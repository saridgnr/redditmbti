24	Unofficial (for now) Official ENFP Discord Server	https://discord.gg/HytWPA9\n\n~~I've went ahead and messaged the mods about officially having a server being made for the subreddit but I've also already gone and set up a server that can be used as a general starting point. There's a few basic roles, bots and channels and it's 100% a work in progress and it isn't in any way official (yet). If the mods want to take over I'll gladly hand over control but for now this is the server we have.~~\n\nIgnore that, we're official!

I don't think anyone has ever rendered me so dumbfounded before. üòÖ Don't know if this is an ENFP thing or just in general but...SWOOOOOOOOOOON. üò≠
7	Two Stories I heard as a child that I think truly encapture the ENFP nature.	Story 1: The Foolish Traveler \n\nonce upon a time, there was a foolish traveler who had gone on a journey. why was he foolish? well, because he was fooled by everyone he met!\n\neverywhere he went, people made up all kinds of sad stories to tell him, and the traveler fell for every one of them.\n\nplease, some money for medicine‚Ä¶?\ni have a sick younger sister‚Ä¶\ni don‚Äôt have money to buy seeds to plant in my fields.\n\npretty soon, his money, his clothes, even his shoes had been cheated away from him.\n\nhowever, the foolish traveler was always glad to help & would tell everyone the same thing, he‚Äôd smile and say, ‚Äúi wish you happiness.‚Äù\n\nbut by this point, the traveler was completely naked, and with nothing left to cover himself, he decided to leave the main road and travel through the dense forest, where no one could see him‚Ä¶\n\nsoon, he was discovered by the goblins that lived in the woods. the goblins wanted to eat the traveler‚Äôs body, so they begged and pleaded, and used kind words to try and trick him‚Ä¶\n\nof course, the traveler was fooled. first, he let the goblins eat one of his legs. then an arm. then more and more‚Ä¶before it was over, all that the traveler had left was his head. he‚Äôd even given his eyes away to the last of the goblins‚Ä¶\n\nand as the last goblin was eating the traveler‚Äôs eyes, he turned and said ‚Äúthank you, traveler. in return, i leave you this present.‚Äù\n\nwhat the goblin left was a slip of paper, with the word ‚Äúfool‚Äù written on it. the traveler couldn‚Äôt see it. he didn‚Äôt know what it was. even so, tears began to flow down his face. ‚Äúthank you,‚Äù he said. ‚Äúthis is the first present anyone ever gave me. i‚Äôm so happy. i‚Äôm so happy. thank you.‚Äù\n\neven without his eyes, he cried and cried great tears of joy. then, the traveler died, with a smile on his face.\n\n\nStory 2: The Brown Pebble\n\nOnce upon a time, there was a family, a couple had been blessed with triplets. In the hospital, as the new parents admired their newborns, the village priest came to visit. \n\nAs the priest met and introduced himself to each of the three children, he gifted each of them a different gift. Each gift he said was a priceless stone. \n\nTo the first baby, the priest gave a beautifully cut and clear diamond. The priest told the family that this child would be gifted with high intelligence, and a perfect memory. \n\nTo the second child, the priest gave a bright dazzling emerald that glistened in the sunlight. The priest informed the parents that this child would not only be beautiful, but also have amazing artistic talent. \n\nTo the last child, the priest bestowed a small brown pebble. The parents noticeably confused asked what gifts their third baby would receive. The priest said that the third baby would be talentless, & unremarkable, however would have the gift to grow, learn, & to nurture. \n\nConfused, the parents kept asking the priest what it is their third baby would be blessed with, what kind of future fate has planned for them, how the third baby would manage to compete with their siblings gifted with intelligence & beauty. The priest said nothing. \n\nAs years went by, the parents invested lots of money in making sure that the first born always had enough academic challenges, and would spend hours of the day working. As the priest predicted, the child most the smartest in his classes and always received top grades. \n\nThe second child spent most of their time singing, dancing, performing in different productions. The parents spent lots of money investing in art supplies, so that the second child could explore different mediums, and as the priest predicted the child was very artistically gifted. \n\nUnsure on how to best support their third child, they tended to spend most of their time & energy on their first two. This was not to say that they did not love their third born, but they never placed expectations on them as they did with the other two, or spent as much time with them. \n\nMany years went by, the triplets eventually all grew up, the first born was a professor with a tenured position, the second became a singer & performer, and the third child made a living by doing odd jobs for neighbours within their community. \n\nAlas, eventually of course, the two parents died. The three siblings were alone and now only had each other. Having been pitted against one another for most of their lives, it was strange for each of them to have to open up and depend on each other. \n\nThe older two would compete with one another, boasting about whom was the most successful recently. However, they quickly realised that without their parents anymore, there was no reason to compete anymore. \n\nIt turned out that the first born hated their job as a professor, & felt trapped with the tenure roll, worried that the only thing valuable about them was their intelligence, they were scared that they would never find companionship and that it was too late to change path now. \n\nThe story was similar for the second born too, scared that they were only loved for being beautiful, the second child became worried that with age everyone who adored them would leave. Fighting to keep up the appearances of beauty and limitless artistic potential, the second born felt trapped in a false facade and character. \n\nHowever, the third child grew up with zero expectations, and despite the loneliness of feeling unremarkable compared to their siblings, was free to cultivate joys and passions of their own. The loneliness growing up had taught the third child how to empathise with others. Never being forced into one area meant that the third child was free to move around and learn as many skills as they pleased. Whilst he was not a master of any, they had the freedom to choose and move around from one to another, learning whatever skills necessary to achieve their desires and goals. \n\nUpon learning of the siblings' unhappiness & melancholy, the third child consoled them, helped them to see that change is necessary, and that it's not too late to chase dreams or to be happy. the third child helped to identify what their real passions were, and helped to create a plan to reach them.  \n\nThe first sibling went on to become a chef, and spent their remaining years owning a restaurant and cooking for the community. The second child went on to become a gardener and florist, making sure that the town was always beautiful. \n\nA couple years later, the triplets sat together reminiscing about the past. On this particular occasion they were looking back at the stones they were given at birth. As they each held forward their stone, the diamond and the emerald glistened and gleamed. The second child looked to the third, to the small, dirty, brown pebble. A eureka moment struck, and the second child took the brown pebble from the third's hand, went and retrieved a flower pot and planted the little stone. Sure enough the stone was a seed, and before long bloomed into a fruit bush. \n
3	Thank you for sharing these two marvelous stories!
10	I enjoy the anticipation more than the actual event. I am in a state of always chasing new excitement.	As I‚Äôve gotten to know myself as I get older, I realize that the adrenaline of anticipation and possibility is far more pleasing to me than what I‚Äôm actually being excited for. This has become a huge problem for me, typically in relationships. I adore the unknown and the possibility of anything happening next, therefore the beginning of a relationship is super exciting to me. However, the things that should excite me (becoming close with another, having someone that has your back all the time, getting to spend time with that person) become mundane to me after the anticipation is over. This has caused me to end perfectly good relationships, quit jobs impulsively, and hurt a lot of people just because my heart isn‚Äôt in it anymore. I know it‚Äôs not right and I want to stop doing it. It happens with other things as well; for example, Im growing flowers. I came home everyday and was so excited to see how much bigger they‚Äôve grown. The second the first flower bloomed, I lost interest. \n\nHave any of you felt the same way before? Like you‚Äôre always chasing a fleeting fantasy? Do you have any advice on how to stop doing this? \n 
5	I'm much the same way. I'm still figuring out how to deal with it as well. I'm an enneagram type 4, and the big thing with that personality type is longing for what's missing and not appreciating what I do have. For me, a big part of learning to deal with that is recognising when this happens, and making a conscious effort to appreciate the things I have, and to not take stuff for granted. I don't think there's like a quickfix for this kind of thing, because it's just a natural tendency for us to think the way we do. I think with every personality type there are things we'll always have to consciously put effort in, and maybe this is ours.
2	I do the same thing. My enneagram is a 7 wing 2 though so I think it‚Äôs just an ENFP thing in general. I wish I was better at enjoying the present and being present in the moment. Like I‚Äôll plan a trip, be super excited about it, then get to the cool destination I planned, and it could be just as amazing as I pictured it in my head, but all I can think of is ‚Äúoh, this is it‚Äù and be a little disappointed that all my anticipation has come to an end bcs the moment is here. Instead of enjoying the amazing scenery or whatever it is, all I can think of is ‚Äúokay but what‚Äôs next.‚Äù I do the same thing with jobs and relationships. It seems so perfect and fun and amazing in my head, and at first it often is, but then the novelty wears off, reality hits, and the problems start coming and suddenly I can‚Äôt stand it anymore and impulsively quit to go find a new job or relationship. 
3	Having an ESTJ Dad is so funny	‚ÄúHow could you have done that to your phone?? It‚Äôs so cracked. You HAVE to get a new phone. And this is my money!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIdk I don‚Äôt really need a new one‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYes you do. You need a new phone and I‚Äôm the one paying for it. The best thing to do is just get an upgraded iPhone for me and just give you mine! Well, I guess I‚Äôm getting a new phone!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThank you! Seriously thanks‚Äù\n\n‚Äú...‚Äù
1	10 life commandments for ENTPs -- also helpful for ENFPs!	
1	I wrote this to replace **8**:\n\nDon't forget to check your Ti blindspot. Try to understand the logic behind your own and other's beliefs, and don't let how you feel about something get in the way of attempting to understand the others' perspective. Also when you think you see patterns in situations, especially in highly emotionally charged ones, check your Ti blindspot to make sure it's not just something you're hoping for or trying to convince yourself of. Then let your values (Fi) take care of your decisions.
1	I don't know what I am anymore...What do you see?	
2	Purely based on these result; ESFJ.\n\nI would recommend a lot in cognitive functions, how they work and how they come out. 
1	Where did you take this test? 
1	The results are high on all but two functions\n\nYou may as well read more about the functions yourself or make a thread on r/mbtitypeme
1	kinda cool that you balance all the functions so effortlessly
1	An ENFPs experience in therapy	Hey peoples! I posted this in r/psychotherapy but thought y‚Äôall might be able to relate to the enfp struggle in this!\n\n\nI am a therapist who has been seeing a therapist for my mental health issues for the past 3-4 months. At first I really liked that this therapist helped me focus on my emotions. So, instead of letting me ramble and intellectualize like I tend to do, she would stop me and say ‚Äúhow are you feeling right now? I noticed you just switched the subject and it seemed to be when you got uncomfortable about xyz. What feeling was that?‚Äù And it has been supremely helpful because I‚Äôm mostly unaware of my feelings to a degree (as ENFPs really can be!) However; I am often frustrated that my therapist self discloses too much. Some weeks are better than others. My therapist is MUCH older than me, and I think she is trying really hard to connect with me. Problem is, I don‚Äôt feel super connected to her despite her attempts. \n\nShe often gets really caught up in my syntax and how I arrange my thoughts, and it feels like she has trouble keeping up with me. I have ADHD (or maybe just becauSe I‚Äôm an ENFP,lol). This is frustrating that she does not focus on the content of what I say. I feel I must constantly explain every little thing. \n\nThen when she isn‚Äôt playing catch up, she is rambling about herself. Yesterday, I wanted to talk about the deep sense of shame I feel when I‚Äôm trying to make friends. I tend to push people I really like away, afraid that they can see the real me and will ultimately reject me. My therapist kept interrupting me to talk about herself and I timed it...her self disclosure went on for a full 20 minutes at one point. None of what she said really related to my situation or taught some principle that I should learn from. I also noticed the urge to start taking care of HER, which I ignored because I don‚Äôt think that is appropriate boundaries. My education has taught me that as therapists when we self disclose, it should be very little AND it should be issues we‚Äôve already worked through so the client does not feel the need to take care of us. The entire focus could easily just shift to her, if I let it. When I focus back on myself it feels abrupt and I almost feel rude for not addressing the self disclosure she is laying out.  \n\nSo my question is, should I give up on this therapist? I‚Äôve put a lot into developing the trust, but while I trust her, I still just don‚Äôt feel that connection. She doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúget‚Äù me and I have to overly explain myself. Secondly, she talks about herself at an inappropriate level and I am unsure how (OR IF) I should address it. Thoughts?\n\nENFPs, can you relate to this type of social interaction? Lol I know sensors really like us to start a story at the beginning and end it at the end, but it‚Äôs really effin hard and NOT why I‚Äôm in therapy. 
1	This ones heavy. I dont like making others feel uncomfortable and my drive to help others would keep me quiet. This person does t sound like a good therapist though. Boundaries have been crossed and too much has been shared. I believe they have been captivated by the charm that embodies us lol. I say get another therapist but what do I know. I played with the idea of going to therapy but, I'm afraid something like this may happen....
2	This ENFP guy I know is a musician but isn't interested in sharing his music, like on YouTube or something. Is it because he's sensitive to criticism?	He shares his music only with people that are very close to him. There's nothing wrong with that, of course. He clearly just enjoys making music and doesn't really need a bunch of random people listening to it. But I was just wondering...maybe the reason he's so against sharing it is because he's afraid of what people might say about his creations? Is this something you guys are sensitive to, as ENFPs?\n\nI'm just asking because I was just thinking, imagine if he shared his music and thousands of people actually really loved it and appreciated it? 
2	We are perfectionists at heart so we are crushed by criticism. There's deeper things going on in our heads as well. Tragic romance things and crap like that... Maybe things he doesn't want to share with the whole stupid world.üòÖüò≠\n
2	ENFPs are known to be, indeed, sensitive to criticism. However, I think it goes deeper than that.\n\nIn my experience, when I create something, there are times when I want to show it, and other times when I want to ‚Äúhide‚Äù it from the mean and cruel world. I once wrote prose that I still believe is my best piece writing, hence I‚Äôve shown it to very few people.\n\nIt is nice to keep things to ourselves. But, of course, perhaps he thinks he is not talented enough?
2	ENFP musician here!\nI can't say this is the case, but I guess that \n\nSensitive to Criticism‚Ñ¢ + I Want My Stuff to Be Perfect‚Ñ¢ + I Want to Explore and Write More Songs‚Ñ¢ (which is more fun than improving the already existing ones so I'll go with that) \n\ncould be a pretty darn difficult combo!
1	I've felt this before. As far as I can tell, it's because having introverted feeling makes me reallyyyy cringe at the thought of sharing my "true self" aka stuff that I've worked really hard on or is really important to me... with nearly anyone but those I'm very close to.
1	My (f19)ENFP mom (f56) has caregiver fatigue. Should I travel alone with her, without my dad?	 Note: Im INFJ, my dad is ISTJ.\n\nMy dad has dysthymia. Since a few months he is taking antidepressants. He was unwilling to take the medication as he thinks that psychology is nonsense and he had weird views on mental ilnesses in general.But he is still definitely not cured. He is an underemployed university lecturer (only a few hours a week).My mom and I try to encourage him to try to switch to a real job, so he does something useful instead of just playing computer chess. But we haven‚Äôt had success on that one yet.\n\nNow my mom suggested that she would like to take a small trip just me and her for a few days, maybe to the mountains or somewhere else. Currently my mom feels very tired and frustrated with his slow healing process. We have done this once before he started taking antidepressants. And we sometimes visit my moms extended family together.\n\nIn any case my dad, my mom and I will have a vacation on Easter. On the one hand my mom and I are both free right now and I would really enjoy to spend a few days away from my life. But on the other hand I am afraid my dad could be upset and/or become a bit more depressed about this. What do you think? \n\n**TL;DR: My mom suggested that I should travel with her without my depressed dad.** 
1	I can't speak for your Father and what is best for your Father.\n\n----\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut your Mom is very much signialing she is empty and has an emotional need that is not being met and she would appreciate some recharging energy.  Note when I say an emotional need I am not talking about MBTI's feeling, this is actually a Si thing for an ENFP.\n\nAn ENFP can supply their own Si from time to time, but there is a limit about how much you can self supply your inferior function.  (So an INFJ can self supply their own Se temporary but over long periods it helps to get Se energy from others, or to take moments to introvert and during this introvert time the INFJ does not think about Se and Ni and they naturally figure out a balance without thinking to recharge the INFJ.)\n\nWell your mom the ENFP needs some Si from others, and a field trip where she is the priority would be good for her.  Do not try to solve her problems during the field trip, just allow her the "freedom" to experience herself with two people and her needs matter and she gets her "special day."\n\nDuring this special day the ENFP mom will be filled with nostalgia and is trying to see the good in life.  At the same time she will complain and your job during this complaining time is just to listen and do not try to solve her problems, instead try to synchronize with her emotions, her feelings, and make sure she understand she is a priority but also her thoughts and feelings she is feeling are valid and you respect those thoughts and feelings and you two will figure it out at a later time.  But emphasize the system is whole, and their is a connection that binds you two, and you can feel confident in each other that you can take on whatever the future throws at you.\n\n----\n\n&nbsp;\n\nUnless your father is suicidal I expect with most ISTJs giving them a few days alone can be a good thing as long as you emphasize that you are there for them as well, but you are taking a small break giving them space, while you focus on another person temporary and you will return to them after the small break.  How you say this matters for it is not like the idea is offensive to an ISTJ (quite the opposite) but how you say it, is what matters.
7	Avoiding silence - Am I the only ENFP ?	Recently, I‚Äôve noticed that I could not stand silence, especially when I‚Äôm alone (and of course wide awake).\n\nI constantly feel the urge to listen to music, or to talk with someone, whether it is by text or from face to face. \n\nWhen I was younger, I used to read a lot, about three or four books per week. Now, I usually watch series on Netflix or movies, etc.\n\nIt almost seems like I‚Äôm no more comfortable by myself, and it crushes me.\n\nWhat are your thoughts, advice?\n\nPS: When I was a teenager, I was a INFP. For the past three years, I am a ENFP.
4	No, you are never the only one. Your type doesn‚Äôt change. We all suffer from one form or another of escapism. It takes real hard work to introspect and truly understand yourself. Meditation, journaling, therapy, sports; all good forms of personal inquiry.
2	Yes exact same thing, it‚Äôs driving me nuts because I can never really relax this way. Life feels so gray now. As a kid I used to see all these colours. I can still feel really excited, but just that and feeling sad/in pain. There are little to no other feelings. The mysticism is gone. \n\nI‚Äôd really like to be able to be on my own again and be content with it.
2	+1 on that meditation thing! It helped me a lot with this "problem" you have. I suggest you download the app "Headspace", you will get 10 free meditation lessons, it changed my perspective. Silence will help you listen to your environment, body and thoughts and you will do it in a safe way (it's ok not to feel comfortable in the first sessions!).\nGive it a try! You won't regret it!
2	yes yes yes, 1000 times yes. I thought I was the only one struggling with this so much. I relate to you so much, with the books thing that turned into TV, and thinking I might have been an INFP when I was younger.\n\nI think it comes from not wanting to just be with yourself. So I've tried actually "taking my emotional temperature" quite often and jut asking myself how I feel in the moment. Meditation helps for this. But also just asking yourself how you feel and what you think about certain things. This is you growing your Fi copilot; apparently growing your copilot is the way to self improvement. You have to be willing to go inside yourself and sit with what scares you and what you're uncomfortable with. It's uncomfortable because our natural favored direction is extroversion, but I guess it's really important for becoming a more balanced person. I've been feeling the benefits.
1	Meanwhile if its not silence for me i'll go savage 
0	Is anyone here a fan Dolan twins? (If you know them?)	
1	God, fuck no. Zack and Cody are the only twins I care about.
1	I don‚Äôt like them as much as I like Emma Chamberlain and Tiny Meat Gang lol
1	What songs do you listen to when you're feeling down?	
3	No Surprises - Radiohead
1	Anything by Mose Allison. 
1	No one's gonna love you more than I do  - Band of Horses
1	When I'm feeling really down and I need to listen to a sad song, I listen to Stuck by Imagine Dragons. It reminds me of my best friend who went away last year\nBut if I want to cheer up, I listen to Mockingbird and Beautiful by Eminem. :)
1	"End of the World" from the Neir Automata game. Inspires me to get my stuff together and do what I need to
1	When I'm down I listen to happy music to pick me up.
1	People Help The People by Birdy
43	Guys, I think I'm in love	I've never felt this this so strong, I've liked people before, many people, but this just feels different, how can I know, I'm confused, I can't stop thinking about her. I don't know maybe I want to tell the story, let me know if you wanna hear it. Aaahh\nHow do you feel when you are in love? 
29	Sanity check that will likely get some downvoting: This sounds like excitement, optimism, connection, hope and the overall liking of another person - but that is often confused with love. Perhaps Ive misunderstood and you‚Äôve known each other really well for years - so forgive my presumption or preachiness. But real love can only really exist after you walk with someone through the hardships of life, see how each of you handle adversity, joy - and even each other. Once the dopamine wears off and you‚Äôve had an opportunity to see the real person triangulated and confirmed over time - real love grows. I only say this to help avoid disappointment and false expectations. Sorry for the preach. 
22	(INFP) For a second I thought this was on r/ENTP and I was like "Wooooooah, super uncharacteristic post".
9	Is this not how an enfp feels if they like a girl. I have felt the same way with every girl I dated. Imagined my whole life with her in the first meet itself lol.\n\n
4	If you're having strong, healthy emotions, FOLLOW THEM.
4	Would love to hear about it. Being in love is fantastic. I have been dating an INTJ for six and half years who I adore and who adores me. I always want to be with her and couldn't imagine my life without her. (Btw- I am also obviously an ENFP if that wasn't obvious).
5	If you feel like you're a better person just by having them in the vicinity, it's love. \n\nIf you feel like your bond will create an incubation chamber where you can both grow, it's love. \n\nIf you feel each thing you say will be instantly and effortlessly understood, it's a deep connection. \n\nThis is extremely gratifying, but it'd say that this isn't love. Love requires work. It's the result of a bond forged with time, with a million acts of giving in both directions. A deep connection sets the ground for love to come easily though, and in the beginning it's what you ought to look for. It's like knowing *for sure* that I could love this person, instead of trying to convince yourself you could and clinging to maybe's. You just need time together and it comes. 
3	Yay I'm happy for you ‚ù§Ô∏è
5	If you "know" you're in love and don't "think" you are. 
3	Congrats!\n\nThis happened to me 6 months ago, and haven't recovered yet. GL
2	What's the story? 
2	I WANNA HEAR THE STORY. Also, I worry i might have fallen in love if my face gets stuck in smile mode. Then my greatest fear as a kid with my face stuck in one expression resurfaces.
2	I'd like to report a witch,\n\nShe is dangerous, or lovely,\n\nI'm not quite sure which. \n\nShe has me spellbound,\n\nShe's controlling my thoughts! \n\nI can only think of her now. \n\nDon't believe me?\n\nAsk her to smile at you. 
1	I do want to know the story
1	Woohoooo I hope it goes well for you (: 
1	If seeing them makes your heart beat a little faster and you aren‚Äôt even sure why 
7	Getting mistaken for being depressed when you‚Äôre lost in thought	Happens all the time and when I try to explain that I‚Äôm just thinking, they seem to always think I‚Äôm hiding something. Like y‚Äôall don‚Äôt take a break to think??
1	There‚Äôs probably more to this story than you think. People don‚Äôt go around suggesting depression, if it‚Äôs in fact as you‚Äôve said. You‚Äôre giving off some other cue if it‚Äôs happening enough for you to make a post about it.
7	2nd date with infj tomorrow afternoon	and she's stopping the night too, to spend time with me cus I have no money atm due to a private situation and I'm trying to think of cheap romantic ways I can entertain her in my home environment aside from us cooking food together cus that's already covered?\n(Keep it classy folks lol)
3	Go to a lake and have a swim. 
4	INFJs tend to love walks from what I've noticed, you could possibly plan a nice romantic route for a walk with her if the weather isn't too disgusting or cold. Somewhere quiet if you can, they're not a big fan of huge crowds sometimes! Otherwise the best advice I would give is to get to know what she likes. It's your second date, don't sweat it, I doubt she's expecting anything super flashy haha. Make her feel comfortable, chat with her and have a good time. Best of luck soldier, you got this!
3	Watch a movie. Play a game (cards or whatever). Try the 32 questions to fall in love. Play hide and go seek. 
2	INFJ here üëãüèº I like cutsie things and I actually prefer free or low cost dates. Maybe bake some brownies or a cake and build a fort and watch Netflix together. On my 3rd date my ENFP boyfriend and I cooked dinner, had ice cream, drank wine, and played Jenga. It was a blast! Hope it goes well.
2	Experience with ISTPs?	Anyone currently dating, married to, or used to date an ISTP? How did you get together? Pros and cons? 
3	I‚Äôve been dating one for a year and a half. He helped me a lot by being patient and understanding through a lot of changes in my life. He is the one thing that has been constant through this period. He is steadfast and is never shocked by any of the things that run through my ENFP head. He never says I‚Äôm being outlandish or that my dreams are too big.  He is the only person in the world that I‚Äôve had the patience and the will to try to understand because we are both older and I think I understand that not everyone talks about things so open like I do. He is never jealous. He never says anything mean. Sometimes when we debate it can get fiery because he is so analytical in his dissection of the topic and I am always thinking of an emotional or what if angle. We have some challenges due to work and familial commitments that have lead to a long distance relationship. The difference with us has been that I have always been intentional with the way I‚Äôve handled the relationship and to him he takes it more as the day comes because that is how the personality type is. I get the sense that when ISTP‚Äôs are committed they are fiercely loyal. It is lovely to be with someone as independent as I am. I hope it works out for you. If it does, you will feel the depths of love like no other love before it and they will SHOW you the depth of their love. I am sending good thoughts your way.
3	Most stressful dating experience I‚Äôve ever had
2	I (ENFP male) think I've dated two, and thought they were INFJ's for a long time.\n\nI actually liked them both a lot.  I mean a lot a lot.  There were things I didn't understand about them and I got into a cycle of over analyzing trying to force communications that didn't work.\n\nI found ISTP's test my listening the most, they can be very practical.  But really I loved them.  I think I will have to be really mature and capable to date an ISTP.  The chance to nurture something really great is here.\n\nNext to INFJ and INFP, I think they are my favorite type.  I think you really have to respect an ISTP's independence though.  You have to trust that things with the ISTP are working out.  Because they may not be rushing to you in a predictable manner like some of the other types.
1	May I ask why are you asking?  I am not an ENFP or an ISTP, I am curious about the context.
1	My first boyfriend was an ISTP. Initially attracted to his laid back nature and dedication to music and art. Probably to some extent liked his individualistic nature. \n\nDid not have many deep things in common. Was both of our first relationship so it went on longer than it should have. He constantly questioned ‚Äúbut how do you KNOW that?‚Äù He invalidated my feelings and generally avoided spending much time with me. Was a bros bro. A match made in hell, TBH. lol. Not a bad person just very different needs and views of life. Didn‚Äôt connect on much. Ended it when I realized I could connect with men who were looking for the same things in relationships as I was. 
18	Imagining actions for other's reactions	So I have this weird thing I do, that I imagine myself doing something, not necessarily bad, but quite often unwanted or even evil and wrong stuff, e.g. suicide (that's the worst). And I play it though my mind many times with desire to see other peoples (relatives and friends) reactions.\n\nIt sounds trivial, but I feel need for seeing other's reactions and thoughts on that particular action. Makes me want to know them on a deeper level, to understand them, to see what am I to them. I pretty much never do it, but I get headaches from over-simulating the events.\n\nAnd by doing that I feel really unstable and anxious. Sometimes even kind of psychotic.\n\nI really don't like it, yet I have urge for it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot sure if this belongs here, but this sub has shown to be really friendly and supportive sub.
10	Sure, 100% me! I feel you man, it could be kinda scary sometimes! But you will notice that your mind does this thing when it's out of quests. Our mind needs to be fed with external puzzles, when it's not it creates them! And most of the time they are not pleasant.
6	Yeah, I do this all the time.
3	I'm the exact same way, I "fantasize"--in the most mercenary sense of the word--about everything. Especially dark stuff that I know will never happen and see everyone's reactions. I don't know why I need it, but I do. There's something cathartic in it. \n\nI also do the same with dangerous situations, or awful stuff happening to loved ones. I go through the emotions and often cry, but its somehow a pleasant release, maybe because it's not real but I can get high off the drama anyway. That last part sounds awful but I don't mean it that way.
2	Yes, there is a thing our minds do sometimes, like if we are by a cliff we might suddenly have a quick thought "I could jump off that." We don't do it but those thoughts can pop in. It has a name I forget what it's called.\n\nBut I also know what you're talking about which is slightly different. Imagining scenarios and what others would do. I've had the suicide one before a bunch of times. But I always know I don't actually want to die at all. More like I just want to see people's reactions. Like even faking my death and hiding out, watching the funeral like Tom Sawyer (though he didn't fake his death on purpose).\n\nBut when I have those weird fantasies, for want of a better word, I feel very bad because it feels sick, gross. Like actually doing that to my family or girlfriends? To see how they would react and if they really care and how much? Ugh. It's fucked.\n\nI think it comes from a deep low self-esteem issue. A need for validation because our own self-worth deep down is so low. I have always had social anxiety and had a need not to be disliked. Cared so much what others thought. I always thought I was ugly,  gross, boring, disgusting, a loser. That no one wanted to talk to me. And these weird fantasies were imaging what would happen if something happened and people felt bad. Would they care I died? Cry? Mourn? Regret? It's so fucked to even imagine putting them through that just for my sick validation.\n\nThankfully I would never do anything like that and I hope you wouldn't. I have been overcoming my self-esteem and insecurity issues in the last year. I'm not worthless. I have worth and value and people like me. I don't need validation from them anyway. I just need to love myself. And I'm really starting to. I hope you can too and maybe these weird thoughts won't bother you or me anymore.
1	Consider you're having these thoughts as a function of vengeance, trying to exact justice through 'payback' in some way.  Punishing them.\n\nIt possibly means there's something not cleaned up in your family history or something you haven't forgiven them for, it could be something simple (parents breaking up when you were young?)  I have this distinct memory of my mother not stopping the car to help injured people in a car crash, I really had to dig deep to get this resolved as silly as it sounds because I developed all kinds of personality traits and habits to deal with this one situation - trying to be a hero - struggling to be heard - thinking nobody cares except me, etc.. etc.\n\nSounds like you're on to step 1 of dealing with this process, which is being open about it!
1	Is that your Fi making you do it ? why care about others reactions ?
266	This is me every time I try to give a lengthy life lesson	
29	Sounds like gold in your mind, but comes out beat to shit lol
6	Why do I relate to this so much? Hahaha
5	One of the most useful things of an enfp. I find it really helpful every time I need to start a conversation with someone, I‚Äôll just wing itüòÇ
2	Literally how I write my papers, and I still ace them XD
1	It feels like magic!
0	A duck with a butt comes to mind
4	Extremes	30 INFPf, dating 30 ENFPm. \n\nI'm an extreme, all-or-nothing person, but it's all in my head. I hardly vocalize my radical thought process and dreams, and have always dated rational SJ or NTJ types who tell me that all of that is just unnecessary. \n\nWell ENFP is so extreme and moving very fast which is soooooooo refreshing and nice and amazing. Hes just vocalizing what my gut is saying.\n\nHowever, I still feel like someone somewhere should be a little voice of reason? Maybe? \n\nI think we're both diving in and ready to dive into this, both starved for the kind of affirmation that comes with finally being understood and accepted.\n\nENFPs, do you need someone to pull you back from the extreme, or gently show you that taking time is wise, or do you really just need that partner to jump with you?\n\nBecause I'm so ready to jump with him, and it scares me not having any rational SJ influence hahaha
5	Nah jump both feet forward.  You're either expanding or contracting life.\n\nEXPAND!!  An ENFP who keeps leaping forward in the face of opposition is a strong, healthy ENFP.
2	Being an ENFPm (26) dating an INFPf (26), I will say jump, 100%.\n\nBeing with someone who shares the same cognitive functions has been super fulfilling for me, I feel I finally have someone on my team, and we can take on anything together.\n\nThat being said, having an SJ in your life is also going to be helpful.\n\nBoth my parents are SJs and I run a lot of my decisions by them, specifically my mother.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBoth of us tend to throw caution to the wind and make impulsive decisions.\n\nWhile our relationship is definitely freeing for both us, having a voice of reason is also really important; or at least it has been for us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso food for thought, the ENFP's extroverted thinking is not our most inferior function, so we do deliberately step back sometimes to make sure what we're doing makes sense. I do find myself being the more rational person in our relationship often.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGo be weird together!
1	I am an ENFP, but only slightly, it's like 52% or something. But I also have Bipolar, and whether I test E or I depends on my mood cycle, but I'm always NFP. I don't know what my boyfriend is, but I know that I need some reason and calm in my life, and he provides that for me. It can be frustrating as all hell at times, but I feel that I am better for it. However, I think that has to do more with the mania of bipolar. Do what feels right for you.
1	Why is 1vs1 so difficult?	HEY ENFPEEPS! It happens to happen more and more frequently:\n\nSocial event, I know 10% of the people here. An old friend comes over and wants to talk about a specific topic.\n\nMe for the first 3 minutes: "A social interaction YAY, I love that"\n\nMe from the 4th minute: "This is taking WAY TOO LONG. I need to talk to other people, my night would be pointless if I talked with only ONE person".\n\nRepeat for multiple guys/girls, old friends or even new people.\nIt's like I become annoyed/bored by the 1vs1 conversation after a while and feel the urgency to socialize MORE and possibly with more than a person at a time (I largely prefer when I can entertain a group of people). I mean, social events have a limited amount of time, right?\n\nDo you feel like this sometimes? Do you think it's ok to be like that?
2	Absolutely. I will usually have talked or developed some kind of inside rapport with EVERYONE at an event. It‚Äôs almost like I have small talk that‚Äôs just one or two levels deeper. Enough to connect deeper but not so much that I‚Äôll be committed to a long drawn out interaction.
2	ENFPs... do you believe in love at first sight?!	I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm just silly or reading into things, but do any of you think love at first sight is a thing? Like maybe you make eye contact and you feel certain that you‚Äôre going to be important in each other‚Äôs lives? Please share any stories you have :) \n\nTo me, it‚Äôs a good vibe/bad vibe kinda thing. Even with strangers or people I don‚Äôt know well. I can always just tell if there could be a connection between us , even if I‚Äôve only seen their mannerisms or how they act with others, but not had a full convo with them myself haha. \n
7	Nope. Love is hard work and has to be built. Thought I had it once with a guy from college. Crushed hard on him for a year only to find out he was an asshole with a micropenis. 
3	Yeah, it's called lust. \n\nHow can you fall in love with someone at first sight anyway? Even if you take "first sight" to mean short period of time, all you really have is an extremely vague and usually biased view of the person. \n\nIt takes time to seriously get to know someone, let alone to develop strong feelings for them.
2	Yeah, I've had quite a lot of them! 
2	Yes ALTHOUGH if you do declare love at first sight - you have to accept everything about that person, flaws and all.\n\nOtherwise it was just your imagination.
2	Y'know, to heck with being logical and all that.\n\nI think what my partner and I went through is the closest thing to "love at first sight" as it gets. A magnetic pull from across the cosmos. Immediate, unearthed. 
1	 [u/CallMeMae](https://www.reddit.com/user/CallMeMae)  you actually meant Attraction at first sight , right ?\n\nLove is something deep , it doesnt happen at first sight
1	Not at first sight, but I‚Äôve had love in the first three times we‚Äôve met once before. The first time I met him, I knew he was special though. 
1	(Sexual) attraction at first sight that may evolve into something more ... sure! \nLOVE at first sight - no way... I believe in chemistry between two people but love is such a strong word. 
1	Yes.
15	ENFP‚Äôs Enchanted by Music ~ Megathread	There are so many songs I‚Äôm enthralled by, which I feel are largely influenced by the fact I‚Äôm ENFP. In particular I love dreamy, beautiful melodies with meaningful words.\n\nThis probably won‚Äôt kick off but let‚Äôs try and make a mega thread of ENFP songs. Share your ultimate favourites!\n\nI‚Äôll start,\nMy Silver Lining - First Aid Kit\nRenegades - X Ambassadors\nYou get what you Give - New Radicals\nBeautiful Ones - Hurts\nStill Young - The Cat Empire
7	Listen to Odesza. Beautiful artists 
5	Porter Robinson and Madeon - Shelter\nOne of the happiest, most friendly songs I have ever heard
5	YES OMG. I love dreamy, echo-y music that takes me to another realm. LYRICS yes they are so important <3
3	Try listening to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRtnS0MHq_A) with good headphones 
3	A bit darker than the usual ENFP\n\nOpeth - Burden\n\nCaligula's horse - Turntail\n\nLes frictions - Your world will fail\n\nPeriphery - All new materials
2	Man on the Moon by Zella Day. Also a sucker for anything X Ambassadors. I love fantasy and Celtic music too - Return of the Hero by Soundmopi is my all time favourite!
2	Tame Impala- Eventually\nMac Demarco- Chamber of Reflection\nTravis Scott- 90210\n\nI‚Äôve never commented anything on this sub but this post really spoke me. I feel like my music taste is directly tied to my being an ENFP. I like to be completely consumed by whatever i‚Äôm listening to as if I‚Äôm being taken on a journey by the artist. These are my three favorite songs & artists- I‚Äôm sure other ENFPs would enjoy immensely! I hope this post takes off
2	countless songs by Florence and the machine. they all have such a different energy and tone to them. 
1	I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:\n\n- [/r/biggestof] [ENFP: ENFP‚Äôs Enchanted by Music \~ Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/biggestOf/comments/aynqjy/enfp_enfps_enchanted_by_music_megathread/)\n\n&nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))*
1	The Reign of Kindo.  I‚Äôve been toting this band as my favorite for a few months now, and I haven‚Äôt heard any music quite like theirs.   It‚Äôs really musically complex and fun!
1	Stickerbush Symphony from Donkey Kong Country 2 <3
9	ENFPS who get obsessive/clingy with their SO, how do you manage it?	I'm currently in a serious relationship and am emotionally attached to my SO. I want their happiness to be mine and vice versa and I want to do everything and live every adventure with them. He gets tired out and obviously wants to enjoy time out with his friends and such. So how do you guys balance that want to be with them all the time and share everything with them versus their need for their independent life? 
5	This is super hard to answer. Life experience/mistakes help little by little lol but I know that‚Äôs not the answer you‚Äôre really looking for.\n\nI dunno where I came across it or whether it‚Äôs a legitimate saying or quote but the idea of ‚Äútreat yourself the way you would your best friend‚Äù helps. I‚Äôve learned a lot just by stopping to think ‚Äúwhat advice would you give your best friend if she/he were in this scenario?‚Äù \n\nAnother thing I‚Äôve learned is it‚Äôs never the best to react to things impulsively, especially when it comes to your emotions. It‚Äôs for sure difficult sometimes but if you can keep yourself in check, it‚Äôs basically always worth it. \n\nTry to let yourself focus a little more on what *you* like, what makes *you* happy because the product of some of those things is what attracted him to you in the first place.
3	I think it helps to find close friends of my own who I enjoy connecting with, as they help keep me company when a partner (if I'm in a relationship at the time) is busy. It's also nice to have some variety and talk about different topics with a wide range of people, as hanging out with the same person all the time can get a little repetitive sometimes.
1	You gotta find something just for you.  The meetup app is great for meeting new friends if you need that, I‚Äôm using it rn to some success \n\n\nFind a sports team, a hobby, hell a pet that gives you things of your very own 
1	Famous Changes	Do you ever wonder what a publicity person who want you to change (physically or not) if you were to become famous??\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'd probably be made to lose some weight, possibly hair dyed / extensions, I would have to clean up my mouth(I cuss a lot).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat do you think your publicist would change if you became famous??\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: What is something you would refuse to change if you became famous??
2	With in reason,  but nothing major.
2	Hmm!! I think I‚Äôd refuse plastic/cosmetic surgery! \n\nAlso goals and friends/family are things I wouldn‚Äôt give up.  (Essentially what you said)
2	I curse way tooo much! My teeth would need to be whitened and I'd have to quit smoking. 
2	I would probably have my nose done. I have a bump in my nose that I‚Äôve always kinda disliked. Straight on it looks fine but I don‚Äôt take good side angle pictures because of it. My publicist would ask for it to be done and I‚Äôd say ‚Äúwell now that I have an excuse, here we go!‚Äù \nI‚Äôd get a boob job, but nothing crazy. I‚Äôm barely a D cup, but I‚Äôm wide set, so I‚Äôd just want to add higher profile so my boobs stick out forward more. I have to squeeze my arms together to get cleavage and would at least like to have some if I bent over. Other than those two things, I like myself physically. I don‚Äôt even hate those things about myself but if we‚Äôre talking about improvements then why the hell not?! \nPersonality wise I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd change a thing! I like who I am on most days. Yes I have insecurities, but those are usually related to whether or not I accidentally hurt or offend people. 
4	Michael Scott from the office is an ESFJ and not an ENFP imo	I can definitely see why he would be typed as an ENFP, he is extremely people oriented and has lots of wacky ideas which is basically the nutshell for ENFPs‚Ñ¢. However, something just never sat right with me for Michael being an ENFP, so I tried to re-type him. \n\nFirstly I wanted to try and identify what his inferior function was. I like to connect the functions to the psychological needs although I know many don't like this method. The first thing that I really noticed is that he has balanced observations, however his judgements are quite unbalanced, ESFJs have inferior Ti and ENFPs ignore Ti all together, this means that both types have trouble deciding what is best for themselves . However the balanced judgement and dichotomy of self and tribe in the ENFP usually is because ENFPs find it hard to stay in one place, and need to be able to navigate people in order to move from place to place. And this is the thing with Michael Scott, for over 15 years he worked at dunder mifflin, ENFPs are starter types, will often burn what is current to the ground just for the taste of a possible better future. It seems strange that the typical ENFP wunderlust that comes with Dom Ne was never really present with Michael. \n\nWhen I think of what Michael struggles with most, it is definitely managing the tribe and his sense of self. He has a huge trouble sculpting his own sense of identity, whether this is the search of Ti truth or of Fi ethics, he isn't overly concerned with being consistent in his sense of who he is. Much like the ENFP who often do become a chameleon based on who they're around, ESFJs will mould themselves to the values of those around them. For me this is one of the biggest difference, the way the two types blend differently. ENFPs are much more controversial in the sense that if they have a strongly held value they will be unmoving, however ENFPs are very quirky outwardly, understand ostricisation and have much more of a live and let live attitude so long as these deeply held values aren't encroached upon. Dominant Ne is aware that it needs to be grounded and so does this through Fi. Whereas the ESFJ grounds themselves with Si, Michael can be detail oriented, and often uses his own experience as a reference point for conversation, an ENFP on the other hand tend to be pretty oblivious to their own experience, and find it much easier to relate to others through imagining what it's like to be in their position, as opposed to empathising through similar  experiences. \n\nI was pretty sure that Michael Scott had Ne-Si as his middle axis, and that he was an ESXJ. And ESFJ imo fits him best, as opposed to an ESTJ like Dwight. This for me is being whilst Te is informative, and often rigidly structured, Michaels biggest weakness is tribe validation, his constant go to is Fe, making sure that his tribe, the office, like him, appreciates him, thinks he's the best, most chill, funny boss ever. Then he goes home, to his Ti demon, this is why he has no real close friendships, and only really socialises through work or through his improv group. This is all because of his inferior Ti. If we look at another alpha quadrant type like the ENTP, we see that their balanced judgement axis allows them to have a balance between truth & necessity of Ti but the Harmony of Fe also, this allows ENTPs to not get to emotionally invested in the validation of others as their Ti identity is well built up. \n\nNe romanticism for sure, Michael falls in love with practically every woman, on the series, a very ENFP thing too, but I believe that's Ne possibilities running through the works each time. \n\nWhen we look at the subconscious of Michael we are not seeing the ISTJ, but instead I believe the INTP. His subconscious is not always constantly trying to retain more data but instead trying to make that data useful for himself. \n\nWhen we look at Michael's shadow we do not see the INFJ but instead the ISFP. this in my theory is why Pam another ISFP can't help but feel sorry Michael because she ultimately relates. ENFPs with inferior Si find it very difficult to use Se, but tend to be very adept in using Ni, whereas the ESFJ tends to rush toward Se activities and sports, which we see Michael do all the time. And whilst I'm not saying that ENFPs aren't active, they are more attracted to individual sports as opposed to team sports. \n\nLastly I want to look at Michael's superego. The best moment when his superego comes to life in the season is when he needs to discipline Stanley. The superego of an ENFP is an ESTP, that very last resort is Se/Ti and for ENFPs this can come across as intense anger and aggression. However Michael's superego is the ENTJ, we see Michael go straight into Te anger and tribe mode, informing Stanley of what Michael will and will not allow with Ni. \n\n
5	No way is he a J. Most disorganised procrastinator ever. I know I‚Äôm simplifying the function but come on. 
3	I love all the thought you've put into this breakdown.  Michael Scott is, to me, the penultimate ENFP; so it's really nice and refreshing to have this idea challenged.  I like how you vacillate on how this is true, but show a framework for skepticism or his diversity of identity.  This is awesome.  
3	I have no opinion for I have not seen The Office (American or Brittish, Ironic for I own the DVD for the first few seasons.)\n\n----\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut just pointing this out for other people.  An ESxJ can very much have a "wacky" side, that looks like Ne dominant to other people if you only got limited information.\n\nThis is because Ne in the 3rd slot, the Tetriary slot, the Mobilizing / Activating slot is very wacky as well (by contrast Ne in the second slot is more cool.)  If a person feels secure in the environment, this wacky side comes out, especially when around ENxPs.  In fact the ESxJs are often a little more absurd, a little less refined, and they often "over-do-it" compared to their ENxP brethen.  This is because the ESxJs appreciate some Ne in their life (as long as they feel secure) but they are less good at using this Ne in a productive way.  ESxJs have a hidden desire "to be perfect" in at least one aspect of their life, but conversely they also have desires to have fun, to explore, and to try new things in other aspects of their life, "but also how do you find the perfect?  Well you have to explore and find it."\n\nThus people like Monica in Friends an ESTJ, or Mr. Peanutbutter in Bojack Horseman an ESFJ can be especially wacky from time to time.  Especially when Monica is around Phoebe (ENFP) and Chandler (ENTP), or Mr. Peanutbutter is around Bojack (ENTP) and Todd (ENFP.)
2	As with almost all fictional characters the problem lies in the fact that he is written for specific actions to further the plot or fit into the story. That's why he is not 100% congruent. 
2	"an ENFP on the other hand tend to be pretty oblivious to their own experience, and find it much easier to relate to others through imagining what it's like to be in their position, as opposed to empathising through similar experiences."\nThis is where you lost me. ENFP's are constantly talking about our own experiences. Whenever someone has a problem our first instinct is to relate it to us and a similar thing we went trough, so they don't feel as alone and that hey we got through it, they can too. I have done this so much I've been chastised for it many times by girlfriends. Always making things about myself.
1	He‚Äôs totally an ESFP. 
63	I'm nice, but if I don't like you, I won't pretend to.	I'll put on the minimum front necessary to keep things respectful and peaceful, but there's a noticeable difference. \n\nIn contrast to my ENTP friend. Who knows what the hell that dude thinks or actually cares about lol. They're far better social chameleons than us, having Fe and all.
24	Yeah I'm not going to start a fight but I'll disengage and go on auto-pilot until you call me an asshole and leave me alone. 
7	I also usually don't bother to argue with people I don't like. I don't care about their opinion, why we time on them.\n\nIf I are with you, it usually means I respect you
4	I had this colleague who I had to orientate, he commented on my pair of pants and said: "What the hell is that kind of pants, man?" I'm all about people wearing whatever the hell you want so it bothered me that he was so closed minded and continued to sigh whenever he saw me, because of the way I was clothed. I guess I dress a little bit alternative and I continued to be polite and one day I was done orientating him, after that he isn't supposed to be asking questions to me. He had a really hard customer so he decided to come to me anyway and I told him to turn around go back to his seat, because he should figure it out by himself now. Never greeted or made eyecontact with him since. It felt good.
3	I think I'm the same. I used to try to be nice to people I didn't like but it felt so fake, and badly faked at that. So I gave up.
2	omg I have no Fe at all.
1	How do you treat your best friend who told you to change your ways?
34	Do you guys feel like you annoy the shit out of everyone?	Because I do üòî
9	It is the nature of the 4 NP types.  You revel in it one moment, but hate it another moment, but each NP finds their own satisfactory contradiction of hating it and loving it.  How much of each you like, and how much you hate.\n\nWhy is this?  For Ne is all about connections, and relationships just like linking words such as linking verbs and linking adjectives connect parts in a sentence, connecting a subject with the predicate.  Connecting one person with another person, or a person with the object.\n\n---\n\n*Hugs the annoying person, sitting there in silence, yet there is connection...*\n\n
7	Yes, but then again I also find most other people annoying. I think people just have personal preferences of what's fun and what's annoying. One trait that someone perceives as fun can be annoying to someone else. So in the end, you shouldn't worry about it! All of my loved ones, even those closest to me, all have annoying traits too. It's universal, haha.
6	I've over-corrected that behavior and cultivated a lot of restraint. Now I can be aloof and withdrawn when the situation demands it. \n\n(Tbh, it probably keeps my friend count to a manageable level.)
5	I used to, but I got pretty good at catching myself before I get there.
5	we do. but we also have the strong N to know when we need to adjust and chill. and interestingly, the people I annoy the most also love me the most for all the most authentic things about  me. \nand i can usually tell they actually feel bad for being annoyed and then i feel bad they feel bad and it‚Äôs just cute. i love my people. 
4	I do sometimes 
5	I've started to notice the more I talk the more people seem to be 'seeking' me, grokking what I'm saying.\n\nI kind of like it.\n\nI think a real difference is going to be made when I'm clear and concise.
2	Yup.
2	Sometimes but then I realize other people really like my schtick for some reason.
2	Yup, especially when I was younger and in school, the slightly more practical and sensible side of me hadn‚Äôt matured and I just didn‚Äôt know when to stop being ‚Äúsilly‚Äù and ‚Äúenthusiastic‚Äù... didn‚Äôt help that my main friends were ISTJs... üòÇ
2	I used to. As you get more confident in yourself you‚Äôll find some people appreciate what other people percieve as annoying.\n\nWhen i was younger i felt like everyone disliked me and now i feel like i can be friend with anyone i meet.
1	Yes, depending on who it is I'm conversing with.
1	Sometimes I feel it's happening and I dont mean too. Usually when I'm going on about something I'm passionate about which isnt a lot.
1	Oh gosh yes. Absolutely yes!! 
89	Do other ENFPs see patterns in dates/phone numbers/pins to help you remember them?	I'm trying to work out if this relates to any of my personality traits or not by seeing if any other ENFPs share this quirk.  \nSo here is an example or two:  \n\n\n**Birthdays**  \nI remember my Niece's it because it makes the pattern 2011 2012 in UK date format (20th Nov 2012, 20/11/2012)  \nI remember both my brothers because one was born **12**th August then the other was **24**th Sep. I remember double the number in the next month  \n\n\n**My Bank Pins**  \nI remember each of them by the shape the digits make on the keypad when I type them, not the numbers. This also applies to the CV2 (3 digit) code on the back. When I speak that aloud for a telephone payment, I actually SEE the pattern on a keypad in my mind's eye.  \n\n\n**My Phone Number**  \nWithout just blatantly posting it here there is basically a pattern xxx19 x38 x37  \nI literally remember it is 19x2 = 38 - 1 = 37  \n\n\nThere are countless other examples of these types of things in my day to day life and I just want to try and understand why I do it. Do others do similar things?  \n\n\n  \nEdit - So I just saw my newest Nieces date of birth written down for the first time and saw another!\n\n5/3/19 is now 5 + 3 + 1 = 9
20	i took an IQ rest and did relatively well, above average.  However, I scored as exceptional in whatever category was pattern recognition. I see patterns everywhere and have a ridiculous ability to recall something I‚Äôve come across st some point that is seemingly unrelated and connect it to a current focus. In hindsight, I wish I had tried to find a career that relied heavily on that skill   
8	No, but I do have a crazy ability to pick up on foreign language patterns: their grammar, spelling and pronunciation. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the same part of the brain that recognizes number and language patterns, though.
6	It is called Chunking.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_(psychology)\n\nYour working memory, all humans working memory has limits before we start to combine aka chunk the information.  For example if you were to remember sounds and there is only two sounds a high note and a low note in an order you can remember about 9 or 10 sounds.  But the more complex the information the earlier you try to chunk the information.  This is why with phone numbers we try to think of the 7 digit phone number as two separate numbers with a dash connecting them.\n\nSome primates are better than humans at certain working memory tasks.\n\n* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsXP8qeFF6A\n\nBut there is a trade off where those primates may be better at certain working memory tasks but humans are better at chunking visually but also verbally aka language.\n\n----\n\nNote to chunk our brain uses the ^1 outer lobes such as the frontal lobe, ^2 the cerebellum, and ^3 the basal ganglia as two different loop systems working together to form a triangle.  The "tighter" you can make these loops the better you are at remembering the thing.\n\n* https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41583-018-0002-7/MediaObjects/41583_2018_2_Fig6_HTML.jpg\n\nOne way to make this learning work better is to give an external reward for positive trials and increase the "saliency" of victory.  Another way is to add supervised learning components like another person assisting you, but also sound effects and visual cues can help the supervised learning component.  This is why things like the price is right sound effects in games can make them more enjoyable for if you can shorten the learning period from seconds before you see if the trial was successful to fractions of a second it helps with learning and it also enhances the intrinsic reward but also external reward and it makes it feel so much better ü§ó\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nRemember I said it is the ^1 outer lobes such as the frontal lobe that tries to figure out a pattern to chunk the information.  Well how best to create the pattern is different for each humans and some do things visually, some do things with mnemonics, some people actually "hear" colors^(see link below), and so on.  This step actually has the greatest human variety of the 3 steps in the triangle.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synesthesia\n\n>There are countless other examples of these types of things in my day to day life and I just want to try and understand why I do it. Do others do similar things?\n\nWhat I am saying here in my long post is all humans do this, but what "reaches" we use to organize these things can be very different.  I **personally** think high Ne users are good at finding weird patterns to remember things that other types would see as weird / uncommon.
3	Can‚Äôt think of any examples but I do this! 
3	Absolutely. I can‚Äôt remember what age I am without using the pattern I have to count it!
2	I do this for sure. Also I can remember prices of things. For example, if something doesn‚Äôt scan and they have to enter it manually I can name the price, even in a basket full of groceries.  I‚Äôve always been able to remember phone numbers relatively easily. 
2	Yes! When I was first learning my home phone number when I was little... my Dad broke it down into a pattern. I use patterns to help me remember things often. 
2	Yes, yes, and yes.\n\nThe major one for me is the shapes. I can't keep 10 numbers in my head but I can usually keep 3 or 4 shapes in my head, so when someone tells me a phone number, I break it into triangles/squiggles.
2	I'm real good at finding patterns but I honestly never use them to my advantage. I just remember numbers, dates, and pins the old fashioned way lmfao.
2	Yup! Love puzzles and seeing patterns and trends. A burden of being observant 
2	I do this with stupid stuff I don't even need to remember. Like, I'll remember dates on cereal boxes with this, or the time on the clock or a serial number. It's like part of my mind just enjoys identifying a pattern and SCREAMING it at the rest of my mind. That part of my mind is generally greeted with a harsh "NO ONE CARES" from the rest of my consciousness... But then I don't stop doing it. I used to memorize the backs of shampoo bottles in the store, too. I think ENFPs might just have weird memories in general (that or I'm just not normal in any regard lol)
1	Dates: "fucking assignment was due yesterday, not today...."\n\nPhone numbers: "if I can't remember our conversation you're not important enough for my contacts list"\n\nPins: idk I just step on them and I remember where I left them\n
1	no but i have grapheme coloured synesthesia which means the letters in the alphabets and numbers have colours to me in my head so i remember things based on the colour patterns i visualise in my head
1	My friends say I‚Äôm annoyingly good with dates. I can just easily remember the dates of various important occasions, even from many years ago. 
1	Yes definitely! 
1	I have aphantasia, so I can't even visually picture patterns, but I still work this way. I literally only remember my bank account number And telephone numbers by feel/muscle memory. Like a dance move. 
1	Yup
1	The pin thing, totally. And I actually managed to get my card blocked in China because the keypad at atms was upside down üòÅ\n\nOthers not so sure. But I am quite visual. I kinda remember where in the page I read a piece of info but perhaps not remember the full info on it. So not sure if it‚Äôs ENFP stuff or just a predisposition to visual memorization, in my case.
1	INFP - I do. I especially look for numbers that are similar or are multiples of each other, things like that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: For example, my code to open/close the library is 17-24-30. I remember this because 24 is in the middle and is 7 greater than 17 and 6 fewer than 30, so that's how I remember it in my head.
1	I always look at the numbers on the back of paper money and try see patterns.
5	ENFPs, when you like someone, does the feeling last even when you fall fast for them?	
7	It lasts as long as I am entertained/stimulated by their presence. It can take me three days to get over someone or three years. I tend to fall for people because my brain misses the feeling of being enamored. It misses all the highs and downs...
3	It entirely depends. It seems I fall hard and fast for people I'm attracted to, and then it depends whether it sticks around or not based on how compatible we actually are. One thing I know for certain is if I don't fall hard and fast, then chances are I'm not really attracted to that person, and that attraction isn't the kind of thing I can grow over time. It's either there or it isn't.
4	Oh man. I dated around, not seriously, until I was 21. Went on a date with my current bf, and I immediately just knew I would be with him for a long time. It‚Äôs been five years now 
2	I still have crushes on chicks I knew back in high school but they are all married with respectable people
2	If they are stable men, I get over them pretty quickly. Too predictable. \n\n\nIf they generally treat me kinda crappy and I‚Äôm maybe an option to them? Intellectual superiority? Ego complex? Sign me up! \n\n\nHaha in all seriousness though, I‚Äôve learned to fall for more stable men as I‚Äôve gotten older. I‚Äôm happily married and I‚Äôd rather have predictability (with fun times and adventures mixed in...in a healthy way) than that whole ‚Äúdoes he or doesn‚Äôt he‚Äù shit any day. 
9	Lonely single looking for some ENFP fun ;))	Hello kind wonderful people. I‚Äôm an 26 year old INTJ dude. I work way too much and when I am off work I feel like I‚Äôm expending too much energy to go out and find some ENFPs. I have met a few of you and it‚Äôs been wonderful. So I was hoping to see if any of you live near Fayetteville Arkansas, or places I could go to try to meet some of you. Even if you live further away maybe we can be online friends.
9	HEY EVERYONE I TOLD HIM TO PUT THAT TITLE AS A JOKE. HES A COOL BRO I SWEAR
2	Il be your friend!! Im like half entp/enfp but yEE DOG!! I live far, but im down to be online friends omg\n\n&#x200B;
1	I have a lovely INFJ(?) boyfriend, but I wish you luck in your endeavors! Congrats on taking a chance and having a friend back you up-- both good things.
2	I thought you all may enjoy this sub and even this post! ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ú®	
0	Is showing up too early for stuff an enfp thing or am I just a weirdo?	I had a meeting with someone today and I showed up a whole hour earlier. Maybe I'm imagining a scenario where I get delayed by a whole hour when I leave?\n\nI have no clue but I'm always either too early or late. Never on time. Sometimes I show up too early, then 5 minutes before the meeting I leave and then come back so that it looks like I showed up on time to the other person ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. 
3	I‚Äôm alwayssss late, I think being late is perhaps more an ENFP thing due to the wandering mind aspect of ya not really being driven so much by time.\n\nHOWEVER I would say I try to arrive too early sometimes in order to avoid anxiety... but perhaps that‚Äôs a whole different story! 
3	Definitely always late myself.. At this point, everyone that knows me instinctually adds 15-30 minutes to any ETA I provide.
1	The stereotype of ENFPs is that they are always late, however I make a point to be early. Its been instilled in me both in my family and in extra-curriculars in school that "to be on time is to be late, to be early is to be on time". If a friend is having a party I'm showing up early to help out. If i have a date I'm probably arriving 15 minutes early just because I don't want to be late. \n\nIts really how much do your prioritize being on time. I do think that I'm late often to things that I don't put much effort into. Like "oh I'll be free to play video games at 6pm" turns into "oh its 630 i was distracted eating food and watching youtube". If I'm trying to maintain an appearance though I'm going to be there by the time i said i would. 
1	If you think showing up too early for stuff makes you a weirdo, you're definitely a normie. 
1	I don't show up too early, but I'm definitely early. I don't wanna miss out on anything.
1	Always late. 
1	I‚Äôm usually late to things I don‚Äôt really wanna be at. If it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm super invested in, like my yoga class, I‚Äôm always 5-10 early. I would say, 90% of the time if I‚Äôm late, it‚Äôs because I had a hard time ending doing the thing I would‚Äôve rather been doing. \n\n\nExamples:\n\nSleeping in before work. \n\nGetting coffee. It‚Äôs. A. Must. I don‚Äôt care how late it makes me.\n\nTalking with fun/interesting people.\n\nFinishing up a (home) project. \n\nEating.
2	Does anyone else have problems with driving?	I'm an ENFP with a driving phobia. I didn't start learning until I was almost 20, got my license and drove very little until I stopped driving at all in my mid 20s. Now, thanks to Lyft and Uber I'm probably never going to get behind the wheel again, even though I live in Los Angeles. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt strikes me that driving is a very Se thing to do. I probably could have done it if I started at an earlier age or if I really had to. But it feels dangerous and unnecessary for me to start now. Have other ENFPs found the same problem, overcame it or it's just not that much of an issue?
6	This is 1000% not a personality thing.
2	Are any ENFPs on here on the autism spectrum?	Pretty self-explanatory question, I think.  I‚Äôve been recently (over the past several months) having suspicions that I might be ‚Äúon the spectrum‚Äù as they say, but I test as an extravert on MB.  Wondering if these two things are mutually exclusive, or if that‚Äôs just a stereotype.  Thanks guys!
3	What are some basics to type someone yourself?	I'd like to practice to type people without forcing them to take the test *haha*. So just wondering about some basics, like what are some easy signs to tell someone belongs to a certain category at least (e.g. feelers vs thinkers). I'd like to start with this while delving more into the functions, it's still a bit technical for me to read through that and really understand it. So could someone explain it in "simpler" terms? Much appreciated!
2	Try using this chart. Definitely consider the person's relationship to you and how they may be adapting to their environment. For example, if they're a co-worker, they may suppress a function in the workplace or behave in a way that earns a promotion. Or, if they're attracted to you romantically, they may be bending their strong preferences towards more neutral ground.  \n\n [http://www.sharesunday.com/item/11861/me-estp-my-family-leo-hubby-istj-and-it-was-strong-for-all-traits-pieces-son-infj-they](http://www.sharesunday.com/item/11861/me-estp-my-family-leo-hubby-istj-and-it-was-strong-for-all-traits-pieces-son-infj-they)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
1	Nm I wrote a response to ENTP ... misread the sub name.
1	You can start poking around this site:\n\nhttps://www.typeinmind.com/type-theory\n\nand checking out this channel:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/DaveSuperPowers\n\nThere's a lot of stuff out there about MBTI so one thing will lead you to another and you'll start getting it. \n\nSee how folks consistently express themselves over time to get a pretty solid idea of their type. 
0	ENFP Interviewing ENTJ Alan M. Te-Se PC/S(B) MM	
23	ENFP girls,how do you express that you like someone?	
63	Probably by overwhelming them with attention in the form of multi-paragraph text monologues until they become so terrified they freak out and cut things off.
32	I tell them. I can‚Äôt really hold back when it comes to emotions like that. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
37	By non stop texting and trying to be in there space and finding reasons to bump into them and dressing up when I know I‚Äôm going to see them and doing my hair nicely too. 
28	Be subtle enough that it's an obvious amount of subtlety ...so pretty much saying how I feel without directly saying it. Also, I always keep the conversation going. No matter what.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSometimes I even double text.......
16	You will most definitely know. We aren't exactly subtle. 
13	i accidentally put this on my main account which the guy i like knows about so i deleted my comment REAL QUICK but tons of baking, handwritten letters, sharing stupid facts about myself (in hopes he‚Äôll share some in return), and showing him things i like (also in hopes of reciprocation) \n\nbasically i make it really obvious
11	I am full on ENFP but  I am also diagnosed with C-PTSD and questionably BPD-II.  Therefore, depending on how much i like you I might  become an awkward, painfully goofy, ball of rumination and worry about how I am coming off until I feel safe enough to trust you with the full force of my personality. I know many people can‚Äôt handle it so I‚Äôve learned to be choosy about who I reveal myself too. But honestly it‚Äôs hard to hide ENFP.  You might have to read/work past what appears defensive or avoidant just long enough for me to warm up.           \n\nI‚Äôm kinda like a bag of popcorn in the microwave... first few minutes you wonder.. did I misread this? Check in.. make sure you‚Äôve given it enough time...\n\nThen as I trust you (will not take long because I love the complexities/ challenges of other people), I will start to ‚Äúpop‚Äù. Slowly at first, here and there. If I‚Äôm picking up on a similar vibe from you, I will explode into the full, delicious version of myself and you will have no doubt how I feel.
8	I text them a lot; i don't make it very very obvious but I don't make it subtle either\n\nAlthough many enfps become quieter (according to the internet) I talk even more when my crush is around me and I look him straight in the eye and continue the conversation although my brain is combusting and my face is prob a million shades redder than usual
7	To all of you ladies saying some variation of "It's really obvious when I like someone," I want to point something out:\n\nNo matter how obvious you think you're being, there is a very good chance that he has no fucking clue. Guys are stupid.\n\nIf you haven't explicitly stated "I like you and am flirting with you," assume he doesn't know.\n\nSigned - A Guy
7	I make an effort to spend alone time with the person. I ask a lot of questions to get to know them. And finally I just tell the person. Usually after I feel I‚Äôve gotten to know them pretty well and have spent a decent amount of one on one time with the person. But\n\nThe biggest indicator of my interest before I flat out tell the person, is wanting to spend one on one time with them. I‚Äôve had a lot of people mistake my friendliness for flirting. It always happens in groups of people because a group of 5-10 people is where I thrive. If someone I haven‚Äôt met before is in the group, I‚Äôll take the time to introduce myself, get to know them a little bit, and then have something to joke with them about before the night is over. \n\n(I threw the BUT in there as a disclaimer because I know like 99.99% of enfp‚Äôs deal with my described situation. Also the one on one time has to be a separate, isolated, event. Hanging out together with the friend group around doesn‚Äôt count for me.)
7	"I like you. We should be friends."\n\n\n\nLiterally. If I'm having a conversation with a stranger and I like them I'll give them my full name and tell them to find me on Facebook. I'm happily married, so I don't look for dates anymore but it'd probably be about the same. 
3	I‚Äôm usually really shy at first.. even if I know him a bit better I seem reserved in the beginning of each meeting because I don‚Äôt wanna come on too strong. But how you will know if I like you is when my focus is on you. Somehow we will end up conversing and I will ask you thousands of questions about you and your life, your day, your interests, anything! \nAlso you will know because I will be extra nice to you and laugh at anything you do or say, and will most probably shower you with my random Ne stories and anecdotes. \nIf I really really like you get ready for me giving you compliments for anything you do or have, it may seem manipulative or dishonest but it is truly the opposite - I am just able to see every positive aspect of yours and HAVE to comment it or else I will burst :D (trying to get rid of that last one though since there are some people that may feel creeped out by this sort of behavior :D)
3	Eventually, I will probably end up saying something to them because I‚Äôm not very good at hiding things like that. But usually it‚Äôs pretty obvious. 
3	Talk to them a lot, smiling, trying to cross paths with them a lot, enthusiasm 
3	I‚Äôm just massively awkward and completely weird because I don‚Äôt know how to act but I also want to impress them so bad 
3	get to know them, then trying to start written/spoken conversation, if he catches, ok, if not, Im taking it as ok, you dont want to chat with me, so whatever. Being disappointed for a while and then move on. Simple :D
2	I usually tell them I like them if they are available and compatible with me, and I think they might be interested. Some other signs might be that I take initiative to talk often (e.g. wanting to text or talk on the phone every day), I remember small details about you and previous conversations, and give lots of compliments. I might also want to keep talking and not want the conversations or hang outs to end. 
2	I avoid them usually 
2	We want to get to know their life stories so terribly bad the second we can imagine that someone could be THE ONE! Because we want to ensure that they are the person we're hoping they are. We will text as much as we think is possible without being too creepy, and we go back and forth about how we feel about it "hmmm are they going to think I'm a creep?" or "if they like \nme they like me YOLO!" (Ultimately still pushes the send button 10/10)
2	Going full Lara Jean from *To All The Boys I've Loved Before*. 
2	I compliment them or ask them to hang. Like to be straightforward. No time for subtlety. 
1	Depends on how the someone acts towards me. If they seem like they like me too and are pretty direct about it, I'm all in. Smiling, giggling, touching, total flirt.\n\nIf the someone acts awkward, I will probably act really awkward around them too and avoid them. I tend to mirror people a lot.
1	Depends on the level of liking, If I felt in control (of how I feel) I would flirt easily if I wanted to. When I felt too much I didn't know what I was doing. 
3	Does anyone else feel like they become obsessed when someone doesn‚Äôt like them and have to try extra hard to change their mind which ends up annoying them further?	
2	Happened to me once. I kept getting caught of guard by this friend of my sis that i respect a lot and wanted him to like me. Id always seem super dumb to him and id annoy him when i was younger. But i always get caught doing sth weird or i go full awkward\nSo i try more\nAnd im more awkward\n\nBut we good now :) had a direct talk with him
1	Me all the time. If somebody doesn‚Äôt like me I can‚Äôt understand why and want to change their mind. As I get older I try to think... their loss 
1	I made my career into this. Lol.\n\nI work as a therapist to court mandated clients! I love winning them over. \n\nI feel attacked rn. Lol.
1	How can you tell when an ENFP male misses you?	I‚Äôm an INTJ female, and was curious on how an ENFP male may act if they ‚Äúsecretly‚Äù miss you. Not sure if this one misses me or doesn‚Äôt care.
5	ENFP's either show it obviously or "test" it by not showing it at all, or he actually doesn't care. You could try to get a reaction out of him though, say you miss him first. 
1	Has the ENFP already revealed they like you?  Are you friends?  Are you dating?  Need more context about the relationship status for ENFPs act different if their feelings / intentions are known and are already appreciated and validated by the other person.
3	INFJ (M) here: what‚Äôs the best way to tell an ENFP (F) I need space / to be alone ?	Hey lovely ENFPs,\n\nI‚Äôm spending a few days with an ENFP (we are in a casual relationship) and I‚Äôd like to know what the best way is to just ask to be alone for some time. \n\nAs much as I can enjoy her company I also need time to recharge and just be by myself - at the same time I‚Äôm scared of offending her / making her feel like I don‚Äôt want to spend time with her \n\nAll advice welcome ! :) 
5	I would just tell her that you need some alone time or just plan the next hangout time a couple days from now giving yourself a time to chill alone. I know I'm an ENFP but I also feel a big need to recharge after a lot of social interaction and she probably does too sometimes. So I think if you give yourself a little time to be alone she will understand it. Hope this helps.
3	Simply explain yourself, and probably use the MBTI justification (i.e. "I'm an INFJ, so I kinda need recharge time... Bla bla bla. It has nothing to do with you... Bla bla bla."). It will definitely help! 
1	This is not literally the best way to do things, but the best way to do things is the authentic / real answer the ENFP can relate to, and not something that comes from the land of ideals / theory.\n\nTell the ENFP ^1 that you like them, but ^2 you need some space to recharge, and you want some own time to ^3 hear your own thoughts, even though you adore them and ^4 all their surprises.  Now in a single run on sentence that could be two sentences depending on how long you can talk without breathing you communicated the main thought and the ENFP will completely understand this thought and will relate to it in an authentic way.  It is true, and the ENFP will both know and understand.\n\nIf you want to tie the bow onto the "present" that you just gave the ENFP, after finishing the sentence and breathing for a second pivot to ^5 you need multiple type of energies in your life and that one of the energies you need is ^6 tranquility but a the same time while it is important to feel calm, serene, worry-free, restorative, you also need ^7 people, new ideas, surprises, connection and so on.   And it is about finding the balance between the two halves inside yourself.  So you will gladly return for the ENFP person help brings out one of the sides of your self that you **treasure** and adore.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNotice these 250 words can be shortened into 1/5th of what I said.  Find your own voice in saying what I said. üôÇ\n\nAnd I will leave you with this relevant image.\n\nhttp://www.dangerouscute.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/2013-04-25-20130425.jpg
2	Any ENFP dating ENFPs?	Met someone recently, and we‚Äôre both ENFPs (although He‚Äôs definitely more intense than me haha). I thought it would be tiring or clashing to have the same personality type, but actually he inspires and impresses me. He‚Äôs so ambitious, outgoing, and also a sad boy poet inside. Curious if there are any ENFP pairs out here :) 
2	Have an ENFP best friend of the opposite sex. We have a lot of great moments, especially when we first met but lately we've been clashing all the time ever since we got comfortable enough with each other to be more truthful and real, our mutual friends say we both have a too strong personality and that's probably the reason. Both very opiniated, easily offended, emotional,... It's a hot mess right now. Had some female ENFP friends too, I'm straight but with them I also noticed too many disagreements and shit as friends, not friends with them anymore. It could work though. I'm a more mature ENFP and my friend who I'm having trouble with right now, is extremely immature. Can't talk about anything without thinking he is always right, no room for my opinion or feelings. Very selfish while I'm always putting my pride aside to help him and apologise even if he started it. Two mature ENFP's could work though.
1	I'm(ENFP(m)) flirting with an ENFP(f) I met dancing they live far away at the moment, but will be coming back in the summer. We compliment each other and have so much in common, so conversation flows and jokes are everywhere. We have each other grinning like fools and laughing all the time. It might be different when they get back. 
4	ENFP auto-biographies?	I was wondering, do you guys know of any succesfull ENFP‚Äôs who wrote their own biography?\n\nI could really use a succes story of our type at this point haha. Concerning our interesting way of feeling things.\n
1	Mark Twain for sure. He requested a version of it not be published for 100 years after his death. He died in 1910. Coolest ENFP in history.

6	Favorite Quotes	I love quotes. I am just wondering what some of my fellow ENFPs favorite quotes are from authors, movies, books, etc. 
23	‚ÄúI used to think the worst thing in life was to end up alone, it‚Äôs not. The worst thing in life is to end up with people that make you feel alone‚Äù - Robin Williams (Good Will Hunting)
11	We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be.\n\n- Kurt Vonnegut
10	‚ÄúPeople are just as wonderful as sunsets if you let them be. When I look at a sunset, I don't find myself saying, 'Soften the orange a bit on the right hand corner.' I don't try to control a sunset. I watch with awe as it unfolds.‚Äù -Carl Rogers\n\njust makes me happy cry a little internally
9	Of all the words of mice and men, the saddest are: ‚ÄúIt might have been‚Äù.-Kurt Vonnegut
7	Let's not forget it's you and me vs. the problem... not you vs. me.\n\n-Steve Maraboli\n\nI think this is a romantic relationship quote but I really think it can apply to friendships and everyth too\n
5	Be soft. Do not let the world make you hard. Do not let pain make you hate. Do not let the bitterness steal your sweetness. Take pride that even though the rest of the world may disagree, you still believe it to be a beautiful place.\n\n-vonnegut (who seems to be popular in this thread) 
6	 ‚ÄúI have wanted to kill myself a hundred times, but somehow I am still in love with life.‚Äù  \n‚Äî  Voltaire \n\nAND\n\n ‚ÄúNo matter what anybody tells you, words and ideas can change the world.‚Äù  \n‚Äî  *Dead Poet‚Äôs Society* (1989), Dir. Peter Weir 
5	"We have to do it or we're not who we say we are." - THE OA
5	We are what we believe we are - CS Lewis
4	But he, that dares not grasp the thorn, should never crave the rose. ‚Äì Anne Bront√´\n\n&#x200B;
3	Picking a single one is so hard.... Gotta go with the classic Little Prince one though:\n\n"It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye."
2	" as soon as they talk to me about elism, I know that I'm in the presence of a moron "\n\n&#x200B;\n\ndo not know anymore who said this, but he said 
2	There he goes. One of God's own prototypes. Some kind of high powered mutant never even considered for mass production. Too weird to live, and too rare to die.‚Äù\n- Hunter S. Thompson\n\nActually I have a list that I've been filling with quotes since I learned to save a file ...

12	ENTJ husband, would like advice concerning my ENFP wife	Let me first say i am textbook ENTJ, and my wife is textbook ENFP\n\nI believe that my wife is going through a ‚Äúrough patch‚Äù at the moment. \n\nShe‚Äôs seems very overwhelmed, she‚Äôs constantly exhausted, she has very little drive/motivation, and ‚Äúzones out‚Äù very easily.\n\nThere are a few different things going on in her life that I believe are simultaneously creating this ‚Äúperfect storm‚Äù, and causing said rough patch.\n\n1) Her job is very stressful. But every time I bring up finding another job (or just quitting all together),  she says things like ‚Äúthat place depends on me, I feel like I‚Äôm the glue holding to together‚Äù and ‚ÄúNo one else cares but me.‚Äù \n\n2) she started back to work because our daughter is now in school. After staying home with her the first few years of her life, it‚Äôs been an ‚Äúadjustment‚Äù to not be with her as much\n\n3) she‚Äôs turning 30 this year, and it‚Äôs really weighing heavily on her.\n\n4) to be blunt, I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs very happy with her physical appearance at the moment. She hasn‚Äôt came out and said it, but she makes snide remarks about it from time to time, and I just try to read between the lines.\n\n\n\n**all I want to do is help**. I want to fix this so badly it‚Äôs killing me. I love this woman with every fiber of my being and would do anything for her.\n\nBut as an ENTJ, I believe the best plan of action is just that, a ‚Äúplan of action‚Äù. Let‚Äôs set goals, put together a plan, and work hard to achieve those goals.\n\nBut I know that‚Äôs not what she wants from me. She wants me to be there for her emotionally. To just hold her while she‚Äôs upset, to listen to her rant, etc. And while I am trying my best to do those things for her, deep down it‚Äôs driving me nuts because I think ‚Äúcuddling is nice and all, but it‚Äôs not solving any problems!‚Äù\n\n\nSo I ask you, if you were going through something like this, what would you need from your significant other to get though it?\n\nThank you
14	I find I don't like other people giving me goals unless it's something I'm inspired and passionate about.  Otherwise I can be indignant, righteous and I can feel alone - at least that's how I was when I was unhealthy and feeling unsupported.\n\nI think the greatest gift you can give an ENFP is support - to listen, to get at the heart of what bugs them.  Secretly ENFP's want to be known and supported, when we're giving up on ourselves we just want someone to 'get us'.  The boost we get from that kind of love can carry us to the highest clouds of action.\n\nDon't be afraid to get intimate and deep into the heart of the matter.  That's going to go way farther than pushing us.
8	**The struggle is real**.\n\nBut remember one can not fix an ENFP, they will reach for heaven no matter what.\n\n>Ah, but a man's reach should exceed his grasp, \n\n>*Or what's a heaven for?*\n\n>**All is silver-grey**\n\nThere will always be another challenge, another adventure, life never ends, and thus the animating force inside the ENFP's heart will continue to need fuel, will continue to need challenges and endeavors, and will continue to need inspiration.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nENFPs value Si and they need Si, and they can self-supply it temporarly, but they need Si from the enviroment, from their support system in order to best able to do Ne, Fi, and to a lesser extent Te.\n\nAn ENTJ has Si as their blind spot, their POLR function.  It is both weak and shadow / subdued function and also it is opposite introversion / extroversion alignment as your default.  But Si does have value, and you as an ENTJ will be free when you learn to respect this part of yourself.  You will still be sensitive and vulnerable about it, but you will not be destroyed / leveled / helpless when you learn to respect Si and recongize it has value.  It will remain a subdued function for an ENTJ but you will have so much more agency when you learn to recongize the value of Si.\n\n* And ironically you will be better able to help your partner, to supply it to your partner temporarily.  She will still need other sources of Si in her environment for an ENTJ will never be good at supplying this aspect for an ENFP, but your relationship will be so more generous, close, charitable, and you both will feel understood.\n\nRead this\n\nhttp://www.sociotype.com/socionics/types/LIE-ENTj/\n\nAnd this\n\nhttps://www.sociotype.com/socionics/types/IEE-ENFp/\n\n----\n\nThe problem is unsolvable, the struggle is eternal, what matters is learning to be ***satisfied*** with the struggle, satisfied not as in gratification but instead its old archaic meaning.\n\n>Theologically and historically, the word "satisfaction" does not mean gratification as in common usage, but rather "to make restitution": mending what has been broken, or paying back what was taken.\n\n>* To build for the future, by making the present possible and a return to normalcy that allows future efforts.\n\nSatisfaction is recognizing reality is a sinking sandpit, and realizing that sometimes you need to relax to move around the sinking sandpit, to realize you need to move and do not try to build a tower towards heaven till you are in a place that is comfortable and has a solid foundation.\n\nThere can be joy and delight in the struggle, there can be surprises, and the surprises can free us.  Life can be awesome but that means accepting it is a mixed kind of thing, and not trying to run away from the bad and run towards the good, it means to take life as a mixture, to find your own inner tranquility, and then build once you feel free to build.
7	Te : wants to get things done, very objective, do not interrupt and do not block the objectives.\n\nNe : wants to explore, brainstorm all of the what ifs, do not interrupt the brainstorming, do not block the brainstorming\n\nRemember ENFPs get to Te after going through all our crazy scenarios and intense feelings, and then we start getting our solutions because you listened and all the thoughts are outside of head and then we can piece them together. \n\nSo remember after the listening, comes the Te that will offer the solutions your Te Mastery is begging for. 
5	Her Fi is built up and the only way to help her is to empathize. Listen and imagine what it would be like to be her, and just listen, do not offer any solutions, do not lecture. \n\nI am ENFP and there is so many big picture scenarios with 20 different what ifs per picture that will have intense complicated feelings behind each one and so when you do listen, be prepared for lots and lots of talking. \n\nI hate being interrupted when I am trying to express feelings or talking about all the crazy what ifs that I see, especially being interrupted with solutions and lectures, blah. 
3	I've been feeling like this today, my husband could have written something similar.\n\nSounds like she needs time to do the things she loves. She is giving her time to family, job, household stuff etc but if she's anything like me, she needs to have a creative outlet or exciting project to get her through the mundane times.\n\nENFPs love to spend hours researching and planning exciting new adventures or projects. Maybe a weekend away, a new fitness regime, an art course, a room makeover.... the list is endless. Help her get her inspiration back.\n\nPersonally, I get sad and stressed if I don't get time to myself, if I'm too busy with a boring job and have no time to do fun stuff. \n\n
1	If you want to talk to her about what to do, you need to let her get the emotional stuff out of the way first otherwise she‚Äôll always be distracted because there‚Äôs something more important to her on her mind. I would also suggest that you try to understand the situation by asking her questions before brainstorming things to do. I like it when someone asks me questions because it means they really want to understand. Then be patient and try to think of small baby step things to do rather than big things. And hold her hand the whole way. I made a friend text me all day to force me to do a bunch of admin stuff that I had to do that I had been avoiding for months because I knew that I wouldn‚Äôt do it otherwise. Good luck! 
3	Am I one of you?	Hello guys!\n\nFor a while now I've been tied between typing myself as ENFP and ENTP (wow, how rare and unique!)\n\nI think I seem very ENFP to some people and ENTP to others.\n\nI thought I'd take this question to you guys because I'd like a fresh new input (I don't think an ENFP has ever typed me).\n\nSooo, here's a link https://www.reddit.com/r/MbtiTypeMe/comments/axggmr/obligatory_typeme_post/\n\nI'd love to see your perspectives xx
3	If you identify with a lot of posts here it's a pretty good bet you belong!
3	I sense a lot of restlessness to be ‚Äúsomething‚Äù from your posts. \n\nIt‚Äôs something we all do to a certain extent. Once you know what the types are and what typical traits are, it‚Äôs almost impossible to not describe yourself along a narrative that fits an outcome you‚Äôd like to hear.\n\nHere‚Äôs my advise: don‚Äôt stress it. You‚Äôll figure it out in time. Not through projecting yourself onto as many people as possible on Reddit, but by experiencing yourself at your highest peaks and deepest despair. (And all there is between)\n\nUntil that time it‚Äôs hard to type you accurately, I suppose. If you can manipulate (your words) your shrink into diagnose you with ADHD, I‚Äôm sure you can convince us into typing you as anything you‚Äôd like.
1	ENFP or an ENTP pretending to be\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
1	ENTP'S are more thinkers than feelers. Both can like discussions, arguing etc... But when you discuss something, do you look at it 100% with logic or do you also take your morals and feelings (and that of the other person) into account? Do you care more about winning the argument or making sure everyone's input is considered and how they/you feel about it? 
29	Just showing off‚úå mmm... not really tho, I traced it...but is still looks niceüòÇüíï

7	Something made me cry today and I was hoping we could have an interesting conversation about it. Is it God?	I went to a specialist yesterday who pretty much told me that if I don't remove myself from hard physical labor, I wont have working joints when i'm 50. I went back to work and sliced off the tip of my thumb. It hurts and struck a literal nerve but its alright. I took today off so it could heal. I spent a couple hours looking for my Bandaids and Polysporin (anti-bacterial/healing cream). I  couldn't find them anywhere, I spent 3 hours looking for my loom for my audio interface so I could start recording vocals for my album that i've been putting off for 8 years. I can't find anything, I'm missing things, I'm missing parts of me literally and metaphorically, I   miss my ex. Nothing is going right and I have no faith.\n\nI texted my Mom, because that's what most adult males do right? (sigh). I said 'If God is real he doesn't like me'. She asked why and I explained what happened recently. She says 'Maybe you need to have a heart to heart with him?'.\n\nAnd just like that, I cried. Nothing crazy, but that feeling of ultimate defeat and having no faith in anything, not even yourself, that's some serious emotional pain.\n\nI know we as ENFPs have all this emotion and yadda yadda, but there's something else to us too. There's this child hidden deep inside that needs to be let out to play. There's the bucket of opinions that's spilling over, sometimes we let it spill out loud and sometimes we hush it. If there's one thing I attribute to being an ENFP, it's the lack of honesty I have to myself. Praise me for being honest to others, but god literally forbid I'm honest with myself and with my fears.\n\nI hope you all find what keeps you honest and faithful to yourself and your world. I hope you all find what love means to you and how you can love yourself. I hope the best for you all and I hope we can all find courage and strength when we need it the most. I hope we also know we have the power to change and the power to choose for ourselves, even if it's not the easiest thing you would think of doing. Love you guys.
2	God is in your self love.\nWhen you love and accept yourself, you love God, and he shines in you. 
1	There are some good links at the bottom of the page I'm sharing too. Probably worth it to browse a bit.\n\nhttps://www.mormon.org/site/god/gods-love
1	Assuming there is a God, and assuming that force is all-seeing, there‚Äôs literally nothing about yourself that you could hope to hide from it, so any message you receive from there would be less of a ‚Äúrevelation‚Äù and more of a reminder, or ‚Äúencouragement‚Äù\n\nIn other words, there‚Äôs probably an old wound you‚Äôve been nursing for a while now, so deep that you might even have forgotten it\n\nI think it‚Äôs time to finally air it out. Love, loss, fear, whatever it is: tackle the damn thing head-on and burn it through, because we only get a single shot at this whole life thing, and there‚Äôs never as much time as we think there is
14	The best thing about the INFJ - ENFP platonic/romantic relationship is that noone understands it	I just discovered that the girl I magically became friends with super intensely and fast is an INFJ, and everything makes so much sense now.\n\nShe told me her friends told her that we are so different. That they don‚Äôt understand how a girl like her and a guy like me can be friends. In every way we are different. (As seen by the mirrored cognitive stacks, every extroverted one is her introverted and vice versa) .\n\nYet we have this amazing click and we are this duo that works so amazingly well in a way I have never felt before. \n\nIt just feels so amazing in a haha :pppp way that most people don‚Äôt understand our friendship, but we do extremely well. It is our and our alone thing together. A island of stability amongst perceived chaos. We win.
3	Aww, that's sweet. Definitely a keeper ;)
2	I (M, ENFP) have also recently met an INFJ & we seem to click so well it‚Äôs crazy 
3	ENFP males, what do you guys think about ENTP females?	I am an ENTP female, and despite the stereotypical ‚Äúclash‚Äù between Fi and Ti that ENFPs and ENTPs are supposed to have in relationships, I have consistently found myself attracted to ENFP males more than any other type. \n\nWhat are your experiences with ENTP females? Have you ever dated one? Did it work out? 
6	My longest relationship (8 years) was with an ENTP woman..she was the best friend I've ever had but I dont think we clicked as romantic partners though we were very much in love once. Doesn't mean that's the rule though so dont get discouraged.
2	I've never dated an ENTP woman, although I've hung out with them and felt a natural connection/attraction.\n\nAlthough I've never considered it to mean anything, I've assumed they are that way with everyone because they seem naturally magnetic.  So I assume we don't have anything special or suspicions they wouldn't be loyal.  I've also found them naturally "agreeing" with stuff I didn't want them to agree with, example I'd express bad behavior and they kind of encourage it - so I have to go in and re-interate my intention is to stick to my values.\n\nMaybe that's just my own limiting beliefs in the way?  I guess I haven't found an ENTP romantic interest I really saw a future with.  My question is always:  will this be a healthy nurturing relationship?
1	Annoying af
1	Ive gotta be honest I dislike entps the most
33	when NT's get mad that we're not "logical" enough	
11	HOLY CRAP THAT IS TRIPPY
11	Not to be THAT INTJ, but the picture shows an impossible object. I understand the sentiment behind it, but surely that disagreement means that they should strive to find the truth.
3	At least in my life, it's more the ENFP reliance on other people & what I might call hearsay. It doesn't hit the level of proof I need to use it in my life.\n\nThat being said, I get all my info from sitting in the basement on my computer. I'm sort of jealous of you extroverts NF's out having fun with people. 
3	By the looks of this thread. INTJs really love ENFPs. 
1	ENTP philosopher  David Hume agrees with you even though he is an NT üòã
1	Its a good quote and all, but its not by Marcus Aurelius, after a quick google:\n\nhttp://ianchadwick.com/blog/nope-thats-not-by-marcus-aurelius/
1	Thought I might be ENTP instead of ENFP after seeing some ENTP-related posts here... But after checking their sub, hell no. Too much of a feeler for that stuff, haha. I asked if I could have ENTP traits based one some characteristics, got asked "if a rodent keeps coming back and ruins your life and you had to bash in its skull with a rock to get rid of it and have pleasure doing so, would you do it?". I said I have better options than killing it since it's a small rodent and I'm a big human and I'm not psycho enough to bash in the head of an innocent small animal and enjoy it. "You feel too much, you can't be ENTP." and kept referring to me as a guinea pig to other ENTP's who commented. Jesus. For a logical thinker that question didn't seem logical and it was enough to determine exactly what I am. So much deep questioning and thinking, hahahaha.
1	That seems like a polite way to start keeping your mind open!\n
1	This is something that i tell my enfp friend everyday
385	For the more introverted ENFP's	
44	I feel like having a small circle of friends isnt a characteristic of enfp. having a small circle of very close friends is 
67	Easy to approach, hard to open up
19	Yup, sounds so much like me. I easily float in and out of groups, but I often have a very small circle of close friends.
19	So many friends but none at all.. Sigh
11	i have a feeling that all, if not most, enfp‚Äôs are like that. correct me if i‚Äôm wrong by commenting? just curious since enfp‚Äôs are known to be the most introverted extroverts so it‚Äôs no surprise that the text post holds true for us?
7	To me this describes depressed me very well. Usually alone, only a few friends, but I still kept in touch with the wide array of friends I've picked up in my life just wasn't seeing them often if at all. 
3	Me
3	this is me. and i feel lonley....
2	I feel attacked
4	Not trying to be negative but this seems a little tootie own horny\n\nThat came out weird haha
1	Ohh shit it me
1	It's Smeeeee!! üòÇ 
1	I don't know if I simply need more social interaction than others so I feel by myself all the time, or if I really am usually by myself.
1	OP, how did you get inside my head??
1	For me this is spot on. In my twenties I travelled a lot and lived in different countries and made friends everywhere I went. Now I finally settled in a new city and just enjoy living in a little introvert bubble with my boyfriend. \n\nIdeally I want to keep all my international acquaintances/friends but have a small reliable circle of friends where I'm currently settling.
1	Bruh, why you gotta call me out like this. Rofl.
1	welcome to the club.\n\nintp here
2	Why do different mbti types feel the need to complain about each other?	Maybe it's my ENFP side acting up, but after seeing some ENTP related posts here, I thought maybe a part of me could be more ENTP because I can be a very logical thinker and I love debating. So I checked out their sub and literally saw a post called "Problems with ENFP?". It was flattering in a way since OP was asking that he never sees many comments or posts related to ENFP's bad traits. But then I read the comment section, and oh boy, a lot of them really don't like us. But then I also realised I've seen posts like that here too in the past (forgot what type was being ranted about), seen the same thing in the INFJ sub, etc...\n\nI'd understand if you'd ask for such advice when it comes to dating/being friends or related to a certain type and you don't know how to deal with some of the more difficult traits. But what's the point in creating a post with the sole purpose to talk shit about a certain type? I mean every single one of the 16 types has both great and shitty qualities, good and bad stuff that can evolve through maturity. Some people stay stuck with some bad traits, and some don't. Are these posts created by OP's who had a bad experience with a certain type and want to vent? Or is there actually a purpose behind it? Because it seems like such a waste of time and it's so hostile and negative. Why can't we all just mind our own business and live in peace?
3	This is something which greatly bothers me as well. I think it's just in human nature overall to have an "us and them" mentality, and when people  get grouped together and labeled into certain boxes it's easy to generalize and stereotype certain behaviours, negative or positive. (I've even done it myself in the past.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've found it's quite common for people to associate certain bad qualities with a MBTI type, based solely on their past experience with just one person of said type. In these cases I see it as a way for them to vent, especially if they've been hurt by that person. Taking an ENTP as example, perhaps saying "I dated this ENFP once who cheated on me. Therefore, all ENFPs cheat." It's very immature and illogical, and I'm sure ALL types do this to some extent. INFPs and ISFPs often get the boot for being "too emotional", ENFPs "flakey", INFJs "special snowflakes" etc.,. It irritates me to the point that I don't even bother reading most MBTI related subs anymore because of the toxicity, r/ENFP is where I mostly hang nowadays. (You guys are really chill and wonderful<3) Just because you're a "T" type doesn't mean you're automatically correct all the time, logical or factual, just like being an "F" type doesn't mean you base all your decisions on feeling. I've found many ENFPs who are even more logical and intelligent, in a certain way, than some "logical" types I've known.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhenever I encounter negativity like this, though I try to avoid it and often get irritated, I try to just forget about it and think about how it's the person spewing this nonsense who ultimately gets the larger negative impact. Going around stereotyping people like this and having that kind of a mindset must provide some pretty terrible effects to an otherwise harmonized brain, not to mention the missed opportunities to make acquaintances with some great people because they've already made their mind up that they're "bad" based on their type and not their personal qualities.
2	Let the ENTPs play with their POLR Fi in private.  They need to feel this side of their subjective nature for they are not good at it, and only by practice does it get better, and remember this was a self selected place where there are no negative consequences to people they see in this "private place."\n\nSure there are better ways to engage Fi, but the ENTPs are so out of practice expect ideal theory is not practical.
1	I'm not complaining.  Who's complaining?
1	I think that you're overthinking ; there's rarely anyone who is hostile on purpose when creating those topics.\n\nMost people who post about others are either :\n* Venting ; classic one : someone still loves someone of type X, and love tends to involve strong emotions. So it looks aggressive. But they still see what they love in one or another person of type X.\n* Desperate attempts to get explanations on some things ; criticism is an important part for setting the problem and getting the right questions answered. And criticism, well, can sound harsh.\n\nIt doesn't mean that any of this is done in a clever and optimal way. Nor even consciously. But the intentions are rarely hostile :)
38	Dating you	F,30 infp, dating m, 30, enfp. Holy moly you guys are so incredible. \n\nLike....a giant heart that's so complex and full of both the heavy things of the world and all the rosy loveliness and humor.\n\nComplex, sweet, broody, vivacious, sexy, and charming. Gah. Cannot believe I'm so lucky to finally find a one that speaks my language. 
9	I envy that he found himself a INxx. Good luck to you both.
4	I can‚Äôt relate- I‚Äôm texting the guy I‚Äôm dating about this furry show called ‚ÄúBark! The Musical‚Äù
4	I'm a 31F ENFP and my partner is 30M INFP, and I am quite convinced that God and the Universe meant for us to be together.\n\nIt's everything I wouldn't even allow myself to dream of. \nHe is the most good person in this world. 
2	In what sense that ENFPs love the distance between their loved ones?(long distance relationship)	The title says it all. I was just wondering as my enfp crush says that she loves the distance between us and I read that it is common for enfp to have a long distance distance relationship. In what sense do enfps love the distance? I am an infp and we are well known to be loyal and faithful, is it the same for enfp as I've read multiple times that enfp falls for stranger easily. She was also previously attached to someone she barely knew and that made me insecure of myself(at this stage I thought she was all into me lol but apparently she has still not decided whom to put her full heart to) and I know getting attached to someone you barely know is a common trait among enfp(please tell me that I'm wrong). 
3	Uh, don't think anyone would actually like long distance. Especially ENFP's tend to be very physical with people they like. But I think if we genuinely have feelings for someone, we could easily do long distance. But the way you describe her, how she isn't sure yet who to give her heart to, sounds sketchy as hell. Maybe she hasn't matured yet. I think older ENFP's are more keen on what they're looking for and who they want so if there even would be a choice, it would easily be made. And thread carefully if it's an ENFP who easily gets attached to strangers, that's another sign of immaturity. That thickle behavior could leave you very hurt. Make sure she's only committed to you before you become serious. Once an ENFP is serious with you, they are loyal and loving. A lot depends on the fact of she's still immature or evolved to being more mature. 
2	I was in an LDR forever as an ENFP and I will say I liked that I was able to run around and live my own life on my time and then dedicate the time I was with him just to focus on him. It‚Äôs not necessarily a bad thing‚Äî it probably means she just likes the arrangement of the relationship and the balance between mutual support and freedom that distance can give. I will warn you though that it also makes it easy for ENFPs to get a Rose-colored image of the relationship if that makes sense. You have such good quality time when you‚Äôre together and then otherwise your lives are very different. Be careful she doesn‚Äôt over idealize or it‚Äôll end when she sees she‚Äôs set her own expectations to perfection.
2	How do you get things to be things	What I really meant in the title is how as an enfp do you guy get things done. It says interesting title so I took my chances :D but yeah the main question is that, how do you get your body to move and complete a certain task when 1. When you have to do it? 2. When you need to do do it but you‚Äôre lazy? This is to differentiate between wanting to do something bcus when you ‚Äúwant‚Äù to actually do any jobs or task, you will do it.(usual enfp thing) But if you feel forced, how do you get it done? I think I‚Äôve tried to explain it as best as I could, hope you guys understood my question. I‚Äôm open to any opinion as I am really in a deadlock situation 
3	As an ENFP I feel like I'm passion fuelled. I need to know that what im doing is something I'm doing by choice and free will. But if there's no passion then it's very difficult. What I've noticed is that fi-te tends to be the kind of person who will either give 0% or 100% but fe-ti finds it much easier to just put some energy into a task but not all of it. Choose your own reasons for doing things. Obviously I'm very unorganised by nature and so forcing myself to create structure for myself is really hard for me, I think I've cracked it though. So personally if I can link what I want to do to a philosophical or even spiritual principal then I'm much more likely to stay motivated. E.g. I structure my week and finances on the chakra systems. So Mondays is survival so I'll do all my chores and go to appointmentments, and anything pertaining to my survival, on Tuesdays it's connection and enjoyment, so I'm likely to take it easy and meet friends or family, Wednesday's is self discipline or willpower so I'll get all my uni work done or do exercise or something and so on for the upper chakras etc. We as ENFPs hate to just feel like we are a cog in a machine without any control over our lives, and we hate to feel like we're doing something for no reason, we like to be inspired and passionate, listening to motivational speeches regularly can help too to boost feelings of passion. Lastly, we are not lazy, as I said before we tend to be 0% or 100% we are both underachievers and over achievers, we are bad at pacing and managing our energy levels, and staying focused, but when we work, and we are passionate, and we are focused, we can truly create remarkable things, it's just hard getting from 0 to 100 sometimes. 
2	I self-medicate with a lot of caffeine. That gets me through the ADHD sprawl, at least. \n\nI learn what works for my brain and my body. I know now that I feel a *lot* happier at work if I've taken a lot of "unstructured, obsessive study" time before I go in. Even if that means waking up earlier. So I wake up early, grab some caffeine, and sit in a bathrobe and study for a couple hours, then shift into work mode - showering, getting dressed, getting my things together and going to work all happen as part of the same flow. \n\nSimilarly I'm learning that when I go home, and I know that I really want to get some cleaning done but I'm worried I'm gonna get home and just flop, I consciously focus on the thing that I need to do as I'm driving home and make a strategy. "Get home, immediately after taking off coat and shoes, start a snack and unload the dishwasher. Then, start the ricemaker. Sweep while this pan heats." That kind of thing. \n\nI mean, it's really just a lot of self-knowledge, internal motivation (I don't clean because I have to, I clean because I want a nice home)... knowing my energy flow, I guess? I like big chunks of "one thing" time more than I thought I did, maybe minimizing the transitions is good for the ADHD-brain. Find the thing that you actually wanna do, figure out what's getting in your way, make it easier. I think that's true for all personalities. 
2	Where do I write my comment?
1	So how do you guys rate stuff on a scale of 1 to 10? [This is regarding stuff you buy/ services (eg. Uber)]	Personally I rarely ever give anything a 10 cuz I feel like it can always be better, but sometimes, very rarely if I love the service, I give it a 10.
2	I used to care about being accurate about reviews like that, as though there is someone watching me to make sure I'm being accurate in my review of an uber ride. \n\nBut no. this isn't school, I'm not here to actually grade others. Effort is what I value, everyone is trying their best in this fucked up world. Some dude not giving me the best possible experience at all times doesn't deserve less than 5 stars. \n\nCompanies do shitty things with their ratings. I worked at a grocery store once, we'd win stuff if we got the highest rating from customers over the month in our department and whatnot. What that ended up proving to me is that smiling and handsome white dudes also happen to provide the best customer service, I'm being sarcastic but it happened. When shit boils down to ratings rather than actual interaction, how can you ever trust other people? I think there was a black mirror about this. \n\nShort of a driver threatening me or attempting to harm me, that person is getting the highest rating i can. folks have too much in life to worry about without also adding "gotta make sure I offer free water to the customer, gotta make sure the music is what they want to listen to even though its my car, gotta have every possible charging cable, gotta get this dent fixed or else some asshole is going to give me a 1 star because the car wasn't to their liking"\n\nIt also allows people to go on a power trip and attempt to harm someone that they don't even know by writing ridiculous reviews online where it pits two people's words against each other.\n\nAnd i know you're probably not the kind to give a 1 star because of *meh* service, but theres enough people like that out there that I don't feel right just giving 8/10 because it met but didn't exceed expectations. The company expects its employees to give 10/10 service, as such my understanding of 10/10 is meeting expectations. 
1	Personally I both love and loath having to review things, I like to balance the objective and the subjective. So the Uber may have been objectively fine and efficient to others however subjectively I would have wanted to go a different route. But I'm a sappy soppy little thing, I don't like rating things especially if it's someone's livelihood or something they hold very personally, you never know what kind of shit people are going through, so I tend to just give high review's unless I experience something that I am genuinely unhappy with. 
2	Hey üëèüèæ	It's an old post but what do you guys think of this I think this really applies alot to our generation. \n\n\nhttps://thoughtcatalog.com/charles-j-orlando/2014/10/ladies-please-stop-doing-this-on-instagram/
4	good one, this problem comes up way to often (i feel most in fp types)\n\nbut as an avid thinker, im not concerned with the self esteem issue (although it was really well elucidated), but the atrocious carbohydrate addiction.
4	The writer comes off as harsh, but some of the points he hit are true.\nSelf-esteem is not reliant on the 'likes' of others to gain confidence.\n\nThere's a difference between absolutely being confident in your body vs trying to gain the approval of others. \n
2	my two cents is that on the online dating world i'm generally not interested in someone whose ig is full of these types of pics. attractive? sure. is being attractive a personality? no. 
10	Is this Flanimal an ENFP?	
1	I don't know, but where did you find this?
1	Yes, specially if a Glonk is an INxx
1	Where can u get one. I want him. He is mine.
1	It may just be my dark traid showing but I'm not a giver in any way as an ENFP. I can be very bubbly and energetic, but I have must a motive for it, and usually I do.
1	Need to find me an INTJ glonk
1	Weekly Support Thread	\n/r/ENFP has always been and will always be a place that lends an ear. Large or small, get it all off your chest. In this corner of the internet, you will be heard. We are here to support one another. We are all we have.\n\nThis doesn't replace the individual posts; it's just another avenue to start talking, MBTI related or not. Sometimes you need to check in more than once before you feel restored. That's what we're here for.\n
7	Is Kanye West an ENFP??	He seems like an ENFP who turns into an unhealthy ESTP sometimes\n

2	That‚Äôs fair
2	yes
1	I‚Äôm gonna go out and just guess but I can see him as an ENTP 
1	Mostly see him typed as ISFP
1	No way. He‚Äôs easily a ESTP. Come on guys!!! 
1	I hope not
4	ENFP computer programmers/developers	Is there anyone here who are programmers or software developers\n\nMy question is how did you stay consistent when learning?\n\nWe get bored easily and also lose focus. How did you deal with typical enfp issues focus/getting bored / need lot of validation when we do something wrong
3	I majored in computer science engineering, so that's mainly where I learned it. I learned a bit from websites like codecademy as well, and a bit from hobby projects and friends.
2	Been a working as a developer since 1999. I changed job once after 8 years. I feel that code is a way of being creative and when I get some code done that wows the stakeholders by being something new, something creative I feel really good. Code can be beautiful. I try to mix team work with solo coding to get variations. I work in two different teams. Always trying to get close to customer needs. I couldn't be working for any software company. They need to be doing something that catches my interest and validates me.
2	I finished tehnical school, but went for a geologist on college after that. I just Can't see myself sitting 24/7 in some office brainfucking with code. I'd rather scale mountains.\n\nBut I was good at coding not gonna lie. Made a game once.
2	ENFP Diary: Career ladders suck but i want recognition	TLDR; my manager has always told me im in line for a promotion even though I would be advocating for one early (got one as recent as 12 months ago) but sent me an email saying I should wait 6 months. Took this to heart, though I wasn't doing my part, felt unappreciated, angry at the world. Angry at capitalism, angry at my company\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy managers manager covering for him while hes on vacation who I am close with told me he supports me going for promotion, and gave me all the details on how it works and that my manager actually has been advocating hard for me. Now i dont even care about the promotion i just wanted to know i was in good graces. Ugh lol
4	How do you afford your expensive (and myriad) hobbies?	Hi fellow ENFPs,\n\nWe're known for having an ever expanding number of interests. Many of those are costly in either money or work-study time- lessons, equipment, travel, etc etc. For those of you who weren't born into money, how do you manage this?  \nHave some of you found lucrative careers that don't crush your soul? (What are they?) Do some of you live in a magical country where healthcare is free or you get a basic income? (Where?) Do you sustain side gigs or play the stock market? (How?) Have you stayed satisfied working as a tourism adventure guide? (A job I've considered many times, but certainly hinders most 'normal' lifestyles)\n\nHelp!  \n
3	I get things for free or cheap. Get the best deal. Do it the most efficient way. 
2	You can try keeping a blog or instagram account dedicated to a hobby. It's a way to get the audience, and hobby related opportunities, to *come to you.* And, if you don't attach your name to the site, it'll be easier to abandon it when a new hobby inevitably replaces it, lol. \n\n&#x200B;
1	I approach this right now with a mindset that balances time, energy, and income. I want to spend a little amount of time on things that do not drain my energy to earn enough money that I can pursue my interests. Or at least this is how I convinced myself to play the game and commit to being a bureaucrat. \n\nIs my job boring? It can be. I get my work done so I can listen to things that expand on my interests without worry. However, its a low-stress position, and I don't worry about work at all when im off the clock. \n\nIs it for every ENFP? no. But I'm focused on other things than "professional development" in my life. The pay is *enough* and thats all I really want. I can't spend money freely, but I can budget for anything if I want it. Meanwhile I like the benefits that come from a consistent 8-4 type job, sleep and eating regulation being the more important aspects. \n\nSome day I might develop enough skill or expertise in a hobby in order to make that my career, and that'd be cool! I just don't see that happening any time soon, I like having all these options. \n\nSo, not saying you should do what I did but don't be afraid of getting a more "standard" job if it pays well enough and doesn't take up too much of your time. 
1	Well luckily I was born into a country with free healthcare and I'm married, so we have a dual income. My hobbies aren't expensive though, I like to paint and I like photography. \n\nIf your hobbies include travel, skiing, horseriding etc then yes, you'll have to earn good money to do those things. Some people work seasonally, with multiple jobs and save carefully so they can spend 6 months having fun. I always thought that lifestyle would suit an ENFP. \n
1	I go all Macklemore and thrift my hobbies! Of course, thrifting is a hobby in itself :D
9	I am sad due to my own perceived incapability of living life	Many don‚Äôt understand this, and I don‚Äôt really either. Of course everyone feels sad, but as others tell me, most not in the retarded way I do. \n\nFor a long time I thought I was sad for the typical reasons such as not looking good enough, not being popular enough, not being this and that enough. \n\nNow that I managed to get past a lot of my bariers and let my natural self shine more, I am becoming more and more popular. Next to that, I have a few really really good friends so nothing to complain. Apart from that most teachers (I am at university) like me, my boss likes me and almost every person I meet likes me.\n\nPlease don‚Äôt understand me wrong. I do not want to brag, I just want to show my own paradox.\n\nReally, the only thing I am missing at this point is a romantic connection, as I have never had one. \n\nStill, I feel sad often, and to come to the point, usually I feel like I am ‚Äònot doing enough‚Äô.\n\nI do not reallt have steady hobbies. On this reddit I read about people who paint, write and many other things. Although I do have my own things, like dancing, I have a hard time sticking to those structurally. Furthermore I often find myself wasting time in my room sitting with my laptop for hours on end. The only thing thwt really gets me out of my room is social things, which I do too much. \n\nI feel like I *have* to live life more to my potential, but at the same often feel paralysed and clueless.\n\nAny thoughts, stories, tips or relatable things?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n\nTo add, maybe it helps:\n\nI have ADHD\nand I am enneagram 8 
6	I feel you in a lot of ways, and part of it is just your age and where you're at in life. I struggled to ever really commit to any hobbies, and some of my hobbies weren't productive at all and instead were just time wasters. Which isn't to say hobbies should have an end or a goal, but if you invest time, energy, and money into something you shouldn't feel like its a waste of time. \n\nEventually my perspective on things changed. As your title suggests "my own perceived incapability of living life", the exact mindset I was in. And to be honest in college its really easy to have that mindset, because its almost like a feeling that life hasn't started yet for you. Other people seem to be living life, and I'd be somewhat jealous of how they were doing it. I just never felt like I was, I was just sortof floating through life and wrapped up in a world of deadlines. \n\nBut after college it became pretty clear to me that it wasn't my own incapability of living life that was the problem, because I was living life. Its all just been living life. The problem was that I wasn't loving the life I was living, I had an idea of what it meant to live life but I was so far from it and had no clue how to *get there*. It was kinda like an awakening? \n\nLife, its what you do. And in order to change it you just have to do it. Find something you want to do, and dedicate time to do it. When you realize that you're just kinda sitting in your room wasting time until something happens, notice that you can be the cause of something to happen. A friend of mine has just gotten into painting, he just got some canvases, brushes, and paints and just started doing. No structure to it, no one telling him what or how to paint, just doing it. Hes already developed his own sortof *style* too. The key is that he is enjoying what hes doing in the moment, he isn't stressing about the painting itself or trying to get it to match his "vision" or something. Hes just doing something he likes to do, and that is living life. \n\nThis also reminds me of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCDQUtWO9Kg) by alan watts. One of the lessons I learned from this (and him in general) is that trying to live life runs counter to actually living life. Which was a rut that I was stuck in, and feels like you've been stuck in as well. of course I could just be projecting my past experiences on you way too much and that this isn't what you're going through. But anyway, hope you get through this funk. 
2	Sometimes you can be sad without any good reason. Have you considered therapy? Also are you in any clubs?
2	I have a different problem, recently I had emotional breakdown and decided to pull back from socializing for a while, not chatting or talking to anyone, being alone, yet I can't stop myself being so friendly and enthusiastic at college. I'm laughing, telling jokes, hanging out with other students, yet I feel depressed inside. I can't tell people that I'm not in the mood for stuff, I'm naturally hyper happy, and it's f exhausting.

3	I'm hurt.
3	Is this ENFP or is this INFP?   \n\n^Thinks ü§î I guess it matters on what the current ENFP and INFP's mood state for which is more applicable is dependent on the xNFP's current mood level and thus how you try to change what you are feeling now.  ENFPs and INFPs both doing this but for slightly different reasons.
2	As an introvert I would like to point out this is also going on on my mind but I would just be way to shy to look or say anything.
2	If I can't relate, but I'm an ENFP, does that mean I'm not lonely?
2	That's why I force myself to sit on the top of the bus, so all I see is the bus driver
2	Hahaha, too accurate. I might generally imagine like a lifestyle with the girl but it's more so like conversations we'd have whilst on a beach whilst the suns setting and I can vividly imagine what her facial expressions would be like and what we're talking about. Ahhhhhhh

0	ENFP Interviewing ISTP Binyamin Tsadik Bair Ti-Se CP/B(S) MF	
4	Disagreeing over values?	I‚Äôm an enfp & my best friend is also an enfp. We have a lot in common and have a lot of fun together. I think of her as an unconditional friend. Recently we had some conversations that really rocked the security of our relationship. Specifically involving an interest in cosmetic surgery & she reacted in a way that seems shocked and somewhat disgusted. \nI have been spending a ton of time thinking about it. I haven‚Äôt really spoken with her for about a week, but we are both busy so idk if she knows. \nI have a pattern of having a close friend and then feeling hurt by that person and cutting them off. I feel really hurt right now. I‚Äôm surprised I feel so deeply about this because the issue itself isn‚Äôt that impprtant to me but i guess i‚Äôm feeling like she doesn‚Äôt accept me if our opinions don‚Äôt align.
5	ENFP's have strong Introverted Feeling which is about values. We have strong values and principles. But they are different for each person. You shouldn't automatically cut someone out of your life for having a different opinion though, especially for an issue you don't care about. Or you're going to end up alone. Let me tell you as someone with no friends it is not fun. :(
2	She's really not supposed to react that way. I understand how you feel. How about you initiate the old conversations you both had before the disagreement and move on? Try to resume the conversation normally like nothing happened. If she brings up the disagreement you can say that you respect her opinion and that she should respect yours too. Agree to disagree, move on and maintain the friendship!
2	>but i guess i‚Äôm feeling like she doesn‚Äôt accept me if our opinions don‚Äôt align.\n\nI think that's the problem. You're putting too much stock into your own assumptions. From what you wrote in your post, I don't get the impression that she doesn't accept you if your opinions don't align at all. She's simply disgusted at the idea of cosmetic surgery, completely removed from the person undergoing it. 
0	Values are values because they are hard to change and why would you want to?  Values are great things, beauty, security, safety, etc..\n\nI suggest accepting other people values.  You can disagree on how they go about achieving them, but the value itself you need to aknowledge for someone else to feel accepted and known in your presence.

17	Princess Carolyn has great advice! "You gotta get your shit together! You're a star!"
7	Um.....bojack is superior to any tv show existing don‚Äôt feel bad 
5	Bojack?
2	Terry crews! He is cool.\n\nAs an ENFP i have to say I am being serious before doing something.
2	Hey, you‚Äôve got to take the lessons in life no matter what they‚Äôre packaged in! I often go back and get moral lessons i‚Äôd forgotten from Disney movies üëçüèª \n\nAnd you know.. for the nostalgia üòã
2	Hahaha I've been there. Their loss for missing out on good insights just cos it's from a cartoon :P (my personal "life inspiration and advice" cartoon is Avatar, the Last Airbender).
3	What kind of grades did you get in Highschool?	I was bad at most maths, I kind of liked geometry though.. good in English and History classes.. up and down in science.. depends on how much I cared mostly.  Not very coordinated in sports/gym but I enjoyed dodge ball of course! that was in grade school, oh well. Also loved Psychology as much as Literature. -Female/enfp\n\nJust curious about correlation with type/cognitive functions and grades in different subjects. Any other factors you would want to add that would contribute to learning differences are helpful. I know most types answering here will be enfps, so I'm curious to see if I relate. All types welcome though, I hope to hear from others :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
7	I had really good grades in school without trying. Never needed to study. But toward end of high school it made me lazy and I got bad grades from not doing projects.
7	C's and D's. A's and B's in classes that where actually worth my effort like Architecture and residential building construction. Psychology, woodworking, Parenting to name a few. \n\nA++'s that dont exist in classes like in middle school where the teacher let me do whatever I wanted. He literally let me and another guy hack all the PC's and put games on them so our seminar, which was the period before, could all play games together. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
3	I got good grades in classes i liked and terrible grades in everything else
3	Here‚Äôs what I remember (I graduated 11 years ago).\n\n- English: always A‚Äôs\n- Foreign Language: always A‚Äôs\n- Biology: A‚Äôs and B‚Äôs\n- Physical Science: B‚Äôs\n- Math: A‚Äôs and B‚Äôs\n- History & Social Sciences: A‚Äôs and C‚Äôs, the C‚Äôs were from AP US History which was a real bitch. \n- PE: always A‚Äôs... PE is always an easy A though. As long as you participated to your full capability that day, you got full credit.\n- Miscellaneous Electives: A‚Äôs and B‚Äôs\n\nI took all honors & AP classes, graduated with a 3.6 or so. \n\nThat all being said, I focused really hard on school as a way to try and get my parent‚Äôs attention. They‚Äôd divorced when I was in 6th grade and showed more concern about their dating lives/new partner(s) than their children. What little attention they did pay was always more focused on my older sister since she had a rebellious streak going on. She was always much more intelligent than me, so they were very concerned with their gifted child wasting her potential by partying and skipping class. I realized that they didn‚Äôt care about my academic performance my senior year, and that‚Äôs when my grades started slipping.
3	A's and B's for the most part on most all my subjects. And I did take the hard classes, Pre  Calculus, Calculus, trig, Chem 2, Astronomy etc. My grades tend to depend on what teaching style in the class. Another words, did the teacher properly teach the correct style depending on the students needs? Teachers that actually care to reach each student can teach each student. Unless, the kid has extreme serious attitude issues.  I had quality teachers the majority of my highschool years. The subjects that could have been difficult were easier to understand so I was able to nurture my curiosity or subject matter that I otherwise might have shown little interested in or failed. There was only a brief period of time right before my father passed away my last year in high school that my grades dropped. However, I had teachers and a counselor who gave me grace and encouragment during that rough patch. 
3	I was an excellent student in high school top scores in every area. Bachelors was pretty bad. I didnt like what I was doing and was lazy... masters got honors because I actually tried 
2	Went to a continuation high school just so I could finish early. Waitressed for a bit until I realized I need a career; went to university and majored in communications. Shocked.
2	Depends on if I liked the class or not. I liked most classes and did well in most (As and Bs). Hated History and that was always my worst class.
2	Generally i'd be described as a B+/A- level student on average. \n\nMath: Mostly B level stuff. Never cared enough about it, but once concepts clicked I didn't struggle. Got a C in calc but I blame being a senior and getting into my college of choice on that. \n\nScience: If its a subject I was interested in (physics, astronomy) A, if its a subject I wasn't B (chem, bio)\n\nHistory/social studies: A if the exams were essays, Bs if the exams were multiple choice. Memorizing was never my strong suit. I also did really well in government class but just okay in econ. \n\nEnglish or writing: A's generally. I liked things like creative writing a whole lot. but overall did well because I was solid at writing essays. Got a B in honors english because I didn't read the books ever. \n\nI took a lot of music classes in HS so those were As. \n\nPretty much anything that I can default Ne I would do well in (like essay based classes, particularly creative ones), anything that I had an interest in I'd do well (like history and physics), and anything that I didn't care about I'd dedicate as little effort to as possible (reading most books, bio/chem, or calc)
1	English A\nMalay A\nHistory A\nIslam A\n\nPhysics B\nBiology C\nAdd math C \nChemistry C\n\nI hate science subjects because I couldn't study at my own pace. There was zero passion about them in class.. we were just ordered to memorized the model answers. But chemistry and math are subjects I might never have any interest in (regardless of being given all the time in the world to study).\n\nThis really goes against the stereotypes where INTJs are super smart and love science. :P We're not. Everyone's different, even with the same type.\n\nI'm very lazy but I could understand/memorize things easily if I want to. Most of the time, I don't want to. Lack of motivation and being no.1 isn't at all appealing to me. 
3	Mature ENFPs, how do you go about breaking up with people?	I feel that I'm an open-minded, go with the flow type of person who fall for people easily and care about them a lot. This usually leads to things developing but I'm usually the one who wants to move on. I hate hate hate hurting people though. Any suggestions that you've found useful in your life for breaking up with people? 
7	You don‚Äôt need to explain anything or give them ‚Äúclosure‚Äù or any of that. That‚Äôs a personal journey for them to embark and heal on their own. Just be polite, direct, honest, and aim to cut off all contact. Any reason is a valid reason. Just say it.
2	Tell them you don't have the same feelings for them, wish them the very best, and move on if you do not both want to be friends. 
2	Accept that you will hurt someone. Honesty is the best policy. I disagree with the comments saying you don't own them an explanation. It's basically ghosting someone and a huge dick move. It's something an immature ENFP would do. I've seen enough enfp posts and such whining about how they got dumped for no real reason and it's damn hurtful. Just honestly tell them what the real reason is and say you don't want to stay in touch anymore. 
1	I just try to be straightforward & say something that breaks down to ‚Äúyou are fine but i‚Äôm not into you.‚Äù Like ‚Äúi had a really fun time the other night you are great to talk to but there‚Äôs no spark‚Äù or whatever. I have sent similar texts several times & people literally thank me. I even sent an awkward ‚Äúby going to dinner do you mean a date? Because i don‚Äôt like you that way‚Äù text one time and even that one got a thank you.  \n\n Being honest hurts them way less than the confusion over fading or ghosting.  Every time someone ghosts me i will be depressed for months even if we weren‚Äôt close, it makes me sick. \n\nMore serious relationships deserve a phone call if not an in person break up.
1	Tell them it‚Äôs not working for *either* of you because the relationship is unhealthy and you have an unhealthy dynamic.\n\n(Only if that applies of course). 
1	I found it is easier to stick to terms that are not personal. Like the connection is lacking, not you are lacking.
1	I write a letter and ask will you break up with me with a yes and no box to check
30	Be a winner. (Albeit a distracted one)	
4	Fuck me this is my life.\n\nIt's SO EASY to help others.\n\nCan I not have my personal goals, self fulfillment AND helping others?  FOCUS.
2	honestly this is how the world should be today 
4	I can't get over a girl I hardly got to know and I need help	As I understand it, feeling over attachment to someone who you hardly know is a common trait among ENFP people. So I was wondering if any of you have had the same problem and if so, how did you get over her/him? \n\nQuick back story: We met at an party a month ago, we chatted and it felt like we really got along well. After about an week of texting she choose a different guy over me. Sense then my life has been a living hell :( can't stop thinking about her, need help 
5	This more about you not being able to get the girl than anything.\n\nYou haven't accepted your fantasy is not real.  Look fantasies are great, powerful and an ENFP can build amazing things from them.\n\nIf you're not taking actions to make your fantasy a reality then WTF are you doing?  Take actions or let it go.
3	Hey, it's ok don't beat yourself up over it. Focus on yourself and the things you like to do and look for someone else. you'll quickly realize why this new person is a better fit for you. 
3	Normally when i feel this way it‚Äôs an attachment to an imagined future or version of myself. I think about the source of my attachment and what i‚Äôm actually missing. Then i make a plan to achieve it for myself.\n\nthis guy dumped me. He told me he would help me learn to play bass. Idk what the whole fantasy was anymore but i wanted to be a band and have an accountability partner to eat healthy with. i didn‚Äôt have a bass but i did teach myself to play ukelele and play guitar for a year. I am definitely not in a rock band but the whole experience did help me recognize my own creativity and artistry rather than living vicariously through him.\n\nSometimes it can be more profound like one ex taught me how authenticity and honesty are cornerstone to my personality & to look for warning signs of alcoholism.\n\nThank u next
2	Yeah, I'll second the fantasies bit. It's really easy to get caught up in what could be, or could have been, but realistically you don't know what would have happened. She might have been fun but ultimately a bad match for you... she might have been outright nuts (this has happened to me before, lol). Maybe try using that imagination to a different end - imagine other possible outcomes, imagine meeting someone even better, etc. Maybe that'll help you feel less attached to this one person.
2	Step one: Realize its lust\n\nStep two: You'll get over her soon
2	Go talk to other girls 
4	30 Pounds	It‚Äôs March.  Soon enough it‚Äôll be summer, and I will be at the beach with my friends.  And for another year, just like every single summer of my life, I will be too embarrassed of my weight and my scars to take off my shirt and swim.  \n\nI used to dream of being a lifeguard.  I would watch them save someone and wish it could be me.  I wished I was strong enough, thin enough, to run down the sand into the water and help someone.  I don‚Äôt dream of that anymore.  \n\nI was a swimmer as a kid.  My dad taught me to swim as soon as I started walking.  By age 8 I was in the ‚Äúguppy‚Äù swim team at the local club.  At age 10 I won first place in the butterfly stroke.\n\nBy age 12 I was beyond ‚Äúhusky‚Äù and my weight started getting negative attention.  I was humiliated every day, and I would go home and bury myself in PlayStation and snacks.  At age 16 I was 245lbs and wore pants and long sleeves all year to hide myself.  That was the first time I ever looked in a mirror and said out loud to my reflection ‚Äúyou‚Äôre fucking disgusting.  I HATE you‚Äù\n\nI started doing drugs heavily.  I got into the crowd quickly and by age 17 I was selling LSD, pot, oxy and Xanax.  I had an unlimited supply of prescription amphetamines.  I was so high all the time on a mixture of drugs that I only ate once every other day.  I was playing music at the time, and between not eating and sleeping and rocking as hard as possible every night I got thin.  I went all the way down to 185.\n\nAt age 19 I was still up to my bullshit.  I loved how I looked in clothing, but my body was covered in deep scars and loose skin.  Again, disgusted with myself, I spent another summer watching everyone else have fun.  \n\nThe band broke up and the drug train stopped.  I was 23.  By my 25th birthday I was 330lbs.  I couldn‚Äôt even make it up a flight of stairs without a break.\n\nI joined a gym for the first time in my life.  At the gym I met someone with an adderall script, and immediately bought him out.  I joined a powerlifting club, and stopped eating.  At the end of that year I had reached 205 and actually had some definition!  My abdomen, however, had been more scars now.  This devastated me.  I couldn‚Äôt get any pills at this time so I upgraded to Meth.  In no time I was addicted.  I was snorting meth 2 or 3 times a day just to get through work.  My productivity was off the chain and I won awards at work for my accomplishments.  Those awards should have gone to my meth dealer.  I reduced my weight, again, over the next two years.  I got to my lowest, 180lbs.  I had more muscle so my skin no longer hung off me like a weird coat, I just had the scars.  I didn‚Äôt even really mind them now.  I went to the beach, took off my shirt and swam in the ocean.  It was so liberating.  I was so happy.\n\nI realized that my drug problem was out of hand.  I quit meth and any other drug, just smoked some herb and drank beer on the weekends.  Without the meth I was RAVENOUS all the time.  I couldn‚Äôt eat enough!  I was so damn hungry.  \n\nSkip to my 30th birthday.  I was in decent shape, blood pressure was good, my gym performance was awesome and consistent.  But my weight was still at 210lbs and I wasn‚Äôt happy with my jiggly love handles.\n\nI attempted suicide.  I failed and my wife saved me.  I spent a year just existing.  No gym, no food control, I barely even showered.  I got on some decent meds and felt a little better and got back to the gym.   I was 230lbs.  \n\nSince then I‚Äôve tried HARD to control my diet and get my workouts in.  I failed, a lot.  I now weigh 234lbs and I hate myself more than ever before.\n\nI guess I wanted to get it off my chest.\n\nThanks for reading.  
7	think about what a setup this is for the most inspiring story anybody ever heard.   i have a story too.  most people do.  you are not alone.  and you can turn your life around.  especially if you are an ENFP. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
4	I've struggled with my weight since I was a teenager but never got REALLY FAT until I got pregnant and had trouble losing the weight after.\n\nThen last year I made a decision to get in shape before I'm 30.\n\nMy birthday is in a couple months, and I have lost a lot of weight, but I don't have a scale so I don't know how much. I know I'm down 4 pant sizes and everyone compliments me. \n\nI have trouble going out to do anything consistently, being a stay at home mom for the time being. Do you know what I did to lose weight?\n\nI played Dance Dance Revolution on my old PS2.\n\nI love videogames, I play a decent bit, although not like I did before I was a mom... Now Im a filthy casual xD\n\nI got a couple used games for cheap off eBay and a couple cheap mats. All the "masters" at the game say it's impossible to play hard songs on the cheap mats, but they are wrong. \n\nWhen I first started, I could only do really easy steps for like a half hour or so. I still had trouble controlling my eating also. I was so heavy my joints would ache.\n\nI kept going though, almost every day, as much as I could. As I got better at the game I started having to incorporate stretches and strength building exercises into my routine to avoid injury. As I lost weight and gained more stamina, I was able to pull off harder and harder steps.\n\nI started changing the way I ate to help me get the best workout. My appetite decreased because I wasn't sitting around all the time.\n\nNow I can play for about three hours every day on the highest difficulty. I sweat my ass off. I don't know how many calories I'm burning or how much weight I've lost but I feel pretty good.\n\nYeah I got stretch marks and some loose skin, mostly on my stomach from having ultra mega baby! But it's okay.\n\nI got sick of playing the same two games for like a year xD. I just ordered four more off eBay for pretty cheap. Looking forward to that.\n\nPeople just need to find an exercise regimen that works for them that they can make a habit out of. \n\nYou've been through a lot, and I was gonna originally rant about my life struggles till I saw the comment saying everyone has a story. Yeah. So instead I thought I'd share the positive story of my fitness crap and uhhhhh maybe inspire you to be able to keep at it and reach your goals!
1	Man, that sounds rough. I'm sorry you've had to go through so much.  \n\n\nHey, so I know you weren't asking for advice, so hopefully it's alright for me to say this lol. But did you ever consider tackling some of these problems through herbal supplements aimed at stress? I've been on some pretty nasty stress rollercoasters in my time, and during the times when it's been the worst for the longest, I've put on a fair bit of weight. Like, I have Chronic Fatigue Syndrome now, but before it was diagnosed, I was exercising well and eating well - and I put on like 60 lbs over the course of a few months (mostly on my stomach) and noticed I was getting less and less fit. Turns out that with CFS, your body doesn't respond properly to exercise, so even a "healthy" amount of exercise was stressing my body out to the point that I was burning out and putting on stress weight. When I cut the exercise way back, and made sure to stop as soon as I started feeling a little tired, I stopped gaining weight (though I have yet to lose it). Something similar happened when I burned out in my last year of uni. My sisters, too, worked out a lot and controlled their diet so it was super healthy, and both had a hard time losing weight. Turns out each of them had hormonal issues that got in the way (one had PCOS, the other just had sorta wonky hormones after pregnancy, but it wasn't like a medical issue per se - just enough to tip things out of whack). Both had more success & felt better when they aimed at fixing the hormones.  \n\n\nAnyway, the point of that is just to suggest that you've had a lot of emotional & physical stresses, stretching out over years and years, and maybe taking some adrenal support supplements or something could help a bit. Personally I love Adrenal SAP and L-theanine supplements, though of course you should like, check with a naturopath first, or a doctor, especially if you're on other stuff. Maybe some meditation and sleep hygeine could help too. Cos it really sounds like you could just use a break. Maybe being a little gentler on yourself and aiming for balance, rather than weight loss per se, could help?
1	You are still a good person and should be proud of your willingness to try again and again. Determination is admirable and you show it by picking yourself up over and over. Your value does not lie in your body or the numbers on the scale. I Hope you can work towards mental health and self acceptance. \n\nYou have nothing to be ashamed of, everyone makes mistakes.  
1	Thanks for sharing your story, you've had it tough.\n\nMay I share a few thoughts?\n\n1. You always get back up and try again. That takes grit and determination.\n\n2. Your wife has been with you through the darkest times. Take the pressure off yourself for a bit and focus your time and thoughts on her. Make her laugh, tell her how proud you are of her, spoil her. She loves you for who you are and that's all that matters.\n\n3. Start a keystone habit. This is a habit which has a knock on effect to other areas. For example, I focus on doing a short home workout once a day. That's all I'm focusing on, too many habits stresses me out. Now because I've put in all that effort, I'm not going to eat badly and screw it up. I'm going to sleep better because I'm tired out. I'm gonna feel happier in the morning because I've slept well. I'm going to be a better Mum because I'm in a good mood. It just takes one good habit.\n\n4. You're an ENFP, you are special and you can do anything.
11	THOUGHT YOU GUYS MIGHT BE EXCITED AS I AM...NINTENDOGS FOR THE SWITCH IS COMING!!!11!!111!1!11	
5	I take objection to the fact that this is not the most upvoted post of the past month on this sub.
2	I remember getting stuck on nintendogs D's because I didn't understand how blowing on the console worked lol
2	*gets a switch just for the purpose of playing nintendogs*
9	About to meet an INFJ guy	I have a coffee date in 2 minutes with an infj, any tips hehehe\n\nWish me luck hehe
5	Don't talk over him, give the man some time to breathe and talk too. Listen to what they have to say. Don't boast too much about yourself and be careful with the limits. If you notice certain topics make them hesitant, don't keep asking about it no matter how curious you are. Show them your kind and nice side, pay attention to little details he says and bring it back up later in the convo to show you've been paying attention, etc... And don't fake too many smiles, only laugh when you mean it. INFJ's see right through a fa√ßade or fake actions.
2	INFJs are into helping others. If you can show that you're that social activist kind of girl they'd be really interested in you. 
2	how was it?   \n\n\nand don't take too much care, it's surely a mistype\n\ninfj are hootler
1	Don‚Äôt be too focused on your own needs, sometimes we like it when others know what they want as we don‚Äôt have to make a choice and get to do things we wouldn‚Äôt do ourselves and other times we wind up completely ignoring the things we want because we know said person wants to go to x eating place that we aren‚Äôt actually interested in.\n\n
2	Work & Career - What do you do for a living and does it fit with your personality?	So I recently found out (=made my friend take a test) that my friend and I both are ENFPs.\n\nIt just so happens that the both of us are in the same position right now, that of being unemployed. \n\nShe dropped out of school, realizing becoming a teacher wasn‚Äôt for her. \nI left a job that was incredibly repetitive, I loved my co-workers, but all in all the place made me stressed and depressed.\n\nWe both share an interest in design, art, writing and music. \n\nSo, long story short, I‚Äôm curious to know what you occupy your time with? What do you do for a living? Do you like it? Did you study or how did you get the job? \n\nTell me all about it! \n\n
1	So far the best career I've had is Social work or anything along those lines (youth work, counselling)\n\nThe variety of the day, vs the autonomy vs the deep people interaction ticks all the boxes for me. Especially if you work for a company that encourages innovation and creativity then it's perf! \n\nApparently Entrapanerial and Human Resources are suitable too, but require a bit of balls so maybe for the more Assertive or mature ENFP.\n\nI'm about to embark on a career change from Social work to HR and I'm excited! 
1	Fast food, mostly at the register and drive through. '\n\nI'd be gone if I wasnt there for the co-workers\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter I've gone to college im going into IT and living the dream job in paradise. 
1	I‚Äôm an ER nurse, I absolutely love it. I get to work with new people all the time and help them feel better, I‚Äôm never bored, part of my job is being caring and optimistic, and people often give immediate positive feedback if they like me. I also have frequent opportunities to get into some deeply personal conversations with people and connect with them very quickly. \n\nSometimes i feel like my personality shines more at work than on my days off. 
36	Are you guys ever about to put on a song/movie, and you're like "Nope. I'm not strong enough for those emotions right now."	For me it's "The Little Prince." I love that movie so much, but it also takes so many emotions out of me. If I'm already tired/exhausted, there's some emotions that I'm just not as capable of feeling. It takes energy haha
5	YESYESYESYESYES. Songs. And I recently kinda forced myself to face certain emotions with a song! Terrible, but the aftermath? Totally worth it. 
3	That film tho........\n\nFor me its most films that aren‚Äôt comedy, whenever i am in a group situation i am not 600% comfortable with. Aint nobody going to see me ugly cry. 
3	When I feel that way what takes over is the thought "There's probably something better I can do with my time."\n\nAnd if I'm smart I do the better thing.
3	Haha there maybe like 4 songs reminding me a close and fucking nice period of my life I just can't listen without be nostalgic as hell, so I'm never listening theme 
5	I love dying out of raw feels, Interstellar for me
2	OMG THIS HAPPENED TO ME 2 HOURS AGO. I randomly thought of a song I used to love but that gave me feels, played it, and stopped it after 10 seconds. Too heavy. "Pictures of You" by The Last Goodnight
2	I'm AAAAAALWAAAYYS like that! the reason why my entire life isn't watching movies is that I know I get too attached and carried away by them
1	Sort of, I like to put a show/ song on that compliments my mood 
1	ALL. THE. TIME.
1	Literally did this last week. One of the first times I felt like I could actually ask that we not watch something because I knew I'd have a hard time fitting in that much compassion when I already felt like shit. Ended up renting A Star is Born because everyone was going on about it...should've read the synopsis first.
1	Oh my gosh, all the time. There are certain songs that are pretty meaningful to me, or that just evoke strong emotions, and I actually avoid them like the plague cos the feels are just too strong. Same for shows. Me and my husband have been watching Gotham and it hit a point where, between the dark themes and my own tiredness, I was like, "Let's just drop this one for a few weeks, k?" :P
1	Only 3 songs do this for me and they're all for very similar reasons, Nana by The 1975 because god fucking damn it kills me, Somewhere Over The Rainbow (The Wizard of Oz version) because it was played at my grandma's funeral, and Party In The U.S.A by Miley Cyrus because I was playing that song when I found out she died. 
1	I just realized, this is why I almost ALWAYS choose comedies 99.9% of the time when I have the chance to watch Netflix or other shows/movies with friends.  \n\nAnything else is too exhausting, I just want to laugh and escape the feels for two hours, DAMMIT!
5	I think I might be ENTP...?	I always seriously identified with you guys...I'm spontaneous...have 20 tabs open at the same time usually, fall for people in the course of 5 minutes...cry at movies...cry in general...all that jazz...I love helping people...I love memes and stuff like that...\n\nBut my friend told me she thinks I'm more of an ENTP because of my quick wit, my love to just sort of be dominant and my love of arguing...and my ability to manipulate people if I want to.\n\nI've always been good at manipulating people...which is a bad thing. I wouldn't say I'm a sociopath because I definitely have morals and I don't do immoral things just for the sake of personal gain or being immoral, but that doesn't stop the fact that I can manipulate people if I want to.\n\nThe other thing is that I love arguing. I can argue about literally anything simply for the purpose of arguing...I will also plow through peoples arguments with no regards to feelings if their argument has nothing to back it up. I will call out someone using appeals to emotions or basing arguments simply on emotion by presenting facts, even if it offends them and makes them hate me...I only feel bad after but during the time, I get so heated that I just don't give a flying fuck.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also think the world is doomed and there's no hope for my kids or anyone else simply because humanity is headed down the drain and soon we'll live in an orwellian state. I'm also conservative which I heard isn't common for NFs...\n\nI'm also UBER competitive about almost everything.\n\nI don't know which I am...
3	You could be an ENTP enneagram 2.\n\nWhich sounds like a cool combo to me.
2	This is making me doubt myself too. I always typed as an ENFP (except once as INFP when I was pretty down) but the things you describe sound just like me. I love arguing, but not in the mean way or not even to be right. I just like debating things, seeing different sides of stuff, people talking passionately about how they see the world. It really activates me and brings me to life.  I've also been told a lotttt that I'm pretty dominant in general, even during internship where I was told to "know my place" I'd still bring up new ideas and fresh thoughts into the workplace, to dismay of some colleagues. I'm also a master manipulator IF I want to, which is almost never the case. I used to manipulate a lot for personal gain, especially as a teen. I knew what people wanted to hear but I'd twist just a little here and there, tell the whole truth but just present it slightly differently etc.. So if people would go asking others about things I told them, they'd get a near identical story so they wouldn't question the small details. I was pretty "evil" back then and dark, consumed by emotions and pretty selfish. I grew out of it thankfully. Now I still use those but on a very small scale, like during job interviews or internships, I'm horribly good at lying too. I know exactly what people want to hear and I can talk passionately about things I literally give 0 fucks about. I never do it with friends and family though. I just couldn't do that to people I love. And if I do manipulate, it has no negative consequences for anyone. It's just to make me look better so I'd have a better chance at getting a job or passing an internship. I'm also extremely competitive when it comes to something I want to win, like seriously get out of my way or you'll get hurt and I will be a very sore loser.
2	I was always an ENTP when I took tests, but now I'm fairly confident I'm actually an ENFP.  I'm a sales rockstar so you're talk about manipulating people registers... but I like to say I'm persuasive because I just lead people to a decision that's mutually beneficial.\n\nDo I have a point?  No.
1	Read these and see if they apply more.\n\nhttps://www.sociotype.com/socionics/types/IEE-ENFp/  This is Socionics description that corresponds  to MBTI's ENFP\n\nhttp://www.sociotype.com/socionics/types/ILE-ENTp/ This is Socionics description that corresponds to MBTI's ENTP\n\n* Note Socioics Introvert Types are different than MBTI Introvert types, due to the "naming scheme" a person strong in Ni and Te such as myself would be called INTp / ILI in Socionics and INTJ in MBTI.  This is because both are based off Jung and both are 16 type theories but they never synchorized their grammar when they were developed independently.  (Socionics is Russian MBTI developed in the 1980s to today, MBTI is American 16 type theory developed in the 1950s to today but it didn't really become anything close to it is now till the 1960s with other people like Harold Grant and so on.)\n\n-----\n\nI bring this up for to tell an ENFP and ENTP apart you need to figure out which of these are more applicable.\n\nENFP has 4D Fe and it is unvalued for 3D Fi is priortized.  ENFPs love Fe but Fi is a more stable outlet of energy^(longterm) so it is prioritized.\n\n* ENTPs conversly have 2D Fe but it is valued over Fi which is only 1D.  Fi is still important to an ENTP but it is learned through experience, while ENFPs like to play with their Fi in order to balance their priorties and figure out what to focus on.  Fi is a game not for a sake of being a game, but Fi is still a game for figuring out the game to an ENFP is like having a compass that was spinning wildly and beating that game's level will suddenly make the Compass point in the right direction.  (Yes this is a Pirates of the Carribean metaphor, even though Jack Sparrow is an ENTP and he needs an external magic totem to access his Fi, but with ENFPs that compass is built inside them as a super-power.  Instead they need an external map, an external Ti map to help them figure out how to use their compass.)\n\n---\n\n^(Skips writting more trying to be brief, but feel free to ask me questions for I have more to say but I am not sure if its useful, but if you give me questions aka context I can tell you useful things.)
1	Well I'm also quick witted and love to argue and a good manipulator, but I'm 100% enfp, this Fi that I cannot get rid of :( I wish I didn't have. 
1	I'm the same, but don't think I'm an ENTP. I think that people tend to focus on the shinier, happier part of ENFPs, but that's not all there is to everyone, haha. I really liked this [ENFP video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7EHubtwH44) for that.\n\nI enjoy a good debate as well, and have to make sure I reign in my tongue sometimes. I've actually always had a sharp tongue when it comes to confrontations of any kind, cos I get straight to the point and don't beat around the bush, and it can come off harshly. I also care less about people's feelings when the topic is something I care a lot about, or something that's caused me or someone I care about a lot of grief. I really love to test out my ideas and enjoy hearing other viewpoints as well, in friendlier debate/discussion settings :P\n\nI'm not super competitive in general, but in certain cases I can be. I feel bad if I win at Monopoly (possibly cos I grew up poor so taking everyone's wealth hits a nerve with me). I sometimes find being competitive in itself to be fun.... almost like a performance, haha. But if we're playing Risk - then, all bets are off and I WILL destroy you.\n\nAlso, re: the conservative values, I noticed a lot of sources, and a lot of people, tend to go from "general cognitive preferences" to inferring values - like, "ENFPs are great at getting into other people's shoes, & care about people easily, therefore they always have left-leaning politics and values" - which is just such a leap it bothers me immensely even to type it out, haha. It's a huge stretch with a super shaky foundation.\n\nBut yeah, we're all the same type but not necessarily all the same. As ENFPs we may have broadly similar preferences & patterns for interacting with the world, but we also each have our own unique experiences that contribute to our personality, values, & behaviour.
1	You legit just described me from every reason I've doubted my ENFP status down to being a conservative and everything XD personality twins? Haha
0	Can't deal with emotionally immature people and they tend to be ENFP's. üôÑ	There's about 5 other ENFP's in my life, two of them are my sister in law and mother and they are the most kind, loyal, and emotionally supportive people ever. \n\nThen I have about 3 other ENFP kind-of-friends (I say kind of, because they're so flakey, we could never consistantly hang out and build a true friendship) and they're seriously the most annoying people to me. \n\nLike... They're so emotional immature, they can't deal with things like an adult, no loyalty, always cancelling plans, and when I fuck up and life turns to shit they don't stick around like a true friend, but go to a "happy vibes" crowd because they're uncomfortable or have a better offer. \n\nI dunno. I'm a hard core ENFP, but for some reason, this disloyalty really grinds my gears. I guess as an ENFP, I highly value deep human connection, trust and loyalty to another soul more than anything. And I have an immense amount of patience for others because I just want to connect with them long term. \n\nBut this flakey behaviour seems counter-intuitive and I see right through it. 
14	"Everything that irritates us about others can lead us to an understanding of ourselves." - Carl Jung 
5	Now I already did a post and it was kind of cryptic and thus not very helpful.  It was not meant to be helpful but revelatory.  To better understand the revelation I recommend you read more about your Inferior Function for Inferior Si is what is annoying you so much.  (Also Trickster Se, the other form of Sensing, but ENFPs can forgive trickster Se until they see a pattern and they then forget about the Sequences of events and focus on the pattern.)\n\nYour Inferior Function can also be called\n\n* Anima and Animus Function\n\n* Aspirationial and Projective / Projection function.\n\n* Suggestive and Dual-Seeking\n\nNow each of these 3 bullet points are different authors describing different types of relationships you can have with your projective and turns out they are all true, for with our inferior it is a very flexibile function and thus your relationship type can be "present" one moment and "absent" another, where what is present changes each time.\n\nI recommend this book.\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Was-That-Really-Me-Personality/dp/0891061703\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis is because your Inferior Function helps you use your Leading / Dominant function better, getting the two of these things at the same time and in bite size chunks helps stabilize your life and you do not have to self-supply your energy all the time, it is so much easier to be self reliant but also more available to others.\n\nYou are complaining about ***how inconsistent others are, how you can't rely on them, how you can't trust them***, this in turn makes it harder to be the ***best version of yourself*** for all your efforts, all your endeavors, all your suffering towards a greater goal (that will pay off in the long run and is worth a small amount of pain when it is paid back), is dashed due to the inconsistency.\n\nAnd the worse thing is besides being extremely annoying to all types, but to an EN_P the EN_P finds it so easy to imagine it not being this way, just change a small amount of details, a phone call at the right time, and so on and things would enter the ideal state instead of being dashed on the rocks.\n\nThe right type of Si is like a lighthouse for an ENFP, the Si allows the ENFP to always return safely to home, to explore the seas.  Quotes John Augustus Shield\n\n>A ship in harbor is safe /\n\n>but that is not what ships are built for.
1	Avoiding someone for some time	Hi ENFP‚Äôs! Question here...\nI‚Äôm 26F INTJ and my friend and colleague is a 26M ENFP. He avoided and ignored me for 2 weeks and didn‚Äôt respond to my direct questions if something was wrong. He was busy moving so I thought he might be distracted but he did seem to be himself around others.\nAt some point everything was suddenly back to normal. Another colleague pointed out we are so close we seem like a couple sometimes and came up with the theory that he might think I have a crush and he backed out. My mother came up with the theory he might have a sudden crush on me and backed out. But that was before everything went back to normal.\n\nWould you do this (ignore/avoid someone for some time) and why?
2	Yeah but when I was young and immature. I have a bad avoidance habit. Ask him about it.
2	Possibly he needed time to think and process things. We do that a lot.
1	I have an enfp friend sometimes she takes hours to respond, I think sometimes she doesn't see what I send her, and she told me once that she sees what people send her, she just responds later. Maybe that enfp is ignoring you, idk it's a possibility.
1	But enfps can definitely avoid and ignore I think.
1	Ignore and avoid depends, I couldn't say for sure if it's an enfp thing though there are more factors than type, just ask
369	Probably not exclusive to ENFPs, but I felt this alot, and I feel you guys will too haha	
37	This reminds me of the first time I went to an onsen (japanese bath). Our boss was always generous and wanted us to experience japanese culture during our stay so he thought it would be nice to treat us to one. We felt like it was rude to decline the offer so we just went.\n\nI was nervous but not as nervous as my friend. We both had anxiety but she was way more wound up than I was. More socially awkward etc. We were the only foreigners in the womens bath. Naturally, we received a couple of stares. But aside from that they were cool. I just said fuck it and stripped while chatting my friend up, not mentioning our nakedness, to ease her anxiety. She did the same shortly afterward.\n\nI have to say it was the one of the most liberating things i have done. And i'm glad i was able to make her experience it, too. (Common baths are not a thing where we come from)
23	Damn that really hits. Also when it comes to talking to strangers when I'm with friends VS when I'm alone ahah
21	My friends ate mostly introverted. So around them I'm considered the designated extrovert and I'm unstoppable
8	Ahhh yes, I am familiar with the mom friend loophole. 
8	I would never call myself motherly. I‚Äôm more the ‚Äúcool aunt‚Äù type. But heck yeah this is me in mom mode. Had a friend fall and get hurt in a haunted house once and instantly put all my fear aside to calmly ask the next monster where the emergency exit was.\n\nMonster: arggggggggh!\n\nMe: yeah hi! I just have a question! My friend fell and hurt her ankle and we‚Äôd like to get her our ASAP. Which way do we go?\n\nMonster: uhh... you can go to the right out that door\n\nMe: great thanks!
7	I never related to something more. I think it‚Äôs kinda because I play the role that needs to be played. Like if I realize that I have the most dominant personality in a group then I feel obligated to be the leader. \n\nI can‚Äôt do shit for myself but if I feel like I‚Äôm the most capable or confident in that moment then my confidence is amplified.\n\nFor example I usually take the back seat in social interactions with my finesse god friends but when I‚Äôm with my more awkward friends I behave in the exact same way as the friends that I normally take the back seat too. 
3	Yep unstoppable if we‚Äôre looking out for someone else. 
2	Yes why is this üòÇüòÇ
2	My bro has really bad social anxiety and I'm not great either but it led to me being the one to make all his purchases for his right up until I moved away for college.... and then his girlfriend had to step in. He's not as bad now though but my mom friend instincts probably prevented him from learning it wasn't so bad much earlier üò¨
2	YES IT IS SO WEIRD. The moment I need to do it for someone else, I have the full confidence and assertiveness to do it. Why is this?\n\nThis also happens when I need to do an emergency thing for someone, like a speech last minute because someone can‚Äôt do it, I just feel great about it.\n\nIt‚Äôs so wild how people oriented I am.
1	Omgoodness all of this.. 
1	I can relate to all of this soo much 
1	My two best friends are INTPs and one of them is really really shy and whenever we‚Äôre at a bar and she wants another drink I am ON IT. 
1	So accurate
1	That‚Äôs because it has less to do with anxiety and more to do with how much you value yourself and view your own worth as opposed to how you view it for others. Yes... even for ketchup.
1	I'm INFP and the same! Like Courage the Cowardly Dog haha 
1	\nOmg why is this so true.
1	First time a post on this sub just hits me so hard. I actually never noticed I do this until now and damn, that's so true. 
1	Also reminds me of my friend who called me to ask for a favor to kill a roach in her room (which is what I'm super terrified of). 
1	Yes, I'm normally so afraid of bugs, anything creepy crawly, but when there is someone who is more scared than me, you bet I will deal with the bug with my bare hands. It's quite the adrenaline rush. Protector mode on. 
5	Tattoos	How do you guys feel about them?
3	I got 14 of them, most are kinda big, legs are almost full. I want to be covered eventually except for my hands, neck, boobs and private parts.
1	I‚Äôm blasted up 
1	They hurt but I just can't help myself
1	I think they're pretty cool. I like asking people about their tattoos, but I don't have any myself. No plans to get any either, though that could change in the future.
1	41yo, made my first tatoo 2 months ago: pirate smile on the right middle finger.\nAlways fascinated by tatoos, but my focus on having open options has stopped me doing so.\nNow I‚Äôm planning to make other 2: on the neck (a letter) and on a leg (dancing Tony Manero üï∫)
1	Love them! Getting more soon!\n\nEdit: I should elaborate... yes they are committing, but it's just a way to tell a story about yourself. If you're always getting an image of something that authentically resonates, then that will always be a meaningful part of you regardless of what your future self will think.  \n\nI have a couple of tattoos from when I was 18 that I wouldn't get now, but I don't regret them. It's where I came from, and I'm happy to carry the whole truth about myself, right on my skin.  \n\nPlus, I was get something that I designed or cared myself, which aids this idea even more. 
1	Tats are great, but I don‚Äôt care for the ones on people‚Äôs faces, haha. I have one, hope to get another, but I can‚Äôt seem to get the image in my head on paper.
43	Triggereddd	
8	Today I just bought two books about this. One was about how to be more charismatic and one on how to make people feel happy and comfortable around you.
7	why would you attack me like this in my own home?
2	Relatable. I've got a giant box of self improvement and business books lol. 
2	What‚Äôs with the random good boii? üòÑ
1	How do you know it.
1	Ahh so that's an ENFP thing hahaha
1	i'm feeling v attacked rn\n\n&#x200B;
11	Russian Doll on Netflix	Has anyone else seen this series yet?\n\nIt is how I view life. Every connection has a universe of implications associated with it. Everyone means something. No one is of no consequence.\n\nI resonated deeply with both the male and female main characters. There was messaging both about how we deal with our upbringing as children as well as how that translates to adulthood.\n\nA lot of feels right now. Honestly I just really enjoyed it and would love to know how fellow ENFPs feel about it. 
2	I have similar views as you stated, loved the show!
1	Sounds interesting. This goes right onto my list. 
1	that sounds good, maybe I'll check it out.   \n\n\nThe universe of connections and implications bit made me think of one of my favourite shows, which seemed a very ENFP show to me, which is Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency (and by "seems ENFP" I mean I saw it and thought they made a TV show out of my soul, haha). 
13	ADHD does not = ENFP	There was a post a few days ago about ADHD = ENFP. I don't think so. I think many people with ADHD read the Ne description and the ENFP description and think they are ENFP. And some people with ENFP think they have ADHD when it is just Ne. There are certainly ENFP's with ADHD, but that applies to every type too.\n\nMaybe it's because I'm a mature ENFP (32) and have developed my Fi and Te a lot and Si. But I don't identify with the lack of attention span. I have great attention span and I use it to gather up all the new information I can take in constantly. I will give up on projects often but after working on them for quite a while. And I come back to them. I am not loud and hyper either. Maybe when I was a little kid but not since then.
6	Yeah, basically ADHD = not able to focus / ENXP = not wanting/preferring to focus\n\nDifference is whether you have the choice or not. People dont get this, lol.
3	I agree, I've never had a problem with focusing. Yes, we are easily distracted when something more interesting comes along, but it's not an ADHD thing.
3	I probably am both, but is is really hard to discern between the two. Sometimes I am scared I dont have adhd and that I am just an enfp.\n\nI got officially diagnosed with adhd, but the people who diagnosed me did not know about cognitive functions. What if they misidentified my symptoms? \n\nThis frustrates me quite often, the uncertainty.
3	I am both, and I agree that they are absolutely different things. But yes, ADHD may lead people to skew towards Ne-leading types that might not actually be the basis of their personality - and I do believe there's an overrepresentation of ENFP/ENTP ADHD folks that may be due to this mistyping.
2	Just pointing out though that the childhood ADHD and adult ADHD are not expressed the same way. ‚ÄúLoud and hyper‚Äù are more associated with childhood ADHD. \nBut I mean I agree with you that not every ENFP has ADHD.
2	Thank you for saying this. \n\nThinly made associations between MBTI and mental illnesses are the types of posts that make me want to rip my hair out.\n\nI used to be an admin on a forum a number of years ago that had a mental illness section and let me tell you, asking a bunch of strangers on the internet if you have a mental illness is the worst thing you could possibly do. Think you have a mental illness? Go see a psychiatrist who can properly assess what‚Äôs going on. Casually trying to label yourself (or a group of people for that matter) with mental illness just because certain traits that are present seem similar is as bad as going on WebMD, looking up symptoms and thinking you have some rare disease or disorder.
1	As a person who is both, the crossover is impeccable. Of course I am alot different when medicated and am not sure if I even qualify as an ENFP well on medication.
1	I think each MBTI skews towards some disorder.\n\nYou could say INFP share a lot of traits with your classic depressos and ISTJ share similar traits to autistic people, or ESTJ are narcassitic.\n
6	Out of 16 types, 8 are light and 8 are dark. ENFPs are one of the 8 light types:	
8	I get used to seeing unscientific self-congratulatory posts here, but this one is in a league on its own. Am I the only one who feels it‚Äôs almost hurtful to denounce half of the types as dark/amoral?
1	**Join me with the dark side and together we can rule the galaxy!**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso this post is a lot of BS

1	Around what age did you yourself notice that you developed extraverted thinking (Te)?	How did you know? 
7	When I finally stopped wondering whether 5 and 9 were sad or happy numbers and decided that I don't want to fail calculus. 
5	When I realized I needed better friends... \n\nFor me, that was 18. But I've felt that surge of extroversion at several points in my life, usually when I needed new people. \n\n18: college\n\n23: moved to a new city\n\n32: needed to get out of a bad relationship
3	Pretty late, only since this year I think so I would have been 24,5 years old. I did possess some of the qualities already, but being more open minded, use more logic and seeing things from different points (and accept them) developed in the last few months.
2	I was ... 12 I think? well... no, maybe earlier. The thing is, I started telling stories I made up on the spot for my friends to go to bed more easily when I was 9ish. That laid the foundation for me :/
1	Honestly? Probably not till late 20's. I've become a lot more assertive and confident. I feel more action-oriented. More able to control my own life. I feel mature, not constantly in a Ne or Fi state.
1	Probably at 19 and 20, with several shattered changes in my world's views and mental stability. I was much more secure in who I am afterward.
11	Hopeless infatuations with people who dont like you back	I guess I need help. I am hopelessly infatuated with someone who is clearly not interested or unavailable or both. Point is my feelings arent being reciprocated. And here I am day dreaming about this person, And beating myself up for doing that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am in a lot of pain. It hurts. I wanna destroy my feelings with fire. I have tried so hard to be over him but its not working. He's a classmate for a class that I really need to take so I can't avoid him. We are friends so we sit together so if I started avoiding him completely in a class this small everyone would notice. I am just in a lot of pain and I am suffering.  \n\n\nThis is a cry for help. Someone please advice me on how I can move on from this. 
6	It's a problem us INFJs face on the regular as well. If I ever figure out how to move on, I'll let you know. All I can offer is my solidarity.
2	Hm, I think it could help to realise more strongly that it's an infatuation. I don't know what your definition of it is, but it's borderline to obsession. It's less related to genuine feelings, and more to a compulsive desire to want them or to be with them. I used to have this too but I grew out of it I guess. Even when I have very strong feelings, I can somewhat control them by being realistic and confronting myself with the truth. With some people it's harder than others, but eventually you will get over them and you have to keep that in mind. This feeling won't last forever.\n\nBut if you haven't confessed yet, it can't hurt to do so. Even if he rejects you and you see him every day, you will have your answer and stop torturing yourself. I think it's the "not knowing" that eats you up the most. Just get it out of the way so you can finally move on.

1	You may just have to wait for him... \n\nI know we crave instant-passionate-extreme-blazing-fire-that-nearly-kills-us-love-stories, but he may be slowly crawling towards the idea of you. In the meantime, be a great friend :) \n\n&#x200B;
1	Why does it matter if you avoid him and other people notice? This is about your needs, who cares what people think?
1	How long has it been since you‚Äôve realized your feelings weren‚Äôt reciprocated? Just curious. \n\nIf he 100% clearly stated in some way that he doesn‚Äôt feel the same, take a moment to step back and look at things objectively. \n\nKnow that moving on will take time but you‚Äôll get there. Try not to fantasize about him suddenly reciprocating your feelings.\nRemember you deserve someone who will love and appreciate you as much as you do, to them. \n\nTry to remember the bright side...maybe this didn‚Äôt work out bc the world has someone else waiting for you to join their journey in life in the future! \n\nSure it hurts now...but ask yourself...will this REALLY matter in a couple years? Will you still be that hurt? \n\nIn the meantime, hang out with some different friends in your spare time...meet new people, find an interest/hobby that makes you happy, and soon enough you won‚Äôt even be pining/suffering anymore. \n\nIt‚Äôs okay to be sad, just don‚Äôt be hard on yourself. \nI‚Äôm assuming you know a lot of great people in general but might not want to date them...this is a good way to remember that sometimes rejections aren‚Äôt really about US. You are still a great person, but maybe not the best match for him...this doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre not amazing!! \n\nBest of luck...you‚Äôll get there...it‚Äôs just a matter of time and riding it out.  :)
1	Keep going for him until he breaks down from your sheer force of persistence OR you understand the pain you feel is all your responsibility then you get the freedom to get any guy you want.\n\nHarsh but true.
0	I can so relate to this, jesus... last 5 months... pain and bitter disappointment... neither I don't know what to do in this situation...\n\nWe just have to live it through and hope for the best I guess
2	ENFPs and communicating/texting/planning	Hi ENFPs! I‚Äôm an INFP (F, 21) seeing an ENFP (M, 21) and I have a question. \n\nThings are going well between us. We met only 3 weeks ago, but we are moving pretty fast, and have been very open and emotionally honest with each other from the beginning. When we‚Äôre together, it‚Äôs always great, whether we‚Äôre having deep conversations or just watching TV. However, he sucks at texting and planning. He sometimes will send me a text checking in, and then not answer for hours or even until the next day. Somtimes he will ask me to hang out, and then be constantly delaying until we finally get together a couple hours later. He has told me that he‚Äôs better at expressing himself in person than over text. He‚Äôs very busy with work and socializing, so I know that he‚Äôs always distracted. He has also told me that he overcommits himself to activities and people. At the beginning, I was very anxious that he wasn‚Äôt interested, and that‚Äôs why he was bad at keeping in touch with me and keeping up with plans. But as the relationship progresses, he makes it clear that he‚Äôs very interested while we‚Äôre together. But still, when apart, he‚Äôs very distant. We still talk every day, so maybe I‚Äôm overreacting, but I want to understand why he goes MIA for hours at a time.  \n\nCan any ENFPs give insight? Do you think he‚Äôs honestly just busy and doesn‚Äôt care to text when he has things going on? Or should I be worried that he doesn‚Äôt think enough about me to care to answer a text? 
2	I've noticed when things are going 'well' and 'better than expected' sometimes I have taken those people and things for granted.\n\nExample, I'll text someone - have an amazing interaction, feel great about our relationship - then forget to text back until an hour later.  I think it's actually a sign for me that relationship is going well, because I used to get caught up in the moment to moment stuff or what's not going well and focused my energies on that.\n\nBasically, I wouldn't worry about it, but feel free to bring it up with him and be like hey text me back already doofus!  It's not so significant.
1	This is me in a nutshell, when me and my SO of 4 years started dating she said she had the same thoughts, meanwhile I was madly in love with this girl but just sucked at texting and organising plans! \n\nI would say don‚Äôt worry ! He‚Äôs probably keen :)
1	"always distracted" is the thing to remember here. Please don't take it personally. If he's making time for you, even if he's late, he's very interested.
