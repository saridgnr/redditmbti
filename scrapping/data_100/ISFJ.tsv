128	ISFJ Handling Care and Manual	This manual is part of a series of guides originated by [**@intpboard**](https://tmblr.co/mTyOnXogUfFjTIpM_yekL2A)**!**  \n\n**Congratulations!** You have come under the care of your very own ISFJ unit, probably because you needed help with a task and they needed an excuse to procrastinate.  They have offered you this manual in a simple attempt to assist you.  You should be pleased that they have chosen you to benefit from their helpful nature!\n\n**Your ISFJ unit will come equipped with the following accessories:**\n\nOne (1) large cup of coffee (refillable)\n\nFour (4) extra jackets to give you if you are cold\n\nTwo (2) semi-fancy outfits\n\nThree (3) casual outfits, one of which they strongly prefer\n\nOne (1) calendar to keep track of important dates\n\nOne (1) coffeepot, for refilling coffee cup\n\nThree (3) grandiose, altruistic life paths\n\nOne (1) large dog\n\nInfinite (∞) support, patience, work ethic, and enthusiasm\n\n**Software:**\n\nYour ISFJ will come preprogrammed with the following traits:\n\n**Si:** Your ISFJ will often be preoccupied with thoughts about the world and people around them, and may zone out during these times.  Don’t be alarmed – this is normal.  They are just gathering information about their surroundings, processing their impressions, and filing everything away in our vast internal filing cabinet. Disturbing them during this process will often result in blank stares and confusion.\n\n**Fe:** This trait is activated only when necessary, following the processing phase. After your ISFJ has updated the filing cabinet with the gathered information, you will find them very interactive, friendly, and helpful! They contain a special chip which makes them particularly intuitive and responsive to all your feelings and needs, as well as overly willing to assist you in anything you may need. When making decisions, will first consider the needs of other people and the impact of the decision on them and others. \n\n**Ti:** Occasionally, instead of Fe following the processing phase, your ISFJ will need to withdraw and spend time deeply analyzing the information gained.  This trait allows them to balance their people pleasing side with their analytical side. Occassionally enjoys puzzle games or analyzing the information we have learned through Si. Form an inner logical framework of how the world works. \n\n**Ne:** The weakest trait of the ISFJ, Ne works with Fe to prod the ISFJ into trying new things.  It is also responsible for their occasional bursts of creative ideas and plans! However, it is only able to activated for fleeting periods of time; pushing an ISFJ too far out of their comfort zone for too long will cause them to revert to the withdrawn, silent behavior that characterizes their original information-gathering mode.\n\n**Getting Started:**  \n\n\nWhen you first start up your ISFJ, do not be alarmed by their silence! The first stage of ISFJ programming requires distant observation, which allows them to gather information about their surroundings!\n\n1. Place included cup of coffee in your ISFJ’s hand.\n\n2. Set them on a bench in a busy location.\n\n3. Allow your ISFJ to charge by observing details about the situation.\n\n4. If step 3 does not work, place included dog on leash and hand leash to ISFJ; Fe mode should trigger when ISFJ is approached about dog.\n\n5. If your ISFJ still doesn’t start, announce a task with which you need assistance.\n\n**Modes:**\n\n*Selfless Giver (default)* – In this mode, ISFJs will jump at any opportunity to help others, regardless of their own schedule or plans.  They will never complain about this type of service.  Even if they do not want to help you, they will – regardless of any inconvenience it may cause them.  Taking advantage of this mode too often will result in an unhealthy ISFJ that will shut down in response to future requests.\n\n*Nature Lover* \- Activated when outside in nature settings.  ISFJs love nature, particularly the solitude and silence they can find there.  This allows them to process information without the interference of additional information.  They are likely to bring you outside with them, in an effort to help you silence your mind as well – even if this is not your idea of fun, please be patient. They are just trying to help you.\n\n*Humble* \- Activated in response to any type of praise.  ISFJs prefer to downplay their own accomplishments, as they are uncomfortable with overwhelming praise.  This often results in their successes being claimed by others, which upsets the balance of the ISFJ and often triggers Clowning mode to hide anger and disappointment.\n\n*Observer* \- Activated in busy situations/places. Your ISFJ will be content to sit back and watch the action around them.  Although they will be lightly conversational, attempting to engage them more deeply will not be successful – they are too busy processing their surroundings.\n\n*Clowning* \- ISFJs are prone to self-deprecating jokes. They use this as a defense mechanism to hide their emotions. A shield of laughter is the best defense of all! To this end, they also find joy in puns, wordplay, and any unique jokes. Their sense of humor never ceases to surprise, so try not to be taken aback!  Activated most often around NF units.\n\n**Relationships with other units:**\n\n**NFs**: ISFJs have very close relationships with NFs, because they are both concerned with the care and well-being of the other.  The ISFJ also often balances the NF, who prefers an “outside the box” way of thinking to the more traditional views of the ISFJ.  NFs can also be too demanding of the ISFJ – they need to know when to let up or they will burnout their ISFJ unit.\n\n**NTs**: NTs have a very strong drive and work ethic that the ISFJ greatly admires; in return, the NT admires the way ISFJs care so deeply for others.  This is a relationship that can produce a lot of mutual respect.  However, NTs are far more logical than ISFJs, who are more focused on emotions, and this can cause friction.\n\n**SJs**: ISFJs get along very well with other SJs.  They are both responsible and trustworthy, as well as equally willing to take care of one another.  This creates a nurturing environment for the ISFJ that is very important for their health and security.\n\n**SPs**: SPs are fun loving and carefree, capable of assisting an ISFJ with big plans, ideas, or experiences triggered by the Fe trait. However, the SP must recognize that the ISFJ has a limit and be respectful of that – if not, their wild, impetuous nature can quickly wear down an ISFJ.\n\n**Feeding:**\n\nWhen busy, an ISFJ will often forget that food is necessary. This is especially true when engrossed in a project that will help others or while bringing one of their ideas/adventures to life.  To properly care for an ISFJ, you must feed them at least once a day.  If they are resistant to stopping long enough to eat, tell them you are feeling hungry and allow them the option of preparing (or paying for) the meal – their overly kind nature will override their natural enthusiasm for work and in making sure you are fed, they will feed themselves as well.\n\n**Grooming:**\n\nYour ISFJ will groom on a regular basis, as it never knows when it will be called away to help someone else.  They will always keep themselves clean and their appearance tidy – they never want to call too much attention to themselves, so they groom and dress in a way that allows them to blend in.  You will not need to monitor this function for your unit, and you should leave it to the ISFJ to take care of at all times; insinuating that your ISFJ is untidy in any way will cause them to feel offended and could result in total shut down until you apologize.\n\n**Sleeping:**\n\nYour ISFJ unit will sleep regularly, as being well rested is necessary to support the enthusiasm with which they approach their day (whether their day is at school, at work, or being with others).  Despite this, they often need naps or a large amount of caffeine to keep running in Selfless Giver mode – this mode drains their energy very quickly.\n\n**Frequently Asked Questions:**\n\n*How do I get my ISFJ to relax and take a break?*\n\nYou don’t!  ISFJ’s are not capable of “relaxing” in the traditional sense.  During their dormant periods, their brains are still rapidly processing and filing information.  The word “relax” is foreign to them and will confuse them if mentioned too often.\n\n*Help! I lost my ISFJ!*\n\nDon’t worry!  ISFJs often need a break to recharge by going into one of the aforementioned dormant periods. They will reappear shortly!  If it has been more than six hours, brew a pot of coffee and wait.  The smell of coffee should bring your ISFJ out of dormancy.\n\n*My ISFJ does not like to try new things?  What do I do?*\n\nISFJ units come with a preinstalled love of habit and familiarity. Attempting to change too much at once can lead to a complete crash if you are not careful!  To deal with this, introduce your ISFJ to new situations, places, and people very gently.  Be patient and they will adjust in time.  Their Fe and Ne traits will also occasionally activate and push them into trying something new – make sure you take their lead and do not over stimulate them. This will cause them to withdraw into dormancy and will require additional coffee to fix.\n\n**Again, congratulations on your newly acquired ISFJ helper unit!**\n\n(Thank you to [@effervescience](https://tmblr.co/mulTdDRdyBpmpzy0ALBX1BA) for all of her help in researching and writing this guide!  
9	This is great. Have you made other guides?
10	Omg this is so nice:-)

I think ISFJs are beasts at scrabble because of their wordplay talent.\n\n&#x200B;
6	Awesome, thanks for sharing
5	Thanks for sharing 
4	I've never seen a topic like this but it's quite fun and interesting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFeel free to unpin my other topic so you can keep this pinned since this is essentially a more creative version of it and we only have 2 topics that can be pinned at a time.
3	I love this omg! It's so cute, haha.
3	Love it! Would you do a ISFP one bychance OP?
3	Mine doesn't go outside, but also I live in a cold country. Is she broken? 
3	Oh my god this is literally my little sister, she's such an ISFJ! 😂 I'm going to show this to her, she'll appreciate it! 
2	very accurate, and I really find this guide cute and interesting !! 
2	Whoa... Did you write my personality coding??? O.o\n\nReally good write up! :)
2	As an ISFJ... Maybe i should try coffee. The NT and NF reactions are incredibly valid. I've read the other versions of this and think they're all great. 
2	"If it has been more than six hours, brew a pot of coffee and wait.  The smell of coffee should bring your ISFJ out of dormancy." \n\nreally hit the nail on the head with this one.
2	OMG, this is so cute and accurate 😍😆. Thank you for programming me 😂😂
3	‘Selfless Giver’ too true, thank you ISFJs, it’s much appreciated :)
1	Love this. Great job. :) 
1	Dogs and coffee and nature ✅
1	This is so cute and informative! It makes me feel like I'm cute 😜
1	This is the cutest. Love so much ❤️❤️
1	I love this! I hope I find someone who would want to read this Manual about taking care of me. 😆
1	this was one of the most genuine posts I've seen regarding mbti! \n\nThank you, I think I now understand ISFJs a lot better now =D
17	Do we want structured, scheduled posts ie weekly/daily/weekend threads?	So u/kjeezy0127 and I have done some themed threads, and I did a few weekend threads but forgot to keep up with them. But if there's interest from the community, I'll set reminders in my phone so that I remember to post things.\n\nA few questions:\n\n1. What would you like to see? Daily/weekly/weekend/a combination?\n\n2. What would you like them to be about? Generic topics/specific topics/current events?\n\n3. Any other feedback?\n\nThanks guys, just trying to get a feel for the community! Oh and I didn't talk to u/kjeezy0127 before posting this so feel free to weigh in, dude. xD
12	I'm not an ISFJ (narrowly) but am dating an ISFJ.  It'd be neat to see topics that help me understand some of the tendencies and preferences that may come with your type!  That might also draw other types into this sub who are interested in learning.\n\nOne thing that could be fun is a weekly/monthly ISFJ appreciation thread where us non-ISFJs praise the ISFJs in our life so you can all see that your actions are appreciated.  You'd probably have to build up a decent non-ISFJ subscriber base first, though.
7	I think something that could be cool is doing an ISFJ AMA here and advertise it on /r/mbti .\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhere people from that sub (non-ISFJs) can ask ISFJ questions on a sticky topic and maybe leave that open for a weekend or something.
4	Please do! I really like the weekly threads. Discussion threads where we can just talk about something or express our mood on overall the week would be wonderful. 
3	I’d appreciate anecdotes of how you ISFJ’s have taken advantage of your shadow functions. Stories are great. Really any kind of “aha” moments, esp your demon/trickster functions (my bf is an ISFJ, I’m INTP). \n\nAlso ways you have overridden Si-Ti loop either intentionally or accidentally. 
3	yes!
2	Yes I think weekend threads are good
2	Hey, there! Dropping in from r/entp. :) This looks like an interesting idea. I know r/infj has had success with their weekly threads. If you haven't already, you should check it out and maybe reach out to their mods.
2	oh jesus now the sensing coming into reddit noooo
1	I’m an ENTP who was just curious to know what the subreddit of the “opposite type” looked like, and I barely resisted the urge to click away as soon as I saw this question. It’s *so* anti-ENTP I’m getting almost physically sick imagining someone could find this kind of endeavor entertaining. Ouch. \n\n(P.S. My wife is an ISFJ, so there’s also a personal thing going on here...)
1	I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:\n\n- [/r/entp] [The most anti-ENTP question ever...](https://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/axltgd/the_most_antientp_question_ever/)\n\n&nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))*
4	[ENTP] What are the most important things to keep ISFJs happy in a relationship?	Female ENTP here, dating a lovely ISFJ man for a bunch of months now. He's a total sweetheart, and I make sure that he knows that I love and appreciate him. I make sure to treat him as well as I can, but I recognize that our types are vastly different, so I thought I'd ask here for tips on keeping my ISFJ happy. Thanks in advance!
2	What things does he do for you? People often will tell you how they would liked to be loved by how the express it. I am ISFJ(F) with and INTP(M). I prefer quality time. I want to have quality conversation. I want to feel like my INTP still finds me to.be interesting. Also the 5 live languages is helpful to figure out how he and you both prefer to be loved. 
2	Everyone is different but I just like to have a bit of time to myself. With one of my ex girlfriends before I knew it we were hanging out all weekend and most weeknights, it just got a bit too much for me. Also let him help you if he wants to don't just brush him off.
1	There was a great ISFJ guide I read from r/MBTI recently that I thought covered us quite well. I'll go look for it.
26	Does anyone else try to finish a thing but ends up starting 10 new things more?	Today I was so commited to finish a song, but when I was doing it, I came up with another song, and when I was composing it, something made me think about a new and very sad story to write and somehow I ended up crying in my bed thinking about life. is this the "P" in my personality? gosh I never finish anything and
5	I'm the same way. Am a musician too. Haven't released an album or EP in two years yet I have 100+ song files on logic from 2017-now. It makes me so mad. I just lose interest. Idk if it's ISFJ or my adhd.
2	Honestly, this is me, a little bit.  When it comes to work that needs to get done - like, you know, schoolwork - then I really will just get it done, even though I'll procrastinate a bit.  But when it comes to personal projects, things that don't have a deadline, this is always happening to me.  For example, I'm trying to write a story right now, right?  And so two days ago, I started with a document for my characters and their MBTI types (weird, I know, but I LOVE typing people and fictional characters, so I want to type my characters.)  I pretty much know their types, and I know what I want to write in that document, but it's like every time I start writing down things for those characters I suddenly have a hundred new ideas for more documents spurning.  I convince myself that having these documents down will help me prepare, but it's like this is slowly becoming a big procrastination thing, even though I'm not really *procrastinating.*  There have been a few times when I've deleted everything on my document because I looked it over and I was like, "Not good enough.  This could be better!"  I think it's the perfectionist in me, mixed in with the ideas that I'm urgent to get down.
1	Yes. Me too
1	Sounds much more like r/entp 😁

1	p starts for procrastination
1	Yes. Absolutely
7	[INTP]How to recognize ISFJ women and howthey flrt?	Hi INTP here. Wanted to know some common personality traits that ISFJ women share and how do they act around INTP men. Also,how do you know an ISFJ is into you and how to flirt with her?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTHANK YOU!!
11	On a serious note :p\n\nI can only speak for myself - I cannot flirt, especially if I like someone. I tend to tense up and clam up in their presence, I just pray that they will make a move. If I know them well, I do take initiative but I need to feel very comfortable and sure about them (which always takes ages). I also tend to take things slow, unless I am so madly in love but so sure that it subdues my fears. In some cases, I am just content to be madly in love from a distance (not really wishing to have a relationship or even talking to them any time soon)\n\nSo far, my experience with INTP man didn't really go any deeper than acquaintance level, and to tell the truth, I find him to be intimidating, unless he's in a light mood.. When we're into someone though, we tend to be 'regular' in caring after them - *have you done homework, do you need help,* remembering some things for you or about you that matter, doing things for you, etc.
3	She'll bring you cookies. Sure sign that she's imagining about having babies with you.
1	Hey man, INTP here.\n\nI've been dating my ISFJ for 2 years now.\nI had to take the lead in order for anything to happen, it was a slow process but i finally understood that she wasn't gonna give me the signs i needed. \n\nBoth types are not very good at communication so my best advice is, ask her for help with literally anything (i asked her for help with math, which i didin't really need help with, just needed an excuse). \n\nI guess flirting with an ISFJ is not necessary, just entertain her Ti child with your Ti hero (should be simple enough), keep in mind that they aren't very responsive so go nuts with your unrelenting mental fantasies. They also are much more comfortable with silence than we are so don't take silence as an Fe fuckup, it's probably just an Se trick (although im not too sure because idk wtf the world is and she dont talk so it dont help me).\n\nSo recap, flirting is overrated. Be yourself, don't expect much feedback and take the lead however uncomfortable that make you. (Nature dates are a plus)\n\nQuick edit: because Ti is first in our stack, ISFJs might feel a little lacking in thinking capability (like everyone else exept intjs), this is not real. They are quite smart, they just take much more time than we to make sure their thoughts are correct and well grounded in reality. Don't let that be a turnoff
11	Are you aware of how others perceive you?	I'd say that I definitely am aware of how other people perceive me.  I'm always conscious of the face that I'm making, how a person is reacting to me, and what other people "generally" think of me.  I know, on some level, what I can do to make someone like me more, or become friends with them, even though I don't always act on those thoughts.  It's often said that NFJ's are great at reading people, but I think as an ISFJ, I'm pretty good at reading people too, even though I do it differently.  I mostly read people when I want to figure out what they think about me, or if I'm interested in them and want to know them better.  \n\nSo, other ISFJ's: are you aware of what people think about you?
5	Kinda not related, but do you reckon you’re (ISFJs in general) good at reading people? 
5	I sometimes feel like I might be too self aware or sometimes irrational in the way people might think of me and my actions. I think I definitely worry abt it a bit too much, I like to think I don’t care and I’m pretty confident but sometimes I become concerned if I upset or annoyed the people around me even if I don’t necessarily like that person. 
3	I feel like I'm pretty good at reading people, like how they are feeling and if something is amiss. However when it comes to how they perceive me, I know vaguely if they hate/dislike/like/love me but not how they see me. A\n friend I've known since I was little told me how he perceived me & how people generally do. I was like "really??? Waat??" 
2	I am to an extent.. and can read people, to an extent.. \n\nBut it largely feels like I cannot truly read people, nor can I know what they are thinking and I also feel like I have not much control over how to change my own expression on my face.. 
2	yeah just as you say
2	Yeah I would say I'm pretty good at reading people's feelings and body language. 
2	I perceive "intuitively" i mean sometimes i get it right sometimes i get ot wrong
4	Thoughts on ESTJ's?	Fellow ISFJ's, what do you think of ESTJ's based on your personal experiences with them?  What have you observed about ESTJ's?  Have you found that you get along with them better than ENTJ's? 
11	I may act like I get along well with them but deep down they make me uncomfortable. They can act super moody/bossy and at the same time very structured which bugs me. I find them to be too competitive and they always think they can take advantage of me but I dont let them. They can be annoying especially when things dont go their way. They seem to always be anxious and try to get on top of their things. They can also be selfish and inconsiderate of others feelings.
3	In my experience--they bring up things in a group I have told them one-on-one and I am so mortified (*deer in headlights* feeling) that any trust I have in them vanishes. Then they do it again and again, even if I ask them not to. I still act friendly around them, but I trust them about as much as an email scammer unfortunately :'(
2	IDK any ESTJ :( I want an ESTJ in my life.. 
2	One of my service officer was an estj (close guess only though she havent taken the test) and i was a teller so we work at the same bank. I was still slow in counting money as i was new. One time, she confronted me that i was unproductive but being the newbie i was i told her that im still learning but tf i was adjusting to my new environment duhhh. She was also rude, childish, judgemental and unprofessional when she confronted me. Thank the lord because i managed to switch careers and i no longer see that btch\n\nGood thing i never got to know her because i wasnt planning to. I avoid those kinds of people . I mean it's okay to give criticism but the btch stepped over the line.\n
2	As far as I know the ESTJ is the "supervisor" type for the ISFJ, which makes ESTJs both attractive and admirable, and kind of frustrating and annoying to be around for a long time for an ISFJ. Sometimes it seems like the ISFJ might want to please the ESTJ, but no matter what they do the ESTJ is kind of dismissive of them and especially of their tertiary Ti logic that ESTJ suppresses with their Te.     \nTo read more about supervision relationships see [**ISFJ relationship matches with other MBTI types**](https://www.personalitycafe.com/isfj-articles/285-love-types-isfj-5.html#post4235430).
2	My boyfriend is one! I absolutely love them ❤ I do tend to get along with them more than ENTJs too.
2	I used to like an ESTJ guy...I knew he was super ambiguous about relationships but I didn't expect him to straight up ignore it. I remember I was too scared to speak to him about it in person, so I wrote him an email. No response whatsoever, and I didn't want to pester him further about it. It wouldn't have worked out anyway since we live in different countries, but I was more upset that he didn't simply tell me he didn't feel the same way. I guess the silence was the answer.  \n\nI have since moved on and we're still Facebook friends, but it's at a bare minimum. I also feel like I can't speak to him normally even if we talked again.  
12	ISFJ and eye contact	Yeah there is stereotype about ISFJ being weird with eye contact and being closet stalkers. How true is that? 
8	yeah, If I'm having a conversation with someone, and i go all in for it - i will hold the eye contact. consistently. but if I'm somehow nervous for any reason due the person I'm talking to or the settings,, eeeh I guess I hold consistent eye contact in 7/10 of the conversations I'm having.  I have noticed people looking away many times, so I try to not hold it too long. the stalker part? I don't have much of a stalker in me. 
6	If I'm uncomfortable around someone, I'll hold eye contact and then break it away, over and over.  It gives the impression that I'm nice/quiet/shy, which is what I want people to think of me when they first meet me (or, sometimes, it gives the impression that I'm awkward.)  If I'm comfortable with you, I'll hold eye contact for a reasonable amount of time.  I like eye contact.  It helps me read you better, know what you're feeling, and how you're reacting to me.
4	Whaddya mean weird with eye contact?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYeah, I can be a stalker. I like learning about people. It's done in a creepily curious, yet innocent way. The best of ways.
3	I swear that used to be an INTJ stereotype. I think it changes with the wind...
3	huh..?
2	I've been told that I tend to hold strong eye contact when others are speaking (luckily this was a compliment), but otherwise I'm not as great at it when I'm the one speaking. As for the stalking, I have no clue where that rumour came from lol. I'd say I'm a good "researcher" so I tend to find random information quite easily but there's no need to stalk someone. It's a lot of work.
2	I'm really bad at eye contact... I'm always looking somewhere else. I'm working on it, though!\n\nAnd I'm most definitely a closet stalker. I love learning about people!! Plus I have a great memory. But sometimes I forget about boundaries and offend someone by reading over their shoulder or something.
14	Any other ISFJs great with language learning?	I’ve always gravitated to languages...In high school I opted to study both French and Spanish (no one did that), I majored in Spanish in college, and one of my hobbies post grad is to learn words in more languages (I love the Duolingo app), currently working at Portuguese. \n\nLearning languages has always been incredibly easy for me. Sure I still have to study and work at it, but it amazed me when people would do so poorly in their language classes when I easily aced them. \n\nWondering if this is an ISFJ thing at all? I think Si allows for excellent language acquisition and in my case I feel I have not only a photographic memory for how the words are spelt and used grammatically, but also an auditory memory for how things sound and phrases that are bunched together. \n\nI also love the idea of connecting with others via speech, which perhaps is explained by the combo of Si-Fe functions 
6	I have an easy time as well. I also speak French and Arabic due to my upbringing. I learned ASL and it was very easy for me, in my opinion 
3	Nope! I'd tried to learned Spanish in my high school years, but being from the hood made it very difficult for me. There was consistent fights in the classroom. Including overpowering the teacher. But oh well..\n\nEdit: Misspelling
3	yup, I learn it fast. 
3	That's so cool! I'm actually terrible with languages. I'm pretty sure I'm an ISFJ, but I've always had issues with paying attention and listening so learning the details of all the different new sounds and spellings were difficult. And never tried to constructive a framework to learn it more easily.
2	I'm not good at languages, sadly! In my experience those with Ne as 1st or 2nd in their stacking tend to be much better than me.
2	My wife is ISFJ and certainly has a level of linguistic talent but doesn't really have the headspace to dive into one.\n\nI'm an INTP myself and have always had a passion for languages and they come quite easy to me as well, however I think it has more to do with your upbringing than with your type.\n\nLet's take me as example. I'm Dutch and I was raised to be curious, which lead me to be able to read before I was 4 which gave me a head start. I started English at about 10 years old. At the age of 14 my school offered me Latin and Greek, which taught me a lot about the structure of languages in general, but I also took German and French. Since then I've been using Duolingo in combination with various grammar resources to learn Swedish and Italian. 
2	Yes i loveee learning language as an isfj but unfortunately i'm not intelligent as you 😭
1	Spanish Class isn't too hard for me, but i still can't fluently speak it. Far from it. I can read it fairly well though. 
1	Reading and writing it yes. Speaking absolutely not.\n\nBut, in every class except anything with numbers I easily excel and wonder how others don't :/. I don't know if I just take better notes or something but "school" and learning have always come very easily. 
1	English is my best subject.  Sounds surprising, but I won't be in high school for a few months, so technically haven't learned any other languages.  I'm going to learn Spanish in high school, but I want to learn French so badly - I'm a huge fan of "French classics" (well, I guess I mean 60s French music -  Serge Gainsbourg, Jane Birkin, Francoise Hardy, I like the song "Porque Te Vas.")  I want to understand the lyrics to the French music I listen to because it's so catchy!
1	Yes and no. I did Japanese all through school (roughly 10 years) and ended up with nothing usable. I wasn't able to make a conversation and still struggled to read anything. I know Japanese is one of the hardest to learn but I don't feel I made any progress with it. \n\nI've started learning French in the past year only doing classes on the weekend. I feel it's a lot easier and I'm able to make sense of a magazine article if I read it. It could be because English is made up of so many french words but it seems to be a lot easier to translate in my mind. I still struggle to have a conversation though but I understand that will take a lot of time and practice.
1	Nope, pretty terrible sadly lol!
1	Now I know I'm not an isfj
1	It depends, if I am emotionally invested in the language - say, my crush's mother tongue is a certain language - I pick it up fast. Or, if I am watching some show or film and greatly enjoy it, I pick it up fast. Or, the cultural aspect of the language I am learning has to interest me... \n\nThere always has to be another motivation other than just learning the language, sadly. 
1	I have a friend, she is only 16, but already speaking 4 langauages. 
1	I'm ok at it. 
1	THAT’S what we discuss in r/entp!	
3	wow 
3	how smart.

8	INFP here	Hey! I have a big crush on a ISFJ girl!\n\nI love you guys! I’m just wayy too shy to make any moves, I need help!\nShe’s at my university and I need help!\nI know her decent, I talk to her sometimes, I helped her with a subject. She is just so nice.\nYou are all just really loving people.\n\nShe removed her insta photo’s and I told her that they looked beautiful and why’d she remove them? And said “I couldn’t stand my own face”. She removed her account 2 times and then she made a new one again after some time haha\nShe’s weird but so cool.\nShe has a lot of stress with study and in general. She told me I looked pretty. I read somewhere that ISFJ’s repress their feelings and that way won’t ever tell someone the truth.\nHowever she told me some time ago about her anxiety and that it goes better now, and about that she has some small form of depression. She told me that she only told this to her best friend and no one else except you (so me) now.\n\nI’m flattered and I have no clue if she likes me or not and I’m just scared that when I do something she will just be like no sorry and I would feel so shit afterwards.\n\n\n\nIf you want a more fuller story I could give you that! :)
3	I'm an INFP guy and have an ISFJ girlfriend so I may be able to help a little. Relationships take a lot of trust. I would say that I would go on with the relationship for awhile and then stop every two or three weeks and question whether or not I wanted to keep going. She had a much higher bar than me at the beginning but once she committed she stayed committed.\n\n\nIf she is sharing things with you that she has only shared with one other person, then there must be some level of trust on her end. If you see a possibility of a good relationship with her, I would recommend asking her about it. It's scary and takes some vulnerability but if it ends in a good relationship then it's 100% worth it!\n\n\nI know INFP and ISFJ aren't usually a recommended match but I've found it to work very well for me. If you have any questions, I'd be happy to try and answer them.
2	I have a couple of INFP friends and my ex is an INFP!\n\nI'd say, just be yourself.. we can be a little messy, worried, have a low confidence, be too sensitive.. just make sure you  are a comfortable presence, are emotionally availabl - which I don't think I must tell an INFP! :) ..and take things slow, but steady :)\n\nWhat else would you like to know?
1	Are you sure she is an ISFJ? How to make ISFJ like you is make them comfortable and give information or good experience as you can. I am an ISFJ girl and have INFP best friend. The problem is sometimes INFP can't tell what is on their mind cuz FI hero is very lowkey to tell what they feel and don't want anybody to feel bad. Just be open to her and tell or initiate that you like her :)
1	Information can be anything. Is like telling what you like, what you experience, what you see, what you feel or ask what she likes. This would make an ISFJ comfortable cuz SI hero always thought about past experience.\n\nYeah i know it is hard for INFP cuz Fi hero is not an open person. But that's the challenge. As an isfj, sometimes i got sad and disappointed to my best friend INFP cuz she didn't gave many of her stories. Communication is the key.\n\nDo you know 5 love languages? ISFJ most likely to have words of affirmation primary love languages. \nBut infp most likely to have act of service love language. But for me, i really don't need help. I just feel comfortable with deep conversation rather than got help by someone else.\n\nBut idk about her primary love language. Maybe she have different love lang. But isfj is mostly have words of affirmation love language rather than act of service.
6	What are some stereotypes about you guys? =)	Hey, it's yayo from r/mbtimemes ;)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo far I haven't found / created a single meme about ISFJs and I want to change that. Therefore I'd love to learn more about you guys =)\n\nWhat are some stereotypes about your type?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for your help! 
18	People pleaser, sensitive to criticism that can destroy confidence temporarily, needing affection (just me), etc. haha
16	That we're the "mom friend"/Disney princesses/sweet pure cinnamon roll too good for this sinful earth.  I'm definitely not all sunshine and roses, but I see a lot of memes referencing ISFJs like that.
8	[We need more memes like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/isfj/comments/aoczxv/gotta_love_isfj_doms/) \n\nThe stereotypical ISFJ meme economy about us being the "mom friend" or the "cookie baker" is oversaturated. I'd like to see some more edgy memes. 
6	Easily taken advantage of
5	Sensitive, but will do anything to help!
3	close minded, pleaser,  boring and sweet
1	In my own experience\n\n1. BORING- especially when i bond with my intp friend who has these theories about the government although he has no basis. I dont think he's telling me these to look superior but he's just brainy. As an isfj i just nod because i have nothing to offer and we isfjs dont talk about abstract concepts and theories because i just find it useless. I mean no offense theories can be fun to listen to  but there are other important things to take care of.\n\n2. NICE/KIND- I mean im called "nice" because im somehow polite according to mg friend. I would somehow help my friends of they ask me or they are having a hard time looking for answers in their projects. Im that "nice" friend bur i dont see myself that way lol. Im just polite because i dont like to resist. I mean it's a waste of saliva\n\n3. SECRETIVE- i dont speak that mich about my life i mean i listen to my friends stories and my enfj bff blabbings but i just dont "open" myself because theres nothing interesting about me anyways. While my friends do open up about their favorite tv shows and gossip about other people, i myself dont gossip although i still listen. People are hard to trust nowadays and you dont know whos gonna betray me in the future. Better be private than be open. My infp friend even accused me of not being open to the group looool.\n\n4. VICTIM mentality- oh nooo another stereotype about isfjs lol but lemme tell you that while im sometimes guilty of  this, i do it in a subtle way to avoid being blamed at. I do own up to my mistakes though sometimes\n\n5. NAVE(?) - i feel like im naive sometimes lol\n\n
4	Myers Briggs Arsehole Index on ISFJ:	"Creeps. “Nice guys.” The ISFJs are really fucking creepy. They do not know what privacy means, and they do not care even if you direct them to a dictionary. They are the traditional silent stalker, the ones who become serial murderers at age 40 out of a growing sense of meaningless in life. Everyone moves away from them, and rightfully so.\n\nThe word “love” to an ISFJ is loaded. If they say they love you, you should change your name. They are talking about an undying burning flame of worship and eagerness to please, and though they will never voicewhat it is they want, you will know. Usually they will romanticise a scenario and keep trying to achieve it. We do not recommend becoming involved romantically with an ISFJ, because you will never know what goes through their mind, and you will never be able to react exactly as the ISFJ wants. If they need to articulate what they want the whole thing is ruined, you see.\n\nYou might have an ISFJ friend, and you might have them for like, 8 years without even touching them, and then one night you overhear them describing you as their [gender]friend on the phone.\n\nThese people give you gifts and need help. The ISFJ animal is a leech, or anything disgusting and creepy, really."\n\nhttps://zombiesintelligently.com/myers-briggs/
6	This is great.\n\n> They do not know what privacy means, and they do not care even if you direct them to a dictionary. They are the traditional silent stalker\n\nOh dear 😂😂😂 I actually am that creepy though!! Plus I'm really good at prying - unless you're paying attention you might not even realize that the questions I ask have a bigger purpose. I love knowing everything about everyone, heh, it's bad.\n
6	This is hilarious, if you like this kind of dark humor (I do). Some of the other ones are really well done too. Thank for posting!
5	>  If they need to articulate what they want the whole thing is ruined, you see. \n\nShhhhhh\n\n&#x200B;
3	Lmao this is so accurate. I'm an ISFP but I work with an ISFJ and she has stalked me on multiple occasions. -\_-
2	fun and engaging 
2	:(\n\nI thought no one noticed!
1	Thank you for generalizing all of isfj types. Hope you are happy with bashing all of isfj types in the world
12	INFJ (F) in new relationship with ISFJ (M)- please advise on how to discuss problems of him being "too nice"	I've done a bit of searching on the sub-reddit, but I have yet to come across someone asking for the help I need. My boyfriend is amazing. He's the sweetest, most selfless person I know. He drops everything to take care of me when I am sick, and will do absolutely everything for me when he's around. So what's the problem, he sounds awesome, right?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's too much. He's too nice. I really really appreciate it sometimes, but when it happens so often the thing he does for me feels less like warm fuzzies and more like he's my slave. I am a very independent person, and it's really hard to let him do things for me so frequently. It's not just something nice here or there, but every. little. thing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe've had a conversation about this, so I know he knows how I feel, but I think I maybe didn't explain things in a way that will fix anything because it's continued. I really like this guy and I don't want to mess it up, but I'm feeling suffocated by his love right now. Any advice on how to discuss this with him?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, reading on the sub-reddit, I see it's very common for ISFJs to act like this and, while they want to do things to make you happy, they also secretly resent you for it. I have this latent fear that he's not actually genuine with his actions and that he's "trying too hard" or putting me on a pedestal that will some day be torn down and he will disregard me for the flawed human I am. At the same time, I feel crazy for saying that since everything feels so incredibly genuine with him. Any thoughts on this from the ISFJ perspective?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR;; New ISFJ boyfriend is "too nice" and insists on doing anything and everything for me no matter how uncomfortable it makes me. I have a (somewhat irrational) fear he isn't genuine and is putting me on a pedestal temporarily. Any insight is much appreciated! 
18	Hi, female ISFJ here. I just wanted to pick up on the ‘resentment’ angle. Speaking for myself, I only ever feel resentment when I *really* feel taken-advantage of. Otherwise, I genuinely don’t mind doing the little nice things that seem to come naturally. (Unfortunately?) as a people pleaser, we want everyone to be content, catered for and in a good mood. No ulterior motive, no expectation of anything in return- except maybe a little kindness back - I’m not a doormat! And once you’ve pushed me too far and lost me, you’ve lost me. \n\nIf it’s any consolation, I am a fully-fledged grown-up and my mum *still* tells me I’m too kind and thoughtful to people who don’t deserve it. But it’s sometimes harder to be kind than awful I think. \n\nEdit:(as I needed a re-read of your question!) As for speaking with him and him not ‘stopping’ - I can only say that it’s really hard not to do what comes naturally if you are a caring type (sorry). \nIf you can, take the love and care in the spirit that it’s meant (give some back!) and make the most of a great boyfriend and don’t worry about his (imagined) resentment. 
7	Yep, I second doing things that force him (or both of you) to attend to his needs. It's often the push an ISFJ needs.\n\nRe resentment--signs of appreciation go a  HUGE way in averting this for me. E.g.,  saying thank you, acknowledging (with words) my service/care/sacrifice/love. Recognizing it and saying thanks and putting me first sometimes (see above) = super happy ISFJ over here
4	I think your boyfriend being "too nice" is probably an important part of his personality. It may not be reasonable to ask him to change that in a short period of time. You said you've already talked to him about it, and things haven't really changed. He probably remembers and is trying to help but doesn't really know what to do.\n\nYou may need to go about this slowly. Have a few talks with him expressing what you feel and what you want. Try to remember specific instances of him being too nice and what he could've done (or not done) instead. The important thing is to be direct but not too blunt. You don't want to hurt him or make him feel insecure for how he acts, but you want your message to get across clearly. 
7	\n\nI cant figures out all the details about him since I dont know him in person but its possible that\n\n-Hes insecure about relationship and his way of coping with it is making sure your needs are taken care of albeit perhaps in this case to a slight extreme.\n\n-I dont know if it was his first relationship but perhaps pedestal thing could be a case where you happen to be someones hes much closer comfortable with compared to other people he knows... or just scared he will lose you since he loves the relationship too much\n\n-Hes not comfortable that the things he likes to do or things you or other people want to do as much as him so he changes himself to fit in with people he cares about\n\n-Perhaps theres a way he was raised where he mightve been felt guilty really easily if he did something wrong and tries to make it right by essentially being ultra nice\n\n\nNow I dont know you told him about you felt about this but I would say do one of the following\n\n-Be slightly more blunt about how you feel suffocated but reiterate you love him and such.\n\n-This might be a weird method but try to do something that kinda forces him to do things that are more about him. As said above he may have trouble being independent unlike you so maybe try to figure out what his insecurities are so he can function more on his own\n\n\nThis is the best I can offer hope it helps or someone offers something better
3	My wife is ISFJ. \n\nMaking other people happy and giving them uninterrupted support is the motive of ISFJ's. You cant take it from them altogether.\n\nHowever strong communication skills from both sides might well put this issue on a slight ease for both of you.\n\n\nTry to become a skilled communicator without being blunt and direct. No hurting !
5	You already know the answer to this, it's just a matter of *when*
2	Just be honest with him about respecting your boundaries without being too blunt. Tell him you apperciate his love and that you wanna reciporcate it by doing nice things for him. Enneagram Type could also play a factor in this. Sounds like he could be a type 2. I know one of the weaknesses of that type is they could be very clingy. Personally, I'm not very clingy since I'm a type 9. Good luck! 
2	Another female ISFJ. The only time I feel taken advantage of is when people don't say thank you. Honestly I would drive you across the country and as long as someone told me that they appreciate me I would be happy. That being said, if I go to the store for you and you don't even say thanks it stings a bit...but not enough for me to not do it again tomorrow. It is almost a subconscious personality trait for me at this point!
2	I agree with all the comments here..\n\nI doubt he's feeling any resentment, because I'm sure you might feel it emotionally, even if his actions show his sense of duty towards you. So please don't worry about that! :)\n\nWe are very caring to people we love, almost obsessively and it can feel stifling to some people, but it's really a part of what we are. The more we love, the more we care for you as though you were my little baby, it's not something we can change - even if we want to. We may contain or restrict our action, but the instinct doesn't really stop.\n\nIt would hurt him very much if he even gets a feeling that you think his care and duty-bound love for you is being perceived as inauthentic and is causing you discomfort. Trust me INFJ, this will be enough to totally break his heart and send him into an existential crisis lol. Because, any (maybe a rare exception) ISFJ's basic expression of love is service I think.\n\nSo, please remove such doubts, and you could try accepting him as he is, and give yourself and the relationship time to see the love or spirit of his actions? Perhaps, ask him lovingly to slow down a bit and reassure him. For example, when he takes an initiative to do something for you, then playfully (and lovingly, ALWAYS, lovingly) tell him you would do (that something which he was gonna do for you) it this time?? Take turns. Tell him "*Babe, this time, I will \_\_\_\_\_\_ , you sit back and relaxxxx :)* " type of thing?? I hope you get the drift.. take turns, this way you are also getting him to relax, and a lot of your concerns will go away - and more importantly, makes for a healthy exchange that is important in love.\n\nYou can also try to direct his attention to his needs, like people here said, we do need a push and need someone who will direct us and sometimes take an initiative to have us relaxing for a bit. \n\nWhatever you convey to your ISFJ, just be gentle and reassuring :)
0	I am a woman and also was an INFJ for most of my life. I have no idea why it switched to ISFJ but here I am. I absolutely could not stand having a too nice boyfriend. I felt not worthy, guilty all the time, very restricted because if I do this he'll do this so I won't and avoid the whole thing, etc. He was the sweetest guy but it made me so uncomfortable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am a very caring and nurturing person. I will definitely be too nice a lot but I will resent people who don't appreciate me or people who take advantage when they don't need to. For example, if we're eating and we finish and I'm headed to the kitchen with my plate, I'll take yours too, no problem. If *you're* eating and finish and ask me who is not headed that way to take your plate in because I'm standing up and you're lazy, I will flip my shit inside.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I guess my advice is to just make sure he knows you appreciate what he does for you - IF you appreciate it. If it makes you uncomfortable he needs to stop doing those things because it's not nice to make someone uncomfortable and tell them it's because you're nice. I would never be nice to someone falsely or put someone on a pedestal temporarily - you either earned it in my eyes and it's up to you to knock yourself down with your words or actions or you're not going up.
0	You're both guardians, meaning both have heavy interest in taking care of each other. Too many cooks in the kitchen ruin the stew or whatever. Basically, you guys need me, an ENTP ideas man who is also a slob.
3	ESFJ and ISFJ relationship.	Just started a relationship with an ISFJ, kinda. He works with me and I like him a good amount. He was always the person who is quiet and to themselves but after one night out as an office we got touchy and one thing led to another and we slept together. I was clear that this is not a hookup and that I prefer long term things. The ISFJ seems to like me back and anything I ask we do together they do very willingly. \n\nSo my question is, they seem to very distant. Thinking about something a lot. I carry most of the conversations, which I’m fine with and am used to but I’d like them to start some convos. I know eventually I’ll get tired of that. They always talk enthusiastically once I bring up something. \n\nSo do you guys open up eventually or all of you very distant all of the time. I have a good read of people’s emotions and I can tell he’s not distant because he doesn’t like me but he has stuff on his mind. We Havnt talked about where the relationship is yet and quantified it. Does he need that? I don’t want to scare him but I don’t want him to feel like I’m moving too fast. 
16	Ask me things and I can talk all day but unless something happened, is exciting or important or involves you, I can't think of conversations to start.
13	What are immature ISFJs like?	Hey guys, I’m just wondering what immature ISFJs are like. I’m 17 yrs old and would like to become more self aware and possibly avoid some pitfalls. What were you like/what immature ISFJ traits do you know of?
36	Passive aggression is one of the traits of an immature ISFJs.
26	this may all be unique to my own experience, but i'm a pretty textbook ISFJ, so it may help to recognize if you see these patterns forming in your own actions: \n\njudgmental and alienating, projecting your own insecurities on to other people and ostracizing them for these perceived inadequacies while using this to create social currency for yourself. being attracted to people with higher social status and using them to bolster your own self-worth because you believe you are not deserving of anything. getting others in trouble for transgressions to avert the blame/attention from yourself. throwing yourself into new experiences 100% until you make one mistake and then giving up, or not engaging in experiences that could make you a better person because of a fear of failure/disappointment.\n\nlearning my own strength, talents, and abilities helped with a lot of these issues, through pure trial and error and dumb luck. i still deal with these issues as they come up, but rarely, and the first step is to acknowledge the things you do that you know are wrong. i would be interested to see if any other ISFJs have experienced these negative traits.
5	Try to become comfortable with verbalizing what you are feeling.
7	Immature ISFJs: are judgemental, rigid, emotionally manipulative, overly conflict avoidant, and perfectionistic. Prone to Si-Ti loop, analyzing and reanalyzing past experiences and not doing anything about it (I made a post about it Check it out.). Overly Critical. Passive aggressive. Extremely fearful of change and new possibilities (Ne grip/inferior). \n\nSource: ISFJ Male with plenty of experience being immature. 
18	Weekend Discussion Thread: Fuck, Marry, and Kill (MBTI Types Edition)	Good late evening. So me and the co-mod thought it'd be fun to switch up the weekend thread this week with a game. We decided to do the fuck, marry, and kill game lmao. \n\nI'll start this game. \n\nFuck: ESTP. I tend to be naturally drawn to these types though I've only meant guy ESTPs. It would be interesting to meet a girl ESTP and see if we hit it off. Overall, I feel like they would be good one night stand \n\nKill: ESTJ Sorry I'm just not very drawn to the super high Te.\n\nMarry: INFJ. I only know one INFJ in real life and she's great to talk to and get her perspective on things and problems I'm having. I also feel like these personality types are deep romantics (really all of the NF types could be). I also like how their quality of being reserved but empathetic (sometimes extroverts can be overwhelming). Overall, they seem like a soulmate type. 
7	Fuck: INFJ: we get on like a house on fire, they flatter me and make me feel fuzzy. We part ways before they interpret me raising a tiny issue as a warrant for full-blown attack where no holds are barred and I'm to blame for everything ever (I'm sure there's more stable and wonderful INFJs; I've just encountered some very unhealthy ones who have said horrible things to me)\n\nMarry: ENFP: so nice; draws me out, won't hurt me\n\nKill: ESTJ: same reasons as OP
7	Fuck: ENxP\n\nMarry: INTP\n\nKill: ESFJ\n\n
3	fuck; ISTP\n\n\nmarry; ESFP\n\n\nkill; ISTJ 
3	Fuck: ESTP (probably couldnt deal with their ego-centric nature long term)\n\nMarry: ISTP (sexy fuckers and have a deep intensity)\n\nKill: I can’t stand the thought of killing any type....but some of my least favorites are, ESFJ, ESTJ, and ENFP 
3	Fuck: estp\n\nMarry: isfj\n\nKill: estj
3	Fuck: ESFP\n\nMarry: ENFP\n\nKill: INTJ\n\nSide note: I dated an ESTJ and he wasn’t so bad at all. Just very busy and focused on working 24/7. 
2	Fuck: ESFP (idk guess I like the craziness and niceness lmao)\n\nKill: ESFJ (too much Fe, stop caring about me so much!)\n\nMarry: INFJ (best friend is INFJ and we dead ass can talk about almost anything for hours)\n\n&#x200B;
2	Fuck: ISFP.  Something about Se is so, *so* attractive to me.  It's like the Se-users I know are naturally sensual, even if I don't find them attractive.  I find female ISFP's particularly attractive, even if I wouldn't date some.\n\nKill: ...ENTJ.  Sorry, you guys.\n\nMarry: ISTP.  I love ISTP's so, so much.  Such a puzzle to figure out!  Any mature STP would do for me in marriage.  
1	Fuck... I can't pick one.. I guess, any type would be an experience!\n\nMarry... xSTJ or ENTJ or ISFP.\n\nKill..
1	INTP here\n\nfuck you istj, you are too structured and orderly (to the point of inflexibility even at great reason), and dont have the same nice charm as isfj\n\ntu mourront esfj, youre boring as fuck, and your small talk plans should go die\n\ninfp youre the best ;) always so kind, and (excluding infjs), the only feeler who seeks truth and (being an introvert) can connect best with me
2	How do I let me wife know that her cigarette smoking is hard on the family, without causing her shame or otherwise hurting her feelings.	She was an ex smoker for 10+ years when we met.  Years into our rocky relationship she started smoking again, and blamed it partially in the stress our disfunction caused her.  Things got worse. \n\nI tried to be as accommodating as I could.  We both went to therapy and eased the disfunction and stress a great deal.  \n\nWhen she quit smoking for about 6 months, we quickly became the closest we've been since early in our relationship.  We both had so much compassion for each other and it made the rare hurt feeling heal so quickly.  We stopped having whole weekends mad at each other.  It felt like we had relationship stuff figured out.\n\nShe went out of town for a day and suggested she might have a cigarette.  I was in a "you do you, I do me" frame of mind, and didn't put up a fuss.  Now she's been smoking for 6+ months and along the way I realized that we are taking a step back into disfunction.  She definitely has less patience with me and the family. We definitely are still much better than our bad times, but she acts much less compassionately overall.  I looked up symptoms of long term cigarette use, and damn... they fit what I was feeling.\n\nI love her with everything in me.  I want us to get along as best as we can.  And I only want to spend the rest of my life with her.  The thought of her dying before me is fucking scary.  Dying of a painful and preventable disease... I can't put words to that thought.\n\nShe is a stubborn one.  In the past, any kind of pressure to get her to quit hurt her feelings, pushed us apart, and seemed to make her dig in her heels.  She doesn't like the hint of being told what to do, or the impression I think I know what's best for her.\n\nAny suggestions?
1	Editing since I have no idea how it feels like to be in a situation like yours, only similar...
1	BURN THE CIGARS!!!!!!\n\nHAVE HER WATCH THEM BURN!!!!!\n\non a serious note, budget planning might remove all of her money for smoking
7	I am INTP hubby(33 yo) wife(27 yo)is ISFJ. Please advise me how to keep my wife happy and also somehow make her acompany me in unconventional routines/activities. Help needed	\n
17	Don’t “make” her do it. She will be much more inclined to do something you want to do if you gently bring it up and let her know that it’s important to you and you would love for her to share it with you, even if only once.\n\nAlso, emphasize how much it’s *not* that you’re unhappy or dissatisfied with her as a person - you just want to do these activities that you enjoy *with* her.\n\nI assume you probably already do things that she wants to do. Try not to make her feel guilty by saying that you always join her in things she wants to do. It’s understandable, but not always helpful. \n\nOn the other hand, if you don’t join her in the things she likes to do, maybe try some out. She will probably want to reciprocate.
5	The first part, how to make her happy, might depend more on her love language than on her mbti type. Try reading into that.\n\nAs for the second part, how to convince her to do stuff together, I have no idea. I would like to know that too.\n\nI think ISFJs are very prone to depression, fear disorders and related issues, which may increase the difficulty of answering your questions.\n\nI'm an INTP (30m) with an ISFJ (24) wife btw. 
3	Make sure she knows she matters, is loved and appreciated. We love to hear that we are loved. \n\nWe also love to make those around us happy, so if you are able to express how happy it would make you if she participated in these activities with you, she will be more receptive. I dated an ENTP who was super into the card game magic the gathering (lol) and he wanted me to play with him so bad. While I thought it was so dumb, I did really try to get into it bc it made him happy. Ultimately I was like, nah this isn’t for me, but I really tried. 
1	Was there text associated with the title? Female 25 y/o Isfj here with an intp bf if you want to ask me for any more advice? 
6	Does my ISFJ acquaintance dislike me? (INTP)	Hi,\n\nI am currently in living arrangements with some of my acquaintances (2 couples - 4 people) and one of them is an ISFJ. We have been living together in rented accommodation for 3 years now. Me and her have always had civil relation with each other.\n\nThat gradually changed over time: due to our immense differences in tastes and interests, we started talking less to each other, and eventually it came to a situation where her behaviour towards me is the following:\n\n1. She would never initiate any conversation with me. If I say hi, she would say hi back, and that's it. She never asks about how am I doing and if I didn't initiate the conversation, we could literally go months without talking to each other.\n2. If I tried initiating - asked her about how her day was, etc. - she would give me very short responses and no 'hooks' to keep the conversation going. She wouldn't even look at me when giving these answers, and she isn't expressive whatsoever.\n3. All of the above is not the case with anyone else: if someone else asks about her day, she elaborates, uses facial expressions such as smile and actually looks towards that other person. She also follows up with a question of her own. None of that happens when she talks with me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCan you, dear ISFJs, enlighten why is this the case? Is this how you behave towards a person that you dislike? Maybe she hates me? Doesn't feel comfortable around me? Is it possible that the main reason she acts towards me like this is because we are just so different? Is it possible to reverse this?\n\nFrom what I remember, I have never insulted her or acted unkindly towards her...
11	Sounds exactly like how I would behave in this situation. My main way of relating to people is through shared interests. If we don't have them, I won't want to talk to you that much because I know it's not going to go anywhere or get deep. Doesn't mean I don't like you, but it's not energy I feel like is worth expending, if that makes sense.
8	Real talk, I don't think she hates you. Y'all just have nothing in common. In my opinion ask her do you want to hang out. But in all honesty, I don't think she dislike or hate you.
4	Honestly I have acted this way with a housemate who I did not like because they weren't a nice individual in every way possible and i wanted to cut my communication short with them. But you actually seem concerned and care about why your housemate may be acting this way. You may have done something that you didn't mean to personally effect them, but you may not be aware of it. If i were you , i'd confront them in the kindest way possible by asking if you did anything wrong because you really want to get a long with her, and that you're willing to fix it if u did something wrong.
5	I'd probably find myself acting like this if I were annoyed or resentful about someone being inconsiderate towards myself or others eg being messy or not contributing well to household practically and emotionally. It'd take me a v long time to get to the point of actually showing my frustration outwardly in how I interact with them. No idea if this is the issue here, just thought I'd let you know how it is for me!
3	if she doesn't know what to say, and doesn't know how to speak with you that she actually knows makes you comfortable, then that makes her uncomfortable. this results in her not talking to you at all because .. she doesn't know what to say, and doesn't want to throw herself out of her comfort zone.
3	I kind of act like this when I don't like something about someone. It doesn't mean I dislike them as a person, I just have no interest in interacting with them.
2	Maybe with the passing of the years she just realized that you have nothing in common with her, but I feel like her behaviour is not just about not having anything in common, specially from what you said about her behaviour with your other aquaintances. Does she interact more with them than she does with you on a regular basis (I mean, spending time with them, even if nobody speaks)? Have you all known eachother for the same time?   \n\n\nAnother possibility is that you've made some comments that were unpleasant for her through all these years that were probably insignificant, but after being piled up they became a big discomfort and her way of avoiding more of those is just to cut communication with you, but hey! this is probably because she doesn't hate you at all and doesn't want to end up hating you (this is just a hypothesis of mine)  \n\n\nWhatever it is the reason for her behaviour, I believe she doesn't hate or dislike you, she's just probably trying to avoid something that makes her uncomfortable, be it the awkwardness of not having anything to talk about, comments that she may dislike that are innocent... 
1	I wouldnt blame her personality type. It seems to just be introverted behaviour to me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWomen especially tend to open up to some people more than others and introverts and other introverts can often be pretty awkward together. There are a lot of variables here so its pretty hard to pin down. How you ask a question can lead to many different answers from another person. I used to get a lot of one word answers from women when I went on dates but now with a few tweaks women seem to give me better responses. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBest way to tell if she dislikes you or not is if she is quick to get away from you or distances herself from you. Just keep a watch on her body language and what she does with herself when you are around. 
1	I am INTP and my wife is ISFJ. You know what we really have to put in a lot of hardwork and tons of communication to have a good day to day life. 
1	She probably doesn't view you as more than an acquaintence. I know for me awkward small talk with acquaintences and strangers isn't something I enjoy. I will say points number 2 and 3 could be good signs that she doesn't like you. Those points honestly sound like what I would do if I hated someone or just avoid them. My advice is to just say something along the lines of " Hey I've noticed you've been act strange around me. Did I accidentally do something wrong? I really value our relationship and want you to feel like you can be honest around me and do what I can to make this right". I wish you luck. 
1	I find her behavior very rude to be honest. Especially if she behaves differently towards the others in the house. But - that is her problem and not yours (unless you know of something you might have done to hurt her feelings. But my guess is you don't know of anything..). I would keep doing what you are doing - be friendly and ask her a question or two when you do meet. But give her lots of space, since she is clearly sending out signals of wanting to be left alone. 
7	ISFJ 9 chicks	What is your dating history? I'm interested in what (mbti) types of people you've been close to. How it went but also why you were attracted to them in the first place. \n\n&#x200B;
13	I’ve dated many types....here’s a quick summary:\n\nISTJ—boring. Way too similar to myself and didn’t challenge me in any ways or bring new insight into my life. Too uptight, not fun. \n\nISTP—greatest love of my life. Loved how deep, technical, introspective and good with his hands he was. Also kinda liked his aloofness. Super funny and chill. Struggled to express emotions at first, but once we got over that it was wonderful. \n\nINTJ—was really drawn to him...something about INTJs intelligence is sexy as fuck to me. Ultimately it didn’t last long. Don’t think he appreciated my conventional nature. However I’m still really drawn to them and love to listen to what they have to say.\n\nENTP—very interesting. Not sustainable but I did learn a lot from the relationship. We just were on different wavelengths most of the time and pushed each other’s buttons. \n\nISFP—wonderful, almost as wonderful as my relationship with the ISTP. He is warm, affectionate, full of wonder, peaceful, calm. He makes me relax so much and not worry. Super sensual, but also introverted and does have giant displays of love. Beautiful mind. \n\nThat’s my thoughts so far! However, I hate to define each type based on the one particular person I dated. I wish I could know many people of each type and have a better sense of healthy and unhealthy versions of each...
6	I haven't dated anyone yet!
4	Currently in a long term relationship with an ENTJ. Totally love our differences. We’ve helped each other grow a lot and keep each other grounded and real. I value honesty highly and I think that’s what attracted me to him most of all, that and his charisma. I always know where I stand and I can trust his judgement completely.  \nBefore him, I was with an INTJ. I’ve clearly got a thing for XNTJ’s! He was also really charismatic and I enjoyed his intellect a lot.
5	My husband is ESFJ. So we're pretty similar, except for his extroverted-ness. We have a lot of the same values as far as relationships and family go, so it was easy there. Our biggest problem is how introverted I am, and how extroverted he is. He's not an extreme extrovert by any means, but it has taken a lot of talks/discussion to find some common ground with how much time we spend with eachother vs with friends.
3	Took me a long time to find anyone I wanted to be in a relationship with who also wanted to be with me. 😆 I married him recently. \n\nI was attracted to his confidence and humor, I think. And also that he could deal with my anxiety LOL. I sometime resemble a 4 or 6.\n\nHe’s an INTP 5 but several years older than I, which I think contributes to his extroversion, uncharacteristic for his type. \n\nPrior to that, I had mostly been attracted to men who were uninterested in me and probably emotionally unavailable but whom I felt a desire to save. 🤷🏼‍♀️\n\nEdit: Also - goals. Values. They lined up pretty well.
2	ISFJ 9w1 :)\n\nIDK my first boyfriend's type. he seemed sensitive, has this silent strong outside, soft inside aura, had this protective, stable vibe about him. He was very practical, I think he's a thinking type for sure..\n\nSecond boyfriend was INFP (he introduced me to MBTI :p)  I loved everything about him, everything about him was attractive to me. <3 the connection I had with him was/is only something I can dream of. Yes, there were some aspects about him that used to get me worried for him, but I loved him. Sometimes, it still depresses me that I had to part with him.
6	How do you relate to INTP's?	Okay, so this post is phrased strangely, but here's what I'm getting at: ISFJ's and INTP's have the same functions in a different order.  ENTP's have the same functions as us, too, but since ISFJ's and INTP's are both introverts, I'd think that most ISFJ's would feel that they have more in common with the INTP than they do with the ENTP.  As an ISFJ, I'm wondering what you've thought of some INTP's that you've met.  Do you feel that you have an "INTP side?"  I certainly feel like I have an INTP side - it's hard to explain, but even though Si and Fe are the functions that I use the most daily and value the most, my Ti and Ne always seem to be working in the background.   When I'm thinking about something, I'll sometimes almost feel like my Ti+Ne are more prominent than my Si+Fe, even though it wouldn't seem that way on the outside.  Some ISFJ's I've met think that many INTP's are socially awkward, or odd.  But others I've met have a lot in common with the typical INTP, even though you wouldn't realize it after initially meeting them.
6	INTP male here.  I've been in a committed relationship with ISFJ female for 6 years now.  \n\nOne of the main things I appreciate is authenticity.  Early on, she pretended to be into some of the things I like, which made it seem like we had a lot in common.  That was nice in the beginning, but unsustainable, and ultimately  disappointing for me because when she stopped pretending it left us in a situation where she doesn't partake in any of the activities that I initiate. I love hanging out with her, but to do so means I have to only do activities that she chooses.  \n\nWhy are you analyzing how you relate to INTPs?  If the ultimate goal is to make relate better, you might do better just focusing on being authentic, not try to tweak yourself to fit them.  I gravitate to people who are authentic and different to me way more than inauthentic and similar.
4	I have not noticed that I have a lot in common with INTPs (or ENTPs); however, for some reason the ones that have common interests as me (movies, books, business etc.) are majorly attracted to me and I can keep their attention easily. I can keep up never-ending witty banter with them and make them laugh etc but at a very surface level. I would not share my fears and insecurities and open up to them easily (or to anyone actually :P)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have no idea how or why this can be because INTPs are considered among the greatest Thinkers and I am not someone who enjoys having deep conversations about abstract subjects (although I enjoy lengthy discussions about society, business, etc.).
3	Two of my bestfriends are INTP's. I make them laugh non stop. They just think I'm silly and I really lean into it around them since they are a great audience. They both bring a thoughtful side out of me. They make me think about the world a little more critical and less emotional, but they also bring in their own "logical" emotions oit around me. 
2	i agree with you ... sometimes
2	I REALLY struggle to relate to INTPs. They always seem so far removed from emotion of any kind that it makes them seem flat and uncaring to me. 
2	Maybe you think you are doing something you’re not. Idk, I can’t say for sure, but ISFJ’s I’ve met only make me frustrated when I try to have a logical conversation that questions their beliefs. Having logical conversations that question one’s beliefs whether they’re in an INTPs head or in dialogue is kind of our thing. Maybe it’s just the ones I’ve met, but I can’t see the resemblence.
2	Two of my close friends are INTPs actually. I definitely feel like I can understand them even when they are unhealthy. I made a post a while ago about how since we have the same four functions when healthy these types can have a good connection. I will say I admire the way they can use Ti w/o effort and I enjoy analyzing things with them. However, there are many factors beyond personality type that go into friendships and relationships. It defintely helps that I have something in common with both of my INTP friends. 
1	eh, si is generally boring\n\nfe i can relate to though
10	I’m (INTP[22m]) weighing whether or not I should try to give me ex gf (ISFJ[23f]) some closure.	I broke up with my gf 2 days ago because of reasons I didn’t really understand at the time, but now know are mostly communication related. \n\nI wanted to theorize and postulate and mentally break down everything, but obviously she was content with her current knowledge base and was exhausted and stressed out by my thought process. \n\nI would try to compromise by talking about things she was interested in, hoping the conversation would be deep, but she was still content to just discuss surface level stuff.\n\nIt’s worth noting that she grew up never being encouraged to pursue and interact with the world around her. Her family was fairly materialistic and not very thought provoking. So now she is in a stage in life where she’s figuring out what she wants and likes, but hasn’t quite found them yet. \n\nI figured this would be a great journey for us to find what she likes and explore interests, but she is happy just experiencing life as it goes and not forcing herself to explore the world. \n\nThere are probably more disconnects, but I’m just trying to see if you guys would agree with what I said, and also ask if you think I should try to explain this to her, or would I just come off as a psychoanalyst being critical of her life and her family?\n\nThanks for reading.
12	It sucks that you weren’t able to connect. :( \n\nIt’s always disappointing when you think a relationship with a complementary person will enrich both your lives, and you can’t overcome the differences.\n\n>you think I should try to explain this to her, or would I just come off as a psychoanalyst being critical of her life and her family?\n\nOh god no. Don’t do it.\n\nAll my intp friends ignore me when I say to not psychoanalyze people’s weaknesses without their permission, but really- isn’t this just kicking her while she’s down? Don’t.  \n\nLet me be clearer than I like to:\n\n> I wanted to theorize and postulate and mentally break down everything, but obviously she was content with her current knowledge base and was exhausted and stressed out by my thought process.\n\nYou already said it. She hates that kind of thing.\n\nYou can Ti this- is right now, after a break up, the optimal time for an individual’s ex to tell an individual what they think of her and her stupid family? Not if they mean anything constructive by it. But it’s definitely a good time to tell her to inflict the most pain on her, and cause the most drama. I’m definitely not saying that is what you are doing! But that’s kind of how the interpersonal cause and effect looks.\n\n\nIt really sounds like you are just asking permission to get this off your chest for your own closure, not hers. You might do it anyway, but I’m going to say that at least one person thinks it’s a terrible idea. \n\nI would wait a month at least and ask her if she wants this info from you.  \n
9	I am an INTP with two ISFJ exes and currently engaged to an ISFJ.\n\nDo not give her closure. It wont help, it will just make things worse. Leave her alone. Nothing you can possibly say will help her. I promise my dude.
7	ISFJs cannot handle criticism. Please don't criticise her.  Be sweet and take the blame. She probably could use some closure. \n\nAlso that's how S people are. They are in the here and now.  Content with now. If you want deep conversation you need to find other N friends or get a therapist to talk too. S people are more into action than deep chats about random ideas. They are living in the moment. They don't have to practice mindfulness they live it all day long.\n\nAccept her as the nice girl she is not who you wish she was. In fact maybe don't break up with her. Apologize and get back with her with a new understanding. You'll never lack for anything with an ISFJ, if they can do something for you they will. I'll take a kind person over a deep person any day. Their deep comes from the richness of their feelings not the richness of their thoughts. :D Sorry, do what you need too. I just love ISFJs so much.\n\nEdit: I should add that I'm 50 and been dating an ISFJ long distance for 2 1/2 years, and I would not trade her for anyone. She can get deep if you want to talk calculus or modular arithmetic or primitive roots as it relates to telecommunications wire bundles, which is what her masters thesis was about. She is so much smarter than I am. It's so hot and exciting. Gah\n\nAlso I didn't realize this was the ISFJ group. Sorry, I try not to butt in here with comments. Apologies.  I stand by what I said y'all are the best sort of people, and there are more of you than any other type. Yay! What could be better? Nothing.
4	Take this as a learning experience about your needs in a romantic relationship. Your ex doesn't need to know unless she specifically asks. This is about you and I hope you find a future partner that meets those needs. Good luck!
3	It sounds like she doesn't need anymore closure. You already admitted your thought process stressed her out, wanting to go any deeper will probably stress her our even worse. Leave it be. If she wants more closure she will ask you for it.

2	Yeah... my gf’s mom is an ISFJ and I’ve literally never had a harder time trying to speak to someone in my life. Imo this is not the type for an INTP to mesh well with... I don’t like saying something won’t ever work bc of types, but I can’t imagine being stuck with surface level conversations for time on end. My INFJ gf and I have had a conversation going about theoretical or just random stuff since I met her 9 months ago. I as an INTP need someone to bounce my ideas off of constantly. Sometimes things just dont work bc two people aren’t meant for eachother. Maybe your ex can remain a friend in years to come.
7	My ISFJ boyfriend checked my phone and lied to me about it	I am new to this subreddit and I hope that it is okay to ask for advice. I am an INFP and concerned about my ISFJ.\n\nI (24 f) am in a serious relationship with an ISFJ (28 m) for almost two years now. We live together,  we are very happy with each other and can usually openly talk about any of our concerns. But a few days ago I noticed him (lets call him Sam) checking my phone and lying about it when I directly asked him if he did. I am not angry but I am worried why he felt the need to lie to me. I am hoping for some insight or advice from fellow ISFJs.\n\nThis is going to be a long post. But I don't know the reason for his behaviour and I don't want to skip possible important aspects.\n\nSo before this all happened I was visiting my friends and family for a few days while Sam was working. I was spending one evening with two female friends. Usually when I am with friends I don't spend much time on my phone because I rarely see them alone and want to get the most out of the time. Me not texting Sam back while being with these particular friends has been an issue before. So I tried to at least answer once every hour. Sam can be very jealous when he feels like spending time with anyone else is more important to me than he is. My girl-friends are both single and like to go out and enjoy the attention of men. But they did never push me to do anything I don't want to do nor did they ever abandon me because of a man.\n\nThere might be another incident Sam is associating with these friends. Around the time when I knew him for about two months, one of my friends was having a party. We played a drinking game and I drank way to much alcohol. I got wasted and ended up in bed with a man I didn't know before. This is absolutely no typical behaviour for me and it still freaks me out how I changed under the influence of alcohol. Me and Sam were not in a relationship back then but we where seeing each other regularly. I did not text him the whole evening,  which made him suspicious. Beeing the ISFJ he is, he kept thinking about this incident and asked me about this months later. I was honest, told him the whole story and apologized. Although we weren't in a relationship and he knows that this was unusual behaviour for me, I know that it still hurt him.\n\nIn the beginning of our relationship I was also occasionally chatting with a guy I knew from school. Nothing special, mostly just small talk and it was only important to me because he was the only male friend I had left. Sam wasn't comfortable with this. He was jealous and thought that guy was interested in more than just friendship. Because I love Sam and I don't want him to worry or feel insecure, I stopped texting and it turned out that Sam was right. He was sexually interested in me and didn't care much about our friendship, so I am not too sad about ending this relation.\n\nI guess because of what happened and the way my friends are, Sam is always worried when I spent so much time without him. Sam has also been cheated on before. This makes him extra vulnerable. I know that and I would never cheat or do anything to hurt him.\nI want to point out that on the evening last week with my friends, there was absolutely no alcohol involved and I tried to text Sam as often as possible. Me and my friends were staying at home, talking and catching up on each other's lives.\n\nWhen I returned home, everything was fine. Sam was very happy seeing me again and we enjoyed the weekend together.\n\nOn the day he was checking my phone I had a severe anxiety attack. I was crying for hours and he was comforting me the whole time. He did calm me down and we were talking about everything on my mind. I was completely honest with him and I don't think that I held anything back. I trust him and he knows that I do.\n\nLater that day I fell asleep (probably because of the excessive crying) while watching a video on my phone. I woke up when Sam was entering the room. I was still very exhausted and wanted to continue sleeping. I didn't move and pretended to still be asleep. I waited for him to either leave the room or join me and cuddle up to me. Well he didn't. He was grabbing my phone and didn't move for a while. He was standing there doing whatever he was doing while I was still pretending to sleep. After about five minutes I realized that I won't fall asleep again and felt stupid. I opened my eyes and he was still standing there looking at my phone. He pretended that he just came in and stopped the video. I know that the video wasn't playing anymore and that he had my phone for at least 5 minutes. \n\nLater that day I wanted him to tell me what was wrong. I asked him if he was sure he didn't look for anything on my phone and was just turning the video off. I asked him if something bothered him or if he was worried about me writing someone else. He then lied to me. He told me the video was still playing and I woke up right after he stopped it. He also tried to convince me that he had no reason not to trust me and that he feels too loved to ever expect I could do something behind his back. The next day everything was fine again and he seems to be happy since then.\n\nI know that there was nothing interesting on my phone and that i dont keep any secrets from him. I am not even mad that he somehow invaded my privacy. But I am really hurt and confused why he lied to me. I can't stop thinking about this. I don't know if he was concerned about me spending the time with my friends, if he was worried because of my panic attack or if he might even be self projecting. I do trust him but I know that people develop trust issues when they are the ones cheating or feeling guilty. So now I am getting paranoid and this messes me up. I don't want to accuse him of anything and I feel uncomfortable asking him about this again because he might be upset about me pretending to sleep. I would have never expected what happened. As I said we do usually talk about everything and I absolutely don't know why he lied.\n\nI have to confront him again and tell him that I know he lied. Otherwise I know that I will trust him less and that this will haunt me. I don't want this stupid incident to affect our relationship.  I get mad at myself for even thinking he might be cheating and therefore not trusting me anymore.\n\nDo you guys have some more insight or can relate to him? Did I miss something important? Or do you have advice how I can approach this without him feeling attacked or as if I betrayed him. I am thankful for any advice.
19	He was insecure and afraid. So he checked your phone. He saw nothing to worry about.\n\nThen you ask him about it. He doesn't want you to know he checked your phone because that will create conflict which he thinks he can avoid by lying. And admitting it will make him look bad and distrusting of you. He wants to be a trusting boyfriend and wants you to believe he is. But he isn't. So he lied about it. Possibly he's lying to himself in some way to justify doing that.\n\nthis needs to be confronted because secret distrust is one of those spreading cracks in the foundation of a relationship. it's gotta be dealt with to build on stronger.
3	Texting back every hour is excessive if you have been together two years and the incident you are referring to happened so long ago. It's very controlling behavior to expect that of you, especially since you were having girls time. I understand that each relationship has expectations and compromises but he needs to stop holding the behaviors of OTHER PEOPLE  against you. That is unhealthy for the relationship and himself.
3	He seems to have a very anxious attachment style. The irony is that he's afraid of you lying or betraying him but then actually becomes the one lying. Take truth as the fundament of a relationship or it's already doomed to fail. You should make this clear to him. If he follows that rule he will also lose much of his anxiety. If the anxiety doesn't get lower you could probably assume what's going on.
3	I don't feel like any of this is "typical ISFJ behavior" really.\n\n>Beeing the ISFJ he is, he kept thinking about this incident and asked me about this months later. I was honest, told him the whole story and apologized. Although we weren't in a relationship and he knows that this was unusual behaviour for me, I know that it still hurt him. \n\nI once slept with someone when I was *talking* to someone else who lived 6 hours away and wouldn't actually commit to trying a long distance relationship (his whole family is down here anyway, he comes back) and when I didn't text him that night he was really upset, he said, because I would ignore him for that. He then wanted nothing to do with me, even as a friend... it took us years to talk again. I personally, as an ISFJ, think that is ridiculous. You don't get to be mad at me for the actions I take just because I know you're *interested* in me. This guy made a move first, how is that my fault? I'm just supposed to say no to every opportunity I get for anything in case you come around? It doesn't even matter that you were intoxicated/it was out of character, etc. it's none of his business until he makes it his business by committing. \n\nHe sounds really jealous and not in a protective, loving, cute sort of way. How hard is, "you know what babe, I looked through your phone because I got nervous or paranoid but, of course, there was nothing. I'm sorry I didn't just ask you, but, if it helps, I know there doesn't need to be a next time." Even if it's a load of crap, which it shouldn't be if he didn't find anything he was uncomfortable with.\n\nAbsolutely talk to him about this, but it doesn't have to be a confrontation it can be a discussion. Especially because you really only seem upset because he lied to you not because he looked in your phone, and it's affecting *your* ability to trust *him* now and that's gonna be a little feedback loop.\n\n> I feel uncomfortable asking him about this again because he might be upset about me pretending to sleep. \n\n**Then you weren't pretending to sleep, you were trying to fall back asleep and then decided it was futile after a few minutes and you unexpectedly open your eyes to him standing on your phone.** Say you thought he walked away or at least set it down or something. If he can lie you can bend the truth to have a productive conversation, in my opinion. (I bolded that sentence because I feel like it's the most helpful point in my long as hell post).\n\nI hope you can work it out though because it really seems like you love him and I'm going to assume there's a good reason for that since all I know about him right now is the phone stuff :P \n\n&#x200B;
6	ISFJ and sales	Do you like it? Do you hate it? Both? Do you use your ISFJ functions or use your unconscious or subconscious mind to do it? ESFP side or ENTP?
10	Hate it. Period. 
6	The thought of working in sales gives me anxiety. I'd be horrible at it. 
5	Hate. I hate selling and being sold to.
4	Would depend how far on the introvert scale you are. I think I'd be good at it but I would get tired of it pretty quickly. Every time I go to buy a car I always think about being a car salesman since I tend to know more about the car than the people working there. 
3	Pretty sure we all hate it
2	Hate it. Hate working in service oriented jobs in general. 
1	I think I use my subconscious and unconscious If i'm trying to sell something or try to convince others to do something or to believe in something.
1	I have to sell warranties on computers. I t hmm ink I use my subconscious mind and the determination and caring aspect of the ISFJ personality, which is why I'm so bad I know the warrenties are crap so I don't want them to buy them. So it's hard convincing them to buy something I would never buy. But I don't hate it and I guess that's cause I like talking about computers.
12	ISFJ & ENFP romantic relationship	Hi! \n\nI'm a 17F ISFJ who has a crush on a 17M ENFP and he likes me too. I've known him for about 1 year. I feel like we're total opposites, but we share the same interests though and that's why I fell for him. Our relationship isn't quite official yet, we've just hung out at our houses watching YouTube/Netflix and discovering new music. \n\nIt's just that he's so energetic and active! He talks all the time and I try my hardest to talk back interestingly  but I just can't. I'm super scared he will think I'm a boring, private person which I'm definitely not. I have lots of stuff going on inside me and I wish I could talk about them all. I'm scared he will get bored of me because I'm not a talkative person who talks about anything I think about. I almost never start a conversation. I wish I could do it.\n\nOf course I do talk when he asks something or we find an interesting topic to discuss - sometimes I just talk and talk and talk.\n\nI become attached to people very easily and it happened with him. I think about him almost all the time and can text him about anything but it's totally different when we're face-to-face.\n\nHow to become braver and more talkative? :( I know I can't change my personality entirely but I'm afraid my personality affects in our thing in a negative way.
9	Hi! I'm an ENFP girl dating an ISFJ guy. The first few months of dating were SO hard. Conversation  definitely didn't flow super naturally. If your ENFP is anything like me, he asks a ton of questions to get to know you. The easiest way to keep a convo going is to simply ask "what about you?" after you answer one of the questions! I would let him take the lead as far as starting a conversation, but try to ask these mirroring type of questions to keep the conversations going. My ISFJ and I bonded over our sense of humor, so maybe try that? Go to a stand-up show or something together.
3	 Be yourself!! Always always always!! \nENFPs don’t need a “perfect & cool” person with the best comments and conversation topics to be comfortable and have the greatest time. \nBe yourself and say what is on your mind, imagine he is your best (all life) friend and talk to him that way. \nHe likes you the way you are, and if you are trying to hide yourself, sooner or later you will get to know each other the way you really are. There is no point in hiding it, BE YOURSELF :D I am sure he will (and has already) fall for that person.\n\n(ENTJ)\n\n
2	I am 24F ISFJ dating 32M ENFP.\n\nThey will love to see you being comfortable and talking about things that are passionate to you. You don't need to be more talkative or force yourself into doing anything you don't want to do. Just be yourself. Find something that the both of you like to do and do it wholeheartedly. You can tease him lightly. Make him laugh. Encourage him to be the best him he can be without nagging. Be cute, be patient, be you and let him be him
-1	Types for the most part dont matter in a relationship. It's about both of you being mature and honest with one another. No games. Hard work. \n\nThe types only become important when both of you can't figure out why the relationship isn't working. That's when you see two mature adults mutually splitting.

21	Any ISFJs that feel misunderstood?	Hi, fellow isfj here.\n\nI'm wondering if it's common for isfj's to feel misunderstood. I often see things online about how intuitive types are widely misunderstood and misinterpreted, due to them being more rare, but I noticed that for a majority of my life, I too have felt that way as well. When I'm speaking or trying to explain something, sometimes the people around me think I'm reacting/feeling one way when in reality it is the opposite. I also feel as if the people I'm closest to are rather shortsighted and lack vision (and proper planning skills). As far as I can tell, no one in my closest family are xSxJ's (xSxP is very common). I noticed I tend to gravitate towards/relate to other xSxJs and xNFx's\n\nIn case it helps, I live with an INFJ (my mom, the person I'm closest to; she often knows how I'm feeling/how I think, but occasionally, there is some misunderstanding), and an ESFP (my grandmother. Very unhealthy version of type; there is often friction between us).\n\nI'm curious if any other isfj's have has experiences like this as well?
8	I think it's very human to feel misunderstood in their life,  whether it's during a period of time  or their whole life.  personally, I don't feel misunderstood. 
3	Do you feel more lonely than misunderstood maybe? I've always felt misunderstood although I have an INTJ friend who generally understands my blunt remarks to everything whereas most might feel offended while I have no idea why lol\n\nAlso may I hear your experience of living with an INFJ parent? I used to have an ISFJ girlfriend which is why I'm asking.
2	ISFJ here- proudly misunderstood by most people since 2010! Why be understood when you can be liked? \n\nIn truth, I have a few friends who do get me and I would lose my shit without them. Everyone else can get Fe-ucked (not really, but it’s often not worth trying to be understood). \n\nI have a lot of NT friends who are delightful, but I’d freak them out with all the feels stuff I’m into. 
20	I’m in love and I’m scared	I imagine this is a feeling a lot of ISFJs have....that moment when you know you are deeply in love with someone and not sure if it’s fully reciprocated but you don’t even care bc your feelings are so strong and you need to express them fully. That’s where I’m at now. \n\nIt’s such a beautiful feeling, having that much love and affection and care for someone; feels like it’s my life’s purpose. But I also hate it bc I know how hard I fall when shit goes wrong. \n\nMy current partner of about 5 months (ISFP) really struggles to concretely express affection through words. His body language would indicate to me that he feels just as strongly as I do, but also he claims he has never been in love with anyone before. \n\nI have no problem interpreting my emotions and once I understand them, I feel like I need to express them. I told him I loved him last week, to which he didn’t say much (which I expected). I’m not concerned that he didn’t say it back—I know words are hard for him. I’m moreso concerned that I’m being stupid and irrational and I’m mad at myself for putting myself again in this position that I desperately want (to be in love) yet am so scared of. \n\nWhen I care this much about someone and they hurt me, it’s ugly. Out pops this angry, petty, bitchy, demanding version of myself that I don’t even recognize. It’s almost like I put so much trust into them that it feels like the ultimate betrayal when things go wrong (ie breakup) and I backlash. \n\nNot even sure why I’m posting this. I suppose just wondering if any other ISFJs can relate? 
22	I think it’s only normal for us to feel scared when we really love someone, because it takes awhile for us to fall in love but when we do, we fall HARD and we are aware of how much it would hurt us if it doesn’t work out the way we expected to. We hate uncertainties and we have high expectations, because we also want our feelings to be reciprocated, and the fact that your ISFP isn’t big in words of affirmation, then I think it stems from that. ISFJs are big on appreciation, affirmation, and reassurance. I’ve learned that it’s always better to ask your partner about how he really feels about you than to overthink on your own and assume things that are far from reality. 
7	Is this written by me? Kidding aside, I can fully relate to this. I have always felt this way in the few times I have been in love. To me, to love is to trust in them so much that you give them the power to hurt you but believe that they won’t willingly do so. I know you’re not looking for advice and just probably want to be heard. I am hoping that everything turns out for the best in this relationship of yours. Being in love and being loved in return is one of the most wonderful experiences one can have and you’re brave to still go on despite your fears. I’m rooting for you.
5	Being in love can definitely be a strong feeling for ISFJs. I can relate to what you said about strong feelings that need to be reciporcated. I do value being honest with someone when I have strong feelings for them. I think you guys need to have an honest conversation where you talk about how you feel so strongly about him and are wondering if he loves you back. I always love it when I help someone and they thank me for all the hard work I did. 
2	never been in love, but I know it will happen.
3	Career paths and studying	Hi guys,\n\nI'm new here and I was wondering about what kind of careers or studies people here are doing. Online I find that such a type usually becomes a medical worker, teacher or social worker. I however am studying computer science which is completely different from the "usual" things. Is this just a stereotype or am I perhaps wrongly typed? I'm mostly curious as to what other people with this type actually do :P\n\nCheers
5	I was hoping to get into Meteorology or Psychology, but i havent even got into college yet. I got some time. 
4	I am currently in my last year of undergrad. I am studying Family Studies & Human Development with a minor in Psychology. I plan to get my masters degree in Marriage & Family Therapy (MFT) & plan to use my degree for MFT.\n\nMy ISFJ friend is in mechanical engineering, which I would say is different from what typical ISFJ’s go into. However, she did express that she is unsure about her major.
2	I'll do construction for a living. Mainly heavy equipment operations.
2	I'm currently in my last semester of college studying accounting. After I graduate, I plan to get my CPA. 
1	I got a degree in commerce and took some computer science classes along the way! I plan to get my CPA eventually, become an auditor.
1	I’m a chem major, currently going for BAS. It’s going about as well as you’d expect.
1	I used to be a science teacher. Now I’m in school to become a genetic counselor 
1	pre PA biology w hopefully gerontology minor
1	I'm a Geology major. I think STEM careers are good options for us.
1	I am an ISFJ, Got my B.Eng. in Electrical Engineering and currently been working as an Electrical Engineer for 7 years.
1	ISFJ - Female\n\nHm. So I had dreams of becoming a doctor in neurology or oncology since I was 15. Fast forward into college where I had traumatic events that ruined my GPA. So med school was out. I'm 24 now and only recently just let that dream go after a practical yet emotional conversation with my INTJ boyfriend. In college, I finished with two degrees, Physics and Criminology. And I also was in 3 different types of research labs: criminology, cognitive science, physics. Now I'm a high power laser engineer in the semiconductor industry. Decided not to go to grad school in cognitive science or physics, last minute. \n\nI stayed in STEM because I also did a lot of nonprofit work in college, but it made me extremely unhappy. I didn't like the work itself which involved planning events, organizing and leading teams, a lot of emotional workshops. I also didn't like the inefficiency I encountered and in the end, believed that in order to create an efficient nonprofit, I wanted a long term solution to being "nonprofit". I liked the idea of having companies create long term relationships with a specific nonprofit organization, so that there wouldn't be a need to scramble for grants and fundraisers. There also wouldn't be that risk of not having enough money, and it would be better to work on a guaranteed budget. So I thought, why not become the people I would ask for money from and focus on charities farther into my life. \n
13	Survey on Flirting behaviors and Personality	Hey I am a doctoral Student at a University in the South. I am studying flirtation behaviors, specifically trying to catalog specific flirting behaviors taken from several experimental studies. I was wondering if I could post to this community as it seems relevant to my topic. Thank you in advance for taking the time to take the survey there is an opportunity to win a gift card if the entire survey is completed. You can back out at any time.\n\nHere is the link to the survey\n\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JMQP5PJ
1	Hey I went to LA Tech too!
1	Question 15. It’s very vague and doesn’t role along with the initial profile question set. Also question 1 and 2 on the kick off have nothing in the question and or an input field. 
1	There are a number of questions on which I can't discern if you're asking about my specific opinion about, for example rules about gender roles, or if you're asking if the reader is aware of the socio-cultural norms and ideals about such topics
1	Please do let us know the results of your study, I am highly curious
1	You ask in the beginning about sexual orientation, but then ask questions about interactions with “the opposite sex.” I don’t think it should be assumed that everyone taking the survey is attracted to the opposite sex. There might be a more inclusive way to ask those questions. 
4	ENTP X ISFJ conflict	I have this ISFJ friend, initially we clicked really well and I started to let her know more about myself when most people wouldn't have the chance to. However recently she seems to be taking advantage of her knowledge about me and seems to be using it to make me feel emotionally negative.\n\nFor example: I mentioned that I do not like it when people ignore me when I am talking, and these days she purposely switches to another topic or totally doesn't reply me. I know that it was done on purpose since she was looking at me but didn't give any acknowledgement. She then goes on to intrude on my privacy by leaning in really close to look at my messages, even when I tilted my phone the other way.\n\nI used to be hurt at this behaviour, but I'm finally letting go. However, she is someone that I'll be seeing for some more years and I have no choice but to stay diplomatic. The thing is that when I start talking to her, I get sucked into our 'duality' and forget to close up, letting the cycle repeat itself.\n\nIt's a painful process, so I'm seeking advice here. What do you think about my situation? How can I take measures to prevent this from happening? 
6	Say everything straight. If you don't like X you say you don't like. ENTP/ISFJ relationship might be fun cuz you are subconscious to each other.
2	My ISFJ wife has an ENTP brother with ADHD. What helped for her was to avoid the initial reaction (which was often anger). This process wasn't easy, because these reactions were deeply rooted in youth problems. She went to therapy for this. 
2	She doesn't seem like a very nice person based on what you've written:-( I would work on not giving her any information about yourself. Focus on vague small talk or topics that don't reveal how you feel. However do so in a way that won't come off as "rude"  or "improper". You can try deflecting her questions by trying to make her do all the talking, ask about something she knows a lot about. \n\nFor an ISFJ(based on personal experience as one and what I have heard/read) information = power. 
2	Just be honest about your boundaries in this relationship. In a nice say that you want her to respect your privacy. That's honestly fucked up if she is manipulating you to get what you want. Definitely be honest about that boundary in this relationship. Also one thing we as ISFJs apperciate is compassion and reassurance. So tap into that child Fe haha. 
2	What a dirty cunt. 
5	It’s s(no)w joke! (Southern Arizona)	
2	I wanted to share another picture from yesterday. \n\nEnjoy! :)
1	Weekend Discussion Thread: Saturday night edition!	I forgot to post this earlier... Need to set myself reminders. 😑 Heh.\n\nSo what are you all up to on this fine Saturday night? I'm just driving around playing Pokemon GO a bit, then I'm heading to bed. xD\n\nAny plans for tomorrow?
3	I’m just chilling and rewatching my favorite sitcom. Tomorrow probably catch up on hw and maybe smoke pot after that 
2	Oh cool ive been playing Pokemon Go as well\n\nGot a few Clamperls and some Water types I dont see too often
2	I took a damp shower since my body hurts a little, it's very stiff. any tips?\n\ntoday its Sunday, so I'm going to just chill and watch cross country skiing on TV
2	I was voicing a friend's fanfic out loud with some of my other friends. It was honestly really fun, and I enjoyed it. 
28	Happy Friday!!! It snowed in Southern Arizona today!	
3	Thank you for this beautiful photo! I used to live in AZ and miss it.
3	Pretty! Always loved looking at pictures of snow. 
3	NIce!!!
2	Nice picture! It actually hailed in Southern California. 
2	How to stop alienate/reject people?	Like title said. I rejected too many people whole my life.
3	For me it was realizing that maybe my standards of people and myself was too high\n\nI had to lower expectations of everyone and myself that there will always be flaws to deal with\n\nStarting slow and getting more people in your life can make your group of people slowly expand just take it at your speed and start somewhere
3	How to develop my ISFJ side? [ENTP]	I'm a cold, mechanical, spontaneous, reckless, selfish, power-meandering analyst, that believes things only and only if I can do them alone for an abusive mean. (unethical heuristics)\n\nAnd even though I do not, for the heavens, want to change that, I now know I won't be able to achieve my dreams of being a good father, or even to live in society, unless I find a way to develop myself around that. I have very good relationships with children and I really care about my little sister. The problem is I cannot turn a blind eye and follow through things despite not wanting to do them or seeing no value for me in doing them. I continually downplay almost all ideas unless they are genuinely near-genius and my skeptical nature makes me see all, even genuine intentions, as something with darkness lurking beneath.\n\nBut I really want to learn how to stay focused, dependable, helpful, honorable and loving for a longer period of time, for that it's the only path to hope.\n\nIf that makes sense...
5	learn to not be so insecure with your Si, and then aspire with it.
3	Entp here, you sound so edgy lol. Just channel your inner normie and realize it's ok to have feelings, enjoy life. I got an isfj gf, we're very different but you shouldn't try channel being an isfj, just be a better Entp. Empathize with people's feelings, or at least try
2	Very easy - by hanging out with actual ISFJs. This is the quickest path to developing your own inferior and tertiary functions beyond immaturity. When you hang out together you'll absorb a lot of their behaviors and ideas that will then "fill out" your own weaker functions.
1	"I'm a cold, mechanical, spontaneous, reckless, selfish, power-meandering analyst, that believes things only and only if I can do them alone for an abusive mean."  \n\n\nHow often does this narrative repeat itself in your head throughout the day?
1	Anger. This is what often drives me to do selfless good. Everything is shit anyway so might as well be the one to actually do something about it even at my own cost. Stupid but idgaf because I'll driven by anger and disappointment.
2	ISFJ male cutting me off without explanation	hey everyone this is a throwaway acc\n\nI've known this ISFJ for about 7+ years and around a couple months ago there was a large misunderstanding where rumours were being spread that I was talking about people behind their back within our friendship group. No one really believed these rumours except him(I'd assume because he is VERY close to the person spreading them). I tried to directly message him(as we don't see each other often) with an apology(because he did seem very passive aggressive whenever I was in a  group call with him) and an explanation of the situation while asking what he thought of the situation, but all he had to respond with was a very short message of him wishing me the best, but him saying we should end it there.  \nI think that this was in an attempt to kick me out of the group(cause I do tend to isolate myself from situations)  \nHowever, this didn't end up happening and a couple weeks later we ended up having a gathering with our group.  \nThe interaction between us wasn't passive aggressive though, but rather something I found odd.  \nI found himself distancing himself from the entire group every now and then and it all seemed very unnatural?  \nI was wondering if he feels even remotely bad for cutting me off. He still interacts frequently with the person who initially spread the rumours and I don't even know if I want to message him again about the situation. Every time someone tries to ask him about the situation involving me and him he tends to just completely dismiss it(sometimes even meme it) and change the subject. It seems as if he has no reason to hate me/think i'm a bad person? Is it to do with staying loyal to the person spreading the rumours?  I'm very confused on what I should do. Is there anyway I can rekindle this friendship?\n\n&#x200B;
14	its my first post please don’t flare on me	I don’t know, maybe it’s just me and not an ISFJ thing but I just felt like getting this out of my system. \nSo I’m in my first year of university and it’s been amazing. Everyone is so great and cool. But I feel a bit behind, in a sense. Everyone seems to have something to say about the world, like politics and humanity and civil rights and stuff, things that feel very “intellectual”, if you know what I mean. I can never participate in those kinds of conversations because I can’t hold my own opinions. And I just don’t feel that I’m “educated” or “smart” enough to have those discussions. \nI’m trying to learn more about those things so I can at least understand what they’re talking about (and my introverted ass finally has an excuse to attempt joining the convo) but the more I try the more weird it feels because I’m essentially trying to be someone I’m not, if that makes any sense at all...\nIdk i guess i’m just asking for validation. anyone who’s had similar experiences?
7	First & foremost don’t beat yourself up about it!\n\nIf you haven’t traveled down the rabbit hole of “cognitive functions” I would suggest looking into it, Type in Mind seems like a very resourceful website because it breaks down each personality types cognitive functions.\n\nISFJ’s top weakest cognitive function is Ne (extroverted intuition), from what I understand, this is what sparks our curiosity & what triggers learning.\n\nSo for example my INTP boyfriend will go on about WWII or astrophysics & I kind of just sit there & listen, (frankly those topics don’t interest me), I do feel bad for not contributing to the conversation tho because I really just don’t know what to say. Or he’ll want to watch something educational & I’m like noooo 😩 haha\n\nIt’s just how our brains function, but if you feel embarrassed for not knowing as much everyone else in the group you can always do your own research on the topic & come back to continue the discussion.\n
3	>Everyone seems to have something to say about the world, like politics and humanity and civil rights and stuff, things that feel very “intellectual”\n\nTake it from someone who wasted too much time arguing about politics in 2016 - 99% of political discussions are the philosophical equivalent of gold-plated poop.  It's all just bumper sticker rhetoric and biased partisanship dressed up to sound smart so people can pat themselves on the back for being "on the right side of history".  The people who sound "smart" are often just reciting sound bites someone else came up with and don't actually have their own ideas.  This is especially true in the early years of university where 99% of people have spent their entire life living at home with little to no responsibility or real world life experience. Most conversations at this point don't even go beyond the first layer of depth to any topic since everyone's just learning these things for the first time. \n\nYou can learn a lot through active listening and asking pointed questions during these conversations.  Take your time figuring things out and let yourself be curious. But I think you just want to relate to other people who are in your shoes; my friend said the same thing to me ("how do you know all that stuff?") two years ago (age 26) and current me can confidently say I didn't actually know much at that point. I'd just spent a few months listening to conservative podcasts and reading opinion articles. 
3	I struggled with this problem in my first year of univeristy too, I felt really out place and the fact that I had SO MUCH to learn made me feel really uneasy, so that problem ended up being a terrible burden during those days. Whenever I tried to learn about something I didn't really enjoy, I couldn't keep any information in my head. But I can tell you that you'll be happier if you don't force it and just try to learn little by little all the things your environment asks you to, your years of study and the experiences you'll have to live will teach you.   \n\n\nPlus I can give you a little tip: if there's something you want to learn but it's really hard for you to do so, you can try to asociate that thing to something you actually really like. My favorite way of learning about history of the world, which was something that made me really worried because I didn't know ANYTHING, was through events on the history of film (which I had to study as a subject at uni), scenes that appeared on actual films, and music. 
3	Yeah, I think I do something familiar. Since we're like people pleasers, in a sense,  we want to get along with people and are interested in THEIR interests. However, as you said, we lose our individuality kind of because that's not who we are, really. \n\nDon't worry though, university is a big place and I'm confident that you'll find someone who has the same interests with you and can actually connect with you, mutually and not one sided. Don't lose hope! It's my first year at University as well, and it's such a big transition from high school. High school really didn't prepare me enough for University and life, haha.
3	Ah, the good old imposter syndrome. It's definitely a thing and you're not alone!! I was in the same boat back in my first year too. We meet so many new people with different areas of "expertise", knowledge, and interests so it seems like the areas we aren't as familiar with are magnified. I'm in my third year now and most, if not all, of my imposter syndrome is gone. To put it as politely as I can, people are actually way more stupid than you think lol. Now that I've made friends with the people that seemed so far and out of reach, theyre great and have inspired me to work hard. They also know that I am a competent person and have thoughtful opinions, so that put all my anxieties at ease. I hope you get through this OP, as you're definitely NOT less than those around you. It might take some time or as cliché as it sounds, just finding the "right" people.

28	How do you take it when someone doesn't like you?	I don't know if it's just me, but I've always taken it a little too personally when I realize that someone doesn't like me.  I'll feel this quiet sort of hurt, and spend time trying to contemplate why they might not like me (of course, it bugs me even more when someone dislikes me for no reason.) So other ISFJ's: how do you feel, or handle it, when someone dislikes you?
30	not well at all & i take it very personally. if im being honest, an unhealthy habit of mine is assuming that people dislike me, even friends, until we become so close that i'm absolutely positive that they don't. 
11	Yeah this can really hurt and destroy my confidence or ego. It's hard for me not to take this personally. How I handle this is by realizing that you can only do so much to get people to like you and in life there are going to be people that dislike you. Also, I try to figure out why they don't like me so I can improve if necessary or if I think what they are saying is inaccurate I'll ignore/tune them out. I know we as ISFJs can be super friendly and kind and want other people to like us. Spend time with people that love you can remind you that you are a great person.\n\nEdit: this article talks about ways this is a common issue for Fe users and what to do about it https://www.psychologyjunkie.com/2018/09/06/why-infjs-isfjs-enfjs-and-esfjs-struggle-to-let-go-of-bad-things/
8	I don’t handle it well at all, it shatters my already frail confidence. On some level I do think I deserve it because who could like me, I’m not interesting. 
5	I take it very personally and proceed to avoid that person. 
5	I'll try to logic my way around why and if I can't, it bothers me more. Like I'm still wondering why a receptionist I walked past yesterday gave me the glare of death. I keep reminding myself that feelings aren't always rational. 
2	It used to be the case that it bothered me and made me feel that I had done something wrong. Then I would forever feel ill at ease around that person and would make a special effort to try and change their opinion of me.  \n\nThat has changed as I have gotten older (I’m 43 now). Some switch flipped around the time I turned 40 and now IDGAF anymore.  \n\nIt’s liberating.  
2	You know when they have insecurity issues that they have to project it on someone smh like the perso  who doesnt like me\n\nI just dont pay attention to them nor be aware that they exist 💀💀💀\n\n
2	I was hurt in the beginning but I've gotten over it. I've had best friends turn their back on me as well. That really made me question myself for a while.
2	Terribly. I already tend to assume everyone hates me (arrgh) so apparent  evidence for that crushes me
2	Hurt initially, but I can let go, kinda accept it.. I don't expect people to like me, infact I am shocked if someone says they like me, but still it hurts me when someone doesn't like me, I've improved a lot over the years though, I can let go.. but then I tend to feel very self-conscious around them. I don't want to be a bother, more than anything.
2	It doesn't bother me that much. I get a bit internally sassy and then I just avoid them.
1	when it happens, I get a little bit down.
1	It bothered me when I was younger. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt doesnt really bother me at all now that im older (when I hit late 20s / early 30s)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just dont really care what a lot of people think anymore and why should I? I cant control that. 
5	What do you guys think about following careers?	[IAS](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Administrative_Service)\n\n[Banking](http://careerwiki.in/courses/career-as-a-bank-po/)\n\nI am basically lost. I don't enjoy anything. I am a science student but going for engineering don't seem a good choice cause I feel a bit lacking on technical side. I can easily solve problems which I have attempted before but on seeing a new sort of problem gets me a nervous breakdown.\n\nI want to know opinion of you guys about above mentioned jobs as these are the top premium career option in my country. And I will be taking risk which I am willing to risk. 
2	I studied electrical engineering and ended up in a career where I'm doing a lot more project/people management than I do technical work. I can't say I loved engineering when I studied it, but I do really enjoy what I do now, but I definitely did not expect myself to end up doing what I do now (working in construction)\n\nMy advice is to go for as many opportunities you can now so you can see what you do and don't enjoy.
2	Follow your heart. Even if it means giving in the financial comfort; doing something you love will more than make up for it. 
2	I'm an ISFJ going to school for radiation therapy. I really enjoy the physics behind it and know I'll be doing some math in my career while also working directly with patients. This field attracted me because of the patient interaction (I was previously studying chemistry and realized that no part of me wants to work in isolation in a lab) and strong physics background it requires. My first test was creating a radiation treatment plan for breast cancer which was super satisfying to figure out like a puzzle and in my day-to-day career I'll be executing these plans moreso than creating them but it's important to understand the physics nonetheless. A lot of science has applications in the medical field (highly suggested for ISFJs)  such as medical/nuclear physics, pharmacology, etc. Explore some areas and rule out what you don't want:)
4	"Offense to Truth"	
17	What is a trait that you posses as an isfj, that you wouldn’t want to pass down to your children?	
42	criticising myself so much that i lose all confidence and ruin my life for myself \n\n\n*laughs* 
37	Lack of assertiveness and weak boundaries, as well as being too strict with own preferences to the extent than I can get irritated if something doesn't go as planned
18	focusing so much on making sure that everyone else is okay that i don't help myself when i need to.
16	Taking things far too personally bc I demand a high level of respect 
6	My difficulty in handling other people disliking me - I know that I can't gain everyone's approval, but it brings my self-esteem down a pang every time I realize someone doesn't like me. 
16	always forcing what's moral behaviour down others throat and being so controlling sometimes
5	My high level of defensiveness when people are only joking.
3	My unhealthy Fe :((
3	Avoiding conflict to the point where I lost friendships and relationships instead of dealing with it. 
6	Insights needed: Signs of disinterest	So, I have this female crush who admitted that she's an ISFJ.  We are friends but our communication are very much limited to texts only. We did hang out in group and met one-to-one (her initiative) but the purpose of the meeting is only to pass her some study books.\n\nRight now, we're texting each other frequently. The content of the conversation are mostly her sharing of job seeking experience and asking for career advice. I spoke some silly things to her as well and she responded with laughters.\n\nMy only struggle in texting her is only one thing: sometimes she replied me quickly and sometimes the reply came in 5-8 hours interval and sometimes she didn't reply me at all.\n\nI wanted to know in general is ISFJ is:\n- generally friendly to everyone like she is to me\n- giving me hints that I should back off from texting her too much through slow replies/ no reply (signs of no interest).\n\nKindly advise me because I wanted to know the rough picture of the situation I'm in. I do not want to push her too much if she's not interested in me.
5	To provide a counter note, I rarely respond immediately to people who aren’t my boss. Sometimes this means I am comfortable with them, and sometimes that I am trying to make a good impression and it’s hard to decide what to say. Other data? 
5	If she’s backing off it means you’re showing too much interest and to slow it down. She likes you, but be more friendly than flirty. We take it at a glacial pace
3	Like the others I will reply asap if interested EXCEPT:\n\n1. if I want to craft perfect response because I don't know person well yet OR\n\n2. if I'm worried the other person will freak out/feel imposed upon if I do. If you've given even the slightest hint of annoyance etc in the past this might be at play.\n\nI'd suggest hanging out in a group again if at all possible and seeing how she treats you vs everyone else. That might be a clearer indication.
2	I’m consistent about replying to people I like ASAP. So if I don’t I’m either literally off the grid, or I don’t want to talk to you anymore.
2	I can go several hours to a day without replying to my boyfriend and close friends, and much longer with people I don't know well. I just need a lot of space and it's something they've had to accept. 🤣If she replies and sounds enthusiastic then you may still have a chance. I would definitely not press the issue and let her reply on her own terms. Best of luck!
2	we try to answer everyone, but to me; it either sounds like she's super busy or not interested.

3	Funniest jokes	What are the funniest jokes & puns that have made you laugh?\n\nWhat typically makes you laughs uncontrollably?
11	I like jokes that are a mix of silly and not making sense or clever but not too forced in either direction\n\nMy humor is probsbly also more mean/savage than youd expect from an ISFJ, I just have to hide it outside close friends or else not many people would like me
6	My humor is saying off the wall shit or watching people get roasted on. I also love morbid humor too!
3	My humor can be a combination of silly and dark lol. I like sitcoms when the characters do things that don't make sense One of my favorite comedies is South Park for the reason that the humor is silly and dark like I enjoy. 
10	Attempted explanation at Si?	While Se sees data points of "this surface is brown, it's hard, it is about the size of my ass, it has a perpendicular piece attached to the back," Si is creating a reason for why Se is seeing these things. The reason being "the object is a yew chair" and attached to that is a model of what a chair is(a supporting structure comprised of a hard base and a hard back). While Se is observing "brown and hard, and has a certain pattern on the surface" Si has summed all of these properties up by labeling the thing "yew wood." Similarly as much data as Se takes in about the structure of the object should relate all back and be explained by the fact that it is a chair.
8	Some notes I took/found a while ago\n\nSi (ISxJ dom, ESxJ aux, INxP teritary, EnxP inferior)\n-Retaining [To continue to use/practice an old custom]\n\n-Temperate [Moderate, Not extreme in opinion]\n-Indirect [???]\n\n-Impressionistic [Tends to judge things based on immediate objects/actions without attention to detail]\n\n-Habitual [Comfortable with sticking to things they already do]\n\n-Knowing [???]\n\n-Be one with ageless customs that i known even if what is reliable changes\n\n-Will experience something then quickly compare to stored memories in mind\n\n-Can easily detect if something doesn't match ip with what they are used to\n\n-Recall [Likes to think of things of how they remember they should be]\n\n-Takes relevant sense and compares with previous occurrences\n\n-Constantly comparing things and how they used to/should be\n\n-(dom/aux) Focused, traditional, realisitic\n\n-(dom/aux) Much less about experience things\n\n-(dom/aux) Go with traditional, what they are used to and "right" way to do things\n\n-(dom/aux) Enjoy being in positions to follow routine and used to\n\n\n\nSi\n\n\n- reoccurrence\n- Keep a tidy mental library\n- What I already see and know is the easiest way for me to develop an opinion on something.\n- What is different?\n- over-concern with realistic experience in order to repress unruly imagination\n\n
3	I think I agree for my personal experience. \n\nI used to believe I had aphantasia because I couldn’t look at a memory or mental image and be able to answer things like “what color was the chair?” I realize now, it’s because the key thing I’m aware of is the impression of chairness it left on me. \n\nSo when I’m reading a book describing something, I’m not seeing a movie being played out with all the sensory details. I’m kind of sensing the impressions the character has about their surroundings. If I had to draw that scene, I would have to sound out the exact sensory details-try out different colors of chair until one had the right impression.

4	A question for ISFJs	Hello, I'm a friendly neighborhood INFJ who has an inquiry based on our similar function stacks. We both share, if one is familiar with the theory, an incredible weakness in the 7th function; it can be called the blindspot, Polr, trickster, whatever really. Without it Ti is given free reign, and from there it prevents one from seeking out and caring for the facts of this world; it would rather rely on it's own methods(in theory.) In the INFJ one would give fantasy free reign and dominion over the mind, leading to dreams and visions of how a better world could be brought about. However, given the nature of Te it's unbelievably impractical, immeasurable, overly perfectionistic, and it leaves one with a pass/fail mindset in tasks. I imagine such fantasies, as they stem from some "underlying universal pattern", are product of an INFJ's Ni, but I'm unsure how it would manifest in an ISFJ- could you help me out? Is it the same thing minus the universal pattern part?\n\nSo yeah, maybe just explain some things that happen in your life that you think link Si without Te? Maybe there's a video that helped you understand it? Anything would be appreciated, thank you for your time.
2	I’ve always been allergic to Te. I don’t think about it, and it bites me in the ass. I despise the simple linkage between act/physical form and reality. I fear that kind of work above all else. Engaging in Te is deciding to engage in a mockery of what’s real-to me, Si and Ti- and engaging in the disgusting world of working towards a concrete goal. I despise workout plans, affirmation meditation, the bureaucratic pea cockery of job applications and fake interpersonal work dynamics. Information meetings, filling out tax forms, taking an overwhelming task one step at a time. \n\nI think Fe is the only thing holding me together sometimes. I don’t want to engage, but if someone else wants me to do something, I do it- and suddenly I am in the universe again. 
1	Jet's MBTI - Cast Podcast	Hey Reddit, my name is jetplane48 (ESTP 7w8 sx/sp) and I am starting up a podcast in relation to MBTI. Fundamentally, the goal of the podcast is to educate the viewers of several Typology systems through a series of one-on-one's with others who are interested in the same topics. I have been conducting interviews for many years (MBTI related) and this is just an extension of that, however, I want to discuss topics that the audience wants me to cover. Naturally, I'll come up with my own material but I would love to explore topics that others have in mind. I am busy with school for the next few months but when I finish, the goal is to eventually be more consistent with these podcast uploads if this turns out to be popular enough. I'm very excited to get this started, and let's see some questions!\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAR20eDTSOg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAR20eDTSOg)
4	Is it actually possible to love yourself as ISFJ?	something something 6th function/critic.
2	6th?
2	In regards to the question, yes, definitely, by proving yourself repeatedly that you are worth it. Of course every thing I don't do as right as I could kinda puts me down but then I look at myself and compare to the people around me and that makes me feel better because I can see some big differences in my favor (earned through efforts of course). Maybe not the kindest thing to do but it works for me. 
6	INTJ trying to make an ISFJ friend open up	Hello! I am an INTJ [21M] and I have this friend ISFJ [20F] who a while back told me she had a bad weekend and is dealing with this 'self crisis'. I do have a lot of interest in her, and I'm intrigued by the way she thinks and by all means I wanted to help and understand her. But when I asked about it, she deflected and avoided the topic alltogether. I know it's hard for her to just open up like that so I didn't push further when I saw she didn't want to give any details. At that point, we were not too close either, more like friendly acquaintances if even that, so I had no reason to continue on the matter.\n\nCouple weeks passed, we ended up talking a lot more. I could tell she enjoyed my company and on numerous occasions she was the one who initianed the conversation (which is totally out of her character, but she is definitely making an effort for our little friendship to work). On the other hand, I also enjoy it as I find people with a different view than me especially intriguing. \n\nThen yesterday, after a short chit-chat she tells me she had another bad day. Now at this point I am confused, worried and the curiosity is burning me inside. From my point of view, you don't go around telling someone you had a bad day without being at least a little bit enclined to share it. Therefore I assumed she wants attention. Furthermore, as I said, I do want her to share what's in her mind with me so I can get more insight in who she is and possibly help her or at the very least give her some feedback, yet again, to my surprise, when I asked her about it, she changed the subject instantly. I told her that she can be open with me, yet to be fair, I might not have been very clear.\n\nNow, my question for you ISFJs out there is if I should keep pushing considering I really want to know what's going on and understand her, or just let it go and give her some space. Rationally, she being an ISFJ, the reasonable choice would be to let her deal with her stuff despite that being against my interests if I don't want to end up dismissed by her. Though I can not ignore the fact that she was the one that bringed up the bad day in the first place.\n\nSo how can I go about her opening up? Is she not comfortable enough yet? \nWould you mention something personal to a friend without actually wanting to discuss that thing or go into details about it?
5	Often times when I say I had a bad day to a friend, I don’t want to talk about bc I feel that talking about myself seems selfish. She most likely is telling you that bc she wants you to know she’s having an emotionally down day, and maybe you can cheer her up. But it certainly is a way of her telling you to get that she may not be herself bc of it. A big part of her not telling you is that she may be afraid she can’t fully trust that you won’t share it to others or that you won’t judge her. She wants to share her pain, but spare you the details. I would emphasize that you care about her and she should be able to spill out to you bc you’d never betray her. I would only emphasize asking again if you made sure to let her know you want to be there for her. \n\nAlthough, I find concern in you saying you’re “curious” about her issues, which to me, as an ISFJ translates more to wanting to know rather than actually caring, and she may be picking up on that. \n
4	keep asking her if she wants to talk about anything, or if something is bothering her. "it might feel better talking to someone about it." but don't keep pushing if she says no.\nyou're a good friend,! she's lucky to have you!!
6	I would try gently asking her about it. Like the next time she mentions having a bad day, say something along the lines of, "What happened? Do you want to talk about it?" And that may encourage her to open up. Sometimes when I mention having a bad day I want to talk about it and sometimes I don't. If it's with someone I'm interested in, then I'm more inclined to talk about it when prompted. But that's just me- take this with a grain of salt!
2	INTP here. I can confirm my ISFJ girlfriend says this to me also. Def. an ISFJ thing. They get caught in the same over thinking kinda loop that INTPs do.  She's never told me what it means, but I know they dwell on the past, and I suspect she may be over analysing sad things. :(\n\nI too would like to know what it's about, so that I can understand her better and make sure she has what she needs. 
2	First and foremost, be honest with her. Tell her you want her to open up. Try to figure out why you want that, and also tell that to her.\n\nSecond, you might want to tell her that it's important for HER to open up, not for you in the first place. But don't push her because that way she might end up in defense mode. You might even want to tell that it doesn't have to be with you, but telling how she feels will relief so much for her. The fact that you tell her so might increase your chances that that person is you. This part takes a lot of patience. \n\nLast, try to be open yourself. This has a contagious effect. This might be a tricky one because you're not a feeler but there are feelings in there somewhere so go find them.\n\nBest of luck,\n\nAn INTP
1	i don’t know about the others, but in that context, i’d avoid the subject afterwards cause i’d be afraid of possible judgement from him/her (fi critic, ne inf). personally, i would want the person to show that he/she rlly does care and would not judge. that would signal the “ok” for me to share, to make sure that i’m not “burdening” him/her. u can do this by sharing ur problems first, then requesting for her to share hers too. kind of like a transaction? but more like assuring her that u feel close enough. \n\nand tip: after she shares her problem, reassure her that u understand and are not judging her for it. reaffirm this regularly for as long as u are still friends/wtv relationship u have with her. (u probably don’t have to try too much, considering the very good compatibility. that strong-ish fi should be able to curb this!)\n\ni don’t know if this’ll help. but best of luck 
4	just a daily application post for you guys!	this comes from a fellow isfj, and just reading your comments , seeing how you choose to Express yourself through words makes me smile! you guys are a big bunch of sweethearts! this sub never fails to brighten up my day, or improve my mood. you're like .. fellow teddy bears that needs to be protected at all costs. we are  so busy taking care of our close ones, but we also need to be taken care of once in a while. the best feeling, is just getting cared for when I'm down!\n\ndo you agree?
4	this is so sweet! i've been so happy to have this sub lately. i feel so understood reading through answers, they're so thoughtful and kind. i've been telling myself that i need to do a better job of voicing my needs and taking care of myself - neither of which i do that well. so i definitely agree!!
3	Neglecting an ISFJ	Hi, I am a 21 year old INTJ (guy) and my best friend is an ISFJ (girl). It's only been about 5 months since we met but we are already super close. I mean really close. I should say that we only have met twice in real life and that was during two inter-university event and yes she is from another university. Despite that we used to communicate everyday via phone or text. We never used to start our day without wishing each other 'Good Morning' and never end our day without saying 'Good Night/ Sweet dreams' . Our conversations may extend upto 5-6 hours each day. It's been the most fulfilling few months of my life as far as human relationships go. The thing is recently my grades have been gradually falling. Every time I try to open my books my thoughts wander of to the conversations that we had and I would mostly be looking forward to have our next conversation. I thought this was problematic and I talked about this to her and I told her that I was taking a kinda long break from social media and texting, including the chats with her.\n\nNow it has been about 30 days since we last talked. Even though I said I wanted to take a break from Social Media I used to stalk her stories and her profile almost every single day. Today I saw that she had posted some sad pictures about stuff like 'letting someone you love go'. She never acted like this and I attempted to contact her on messenger. It seemed that I couldn't find her. I had a crazy thought that she was referring to me when she posted those pics and she had deleted her fb profile. I kinda knew if she was upset about me she would not pick up my phone and so used a spare number to contact her. She picked up and she seemed really detached. I talked to her for about 30 minutes trying to cheer her up and asking her why she seemed upset. After a while her spirits seemed to rise and she began responding well. Before we hanged up she asked me to accept her friend request on facebook because we got accidently 'unfriended' when she deactivated her account. That was when it hit me that she might have actually blocked me since simply deactivating your account will never remove any of your friends.\n\nI am very much surprised about how all this turned out. She is probably my favorite person right now on earth and I have always found her to be very level headed and emotionally very mature. I never expected her to block me in my wildest dreams let alone be super upset about me apparently 'neglecting' her for a month. It puzzles me very much why she did not even attempt to message me even once if she felt neglected. I thought I had perfectly communicated with her regarding my need to find some space to take back my lost grades. I had promised her that I would get back to her once I got my life back on track. What surprised me the most is after this occurred I feel that she constantly **has** to be in touch with people that are closest to her, whereas I am perfectly fine with not communicating with my close friends (or even my family) for extended periods and being able to connect effortlessly later without the need for any such drama.\n\nI would very much appreciate your valuable take on how I should have behaved in this situation and what to do to not let her become upset again. I really like this girl and it means so much to me.\n\nThank you :)

4	I’m an ISFJ (18, F) and a very similar thing happened to me with an INTJ (17, M) who used to be my best friend. I’m pretty sure I can tell you what’s happening.\n\nISFJs are extremely sensitive and INTJs can be insensitive, so sometimes that can cause some problems (like the one you’re having). You may have explained quite logically why you need to cut contact with her for a bit, but if that happened to me, my thoughts would start spiraling. Let me explain.\n\nISFJs are extremely loyal, but also doubtful of their friends’ affection. It’s just an irrational fear a lot of us had. So when you told her that you needed to stop talking to her for a bit, that probably fed right into that fear. She probably began thought spiraling about whether or not you really liked her, analyzing your conversations for signs that you don’t actually want to be her friend, and just feeling rejected. That’s how I would react anyway.\n\nWhen my INTJ rejected me, I did what she did on social media. I never actually blocked or unfollowed him, but I posted some sad stuff about letting people go and being hurt by people. Honestly, I was hoping that he would see the posts, recognize that he was hurting me, and ask me about it.\n\nThe reason that she got distant with you is because she wanted you to chase her. She feels very hurt, confused, and doesn’t really trust you right now. She wants you to prove that you actually do care about her by showing her some attention. She’s thinking that if she removes all her effort from the equation and then you start putting some in, that’s evidence that you actually do care. Until she’s satisfied by the amount of effort you’re putting in and thereby convinced that you actually like her, she’ll be distant because she doesn’t want to risk hurting herself again.\n\nI know you may have logically explained your motives for not wanting to talk with her so much, but we’re human, so we don’t always have logical reactions. I can tell you, however, that we’re very forgiving (at least, I am) and if you just talk with her about it and put in some time and effort, things will go back to the way they were before. Good luck!!\n\n
2	Talk to her. Tell her how you feel. I honestly believe you didn't try to hurt her.
8	Weekend Discussion Thread of February 15-17: Snowmageddon Edition!	Yes folks, it's time for another one of these! My rambling below is not important though, feel free to ignore it and start your own discussion lol.\n\nSo, we've been hit with a TON of snow up where I am, far more than usual. And my landlord has been incompetent at getting the snow removal guy out, which means I've gotten stuck in the driveway more than once. I had to call CAA this morning because I got stuck with my back wheels off the ground and I was two hours late to work. Also, yesterday I got stuck in my friend's driveway and burned up my tires.\n\nSo this morning the landlord told me the plow guy can't come until tomorrow at the earliest. Well, the windrows left by the city plows are easily 2 feet high in the worst parts, and I didn't own a shovel, plus there were none on the property (I searched). I borrowed a shovel from a neighbour this morning and cleared a little path. This afternoon I came home from work and the city plows had pushed the snow up like I wasn't even there this morning, so I kept on driving and went to Canadian Tire. Bought one of those ice breaker sticks and a small shovel as well as some salt and some engine oil (unrelated, wanted to top it up). Returned home, parked on the street, went to pick up my friend, went to Lowe's and bought a more intense shovel. Came home and shoveled for an hour. We made a car sized path to get into the driveway, and I got in with only some back and forthing required.\n\nWe were going to go to a pub but called it quits because shoveling tired us out. Oh well. Now the other neighbour with a car just came home and got stuck, in the driveway though so at least he's there and not stuck on the street so he won't get a ticket, but I'm not able to get out again until either the plow guy comes, this guy leaves, or I shovel my way out. He's using the shovels/ice thing I left outside now to try to get unstuck. I asked him if he wanted help but he said no, he's fine.\n\nThe driveway fits ten cars (five by two) so it was no easy feat to clear out space. I left a big mountain in the middle of the driveway because it was too difficult to throw the snow up onto the person-high piles that already exist by the curb.\n\n/tipsy ranting
4	How was Valentine's day for you guys? Mine was spent alone. 
3	In the past 3 weeks, I've had school cancelled 6 times and delayed 3 times. Due to the way we also do things at my school, i dont have to make a single one of those days up. Whenever we get a snow day called, the work is put online and that's counted as our school day. \nI honestly find delays worse than school getting cancelled now. \n\nAnd in other news i had a physics test and precalculus test on Thursday. Passed the physics with a 90% and the precalculus with an 80%. Happy about both ^^ 
9	Tinder mess!	I \[27F\] ENFJ met my so called bf \[29M\] ISFJ three weeks ago on Tinder, and we decided to date exclusively -his idea!\n\nWe both deleted Tinder app and decided to try to make things between us work!\n\nYesterday we were watching a video on his phone, and Tinder notifications popped up, he lied and said it is the phone problem and he does not know why the App still there, I asked him immediately to open the f\*\*\*ing app, was 22:00, and found a conversation that started 21:00 while he was on my bed after a great movie night out, he was sending 'hi' everywhere to random girls!\n\nI felt stupid to be in that situation! I felt hurt and I feel shit now! if someone could cry until die; I would be writing this from the grave!\n\nWhat to do?\n\n\*\*TL;DR;\*\* :\n\nDo you think if I continue with him he will do it again? or it is just 'mistake' as he said frankly!\n\nDo you think once a 'Tinder' user you would not quit and settle ? cause you know 'the sea is full of fish'!
34	End it. It's not worth it. Real talk.
14	In my (potentially unpopular) opinion, Tinder is not even remotely the kind of place you should look for exclusive relationships.  This guy says he doesn't feel safe in a relationship unless he's having sex within 3 weeks which is just ridiculous.  Based on the little I've seen in this post, I think this guy just wants to get laid with minimal effort and only asked for exclusivity in the hopes it'd move him towards that goal.\n\nI say dump him and Tinder if you're looking for something meaningful.
11	He lied and he isn't willing to be open with you. That's not something that can change right away. It is serious stuff rooted in who he is and what he sees in you. And it is clear he doesn't respect you or see you as someone worth being honest/direct with.\n\nLet him go. He isn't interested and will only drag on juggling between not respecting you while wanting to find someone else and lying to you to avoid conflict.\n\nFind someone better and better for you.
10	If he lies about tinder, you might as well get out while you can. The dudes probably lying to get laid. Nobody lies about deleting tinder like that unless they got some plan. 
5	after THREE WEEKS he's already lying to you? boy, bye. he's a grown-ass adult, there's no excuse.
4	Behaviour is repetitive; past behaviour almost always predicts future behaviour. I’d bet money on it happening again. You deserve better than that. 
4	It would be different if he owned up to it, but the fact that he tried to play it off is a no go.
4	Either he feels you're going to break things off with him at some point, or he hasn't been open about how he feels about you. I suggest talking it out. As an ISFJ, if I feel safe in a conversation, I'm more willing to share thoughts I typically keep to myself.
1	I dont think this really relates to ISFJs. He's just a lying selfish scumbag that isnt worth your time!
6	What would be the point of you having an INTJ aeound?	There's an obvious pattern of me going places, meeting someone, becoming their friend, and then realizing they are an ISFJ. I think they like me because of my ability to give them intuitive insight that they simply cannot derive from a situation themselves, in addition to other aspects of me such as my work ethic. I feel a bit bad that ISFJs are so trusting because the ones I've known have gotten into abusive situations in the past and continue to make that mistake as we speak (despite me saying that the person is terrible and predicting their behavior accurately, oof). I also appreciate the quality immensely however, because a lot of people are weary of me and INTJs in general I imagine.\n\nThose are my reasons, what are yours?
5	I have an interesting relationship with my INTJ friend. We have known each other for almost 20 years. She simultaneously intimidates and impresses me. I look up to her and I think she looks up to me too. We get along very well and enjoy talking about the people in our lives. Like some other old friends, I am nervous to impress her when we meet after it’s been a while. But then talking with her is effortless as usual. I don’t know why I get nervous. 
4	My INTJ friend makes no judgements, but has high expectations of me - and as an ISFJ, it makes me want to work that much harder to meet them because I know that he believes in my potential. And for me personally, that’s the kind of pressure I need to push me to be better. \n\nYou’re dead on about the intuitive insight - something I know that I lack, but his point of view really helps when I need to remove emotions from decision making and in turn after reviewing the situation, I’ve made better choices. It’s a quality I’ve found truly invaluable!
3	My boyfriend is an INTJ. I have a tremendous amount of respect for his work ethic and even though it’s super annoying when he works on something for hours because it has to be just right, I admire him for it. I’m sensitive and want to have my feelings validated, which he doesn’t always understand - until I directly tell him I need him to validate my feelings. He doesn’t understand why I get wrapped up in my clients cases but I have a tender heart and he knows it. I think that’s what he values in me. I think he understands that the need for me to help others is just gonna be there no matter what. He’s quiet too, which allows me to babble on while we’re together. He’s the one I spill everything to. Mostly because he sits there and listens intensely and absorbs all of it.\n\nI’ve just learned to get straight to the point and be semi mechanical when I need him to understand something. I’ve also learned to pay close attention to what he does for me to show me he loves me instead of what he says because he’s awful at the sweet compliments. But man when he does get one out I value the hell out of it.
50	Definitely belongs to our over analyzing personality type.	
6	WAITTT lmao sameeeee, the thinking and crossing to walk parallel.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProbably why I'm gonna stay single ripp. Confidence negative percent, and I don't want to be perceived as a weirdo by her because I'm probably making her uncomfortable even though she probably doesn't even care.
5	True.
3	Follow u/SrGrafo for new comics daily and visit us at r/SrGrafo for a full collection of his comics. cheers!
2	Hahaha relatable. 
2	Lol me
1	Even worse on a hike hahaha
1	sometimes.. but often not
3	It's been 3 years and I don't know what I am waiting for	English isn't my main language so if you guys think that my writings are funny that cud be the reason. Soo yea, I have been friends with an ENFP guy for 4 years now and have started to fall for him since 3 years ago.  I'm 100% sure he knows how I feel (I told him & also hinted to him numerous time) but the thing is, he never respond to this. He is always silent when it comes to this topic and I know "no respond is also a respond" but I feel like without a proper closure, I'd just keep thinking there could be a "what if" between us. He is a good friend and he helped me alot during my tough times so I do appreciate him for that. I am not sure if his "silent respond" is to prevent himself from saying anything that could hurt my feelings. \n\nAlso he is not showing any typical ENFP traits that could mean he has feelings for me...for example \n\n* He never compliments me. Not even once though. When I ask him about this he'd just say I shouldn't fish for compliments and that I should make myself feel good, no need others to do that \n* He love teasing/making fun of me. Literally anything I said can become a joke/tease by him. Its not like an insult or what though, more like harmless fun. \n* He'll help me whenever I need it. He never force me to tell him the whole story too, he'd just jump in and help out when I need it or ask for it. \n* He listens to everything I said and give me his comment after. \n\nHonestly I don't know what to do. Should I really give up on our friendship just so I can let go of the feelings? I think I need a closure from him but I feel like that's not something I'd ever get from him. I feel like am not ready to date other guys either cause I always feel something is missing from them or am comparing him to other guys. \n\nCan someone wake me up perhaps? \n\n&#x200B;
1	>He never compliments me\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe's just not that into you (hug) You've been friends for 4 years and he's never made any romantic moves towards you. ENFP men are not shy like isfjs are, they will not sit on the sidelines for 3-4 years without saying/showing that they like you\n\n&#x200B;
1	I think you need to flat out tell him “i've been falling for you for the last 3 years, is there any chance something could happen between us?”\n\nMaybe your advances aren't as obvious to him as they are to you. Or maybe he really isnt interested, but i think having him tell you that flat out will help you find closure. What's the point in pining over him if he's made it clear nothing will happen? So i think you should just let it all out and see what he says.
21	I somehow get so offended when someone makes fun of something I like.	Hear me out here. I think it has to do with a few things: if I really like something, I've done my research and have determined that it's the best option for me at this time. Then I think it's also just good old fashioned sensitivity. 😅 Anyone else?
13	Which is maybe one of the reasons we tend to be a bit private?
9	Yeah it often feels like a personal attack on who I AM because I don’t soften feel super attached to those things. It’s almost territoriality. I too read a lot about what I like \n\nEdit: often, not soften 
6	Omg this is totally me too. It’s annoying. Wish I could detach.
3	agreed! 
3	it used to bother me and i'd spend time to figure out why that something else is better or how i missed it. often it'd be people talking out of their ass.\n\nso now i have become indifferent towards the comments. its kinda sad because it's making me closed toward certain experiences.
2	How common is this, really?
2	My isfj boyfriend is the same 😂
3	My wife and I are going to the library. She’s an ISFJ and would like a suggestion from a fellow ISFJ for a book to pick up. Any suggestions?	Title says it all 
1	I like non-fiction books but when I was teenager I liked thrillers. I cannot say for the rest of ISFJ family tho.
1	The entire girl with a dragon tattoo series 
1	The Help\n\nTo Kill a Mockingbird\n\nThe Kite Runner\n\nRebecca\n\nThe Boy With The Striped Pyjamas \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI enjoyed all of the above massively
18	how do i use Fe-Ti properly	Fe doesn’t feel natural to me. i have the urge to help others, and also have empathy for them, but i can quickly switch it off immediately making me very cold in a instant. when i try to act on my Fe, it feels awkward and tiring. \n\ni think i’m in a Si-Ti loop at the moment. i’ve seen the other post made about it but am still unsure about how to use Fe to break it.
8	In Socionics Fe is our “tool” function (everyone’s 2nd function is). So it makes sense you’d be able to switch it off. This is common with me. In the moment I can pull Fe out and be that sweet and charming with a hint of modesty (typical Si/Fe combo), but once I’m alone I just turn it off. It’s a bit of a chore to use on my end as well, even though I enjoy it at the same time. I think his is normal to varying degrees for isfjs (or any type with their 2nd function).
7	Check out These two links it provides solid information about how to use Auxilary Fe and Tertiary Ti properly.\n\n[https://mbti-notes.tumblr.com/theory](https://mbti-notes.tumblr.com/theory)\n\n[https://mbti-notes.tumblr.com/post/121692868877/how-functions-work-auxiliary-fe-isfjinfj](https://mbti-notes.tumblr.com/post/121692868877/how-functions-work-auxiliary-fe-isfjinfj)\n\n&#x200B;
5	ISFJs what is your enneagram tritype?	My tritype is 9w1 2w1 5w6\n\nIf you don't know what your tritype is you can take a test on it here\n\n[http://enneagramuserguide.com/enneagram-tests/tritype-wing](http://enneagramuserguide.com/enneagram-tests/tritype-wing)\n\n&#x200B;
3	Don't remember my whole tritype. It gets complicated. I know one of my types is 6, but it seems to me more to be that I tend to be in a state of disintegration, so tritype just seems more complex than it needs to be for me. The main type is an effective enough descriptor for me. It has helped me better think about my relationships with the people around me. Enneatype 9 seems to correlate strongly with introverted sensors.
2	1w2
2	What is enneagram tritype?
1	I got 6w5-1w9-4w5\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI find myself getting 6w5 alot on multiple websites, haha.
1	1w2-2w1-6w7\n\nI always get different answers every single time I try to take an enneagram test, but that’s what I got from your link 
1	9-5-4\n likely Enneagram Tritype with wings is: 9w1-5w6-4w5
1	I got 2w1, 1w9, and 7w6. I don't actually know what this means though.
1	I’m a 9 too! Somewhat balanced but closer to a 1 wing I think.
1	ISFJ is my most often type but I think I’m borderline on the functions. With that caveat, my enneagram is almost always type 6.
1	4w3, 9w1, 5w4
1	Am skeptical about tritypes, but main type is 9w1. 9/4/6 seems to be about right.
1	9w1 5w4 2w1
1	I got 1w2, 4w5, 6w5 
1	 **9-4-6** \n\n **9w1-4w5-6w5** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoesnt look like there are many matching in the thread. The definitions on the website seem a little wishy washy though. Each of those 9 types could be made up by anybody. 
1	1w2. I love to be right and I love to help. Don’t know beyond that yet.
10	Weekend of February 8 to 10 - Discussion Thread: Get to know each other!	Hey everyone~\n\nIt's time for another discussion thread! Since it's now evening where I am, I decided it was time to post this. So, here we go. I guess you can just talk about anything you want. Let's all become friends here!\n\n:)
13	Hi everyone! I'm about to graduate from college in May so I'm pretty anxious about it all. There's nothing particularly interesting about me, but I'd like to think that I'm an approachable person.
9	Hello \n\nI am boring and my daily life basically amounts to:\n-Eat cereal for breakfast\n-Go to work\n-Eat lunch\n-Finish work\n-eat dinner\n-Play video games/watch anime/go on discord\n-Sleep\n\nOn weekends swipe out work for more hobbies and maybe once every month or 2 hang out with friends\n\nHow are you guys?
10	For me personally, I work full time but also have three close friends I see regularly. One of them a few times a week on average, and the other two are a couple and we hang out maybe 3-4 times a month. I kind of want to change that, though.\n\nThen I also volunteer for a local animal shelter and soon also for a social services organization in my community that helps low income families in need. :) I start the second one next week!\n\nI also have a cat and several fish tanks. I also like to read, sometimes write, and occasionally do something artsy like paint. And I play Pokemon Go, which keeps me busy sometimes when it's not freezing cold out!\n\nRight now I'm sitting on the couch watching Salvation. I'm in the middle of making Nanaimo bars, but I have to wait for the base mixture to cool before I can add the next layer!
9	Hi everyone! I’m pretty simple. I work full time and spend my free time eating, working out, spending time with my family, and reading. I’m really routine in my day-to-day but really enjoy that. ☺️ 
8	Yay!!! I’m so excited that we’re doing this! 😇\n\nHi Everyone!\n\nI’m a 22 year old ISFJ (F) & I guess the most interesting thing about me is I have Congenital Nystagmus (visual impairment). I have night blindness as well as horrible depth perception. It’s difficult for me to read 12 point font or to see license plates/street signs. With the technology of bi-optics I will be able to learn how to drive !!\n\nI’m in my last year of my undergrad (Family Studies & Human Development with a minor in Psychology) & will hopefully be moving by this time next year to pursue my Masters degree. Once I’ve completed my schooling I would like to use my degree for Marriage & Family Therapy. \n\nCurrently I am working on undergrad research with one of my professors on food & housing insecurity among college students.\n\nFor one of my Major classes I am working on developing some sort of workshop/training/career day that focuses on educating students K-12th grade on visual impairments as well as providing them with tools that they can use to advocate for accessibility for people with visual impairments (eventually I would love for this to focus around ALL disabilities, but since I am familiar with visual impairments...obviously lol...I started there)\nThere are still quite a bit of details to be hashed out, but this is the skeleton of my idea 😜\n\nMoving on...\n\nI have a cat who is about 14 years old & a red-eared slider turtle who is about 21 years old 🐢🐈💕\nIn a perfect world I’d own 5 cats, at least 2 dogs & a micro pig lol\n\nFRIENDS is hands down my favorite show & I’m usually watching beauty or lifestyle related YouTube videos.\n\nI’ve also been dating an INTP for 3 years\n\nIf you have any questions please feel free to ask :)
7	well hello there, I just woke up, and in my free time I like to ; read self help books, do skincare, read manga, be with my family and sometimes close childhood friends, be with my cat,, I like taking walks and exercise,, uwu. I am also trying to become better at reading non verbal cues!\n\ndo you ever think about how fart takes up such a big part of our lives?\n
6	I’m 24F, living with my INTP boyfriend in a different state than the one we grew up in. We both work full time. Some big changes came our way in the past two months, we had to get a new car (our old one was cost-prohibitive) and a new apartment, and he also is starting a new job. Things are changing a lot at once but we are making it work. We are celebrating our 12th anniversary next week! 
5	Hello! I'm just a 18 year old ISFJ nearly out of high school. There's really nothing extreme to say about me, I'm a pretty average person. My daily routine is: wake up, get ready for school, go to school, come home, do homework,surf reddit/watch netflix (flash and arrow atm)/listen to music/talk in my discord communities/cuddle withy cat, eat dinner, and fall asleep very easily. \n\nI have a huge passion for music, especially edm. 
5	I’m a Romance junkie. 🙄😂 Me Before You is my all-time favorite and so far nothing has absolutely torn me apart yet made me long for more than that book. After You, the sequel, is great too. I otherwise try to read the books they have for free on Kindle. There’s some hidden gems in there, some not so much. You just never know until you try! What about you? u/variableidentifier 
5	I’m 22 years old and I’m graduating college this year. I have mixed feelings about graduating on one hand I’m glad to graduate college but on the other hand I’m going to miss all the fun times and friends I made in college. For fun, I mainly play video games and smoke weed haha. Oh my major is Accounting. 
3	Yea hi everyone. This week i came back after two month of uninterest to MBTI subs. I love how this sub became more active, I love thread like this. Please make it regularly, admins!\n\n(still confuse on typing myself but yea i don't really care about it now.)
57	Trying to Find ISFJ Memes be like	
17	they always seem to be about baking cookies for everyone lol
8	Ask the INTP subreddit to make you guys some
9	Despite being one of the most common mbti personality, our brotheren don't give a shit about MBTI.
41	Gotta love ISFJ doms	
8	whoa is this a thing? i'm an isfj and a pretty major sub. but the times i have been a bit more dominant it has felt good but i've not followed down that path at all... maybe i should
6	Dominating the oven.
5	Ok, this is pretty funny!
6	It's true tho lol
3	dominating the fridge maybe lol
2	Hahahahaha this is true
4	Participate in my MBTI Survey	[Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1WMhQAkegNdJ-A3xJcFrW-nFWrr7GmA0hZas0JV9VNgo/edit#response=ACYDBNhQ0PU1TZRvnGkP7PGc90QBwl3lFCfIB3vZtgcv085JbaqmtEYnxBTSVuifSUBK2rE)
3	If I were a smart person and I am I wouldn’t click that.
1	How to fix Fe and Ti Loop?	I am just fellow Isfj that consider my failure in those functions department. I cannot open up to people and try to cope with that with Ti function. It was once proven by psychologist I visited to solve other issue. I don't know what to do actually. Any advices?
2	I discussed this issue in this thread and it includes tips for getting out of the Ti loop. \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/isfj/comments/aj4k2s/the\_siti\_loop\_what\_it\_is\_and\_how\_to\_get\_out\_of\_it/](https://www.reddit.com/r/isfj/comments/aj4k2s/the_siti_loop_what_it_is_and_how_to_get_out_of_it/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wish you luck trying to break this loop! I know it can be hard but it will be really rewarding and worthwhile in the end. 
6	Opinions on Conservatism/Right-Wing Politics	I've seen a hypothesis that SJs, more than any other type, is prone to take conservative/right-wing views in various degrees of intensity more than any other political world view, and I want to test it out in the real world of ISFJs (i.e. all of you). What do all of you think about  the usefulness/validity/desirability of any of the varieties of conservative thought out there? 
1	So I'm pretty sure I just realized we don't have a set of rules in this sub, but just in case, I think it goes without saying that any attacking of others for their political views, or similar behaviour, will not be tolerated.\n\nI don't expect problems in a sub full of ISFJs, but you never know who's lurking!
16	Personally I'm very left wing. I don't believe that conservatism and other such right wing values tend to be in the best interest of a lot of people, although I certainly do see where they would have their applications.
7	23 F, definitely more conservative than my friends. I’d say mod-right on a lot of social aspects (except LGBTQ bc I’m not an angry old person). Also very fiscally conservative when it comes to economics, taxation, and things of that nature. My fields of study are Econ and politics, so my bias has not be influenced by my upbringing. I was raised in a modest, apolitical household. I find myself more inclined to support conservative views bc they just appeal to my own moral code I have created thus far. Can’t explain it. Since I was a kid I have always found myself appalled at some things people do in public or perhaps how liberal they can be about their bodies. I tend to be “sexy” but still conservative, if that makes sense. I’m very self-aware of those watching, so perhaps that’s why
5	My parents are very conservative and I didn't really question their views as a child.  I became moderate as a teen, then liberal as an adult.  While I might be considered conservative in my personal choices (traditional gender role, would not want an abortion, respects the law, don't drink/use drugs, religious), I don't feel like others have to make the same choices to be good or moral people.  Also the "caring for others" aspect of ISFJs is another big reason liberalism appeals to me.  
6	I tend to think of myself as fairly conservative, though where I live is so ragingly right-wing most people would consider me a liberal. I think the conservative ideals of fiscal responsibility, smaller government, and personal liberty are spot-on. I left the Republican party several years ago as I don't think it represents those values any more. Personally, I think the majority of the right has pretty much jumped the shark at this point. I love the leftist values of compassion and community, I just tend to think those things are better left to the people than to the government.
3	24F, I consider myself very liberal and progressive. 
3	I'm liberal. I think something like this could be more influenced by how you grew up than what type you are. However, as you get older if you are interested in politics you can like look into politics more and decide for yourself what side fits more with your beliefs or worldview. 
3	Honestly, I know that there's this whole stereotype of SJ's being the conservative ones, but I genuinely think a person's political views are influenced partly by what they grew up around, and partly by what they of course personally believe. Most of my fellow xSFJ friends are liberals, but I'm sure I could find just as many who are conservatives.  Haven't interacted with enough xSTJ's to really say anything about them. I have Fi-using friends who have more conservative views simply because they have conservative parents - half my ISFP friends are "rebellious liberals," and the other half have picked up the views of their parents without truly realizing it.  I do disagree with my INFJ mother sometimes on politics, but that has more to do with me feeling like she brings her theories into the conversation of politics - in general, both of my parents lean toward the liberal side, and I'm absolutely liberal. 
3	I tend to lean more to the right.
3	I was always socially liberal but I became fiscally conservative in high school and even more so in college. It had to do with learning about economics mostly. My parents are conservative but they didn't teach me their views until after I had already formed my own.  Learning sociology is what shifted me to full on liberal.\n\nThough there is a emotional struggle I dealt with regarding my left and right leaning beliefs. I remember a while back there was an infographic comparing left and right beliefs. A section of it was about parenting styles. \n\nIt showed the left wanted self nurturing kids who are open, empathetic, and examines themselves. And parents on the right were shown to want self reliant, disciplined kids with strong morals. It's generalizing but it still hit me. \n\nLet me find it: https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/left-vs-right-us/\n\nAnyways, so I realized I had started life learning all the parts on the right part of the family structure. I had strict, hard working parents,  who weren't nurturing but pushed me to achieve. But I had to teach myself all the stuff on the left side family structure to build friendships and toward my goals for how I want to parent. Which is a combination of self reliance and also self nurturing. \n\nAnd I've found that what I learned is that my ethics, my politics, and my philosophy is all emotionally driven. I wasn't completely convinced by the studies and statistics alone. It's all about how I view myself and my choices in the world and how I feel about the world that allows the studies and statistics to sink in.
2	I'm a libertarian.
2	left wing
12	I want to connect with fellow people/fellow ISFJs! Anyone feel similarly?	Not really sure where this post is going, but I'm sick of joining mbti discord servers advertised in here and finding theyre all full of INTPs... No offence but they're usually a bit weird imo. And I mean, my boyfriend is intp and hes weird but in a lovable way. But it's just not what i was hoping for.\n\nSometimes i try and trawl /r/makenewfriendshere or /r/needafriend. I want to help people out but usually i get frustrated because i feel like i can't (usually because they need professional help). But i just feel a bit lonely and want to talk to more people sometimes :(\n\nif anyone has any suggestions, let me know please :) <3
7	I always found the best way to make friends is to join a group with similar interests. If one likes singing, join a choir. Like photography, join a photography club. Like reading, join a book club. Like nature, join a walking / hiking group. Like gardening, join a "grow your own food"- club.. 
2	This is not really a suggestion as I have not tried it myself..but I have seen the school of life has made an app to help people make friends and it seemed to be aimed at us, introverts. Give it a try if you want :) \n\nAlso, I understand the frustration of wanting to help people and not being able to. As I found that it is hard to get people to say whats wrong when you can feel they are in distress. 
2	Meetup.com (also sorry)
23	Were you a socially awkward child?	I was a very shy and reserved kid, and was often bullied for various reasons, my Tourette syndrome and general social ineptness being one. Nowadays I am waaaay better at socializing and can more easily fit into a group (although some groups are too complicated and sometimes I just prefer not to).\n\nI was known as being very quiet as a kid, to the point where people were shocked if I spoke. 😅 Also, I offended more than a few people by not wanting hugs and such! These days I just take a deep breath and suck it up.\n\nI'm wondering if maybe some of these situations were due to underdeveloped Fe, as I've heard that doesn't really develop until early adulthood. Alternatively, it could have been that I was unhealthy (had severe untreated anxiety up until a few years ago when I finally acknowledged it as a problem), so I was in a Si-Ti loop, grip of Ne or whatever.\n\nThoughts? Similar experiences? I'd love to hear 'em!
22	Yes... and a socially awkward adult.
9	yeah, at school i were very quiet, and i only had two friends, but they were younger than me and not in the same grade as me. Even just a few years ago there was a guy in my class who thought i was mute.\ni was very quiet, and I still am. \n\nI feel like I have gotten more comfortable with myself, but I also feel like its intimidating that I'm so quiet?
6	Seconding being both a socially awkward child and adult.\n\nHelps it was harder for me to find people who had the same nerdy interests as me untli I got older which I think didnt help my awkwardness.
5	I actually have vivid memories of being really outgoing and funny as a kid, but come to think of it, that was always amongst a fairly large friendgroup where I trusted everyone enough. Outside of that, as well as around figures of authority I would have no idea how to act or what to say.
3	Absolutely. I was very quiet and shy as a kid. My favorite activity was being alone in my room reading books. I hated talking to strangers. I’ve gotten a lot better as an adult when I realized I don’t mind sharing personal details with people I trust. People think of me as outgoing even though I’m an introvert. I just like to see different friends and bring people together, even though a lot of social activity does wear on me. I feel that social anxiety creep in when I’m by myself in a crowd of strangers, or just worn out after a long day, or when I have to speak in front of an audience. But I’m not sure if it shows.
3	I am INFP and I had very similar experiences pertaining to social anxiety in childhood. I used to be awkward in most social situations. \nI assume the kind of environment we are brought up in has a big part to play in our social attitude, especially as kids. I grew up mostly around people who I consider aren't nearly compatible by personality type to me, and it took me a very long time to realise that, there were more people, who were more concurrent with my interests. This I now figure took a big toll on my social abilities and outlook.\n
3	Yes. And I was more comfortable around adults than other children (because they were more predictable). But luckily I had one really close friend throughout my childhood. And then at high school I got less shy, and more friends. 
3	Yes, though nowadays i try not to label myself as such. Im still in high school and I feel not even trying to consider myself that makes me more confident. I only have 2 close friends in school, and I guess a few other less close ones. (Though I'd consider them more like nice acquaintances) 
3	Shy and kinda quiet but still friendly, outgoing, cheerful. I was a happy smiley child..
3	For sure! My parents got the concerned "does she talk at home?" from teachers all the time during parent-teacher conferences.
2	Oh, absolutely.  I secretly craved social interaction so, so much, but I felt like other people would find me boring and so in school settings I kept to myself and did my work (which apparently led to some people thinking I was stuck-up in middle school.) When my mom took me to the park, I'd barely talk to the other kids - I didn't really know how to relate, even though I wanted to.  I'm sure having two introverted parents and an introverted sibling didn't help my case.
1	Yup. Still am as an adult, but I’m leagues better from where I used to be 
1	Yes, I was very awkward. Kind, but completely clueless about what should or shouldn't be said or done in situations. I probably annoyed a lot of kids. My behavior started to become more normal around when I was 14-ish.\n\nNow, as a young adult, I probably seem like your average Jo, but people who know me more personally say I've got some Asperger-like traits. I don't think I have enough to get a diagnosis, though. 
1	Yup I was for sure. I had autism so that made things like making and maintaining friends hard for me. As a result, my Fe was pretty underdeveloped and I had stronger Ti. I was definitely super shy as a kid and looked forward to school being over. I had to even attend a program to learn proper social skills. People were also shocked if I spoke too. 
10	What car do you drive and/or what kind of car would you want to drive?	Just wondering. Personally I drive a 2011 Subaru Impreza. I love Subies; my parents have had them for years. My first car was a stick shift 2001 Forester, then an automatic 2005 Impreza, and my car now is a stick shift. To me they strike a good balance between fun and practical. What about you?
8	Honda Fit for me. Hondas never gave us mechanical issues when I lived with my parents and the hatchback design means I can transport decently sized cargo conveniently. Gas mileage and high safety ratings are both great, too.\n\nMy ISFJ SO drives an SUV because she's tiny and likes feeling big, lol. 
3	I currently have a 2003 Toyota Camry. I know it’s old but I’m a broke college student lol. My dream car would be to have a Toyota Prius. 
3	2016 Chrysler 200. If I ever won the lottery I'd buy the new tesla roadster
2	I drive an '02 civic and once it dies I plan on having a Subaru Crosstrek!
2	'06 Corolla.  It's still chugging along fine and I'm in school right now, so I probably won't be getting a new car for a few more years.  I don't really care about what my car looks like, I'd just like more inside comforts since what I have is very basic.  Also car tech has changed a lot and I want that bluetooth and backup camera.  Thinking of maybe a Honda next? (I'm so wild and adventurous!  Honestly, reliability is most important to me.)
2	I have a ford fiesta in bright blue :D I'm not too picky with cars as long as they're clean and run well. I do prefer smaller cars like the one I currently have, though. Easier to park & less stress when changing lanes.
2	I went with practical over appeal. ‘08 Suzuki SX4 JLX. Nothing beats 8 months of winter like a front wheel, all wheel drive, manual transmission on all weather treads. I like to disengage the electronic stabilizer to drift with the wheels locked in AWD. 
2	Have a 2012 Honda Insight. It was originally my brothers but he liked my 2007 Scion TC more. I do like the perks of paying less for gas and much less often.\n\nI don't really have a dream car, I just want something red and has good milage and 4 doors that's not too big.
2	First car was a 2006 Chevy equinox in red, not my favorite had lots of issues and spent lots of money on repairs but it worked for college travel back and forth 2.5 hours! Now 3 years later I have a 2015 Ford Escape🖤 I needed something reliable for my 40 minute work commute. It’s black and if you look closely it’s almost glittery, has heated seats and came with a remote starter, I couldn’t be happier!
2	VW Jetta, but I want an old jeep Cherokee.
2	2009 VW convertible Beetle. Metallic pastel blue with black top. I would love to upgrade to a newer model in the future.
2	2008 bmw 128i. Huge european car fan. A car id love to drive though would be an Ariel Atom or an Exocet. I love the feeling of going around tight twisty turns fast lol
9	How do I (M,30, INFJ-INTJ) support a depressed ISFJ (F,25)?	I have an ISFJ acquaintance/ friend. While this has the potential for a long-term friendship, we don't know each other that well. We just meet one-on-one every 6-8 weeks for a semi-professional goal, and that's it. However, over the past 6 months that I've known her, I've seen her gradually lose interest in her life and hobbies and goals. I feel she is depressed and I want to be supportive. At the same time, I'm not sure if I want anything apart from a platonic friendship with her. Any clues on how I can be supportive, without crossing any boundaries? I care deeply for her, and if she is really going through something, then I want to be there for her. \n\nISFJs, when you are in pain, how do you like to be supported? 
10	You sound like a nice person to know, but as an ISFJ (a fair bit older than your friend) if I were 'confronted' as it were, I would retreat further and probably start to avoid you. Do you know if anything notable has happened in her life that she's mentioned in passing perhaps? Or you feel could be a trigger for the change? Sometimes I find talking through an 'issue' with a fresh - non nagging - perspective really helps, especially if I feel that person is genuinely concerned about me.    \n\nHow often do you chat/text in-between your meet-ups? Sometimes when it's written, rather than in a phone call, we have a little longer to prepare a response and give away as much as we need to (or not! I'm quite private unless I want to share) Maybe a "You've not seemed yourself recently, are you doing ok?"  message. It seems bland, but is kind enough to show concern, but certainly not overstepping the mark. \n\nJust my thoughts, I hope you can find a good balance to help your chum. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL:DR - don't push or we retreat!  All the best. 
5	23/ISFJ/F: You’re really sweet to care. As an ISFJ, most of my healing comes from just being left alone. If I’m ever confronted, like the comments above, I’m more likely to avoid it and then avoid the person wondering, or just fib altogether and say “I’m fine”. The best way to handle this, I think, is just to let her know that you’re there if she wants to talk and let her work through that. ISFJ’s are “fixers”, so it’s hard to feel like we’re being “fixed”, despite the good intentions behind the question. Just keep being kind to her! She’ll work through it. 
6	first of all, this is very very thoughtful and sweet of you.\n\nwell, if I would feel depressed, I would like people to actually ask me how I'm doing (because most people don't do that) with a real interest, and seriousness in their eyes. \nIf I then would open up to them, telling them what's bothering me and so on, I would like them to comfort me, but also come up with real good advice - especially if the advice is based on concrete examples from past experiences, but also with a touch of ... poetry. with a touch of abstractness to it.\n\nto be honest,  just the feeling of opening up and venting to others are more than enough,  just feeling seen by someone!\n\nI wish you good luck!
2	Just say something like “I’m concerned that you are depressed I want you to know I’m here to help you get through this tough time”. Also Knowing that my friends and family are there to support me but also not forcing me to open up before I’m ready. Just knowing that the people in my life care about me so much makes me more likely to open up. I wish you good luck.
16	Random ISFJ ways you like to organize things	Some things for me\n\n* I keep a queue of order what games/shows/anime to watch, a mixed order of preference and when it came out (I'll also include release/starting airing dates of games/shows)\n* Every month or 2 I peruse my social media follow list to unfollow people that either dont post anymore or I dont want to follow to make sure my timeline is relevant and not cluttered. Especially since I'll randomly follow people I feel like I should\n* I started keeping an inventory of food so I motivate myself to eat out less. \n\nI use a lot of list organization in Todoist and Trello
5	I keep a text file with various lists of what I want to do (things to read, watch, play or learn) but only rarely I follow through them and instead I usually just waste time browsing other stuff. How do you guys do it?
3	I keep a pretty intricate log of my life in a journal. Everyday is broken into ten lines, with a line representing a block of time.  Two pages is an account of my week, and then every month, quarter and year I will jot out the highlights and try to reflect on the period a little.\n\n...It keeps me mentally compartmentalized. I understand where I've been, how I spent last week, or yesterday without forgetting. And a measure of accountability to myself so I am not frittering away time. It's a way of keeping my life organized in the most broadest sense I guess. 
3	Reading how other ISTPs organize themselves makes me feel a lot better about my countless Notes in my phone and lists I keep
2	I do #2 and #3! Costco really helps cut costs.
2	 I do #2! I also keep a checklist in my head of what I should do. I try to keep it down, but it's hard. But other than that? i just am by nature
1	Definitely 1 and 2 here. 
1	I have questions. You keep 2 to do list apps? No paper lists, but 2 apps? \n\n(hides my sloppy paper lists. *they are the best I can do*)
1	I have a spreadsheet that lists all my fixed monthly expenses, the amount, the day they are due, and the way they are paid.\n\nI also have a planner where I keep track of my migraines, where I keep track of what I eat (I sometimes forget), and keep various reminders. I mainly only open it to write down my food, though.\n\nI also use a lot of Google Keep notes in my phone to keep track of stuff.
1	Not random but I keep track of bullet notes in my phone app. For example, things to do, things to save up for. Since I usually like things tidy and organised, I see myself doing that random. For example, when I know I have the time to do it and once I decide to clean this, I'll start organizing this and that until I'm satisfied with the results.
1	-i go on unfollowing sprees\n-religiously started following phone calendar for class schedule\n-have a note on app of food bucket list, songs to download, dramas/movies to watch\n-i also have a whiteboard to do list i try to update each day
2	Song Recommendations?	I’ve been really bored with my music lately & I’ve been craving new music 😩\n\nYou know the drill 😜\n\n
5	I have some albums for you to explore with my fav songs !! \n\nSza- Ctrl: normal girl, love galore, drew Barrymore, broken clocks \n\nCardi B- invasion of privacy: be careful, I do, bartier cardi \n\nAriana grande- sweetener: R.E.M., goodnight n go, breathin, Pete Davidson \n
3	I've been obsessed with Post Malone's "Sunflower" lately... Also the new albums by Weezer and Papa Roach. So different from what I usually listen to, but ahh I'm enjoying them so much!
2	What genre of music are you into?
2	I'd be happy if someone can find some Chillstep to their taste. [Electus - Metaphysics] (https://youtu.be/5wPHJzdEnAA)
2	Any trance, EDM, old rock and pop songs. When you feel really REALLY shit listen to some jazz.
2	If you like Rap, Noname is awesome! Her flow is off the charts. 
1	Don't listen to radio... 
1	what kinda music do you like? :)
1	Room25!
28	Are you stubborn or can be in many situations?	Generally Im a passive/go with the flow kind of person\n\nBut if theres a task I really want to do, even if its something small I'll do whatever it takes to do it\n\n
11	yes, if i start something i have to finish it no matter what. i sometimes get ocd when minor inconveniences come up when i had a plan already
5	Usually, unless i get bored. 
4	Outwardly I often go with the flow, but on the inside there's a granite wall of determination. I tell myself I will accomplish no matter what. \n\nSometimes this is a bad thing, because I will chase after a lost cause of a goal long after I should have just cut ties and let it go. But there is something satisfying in achieving what looks impossible... so sometimes it ends up worth it.
3	I’m exactly the same way. Didn’t know this was an ISFJ thing. 
1	YEAH. hell yes.
1	Same, I'm very go with the flow kind of person, except that I am immovable when it comes to some of those very very few things I believe in :-)
2	I need help with typing!	Hi! Sorry to be a pain yet I really need help typing! I thought I was a INFP type 6 (I’m sure on the enneagram) and always just about type as one (like N/S and J/P is equal) yet after taking a functions test I got ISFJ.  I think I’m almost in between the two! I don’t know which I am!\n\nI think I use Si a lot (likely too much!) I always have flashbacks and little things can remind me of a certain day or time. I’m never in the moment and always thinking of the bad things that have happened in the past. I also notice the really little details, yet a car could almost run me over and I wouldn’t have a clue!\n\nI heard one of the differences between INFP’s and ISFJ’s is that INFP’s tend to think about their goals and fantasies while INFJ’s tend to carry them out, yet I don’t think I really do either. I never have any energy!\n\nI think maybe the enneagram type 6 sums me up better than a mbti type? I can’t really put into words what I’m like yet type 6 is pretty spot on!\n\nI overthink and panic a lot! Like all day long (maybe that’s my anxiety though!)\n\nI’m also very curious. I always like to know what’s happening and why it happened. Although this doesn’t always help as I tend to remember the bad things and replay them in my mind (like after watching a sewol documentary I stayed up till 3am crying my eyes out as I was so frightened remembering all the horrible things)\n\nI’m shy, cautious, innocent, curious, sweet, kind, bubbly, quirky and nervous.\n\nI tried my best to explain yet I probably didn’t do a great job, yet any help would be kindly appreciated! Ty! 💓
2	Since you have a desire to find your true personality type, I heard it helps to read the cognitive functions. Try reading the difference between those two types. \n\n"What stands out to you the most?" Is what I heard from others since I also wanted to figure out mine myself.\n\nISFJs have Si-Fe-Ti-Ne\nINFPs have Fi, Ne, Si, Te\n\nYou can search for cognitive function descriptions. Understand them and read other people's experiences from them, it can help. \n\nI think we only know ourselves better so I don't trust many people's opinion on me, they don't know me. And everyones different obviously, descriptions don't describe us exactly. I think cognitive functions are more understandable to know how and why we act, and helpful especially in personality typing. \n
4	Keyboards are a good start. You can get them as cheap as $10 these days.
11	How do you act once you're comfortable with someone?	I met an ISFJ at the start of last year, he was reserved, but friendly at the same time. He talked when I asked him questions (I talk a lot), but for the rest of the time he was comfortable just focusing on his work. I got used to him being around, but not saying much.\n\nThen he actually started making jokes and being openly (bluntly) honest, I was so confused, like what just happened? He's shared information that I'd deem personal-when he mentioned it, I was shocked-like sh\*t, what do I say? I wasn't prepared for this!\n\nIs this how you act once you're comfortable with someone? Or, is this how ISFJs normally act, but around people they don't know, ISFJs seem more reserved? 
12	Once I'd trust you I become more talkative and goofy around you. 
10	That seems rather congruent with how I act. I'm reserved at first, then get very open once I trust someone.
11	Congratulations! You've crossed the barrier of trust with a commonly self protective type. If this makes you uncomfortable I'd recommend being clear about it. I'd much rather have the opportunity to slide back into my shell than to realize some time later someone wasn't ready to meet the real me.
3	That is 100% exactly what I do. I see no point in “small talk”. There’s no substance or direction to it. I’m either all-in or quiet & focused.

5	Hello 1684th mbti server.
8	Can't STOP talking?	Okay. I was going to try to write this post without being longwinded but I can already tell it's going to be a page stretcher, so there'll probably be a TL;DR at the bottom if you want it, but I'm going to explain a lot of context things for my specific situation in between. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, I'm an ISFJ through and through. I'm also a type 6w7, if it matters at all, and on top of it I have moderate anxiety which is where I get my habit of 'anxiety talking'. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've found that in the workplace and in social situations where I'm not surrounded by people I'm very familiar with, or care to get close to, I don't speak unless I'm explicitly spoken to OR if I need to ask a question, otherwise I'm content to just sit and watch conversations play out around me. But when I'm with friends, this is 100% the opposite. I've found that I have a bad habit of going on forever about something, even (a lot of times) rambling/circling the same thing over and over again/taking forever to get to the point. This might be anxiety, but I'm starting to wonder if it's something in my personality? When I notice myself dominating the conversation like this I don't FEEL anxious, I actually feel excited in the moment, until the realization hits that I've talked for way too long and everyone else has things they want to say, then I feel guilty, and then when I try to stay quiet and let them talk, I find another point I want to chime in on (this is usually during group discussions about what we think, so it's entirely valid to chime in on things, it's just the fact that I take up so much time talking it turns into a Ted Talk by Me on accident.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know I can be a good listener if I try, it's clear I can do it when I'm at work, so why can't I do it when I'm with people I'm comfortable with?? I know I'm able to speak more BECAUSE I'm more comfortable with them, but I don't know how to condense what I have to say down into a way that EVERYONE will understand AND have it be short. Also, when it comes to listening, it's not like I don't listen well at all, because when my friends DO talk, I DO listen, so it's not like I'm a bad listener so much as I'm a bad.. talker? Except instead of too little, I talk too much. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI only know 2 other ISFJS in real life, one is younger than me and one is a lot older than me and all 3 of us have anxiety, but I notice that the younger one is a lot quieter than me/is very patient with what they have to say, but the older one can go on tangents too, almost similar to me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR, finally: Do any other ISFJs have an issue with talking TOO much in friend groups??
9	i end up doing this sometimes. i used to do this alot when i'm with a certain group of people but now i'm more aware and try to open up a conversation. \n\nalso noticed, this happens when i'm with a group that's more reserved/quiet than i am
6	I am also quite chatty and can't seem to shut up with people I am comfortable with or have decided to trust. I have confused many people because upon meeting me they think I am super quiet and then once I'm comfortable, bam the floodgates open! \n\nI constantly struggle with it. However three people have told me that they don't mind my chattiness because they don't have to worry about keeping the conversation going. \n\nI think as long as you do your best to make sure everyone gets heard, it's okay:-) 
5	I am too, with my family I sometimes get in a mood where I just BALABAJABALALALAABLABLABLA.. lmao\n\nbut I have gotten better at it.\n\ndon't feel guilty ok?
4	Honestly, I do have my moments with friends and family where I can't stop talking. But usually it has to be one of my favorite topics. My family says I'm super passionate about my favorite topics. Most of the time though I don't talk that much and I'm pretty chill for the most part. 
3	WOW, this whole post is me! I’m also an ISFJ 6w7. I can very much relate. I felt like I was basically reading about myself. :) 
3	I can relate. Mainly when it’s something that im really interested in like car. Youll never get me to shut up if i start talking about cars 😂
3	I can totally relate to this as well! With people I'm not comfortable with, it's a struggle to find my way around my thoughts and actually say something that would make sense. But with people I feel close to, my mouth never seems to stop and my listening skills takes a backseat. It feels a bit embarrassing but people actually appreciate this because they will get to know you more, compared to the super composed mask that we usually show the world. 
2	Oh my god I'm the same way! I'm a 6w5, so I tend towards being quite reserved at times, but once I get to know someone... I could talk forever. Haha.
1	Lol omg it gets worse in letters.
6	ISFJ in group works	Hey, I just have to write a paper on my group work and I wondered how fellows ISFJ are in group works.\n\nSo basically, we were 5 in my group and we have to write a 30 pages report for yesterday.\nThe natural division would be 6 pages for everybody.\nWe had like a month to do so after the end of our group work. And we already done the repartition of the work.\n\nI have started really early so that 10 days before the deadline, I had already finished the parts I was supposed to write.\n\nBut group works is what it is, some people didn’t do much or anything, so yesterday the report was 22 pages long and I had to completed/organized it to make it longer.\n\nI couldn’t bear that we don’t finished the report, so I felt obliged to do so even if it weren’t my parts.\n\nStill, I can’t be mad at them because I know that group works always end up like this.\n\nSo, how do others ISFJs handle group work ?\n\n
4	Incredibly relatable. I often find that I can only rely on myself. Try going to your professor maybe or track down another person in your group who has the same work ethic as you to approach the professor with you or just help you pick up the other members’ slack. It’s incredibly annoying and makes me dread group work but easier than the anxiety of ruining my grade because of someone else.  Not sure how to explain why we do aside from Si planning skills.
4	that is exactly how I do it. Start early, finish early. I do my part and sometimes people can't finish their part and so i make up the rest because it has to be done and someone has to step up and do it.\n\nin middle school I used to be more enthusiastic at the start of a group project. I would actively be part of the discussion on assigning roles and organizing work. I was so active that i'd pretty much take the lead. \n\nHigh school and college was different though. After a while, I realize that that enthusiasm is a tell that when things get hard, people know i'll put in that extra work. of course it's only a tell for those looking for it.\n\nso i stopped showing that enthusiasm at the start of a group project. i'll still do the needed work or extra work at the end when it needs to be done, most times for understandable reasons. it's just i'm cautious about getting grouped with a slacker that relies on someone else picking up their...slack. \n\nThere are a rare few people who treat doing work like a game of chicken. It's like they're holding a good grade hostage. It happens, and it sucks to be stuck with them. So i just don't make it feel so easy for them right off the bat. I keep my diligence and perfectionist tendencies a secret.
2	In groupworks, I want things done and accomplished so there has to be a leader. It's groupwork, we have to lead as a group. And that includes managing other people. I advise, really encourage others to step up on their work. If they need help or ideas then as a group, help them with ideas. Strive for that goal or a goal. When you see something wrong, fix it, I think you would know what's most important/right thing to do it that situation.\n\nBut if you're looking for how ISFJs do. I might be an ISFJ but heres my experience... I focus on my work before checking on others. When I know I am good on my work I check on others work. Since I may take too much time on myself then I have to consider my work is theirs and their work is mine, since its groupwork, credit is everyones.\n\nI first work my part, ask if it's right, look over it. Help the group with ideas along the way. Correct changes and see if the order makes sense. If some things don't make sense or are wrong, I want the group know the changes we should make and reasons for it. If they don't agree, then just I would bare with it. If we get things wrong its the group, including every individual. One opinion can help change someone's perspectives. I heard groupwork is also valued in the workplace. Imagine the times when you had a job and what would you do on this job, what you should have done. You are counted on the responsibilities and things you need to do on the job.\n\nMy work is everyones work and my work is theirs, in groupwork. Its hard to do someone elses work because we may not be taking the credit (might be better to kick them out. Lol.) But yeah, I'd just do my best and move to the next assignment. Better to finish than quitting.
29	Do you ever listen to music on repeat while you're stressed?	I find the best way to tolerate life stress is to listen to whatever song I'm currently into on repeat. Sometimes for a few hours at a time. Anyone else? I guess it's the fact that it's familiar so I know exactly what's coming.
8	Typically is a whole album on repeat. One that just hits how im feeling in that moment perfectly. 
6	Repeat on specific songs or albums. Then I tend to go down a rabbit hole finding similar songs with similar sound to build a small list for repeat.\n\nIn reference to memory threshold for us ISFJ’s:\nI use to get to the point I could call the next song on my 50 disc changer. Would fall asleep with it on shuffle and a timer. Only took a couple weeks and I had the whole thing catalogued in memory. Needed to switch the disc sequence to give myself relief of having to know the song coming up and that I didn’t like it.\n\nDo you find your favourite number within the range typically on a disc is usually your favourite song of the album?\n
4	Yes, so much so that I have permanently associated songs to stressful times in my life haha\n\nHide and Seek, Imogen Heap - unemployment 2018 \n\nCome Give Me Love, Tee Gardestaad - Unrequited crush 2017\n\nYuuri on Ice Free Skate - Thesis 2016\n\nAnd so on. \n
4	Yeah I love listening to enjoyable music from my past. I just love how listening to music makes me decompress from my day. 
7	Music definitely helps me to process my feelings and to de-stress. I never listen to the same song on repeat though, I’m afraid I would get sick of it!
3	Yes. And especially some good rock music. Love it 
3	Yeah. And depending on the level of stress, I’ll sometimes listen to the same Album on repeat for several days.\n\nMusic seriously affects my emotional state so if I’m stressed, I will listen to whatever helps reduce that stress and keep it on repeat. 
3	This os so me
3	Yep guilty of this too haha
3	Whenever I'm at a difficult time in my life, I go back to the songs that were popular when I was younger. It gives me a feeling of comfort of when times were better and easier.
1	not really
1	Not really. I'll find something to binge or maybe a comedy to laugh at. When i listen to music, i do use it to stress out sometimes, but really i use it to keep me calm. And i cant listen to a song on repeat for very long unless i really like something about it, which doesn't happen to often. I can only name like 10 songs i've ever sone it with. 
11	Just curious, what careers are you fellow ISFJ’s in? How do you enjoy those careers?	I am at a point in my life where I am considering career options, and I wonder if those with this personality type are drawn to particular careers.
7	My ISFJ girlfriend is currently in the finance department of an assisted living facility but wants to move to managing the care aspect of the business.  She says she doesn't really want to be directly involved with caretaking of residents but instead sees herself in charge of the caretaking operations as a whole.  I think she believes that gerontology is her calling and she enjoys what she does!
7	My ISFJ wife is in social work and likes to work with young people on the autism spectrum. 
6	Computer Science major, but I do testing/QA instead of Programming.\n\n  \nProgramming is too stressful/difficult, QA I can use my detail oriented, organization, and decent speaking/people skills to better use while still being able to use computers that I love a lot.
2	Supposedly ISFJs are drawn to more traditional careers in academics, medicine, administration. I work in economic development, which is quite social and political. I wouldn't say I thrive in this field, but I enjoy it immensely.
2	There have been several of these asks in this sub. Have a look at them as well. \n\nUser Experience/Web Specialist for me. \nTrained in Lean Manufacturing practices that lends itself well to root cause analysis. Which I really love digging into and coming up with a solution and supporting data with it.
1	Any Marriage & Family Therapists ?
1	Healthcare for sure...I’m graduating soon to begin my clinical rotations for radiation therapy (perfect balance between physics and patient care for me)
1	Freelance translator here!\n\nI work from English to French, which is my native language, in the technical and legal fields.\n\nI get to work from home in an environment that I control (apart from the occasional keyboard-blocking cat), without worrying about social interactions and keeping my "social energy" for friends and family.\nIt involves a certain deal of perfectionism, but I don't get to get swollen by it too much because of the short deadlines. \nI enjoy being able to accept and reject orders depending on my capacity to handle work (mental health varying a lot sometimes). \nI'm specializing more and more in legal, so I regularly go to university or training sessions, which keeps the job interesting.\nThe texts that involve a bit of creativity are the most stimulating and also the ones that get me the positive client feedback. \n\nThe downsides are sedentarity, irregularity of orders (and therefore income), and little to no feedback from the clients, which means I don't get to know if my work was okay-good or okay-meh (but I'm always told when it's bad-bad).
1	I'm at a point in my life right now where I'm interested in almost everything (course, still in school, so haven't decided on a career!) I want to learn computer coding, I want to volunteer at the homeless shelter, I want to speak out for my community, I want to become involved in my city's politics, I want to write an analysis of a movie, I want to intern for anyone, I want to join the track team - I'm just willing to do almost anything safe and learnable.  I really, really, want to expand my knowledge this year.

5	Happens to much.
3	Yep
2	one of my closest friends recognized this as a trait of mine and, on his journey to become a better person, has stopped asking for my help as much.
3	Infj wanting to celebrate Valentines with ISFJ.	I love buying presents, but I think he thinks I just keep buying him junk.  Should I ask him specifically what he wants or should I just plan an activity?
6	You can ask him what he wants and ask him what his honest opinion on the stuff you bought. You should also plan the activity
3	kjeezy0127 is right, ask for his opinion.\n\nThough for me, I don't like things. I like activities to do together. My girlfriend likes physical gifts but knows I don't. So we have to give to one another differently. \n\nhave you two discussed love languages? \n\nWords of affirmation, acts of service, receiving gifts, quality time, and physical touch.\n\nwe often want to show love how we recognize/like being loved. as a person that doesn't enjoy gifts, i don't think of giving gifts as that strong of an indication of affection. but people understand signs of affection differently depending on their upbringing. like some sort of language. a love language if you will.\n\nthere are tests online to figure this stuff out, but i don't trust tests or person bias when taking them. I just look at the list and think "what do i like? what do i respond to?" and ask my partner the same. and know to then adjust how we show affection so the other person can receive it better.
1	Thank you
1	Oh that’s funny! My sister is an infj and she loved giving gifts. Although I appreciate every single one, I am a huge minimalist. In fact, having too many things really stresses me out. However I almost always prefer practical gifts if it must be tangible. I agree with the few others here. Ask. Also as mentioned, experiences. Feed our Si with experiences we can look back on fondly. ;)
1	I bought a Groupon for an hour of shooting bows.  I am still dying to buy something else, maybe just his favorite candy.
1	Definitely ask him what he wants! Nothing warms my heart more than being asked + then receiving a present I actually want, as I have extremely specific preferences that you will never know unless you directly ask me. I'll show polite interest in all the gifts I receive but I often feel a bit sad. Then I immediately feel guilty for not loving what someone has picked out for me.
7	Changing food tastes.	My ISFJ wife would like to know if anyone else notices when they change a flavour even the slightest bit and if that irks you because you remember exactly what it should taste like.
6	Yes! Also oftentimes I'll remember a food from my childhood but when I try to make it, it just doesn't come out the same. The slightest difference is noticeable... So irritating.\n\nPossibly has something to do with the fact that I also don't enjoy trying new foods. I am, over time, expanding my palate, but I have to do it on my own terms.
3	Yes, I've always been able to differentiate small changes in the food I eat. Though I don't think it bothers me unless it's my favorite thing to order from somewhere.\n\nOften times I'm excited to see how something can taste differently and how that can possibly improve a dish or improve it upon trying to "fix" it. I also get kind of excited to see the many ways people can mess up a food. But I don't know why that excites me.\n\nThough i was very sad when my favorite chinese restaurant brought on a new chef on the down low and the sauces were tweaked slightly. It was still delicious, but not in the same way I loved. I had to mix in a touch of sweetness from another dish to get it closer to the taste I knew.
2	Yes. RIP Panera chicken noodle circa 2006. 
4	My life in the past year.	January last year I met my current girlfriend who I plan on proposing to toward the end of this year.\n\nIn June my father passed away. I had to take over his company and take on a huge work load to keep the company alive and ensure the survival of our income and the continued employment of my 20 employees. I moved in with my mom to look after her. \n\nMy sister and my brother in law (who pitched 4.5-5 hours of work a day 5 days a week after my dad died, who have helped with the company years ago but for the past few years have been getting paid to stay home while not actually doing any work) demanded 25% of the company along with the ability to work less and from home or they'll cut me and my mother out of their lives. They say that me and my mother are emotionally abusive to them and that in order to make up for that, and to show that we respect them and their boundaries, we have to give them 25% ownership of the company. Which I find doesn't make sense because that won't solve what they're saying it will solve. It sounds like they're being manipulative of me and my mother while we're grieving. Anyways, they made the ultimatum and when my mom decided that we can't please them, they cut us out. But they still live in a house that my mom owns and pays their utilities for, she also loaned them 60K for my brother in law to but his dad's condo in order to rent out for money on the side.\n\nI'm not allowed in that house anymore. It was where I lived together with my cousin and a close friend before my dad died. I left to live with my mom and they moved in. I've been taking care of my cousin for a year before then, and now have to text her and meet up with her to see if she's ok. My friend that lives there was kicked out of his prior home. He's going through a divorce and I've been helping him with his depression. Now he's there, depressed, and I know he relied on me a lot but I can't help him since i'm going through so much and also I'm not allowed over there anymore.\n\nI now live far from my friends and support and therapist, I no longer have the freedom or time to work out regularly, I had to quit my boxing classes, and I loss a lot of weight immediately after my dad died only to gain it all back plus some through stress eating. I've lost a lot of my strength and muscles I've spent so long trying to build.\n\nI've been able to reduce my work hours from the first month of 98 a week to about 50 a week. I'm juggling engineering work with sales and inventory management and purchasing and production management and IT. And i'm still trying to find ways to reducing it so I can get back to my healthier life style from before. It's getting there. Slowly. And I just have to hang on. And also get married because I'm in love. I think I just wanted to vent and maybe have a moment of self pity, shared the with other ISFJs.
2	((hugs)) I am so sorry for your loss and congratulations on your impending nuptials. \n\nWho legally owns the business? Was the 60K loan documented, did your mom make them sign for it etc? ISFJ's get taken advantage of due to their kind natures.\n\nI think you & your mom will have less stress in your lives if you cut your sister off, evict them from the house and rent it out for extra income, and demand payment installments for their loan. You both are enabling their poor behavior. They'll never learn humility & hard work if you and your mother baby them. Trust me, they will come around after awhile - they might cut you out of their lives for a few months but quickly come to realize that you guys are the only family that has their back❤️
13	recently discovered this subreddit	I wish this sub wasn’t dead, can people post memes and discuss their favourite food or books or something like that idk... 🤧
6	Hey! Myself and u/kjeezy0127 recently became moderators and we are working on reviving the sub!
2	Yes. Who is the mod? 
2	So... Is anybody excited for Star Wars episode 9?
2	Does it count if I'm not ISFJ
7	How do you experience your visions of your purposed future?	INxJs often will receive flashes from the subconscious especially when they zone out while taking in sensory data in the moment. What about you? I would suppose that for most ISFJs Ni (visions of the future/aha! moments) feels difficult to consciously use. For me it feels like infinite imagination, other times I will lay in bed awake not knowing why while someone I care for deeply would like help (coincidence?).
3	Okay I'm going to be honest. For me personally it's anxiety, stress, doubt, and fear.
1	I don't really have visions of my future. What I do have is confusion and anxiety about the future. I look at the classic landmarks of success/adulthood/rites of passage in our society and question if I am capable of achieving them, or even wanting them. When I think about the future I have this internal war between optimism and pessimism, where I think "is it even morally right to seek a relationship and bring a child into a world with so much suffering?" vs. "if I act like a recluse and refuse to participate it's not helping the world become any better...". I try to tell myself there's a middle path, but it's hard to find. Mostly when I think about the future, it's about how to simplify my life and pare it down to the most meaningful things, making goals and holding myself accountable. Sometimes I will daydream about a future where AI solves all our problems and humans don't have to work any more than they choose, so they are free to fill the future with anything that brings them joy instead of being driven by survival needs and status symbols.
3	What's your favourite movie, and why?	
3	I don't have a specific favourite movie right now, per se... But I've been loving the MCU! Oh, and most any action movie that's not too gory and has car chase scenes... I love those... Lol. I love CGI gimmicks, it's bad. I literally was obsessed with the tornado movie Into The Storm for years because it just fascinated me so.
3	I don't really keep track of favorites in general. Reason? There's so much to like! You can't pick just one. \n\nSome mentions I can think of though \n\n- Avengers: Infinity War\n\n \n- Doctor Strange\n\n\n- Jurassic Park \n\n\n- All the Harry Potter movies \n\n\n- Star Wars: Revenge of the sith (Order 66 is incredibly chilling) \n
2	Not much of a fan of having favorite movies. Is there a difference with having a "favourite"? (I joke)\n\nI'm not into sharing favorite movies, its personal to me. I do have one favorite but I won't share the title. I usually like horror genres or ones that get me thinking and figuring out things or seeing what a character will do. Finding a movie I can relate experiences to is nice. \n\nI'm mostly into animations. I do enjoy live action remakes of animations. Not my #1 favorite but its one of my favorites is Star Wars. I liked watching the fight scenes, who gets killed, who will win, what they'll do. But also just because I watched them years ago and like to stick to watching the rest of the series. \n\nOhh but with horror movies, gore scenes don't bother me, I want to see what really happens and also challenge how I can withstand watching scenes. Thrillers are exciting. But it really depends since it's just genres and don't always make great movies.
1	Hard to pick one, I have near to a hundred favorites.. :D
5	Discussion bait (😬)	What genre of books are y’all into, I generally gravitate towards thrillers or mystery/crime novels.
5	I love fantasy/mystery/thriller books.
3	Fantasy/horror 
3	Sci-fi/animal history. 
3	Young adult fiction (I'm 22 but I still love 'em), fantasy, a lot of sci-fi!\n\nI recently read Halfway Human by Carolyn Ives Gilman, and it was so good, I CANNOT stop thinking about it! Currently I'm reading The Authority, the last book of the series "The Culling" by Ramona Finn (a teen scifi series).
3	I love Fantasy, crime thrillers, Sci-Fi, and autobiography.
2	I’ve always liked reading history books and any kind of novel as long as it has a good story and characters. 
2	I like self-help books. 
2	Genre-wise i love sci fi and fantasy. \n\nPlot-wise I love stories where characters try really hard. I have a soft spot for stories about single parents or about a parent and child relationship. And I also find social/political maneuvering to be very interesting to read.
2	I used to be crazy over fantasy when I was younger. It's still interesting now but I'm mainly attracted to crime and mystery as well. A lot of the young adult fiction novels seem to be about these genres.
3	What country do you think an ISFJ would thrive in?	
5	Sweden, not for any real reason just because it seems peaceful there, and snowy.
6	norway
6	I live in Canada and I find myself thriving pretty well!
3	Any and all
1	Japan? \n\n&#x200B;
6	Anniversary ideas for ISFJ?	About to celebrate 2 year dating anniversary with an ISFJ. We are both looking forward to a quiet night at home after work, but any suggestions on how to make the night extra special? We've had a complicated relationship and I want her to know how much I love her and how she is my future.\n\nI'm an ESTJ if that matters.
5	Think about things she has done for you. People usually give gifts they like, and speak in their love languages the most. Anything thoughtful, that she had mentioned in the last. It the smallest gestures that mean so much. What makes her go Awwwwww and tear up? What does she say she wishes you did or did more of?! Also telling her 'she so your future' is beautiful! As an ISFJ I LOVE tradition. So my INTP boyfriend has been really good about traditions with me. Like I had never watched the Godfather. So he made it a big deal and we watched it and had Italian food. Another on of my favorite is going back to places (like one of our first couple of dates we went to a bar) so to celebrate we would get food from that place and watch something at home. Or even having a drink there and playing pool and then coming home. But my favorite tradition is on Valentine's day we watch horrible horror movies, and get (usually Mexican because it's out favorite) and celebrate with tiramisu. Or I love it when he wakes up before me and makes a simple pancake breakfast and comes home with coffee or tea. Really, thoughtful gestures go the furthest. Also, I love pictures?  
1	Massage her, i know i love me some massage from my man (He's a ESTJ as well) offer to cook her dinner and let her relax in the sofa! Take over her part as the caretaker and make her feel special by pampering her like that! Hope this helps :)
9	Weekend discussion thread: What are your goals and ambitions in life?	It's time for another weekend thread! This one is kind of late, which is my bad, but yeah.
9	My goal in life is to live a happy healthy life, hoping with someone else, and i hope to get a job as a meteorologist or some psychology major. Im not completely decided yet. 
3	Clearing my financial debt, other than that I don't have anything else.
4	 Solid thread My goal is to finish my accounting degree and become a CPA. I also wanna be a dad one day. I also wanna travel outside of America at least two more times in my life. 
5	I'd like to find passion for something, not just tolerating it, and also improve on opening up to others. Going to be a long journey until I achieve either one probably.
3	My career goal is to become a nurse, something within psychiatrics, I see myself happiest having a family & taking care of others. Also being debt free one day would be cool
1	That’s really cool! Good luck with it
16	How do you feel about pets?	Just wondering how other ISFJs feel about pets! So I know we tend to have a rep as caretakers, I think, and that sounds accurate to me because I tend to "mom" my friends sometimes... lol.\n\nBut what about animals? Like, for example, I don't have a partner and I'm too young to have kids, so when I moved out I kind of gravitated towards having pets. I have a cat (almost had a second, but she didn't get along with my first cat so i just fostered her for a while), as well as five aquariums. I also had a hamster, but I didn't like him very much so I gave him away to some friends (who then got a female hamster who bred with him and now they have a lot of babies xD). I got another hamster, but she was sick so she died. I was thinking of getting another, but I don't really have room in my small apartment for a cage at this time.\n\nI also tend to be kind of strict about taking care of pets properly, which is why I rehomed my hamster (I didn't like him so I knew I couldn't give him a good home), and also why I don't believe dogs should be kept in apartments, or that Bettas and goldfish should be kept in small tanks. I have a huge personal responsibility thing going on. Lol. Which also means I spend way too much money on the pets I *do* have. 😳\n\nWhat about you guys? And what are your favourite pets? Personally I'm not really a dog person because they are waaaay too high key for me, and have too much energy (medication makes me always tired), but cats and fish are perfect. I imagine a more active ISFJ would like to have a dog because you can do a lot with them.
16	To say I'm obsessed with my cats would be an understatement. \n\n\nI love animals in general, but cats are something else entirely. I've always loved them and I've never not had at least one. Right now my husband and I have two, but I've been pushing for a third, and once we move into a bigger place I'm seriously considering fostering kittens.\n\n\n\n I think they're the perfect pet for an introvert. They can be very sweet and affectionate, but they also keep to themselves a lot and aren't in your face all the time. Unless they're hungry. Hungry cats will straight up climb your face for attention.
11	I love animals. ALL animals.\nESPECIALLY CATS.
5	I've always had some kind of pet throughout my life. Fish, birds, turtles, frogs, hamsters, dogs, and cats. It all just depended on what my mom would permit me to have at the time. I love pets and find it strange to be without one. When I moved out I was petless for a few months(my cat needed to pass some requirements before entering the country). However lo and behold I found a stray kitten in the streets. I'm so grateful to have found the little brat and even happier that now she gets along with my cat. I wish I could have a dog too but believe it wouldn't be happy staying cooped up in an apartment. I'm waiting until I settle down and have kids if that ever happens. I enjoy keeping my pets happy and enjoy the comfort and company they provide. 
3	I don’t want children but I have a guinea pig, ball python, and dog. After owning these pets I’ve decided a snake is best for me. Low maintenance, there when you need it, and super adorable.
4	I love love love all animals. 
3	My cat is my world. I say goodbye to him every morning and look forward to seeing him when I get home from work, he chills with me when I watch TV, and he judges me constantly. He's a complete asshole but I'd do anything for him.
3	Animals are my passion! I am actually a veterinary technician (nurse) 😄
5	I don’t care for them at all. I don’t think I want children either. 
2	Cats are my absolute life, really can't live without one (well currently, 2). I had pet mice when I was younger and I loved making little mazes and houses and stuff for them and they spent most of their lives doing stuff with me as opposed to just being in the cage. I like dogs but many of them make me uneasy, especially untrained ones. I like spending time with my friends' dogs but could never own one myself. My piano teacher, for example, has the sweetest little sheltie and my mom and I always joke about stealing him, but he does bark a lot when I come to the door and I just can't find it in myself to tell the little guy to be quiet because that's his thing, you know? I'm also very low energy so I wouldn't be able to keep up with one as well. Unless of course I got a big old lazy dog, we'd be perfect together, but most dogs like that tend to smell and smell doesn't do well with my OCD. As for kids, I'm only 20 and everyone keeps telling me I'll change my mind, but I really can't picture my life with kids, let alone a long term partner (rOCD) so I'll probably just stick to cats and little critters. 
2	I like dogs better than cats. I think it’d be nice to get a dog once I’m out of school and living on my own. It would be awesome to take care of a dog. I think if ISFJs wanted to have a cat or dog, they would really enjoy it. 
2	I've always loved animals my entire life. When I was little (eight or nine), I was extremely fascinated with guinea pigs and rabbits. Eventually, my grandma got two bunnies. I did extensive research on taking care of them. I would make my parents drive an hour just to get 120 pound haybales for my bunnies. I also let them free roam both in my house and outside. They were litterbox trained and lived in my bathroom. I basically spent most of my time at home taking care or them and playing with them. I also convinced my parents to get me other pets such as turtles and fishes. My dad built me a pond in the backyard for my goldfishes. I also did a project where I transformed my tropical fish tank into an aquaponics (self-sustaining) system for a school project. Eventually I had to give away these pets because the fishes became too high maintenance (I returned them to Petco). Sadly, we had to give up our bunnies to the animal shelter because we got a dog (who I absolutely miss and adore today). He would get aggressive around them. So yup, I love all animals. Hopefully when I am done with college and move out, I can get a bunny and a bunny-friendly dog on my own.
2	I'm not big on pets. I love (certain) dogs, but I really can't stand cats.\n\nI don't currently have a pet. I'm not keen on animals in the house, honestly.
2	I love animals! I've had turtles, dogs, cats, saltwater aquarium, betas, a corn snake, hamster, a leopard gecko... the list could go on lol
2	I love dogs and cats and had dreams of owning bunnies!  (IXFJ here)
2	I think pets are incredibly cute but I don't want one, sadly. Too much mess and extra responsibility.
1	My dog is my child 
23	The Si-Ti loop. What it is and how to get out of it?	&#x200B;\n\nI'm sure many of you guys have heard of the ISFJ Si-Ti loop. So in every personality type the dominant and tertiary function are in the dominant attitude for the type. So for an extrovert the dominant and tertiary function are in an extroverted attitude and same for introverts with their dominant and tertiary function. Every personality can have a tendency to get into a dominant and tertiary function loop. Because we feel the most comfortable in our introverted world we can enter a dominant-tertiary loop with our Si and Ti. I wanted to write out this post to help people identify whether they are in an Si-Ti loop and provide some tips for how to get out of it. You guys can also comment with ways to get out of the loop.\n\n**Si-Ti loop in ISFJs**\n\nWe can get caught up in remembering past experiences and then instead of checking in with others via our Fe to get outiside perspective we can use Ti to overanalyze the past experience and get stuck in a rut. Our we can use it to become perfectionists and insist that every detail is done perfectly. In addition, we can use it as a strategy to emotional disconnect from others to avoid getting hurt. We could also use it as an excuse as to why we can't make friends or leave the house. This obviously in the long run leads to a critical spirit towards other people and feelings of loneliness and unhappiness. While it is good to get better at Ti, we shouldn't be using it more than Fe. Ti must be used in service of Fe.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How to get out of a Si-Ti loop**\n\nThe first step is to try to get out of your head. The main thing that helps me is to remember the human element in decision making. It also helps to if you have someone you trust to talk about your feelings and emotions as this can allow your Fe to breath and relax a bit. Reach out to someone you haven't talked to in a while and see how they are doing. Think about ways you can help the people in your lives. Volunteering is also a good option. You can also try and meet new people remember each new people represents new potential positive possibilities. \n\n&#x200B;
7	I usually default to isolation and hiding in my head when I’m particularly depressed. However, I am a supervisor in the mental health field and am surrounded by friends who understand and can detect when people are detaching. Not only did they not allow me to isolate this last strong episode, I also myself decided that at any point, I could not be completely alone. I talked to people all the time or had some sort of noise going on to prevent myself from getting into my head. I processed how I felt, I used the phrase “cognitively I understand what you’re saying, but I still feel this way,” and I worked hard to take feedback appropriately, even though it was more difficult than normal. \n\nI’m on the upswing. I have had to work very hard for the past month and a half to continue functioning in work. I have forced myself into social situations with select trusted friends; I have broken down in some of these situations, but processed and moved on quickly. \n\nDon’t fall into this trap if you can catch yourself! I’ve done it in the past, and it hurts and takes much longer to get out. 
3	Interesting topic that I think Ive fallen into before, especially when Im too shy/lazy to do any social contact\n\nThanks for posting
5	How have you been experiencing Ni demon?	
4	I actually have no clue what "Ni Demon" is. 
17	r/ISFJ Demographics Survey: Jan. 2019 edition!	
6	Oohh nice idea, I approve!
4	I'm not sure what my enneagram is, so I just selected one of the options.\n\nJust a heads up since this will throw the data!
3	Hey everyone, [this](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfMc05zyQyEaOUYf21QRUpl6Hl_UIty88hYJ0eCIPr4ebi4pg/viewanalytics) should link straight to the results! :)
3	It doesn’t include “The Defender”
3	For age, you have \n"Under 18"\n19-24" and so on from there. \n\nYou should change "under 18" to "18 OR under" because i cannot select age 18 for this survey. 
1	`Do you have pets?`\n\nYes - 47\n\n`If not, want (a) pet(s)?`\n\nI have pets - 44\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHmm...
3	Trying to help out a isfj I need advice.	So I am an ESTJ and 26. I am significantly younger than my isfj friend. He’s 63. NO interest here, my friend or maybe not friend has a wife. This issue has been going on for a long time.\n\nI have this friend who has been diagnosed with diabetes. And he took the news with a really hard hit. I get that I think he’s unhealthy as an ISFJ and as a person. Anything little he doesn’t get his way with he’ll break down crying. If there is a situation that is a little more difficult he’ll have a melt down. He was so upset for two weeks after his diabetes diagnoses there was no consolation. I took out the weight calculator and we determined that he is over 80 pounds over weight use to be 100.\n\nThis time he was arguing with me over whether popcorn is junk food or not like a little kid. Yes no yes no yes no type of thing. I try to prove logically that it is. And he came up with popcorn from the store isn’t like theater popcorn. Popcorn is corn so it’s healthy. The biggest pile of crap I’ve ever heard. I became a little frustrated and he hung up on me. We were discussing his junk food habit. He’s 80 pounds over weight and he claims he’s cut out junk food but when I pointed out it’s a once a week thing he couldn’t take it. I stressed a healthy lifestyle. He got this my fitness pal type thing and he can see the breakdown on there. Sometimes he can see why he is over goals. I try to tell him there is something more simple than doing the diary just keep in mind of the portions and don’t eat unhealthily. And when he eats junk food he really goes for it. Two bags of fritos and a almond joy. One time he had 20 of some sweet cracker cookies. His weakness is food. And he over eats anyway. He tries to make excuses for eating a lot. “I like eating” “I am a man” and all sorts of other stuff.\n\nHow am I suppose to talk sense in to him? And how do I help him if he doesn’t want help?
2	Im pretty sure unbuttered popcorn is a pretty healthy snack... Compared to most other savoury snacks anyway. Have you compared the calories?\n\nHow does your friend feel about you helping him out? To me, it seems controlling. Maybe that's what he needs though, i dont know enough context.\n\nlike you said, you're only (maybe?) a friend. he has a wife that should be helping him. Maybe you need to take a step back or take things slower. Tracking calories on mfp is a good step and maybe he just needs some time to cut down on the unhealthy habits. Doing too much at once might seem too daunting/overwhelming for him. 
9	(Survey) Relationship Between Personality Type and Drug Use	
5	Coffee is considered recreational drug use? Geez.
4	I think the survey would have been improved if you had a question about how often you use the drug - like, I put down alcohol but I really only drink rarely. Maybe a few times a year now.
6	Your poll missed out on people who haven't done any drugs.\n\n  \n\n\nWe exist.
1	How you gonna ask a Pe-dom to pick only one
7	Weekend Discussion Thread: How was your week?	An idea that us new mods had was to start discussion threads within the subreddit. I decided that a weekend discussion thread would be a good way to start it off! So, because I am not very creative today, I'm just going to do a generic "how was your week" thing.\n\nSo... Chat away, folks! :P
5	My week was pretty good I just got back to college and I'm starting my final semester in school on Wednesday. I'm also volunteering in an MLK parade that I'm pretty excited about. 
5	This is such a lovely idea! Thank you for kicking this off =)\n\nMy week has been good, overall. Transitioning into a new role/career path at work, which has me nervous, because it’s something new (gasp, change!!), but excited to be more of a specialist, and to grow my skill set. \n\nI am facing some pretty tough depression, the likes of which I haven’t seen in years. Definitely have two parts of myself that are at odds - the rational adult who knows that recovery from depression takes equal parts compassion and work, and the juvenile part of me that just wants to fester and pout and not put any effort into feeling better. Depression can be like an annoying sibling sometimes - gotta live and grow with it, even when it really gets on my nerves. \n\nNonetheless, I am very glad to have some decent insight from previous bouts of depression, and to have patient, loving support from my partner and friends, so in a weird twist, this week also has me feeling incredibly fortunate and grateful. The people in my life are pretty fucking wonderful. 
4	Whew, it was a long week. For some reason I am still transitioning back into working after being off the week between Christmas and New Years.\n\nDoes anyone have any neat weekday night ideas? I am looking for some new things to do after work, outside of the normal trivia night etc.
3	My week started out pretty bad, stressing over tests and such, but ended up pretty nice. And the snow we were supposed to get here from lake effect (NW indiana here) only happened to be about maybe 2-4 inches. Instead like a foot. Also, Season 2 of The Punisher released yesterday. I've only watched the first two episodes but I'm enjoying it! 
4	I guess.. it was ok? I went skiing today. wonderful nature to go skiing in, here in Norway. \nwith my dad!\nI also read a lot in my book; the laws of human nature by Robert greene.\n\nthanks for asking ! 
3	Hello!\n\nMy week was pretty alright. Busy but now that's it's a 3 day weekend for my job for Martin Luther I get extra days to relax and study up on Japanese which I've been doing more consistently recently.
