244	Your ISTJ Care and Handling User Guide and Manual.	**Congratulations!**\n\nYou have just selected your very own ISTJ Worker Unit. As our most popularly selected introverted unit you are sure to be satisfied with your very own ISTJ. If for any reason you are not satisfied, you are simply not being direct and clear enough with your ISTJ unit and that is your own damn fault. So that you may enjoy your unit to it’s fullest extent, your SJ overlords have included this handy guide.\n\n## Your ISTJ will come with the following accessories:\n\n* Six (6) plaid or solid-colored shirts  \n\n* Four (4) pairs of jeans (light blue, dark blue, black, and brown)  \n\n* One (1) belt that has been worn since high school and will be worn for however long it shall live. Because it works.  \n\n* Two (2) pairs of shoes - one for daily wear, one for dress  \n\n* Bonus sports shoes included with athletic upgrade  \n\n* One (1) set of tools and toolbox. Includes basic tools for routine maintenance and repairs to anything they purchased for more than $1000  \n\n* One (1) canine companion  \n\n* One (1) set of How-To Books  \n\n* One (1) duty-powered core reactor \[Warning: Slightly Radioactive\]  \n\n\n## Software\n\nYour ISTJ comes pre-programmed with the following traits;\n\n**Si:** Your ISTJ is acutely aware of personal impact and past precedent. This trait includes the ability to recall events and exchanges of personal significance with immense detail and clarity. This function allows your ISTJ to form memories with such detail that they are experienced as reliving the event. Because of this your ISTJ unit is uniquely sensitive to changes in it’s environment and people around it. Your ISTJ is also strongly aware of it’s own physical sensations and comfort as well as the physical comfort of those it is near.\n\n**Te:** Your ISTJ will act efficiently and effectively when interacting with it’s external environment. Your ISTJ is a skilled organizer, delegator and trouble shooter. This function targets waste and inefficiencies and eliminates them to ensure the system is running at it’s highest functional level.\n\n**Fi:** Your ISTJ may be taciturn, but it is equipped with deeply held values. Your ISTJ will have personal preferences and tastes that it is both very sure of and strongly attached to. This function is responsible for adding the unique variety to each ISTJ unit that is only accessible with regular use and interaction.\n\n**Ne:** Your ISTJ is prone to catastrophizing about the future due to the inferior placement of it’s Ne function. Your ISTJ will be resistant to change and new ideas and is likely to dislike discussing hypothetical situations because of the stress they can induce. In cases where your ISTJ unit’s Ne overpowers the dominant Si software, your unit may feel a need to destroy all current systems and structure and resort instead to individuality and anarchism.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n1. Insert duty-powered core reactor into your ISTJ unit’s duty port (located between shoulder blades on back of unit)  \n\n2. Place ISTJ unit in an isolated area with included set of How-To Books\n3. Allow at least 2 hours of solitude for ISTJ to absorb information and charge\n4. Present ISTJ unit with included toolbox and a practical puzzle or problem in need of solution\n5. If your ISTJ unit does not activate after step 4, leave unit to charge overnight and try step 4 again\n6. If step 5 also fails, repeat step 4 again, but with included canine companion as well\n\n## Modes\n\nFix-It Mode (*default*) - When presented with a problem and reasonably assigned responsibility for solving said problem, your ISTJ will successfully fix or solve the problem assigned.\n\nChill Mode (*default*) - Active when ISTJ is alone or with a maximum of 2 pre-approved closely bonded companion units. Required for a minimum of 2 hours a day for optimum performance. While in this mode your ISTJ will have significantly subdued energy levels, little to no articulation, and will instead enjoy the company of included canine companion and silence.\n\nGet Shit Done Mode - Activated when assigned responsibility for completion of a set of tasks necessary to ensure continued harmony and operation of ISTJ’s life, work, and/or family. Involves only the minimum articulation necessary and zero (0) patience for unproductivity or waste.\n\nWhat Needs to be Done Mode - Activated when ISTJ determines that a particular task must be completed in order to ensure continued harmony or operation of a system or situation, but that said task is not being completed by the responsible parties, or is being completed poorly. Includes silent resentment towards the responsible parties, but successful completion of the task nonetheless. Repeated activation of What Needs to be Done Mode will result in your ISTJ unit’s refusal to help or participate in any future events or activities involving the responsible party.\n\nRighteous Indignation Mode - Activated by applying inaccurate statements or labels to ISTJ or by accusing ISTJ of making an error without providing evidence. May result in emotional outbursts.\n\nTry Something New Mode (*locked*) - Only unlockable with sufficient advanced notice and preparation. Your ISTJ unit is very capable of trying new things, but must be given adequate time to prepare by gaining more information first.\n\n## Relationships with Other Units\n\n**NF:** Generally fascinating and adored by your ISTJ unit, these units can also become annoying if they decide your ISTJ is in need of improvement.\n\n**NT:** Usually well tolerated and respected, but at times can seem overbearing or arrogant to your ISTJ unit.\n\n**SJ:** Well tolerated and most easily understood. Reliable units that can be called on for help if needed.\n\n**SP:** Interesting, but still quite confusing. These units seem to understand your ISTJ unit better than it understands them.\n\n## Feeding\n\nYour ISTJ unit will feed itself regularly and if asked kindly, will likely also feed other units if your ISTJ possesses greater cooking ability.\n\n## Grooming\n\nAs long as your ISTJ unit is not stuck in a Si-Fi loop, it will regularly groom itself without any prompting. Looping units may occasionally need to be locked in a bathroom and told to clean themselves.\n\n## Sleeping\n\nYour ISTJ unit will sleep when appropriate and necessary. Looping units may engage in too much sleep, but can usually be fixed by being presented with a puzzle in need of solving.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n*What is my ISTJ thinking?*\n\nMost of the time, your ISTJ is thinking about whatever was just happening, however sometimes (unbeknownst to ISTJ), they will be thinking about a past event so deeply that it feels as though it is the present.\n\n*How do I get ISTJ to talk to me?*\n\nThe easiest way to get your ISTJ to talk to you is to act it direct questions and wait for a response. Otherwise, your ISTJ will also respond to riddles.\n\n*Is my ISTJ stuck on repeat?*\n\nNo, your ISTJ has simply mastered it’s environment and found a routine that is perfectly suited. Your ISTJ will now adhere to this routine, often until long after it has ceased to be the most effective and efficient use of it’s time and environment.\n\n*How do I get my ISTJ to try a new method of doing something?*\n\nBy proving that the new method works better than the current method.\n\n**Again, Congratulations of your new ISTJ unit! Now go forth and fulfill your role!**
49	YOU'VE KILLED US, YOU'VE KILLED US ALL!
36	So accurate. Amazing. I may include this on future dating profiles. 
28	> Your ISTJ will be resistant to change and new ideas and is likely to dislike discussing hypothetical situations because of the stress they can induce. \n\nBut I would rather discuss these hypothetical worst case scenarios so I can figure out the best solution if it ever happens. Stressful as all hell but very satisfying if I do feel it would be solved. 
23	Could this become a sticky? \n\nu/rawtoast24
12	This was amusing to me.  A few things, though: \n\n>Six (6) plaid or solid-colored shirts\n\nI own 0 plaid or solid-colored shirts.  I do own something in the neighborhood of 30 T-shirts, but they all have logos, designs, or funny (to me, anyway) sayings on them.\n\n> Four (4) pairs of jeans (light blue, dark blue, black, and brown)\n\nThey make brown jeans?  How did I not know this?\n\n> One (1) belt that has been worn since high school and will be worn for however long it shall live. Because it works.\n\nI didn't start wearing a belt until after high school...\n\n> Two (2) pairs of shoes - one for daily wear, one for dress\n\nI have one pair of shoes.  I have no need of "dress" shoes.  If my Danner work boots aren't good enough for a place, I probably don't want to go there anyway.\n\n> One (1) canine companion\n\nNope.  Moar doggos!  At least 2.  They need someone to play with when I'm not there to play with them, cause, you know, work.\n\n> If step 5 also fails, repeat step 4 again, but with included canine companion as well\n\nImplies that you are to withhold canine companion from ISTJ. This is not recommended. Also, do not harm the canine companion, otherwise you might unlock John Wick mode, which is not recommended.
9	Amazing. \n\nEver since I saw the request for this I've been coming back to check if you guys were actually gonna do it. Definitely surprises the ISTP one and the ENFP one it was originally based off.\n\nYou should link it to the r/mbti folks so they too can stop asking dumb questions about ISTJs lol. That also might inspire other types to follow suit (I'd love to see an INFP one for example).
7	> Try Something New Mode (locked) - Only unlockable with sufficient advanced notice and preparation. Your ISTJ unit is very capable of trying new things, but must be given adequate time to prepare by gaining more information first.\n\nI was just thinking today "Hmmm, I should eat somewhere new this weekend. I guess I'm spontaneous now."
5	Brilliant and amusingly accurate haha. I also vote for this to be a sticky.
6	I giggled so hard at this. This so accurately describes my husband. I always joke with him either calling him a robot or a Vulcan. Though curiously enough I think my unit might have a malfunction, when I ask him what he's thinking about normally he defaults to 'Monkey Cymbals' which is something I would add to my list on top of 40 other things being an INFP.  Should I return him to the factory for inspection or does this happen occasionally? 
4	Sweet. 
4	This is awesome.  I do find that I get frustrated about dressing myself. I would like to wear the same thing every day and something practical, goddamnit!
3	Yep that’s me. Good job!
3	Gee, does this mean I have to get a dog to be a 'full ISTJ'??
3	God. Fucking. Damn.
2	Thanks to u/lioneaglegriffin for providing the [link](https://naughty-nanny.tumblr.com/post/139253802222/your-istj-care-and-handling-user-guide-and-manual/amp) to the source material.
2	So cute I love it!  Good job.
2	Also, in the faq part "act", I think, should be "ask".
2	Great post!
2	This is my bf to a "T", down to the one belt since highschool, shoes and companion oh my god
1	Whoa. That's really accurate. Thank you so much for this. It's gonna be useful for me when I'm asked to explain about myself!
1	Accurate and funny. I really enjoyed this.
1	Hi guys, I'm starting a GoFundMe so that I can purchase my very own ISTJ unit. I've never had one and I think one would be very beneficial, except every time I've gotten near an ISTJ unit, I get the distinct impression I am not adored in any way! Is there a refund policy if my ISTJ unit treats me with contempt? How can I get an ISTJ unit to appreciate my differences without trying to mold me into a fellow ISTJ unit?
1	So you guys are basically mentats. That's really neat.
1	This is scarily accurate! Well done! My only critique is that I do own more than two pairs of shoes. ;) 
1	Why is this accurate 
1	Spot on mate, I'm forwarding this to all of my handlers
5	ISTJ trying to find an affectionate and outgoing partner, but knows when to give space	Where would I find this type of person? I find myself very drawn to people who are confident in themselves, very loving and affectionate person and does not get scared or hesitant when I get annoyed or mad. This person can go about their day without having to connect with me 24/7 yet still be very loving as if we haven’t seen each other. Does this person exist??
3	You are saying this because the people who are loving and affectionate tend to get hurt when you need downtime, and they need to stay in touch 24/7..\n
1	Find another introvert 
1	I’m an INFP in a relationship with an ISTJ. I think on the whole we work very well together, but I do tend to be a little more sensitive than he would probably like, and I take things personally when I probably shouldn’t. The perceived/judges aspects of our personalities don’t seem to clash much because I think we meet close to the middle there. So maybe an INTJ would be a good match for you? 
1	You need to set up expectations and let them understand the need for space explicity. Don't expect people to magically read your mind, or be mature if they're obviously not in that stage of their life yet.
1	Sounds like you want another ISTJ
1	Find yourself an ISFP. :)\n\nI've seen ISTJs in very happy relationships with INTPs and with ISFPs, and ISFPs are more independent and less clingy ppl. So... \n\nI'm an INTP in a soulmate type relationship with an adorable ISTJ, but I break her precious solitude out of nowhere sometimes, she seems to not mind me doing that, but she has specifically asked me to stop a couple of times!\n\nThe ISTJ-ISFP couple are just fantastic together, but i don't really know about their situation. I'd assume with the amount of visible love between them, either what concerns you doesn't happen often, or the ISTJ husband doesn't mind her intruding! 
1	yes, they're called ambiverts
0	Sounds like my bf, to be honest. He ranked as INTJ but definitely is more ambiverted.
3	My (f19) ISTJ dad (m56) is depressed. Should my mom(f56) and I travel without him?	Note: My dad is ISTJ, my mom ENFP and Im INFJ\n\n My dad has dysthymia. Since a few months he is taking antidepressants. He was unwilling to take the medication as he thinks that psychology is nonsense and he had weird views on mental ilnesses in general.But he is still definitely not cured. He is an underemployed university lecturer (only a few hours a week).My mom and I try to encourage him to try to switch to a real job, so he does something useful instead of just playing computer chess. But we haven’t had success on that one yet.\n\nNow my mom suggested that she would like to take a small trip just me and her for a few days, maybe to the mountains or somewhere else. Currently my mom feels very tired and frustrated with his slow healing process. We have done this once before he started taking antidepressants. And we sometimes visit my moms extended family together.\n\nIn any case my dad, my mom and I will have a vacation on Easter.On the one hand my mom and I are both free right now and I would really enjoy to spend a few days away from my life. But on the other hand I am afraid my dad could be upset and/or become a bit more depressed about this. What do you think? \n\n**TL;DR: My mom suggested that I should travel with her without my depressed dad.** 
5	Honestly, I think your dad would enjoy a break from you two just as much as you'd enjoy a break from him.\n\nI can't speak for your dad, but as an introvert having solitude is a necessity. 
2	I need to state up front that this advice only comes from my own experience and I'm wary of saying anyone should do anything in particular when dealing with a depressed person.  So, you should only take this as one opinion to consider while you make the final decision yourself.  If you're worried that your dad will hurt himself, absolutely do not leave him alone.  With that said:\n\nI think your dad might find solace in being alone but still draws support from you and your mom being nearby.  You and your mom need to take care of yourselves (the healing process is hard on everyone) so a trip would be a great way to get away from it all. During that trip, your dad would benefit from still being called once or twice a day to know you're still thinking about him.  It'll help him maintain the sense of passive support he likely gets from your mere presence.  \n\nBring home some pictures to share with him.  He really needs to know that you care and that would be one way to show him that you were thinking about him (I don't think us ISTJs typically like souvenirs as much as things that engage our senses, like pictures and videos).\n\nGetting him a full-time job will go a long way towards helping him in my armchair-psychologist opinion.  ISTJs do have a tendency to be driven by routine and work, plus it'll give him a sense of meaning/purpose in his life.  You already seem to know this but I thought I'd reiterate it anyway.  I hope you find success on this front!\n\n**TL,DR:** Go on the trip but call him once or twice a day while you're gone.  Bring home pictures, videos, or other sensory experiences to share your trip with him when you're back.
2	As an ISTJ, while being asked to travel feels like a lot of work, I would appreciate a change in scenery and get some freedom away from home. Perhaps take him with you, make him feel important by letting him take charge. If there’s a place you and your mom wants to go to, like what the other said, let him navigate. He needs to know and feel useful to you, but I honestly think getting him out of that chair will do the works.
2	I’m an ENFP (37f) and I was married to an ISTJ (40m) who struggles with depression. Leaving him alone to work shit out on his own was never effective. Because an ISTJ is an upside down ENFP, they still like positive distractions to keep them from a negative downward spiral. Also, ISTJs are acts of service oriented people who enjoy having a purpose. They like to be needed and they need a job and some physical activity to be fulfilled. Try to talk him into coming with you two. “Dad, we NEED you to help us navigate during the trip, and we NEED you to help chop wood and start a fire.” Something like that. I’m sure your mom needs some time away from the grumpy depressed guy too, but I’ve learned that running away from his depression and anxiety doesn’t fix my own problems, it just creates more cycles of depression. She deserves to get away too! But this trip isn’t the best time to leave him to stew in his misery. 
1	It's only a few days. Leave his miserable ass at home because you guys need some mental health time just like he does. If he's the problem, leave the problem at home,hell be fine. 
1	Reading this breaks my heart for all of you. \n\nI can understand the need to get away from the pressure/burden of taking care of someone with a mental illness - because your mental health is important too! But its important they know they are not are burden, no matter how stubborn or hard to work with they are. They need help.\n\nA few years ago, a friend of mine could not convince her depressed ISTJ husband to go on trips with her. She really wanted to go to disney so she just started going alone. She finally convinced him one time, and he couldnt help but enjoy himself. Now they go twice a year, own a time share, and they look forward to it all the time. Its brightened his world immensely!\n\nIf you and your mom need this trip for yourselves, i say take it. However, make sure you market this trip as a "girls thing" so he cant resent the fact that you go without him. And consider what you can do for hom as well - is there a trip to a place he might benefit from?
5	Political preference for ISTJs?	I don't want to create unnecessary discord, but I'm just curious to see where my ISTJ friends lie on the political spectrum. Do you think there is a correlation between personality types and political affiliation? Personally, I'm pretty conservative.
17	Perhaps not. Liberal AF.
4	No
8	Conservative/Libertarian\n\nThere's a correlation between certain big 5 personality traits and political leanings, but I don't think there's a correlation with mbti.
7	Definitely a liberal. Becoming more so as I age. 
9	Liberal/progressive. 
5	Centrist because you can't be too extreme either way, that means you're using bias to agree on a subject instead of looking at things objectively.\n\nAligning to a political ideology shouldn't be clear cut as it is in bipartisan democracy, but hey people like being on a team. 
2	I'm a classical liberal, don't know if there is any correlation to my personality type
2	I would like the chance to vote for someone who is authentic, trustworthy and represents the well being of the middle class. If this person existed in either party I would vote for them. I think we put too much focus on the politicians and their parties though. It’s the big corporations and their lobbyists who need to be replaced. They’re the ones running the show.
2	Liberal. Used to lean centrist when I was younger. I don't think it has to do with MBTI, but with what we value most. Bias is inescapable.
2	Liberal-leaning centrist, I guess. I'm for gay rights and such, but I also recognize conservatives bring up a couple of valid points too.
2	Fiscal conservative, and I support traditional gender roles in the home. I like the idea of legalizing, taxing and regulating all drugs and prostitution. I believe we’re a sovereign nation with the right to protect our borders. I guess I’m a conservative with libertarian leanings. \n\nI like tradition, which is a known ISTJ trait so these beliefs are fitting. 
1	I'm conservative, leaning libertarian and OK with some moderation for the sake of practicality
1	centre left. 
1	I registered as an Independent voter but my beliefs mostly align with Libertarian.
1	Fiscal conservative libertarian.\nDon what the fuck you wanna do, just do it with your money. Not the tax payers. Please and thank you. 
1	Libertarian/Conservative/Old-School Liberal\n\nI know thats a lot, but i feel a lot a ways about a lot of things
0	Fascist/NatSoc
-3	Yes. I’ve been primarily a republican because I value rules and laws over feelings (something I don’t see from my democratic counterparts)
-1	White nationalist
2	Hard time reading ISTJ, help please	Hello, I’m ESFP (f/27) and recently an ISTJ (m/36) caught my interest (just a few weeks ago). I’ve dated ISTJ and ESTJ before and in my experience they really stare you down when they like you. This new guy though goes to my gym, and when we talk he will barely make eye contact with me. I feel like he is internally having a panic attack and just gets very awkward. This is to the point where I have tried to end our conversations early just to relieve him of the awkwardness. I don’t want to force someone to talk to me if they just want me to go away. Every time I do this though he finds 100 more things to talk about and keep the conversation going. For example, I tried to make my exit after a 10 minute convo and he ended up talking for another hour and obviously trying to be funny—but looked past me the whole time. I have never experienced this before. I cannot read him at all. \n\nDo ISTJ do this when they don’t like someone but want to be polite, or when they do like someone and don’t know how to act? I don’t want to be full on high energy, touchy, talkative ESFP on him if he’s not into it, but I also know from experience that an ISTJ could hide their feelings for decades if they felt it was necessary. \n\nJust wanted to get some opinions before I go too deep into my analysis. Not really into making an ass of myself at the gym that I have to return to on a daily basis. 
3	I don't think he wants you to go away. Maybe he is also interested in you, since he tried to talk to you for another hour. Furthermore, him barely making eye contact can mean nervousness. \n\nHonestly, keep talking to him but maybe invite him to a more "private" place outside of the gym.
2	We do this when we like someone, but are nervous and unsure of ourselves. We are introverts so we sometimes need a lot of encouragement before we can relax and communicate openly and easily. Then watch out! :) Also, I would never talk for over an hour with someone that I didn't like, I would kindly end the conversation.
1	If I'm in a busy place, I don't tend to keep eye contact. I'm always looking around, checking things out, making sure everything is OK, multitasking, or whatever. Go somewhere less busy. And don't try to read us. We're not books. We're really overt so don't waste time trying to flip through our pages. We don't have any. 
19	What are you like when you're drunk?	Some friends prefer me drunk... I get super touchy-feely and silly, make everyone laugh and feel good, then regret it. Drinking ends up depressing me. I feel like it can be a crutch to my social skills, so I haven't had anything to drink in over a year.\n\nDo you think drunk you is the "real" you? I think it opens the floodgates to a side of me that I prefer to let people see over time.
10	I'm a little more goofy/outgoing, but like you, I'm not a fan. I don't go wild like some friends, just a bit more talkative basically. The first (and only time) I've drank to where I thought I was drunk, I just got sleepy and ended up going to bed. Might have had something to do with the vibe of the place I was at as well though 
9	Im relaxed and funny. A little mouthy, in a fun way. What little filter I have is 100% gone and ppl think im joking when I'm not, which is cool. I don't get wild and crazy or anything and I've never done anything I regretted. I have chronic migraines and realized that migraines are a lot like hangovers so I dont worry about drinking the night before I go to work. Seems like if I'm gonna get a headache I might as well earn the damn thing. 
6	Tired. Straight to bed early!
6	I turn into an ENFP. So yes, i definitely turn into the version of myself you dont get to see unless youve known me for a very long time.
6	When I drink, I actually shut down completely. I find a corner, stay there, talk to no one.
5	I couldn't say.  I haven't been drunk since I was a toddler.  Evidently it was hilarious, though.
5	Rarely get drunk. Make some inappropriate jokes and laugh louder than usual. Nothing crazy
4	My ISTJ is usually reserved and quiet, but when he’s drunk, he’s SOOOOOO loud and grabby. It’s fun if I’m also drinking, but it’s annoying if I’m not. 
4	Touchy, more ily’s. Very happy or sad depending what initial mood I am in. Like a cuddle bear really. 
4	I laugh a lot. Like, sitting on the floor in underwear and guffawing over anything and nothing at once. \n\nI also snore very loudly.
4	Sleepy and dizzy. Hate it.
3	I actually feel much better in social settings with 1-2 drinks in me. My internal filter drops and I can socialize without overthinking everything. I get really uncomfortable in large groups if I think I have too much, that’s only happened once. Now I limit myself to that 1-2. 
3	I generally avoid getting drunk, but the last time I did I annoyed my husband a little because I wouldn't shut up. I generally don't prattle on and on.\n\nAlso the drunk me can't be the real me, because drunk me is less intelligent. But she is more open with the right people.
3	When I am drunk or even tipsy, I am a lot hornier. I also get a lot more confidence and actually flirt more when inebriated. Friends had also told me I'm a lot more open, touchy, and goofy. \n\n\nI also feel sad when shit does not go my way.
3	I don't drink. The thought of getting drunk and not fully being in control of myself doesn't appeal to me.
3	Where can you usually find ISTJs?	I think that I’ve probably run into them a lot, given that they are so common, especially among men. However, I can’t pinpoint any I know personally. Where could I usually find them. What do they usually do?
10	I’m often found in my house...\n\nMaybe at a concert\n\nHiking...\n\nOut with close friends maybe at a Friendly’s.\n\nNo place too crazy.
9	Home. Work. Bookstores. Target. Running outdoors. The occasional concert.
5	Find me at: home, grocery stores, home supply stores, thrift shops, coffee/tea shops, concerts, out doing something active, parks/beaches, museums, hip new spots, and libraries. Basically, anywhere I don't have to talk to strangers for extended periods of time... you might not find me because I move quickly... lol
5	I like being comfortable so usually some place relaxed and quiet like my house. I'm also studying a lot bc I'm in college. If I do go out, it's usually a place pretty relaxed. Dont have much desire to go to clubs or bars either, but I'll go if my friends really want me to. I'm usually pretty tired after parties.
3	Home. Work. School. High end bar or crying somewhere 
2	Wherever I need to be....
1	You'll find me at work in the HR Department, having to put my foot down most of the time. 
-2	Idk, church, probably. (Don't take this answer too seriously.)
3	ISTJs, what are your Clifton Strengthsfinder results?	I am curious if any other ISTJs share similar top 5 strengths. To start things off, here are mine:\n\n1. Analytical\n2. Deliberative\n3. Harmony\n4. Responsibility\n5. Learner\n\nIf you don't know what the Clifton Strengthsfinder is: it is a **paid** test that is supposed to show one what their top strengths are out of 34 possible options. It is also designed so one can build their strengths in order to lead a more successful and more satisfying life. Here is the link to the test: [https://www.gallupstrengthscenter.com/](https://www.gallupstrengthscenter.com/)
2	I took it about 6 years ago and I got:\n\n* Responsibility\n* Restorative\n* Individualization\n* Ideation\n* Delibrative
2	1. Analytical \n\n2. Learner\n\n3. Focus\n\n4. Restorative\n\n5. Achiever 
2	Focus, futuristic, analytical, and significance. 
2	ISTJ here. Did this at work a while back. \n\n1. consistency (execution)\n2. context (strategy) \n3. restorative (execution)\n4. deliberative (execution)\n5. connectedness (relationships) 
2	Individualization, Futuristic, Learner, Analytical, Ideation
2	Achiever (executing)\n\nIntellection (strategic thinking)\n\nResponsibility (executing)\n\nLearner (strategic thinking)\n\nInput (strategic thinking)
7	Trying to understand ISTJs	Hi guys,\n\nSo I’m an ENFJ and have had some, let’s say, less than easy dealings with ISTJs over the years. I’m your typical NF in many ways: I’m open minded, look for the positive in people, think in terms of emotions, emotionally expressive, care about people, people pleaser, all that good stuff. And while I don’t think I know any ISTJs in my inner circle, I suspect that many of the people that I have had a hard time with are ISTJs. \n\nI got interested in the MBTI a couple of years ago and it has really opened my eyes to a lot of things about myself and others around me (including ISTJs). I’ve been reading a lot about you guys and I really want to understand how you think. I’m a liberal arts grad and very much also interested in psychology, so I very often try to relate to others by understanding who they are and how they think. \n\nI really would like to fully appreciate you guys for who you are and how you think. I have tried reading the cognitive functions test to better understand ISTJs, but I think it might help if one of you explains it to me. \n\nCould you explain how you guys think? What do you guys value? Where can I find you? What annoys you? How can I best approach you? \n\nThanks\n\n\n\n
22	Here's a little about me - \n\nI rely a lot on past experiences to predict outcomes of similar situations.\n\nI thrive in routine, the more regular and regimented the better.\n\nI dislike wishy-washy answers, preferring solid facts.\n\nFacts don't care about your feelings and generally neither do I. No offense.\n\nI strive for lethal efficiency.\n\nI work best alone or as part of a very small team, 2-3 at most.\n\nI dislike managing people.\n\nI am fiercely loyal.\n\nIf you come to me - come to me with facts and solutions to problems.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoes this help?
11	There has to be structure in everything that I do, and there must always be some sort of (even if it’s loosely based) plan to any sort of trip, approach, or project I’m doing. I consider myself to be open minded to new ideas, but ISTJs could be considered the most stubborn of the personalities because, if we’ve already done it efficiently (which we probably already have) that way is foolproof and should be done every time, guaranteeing a flawless outcome. There’s little room for spontaneity. For example, my boyfriend is an INTP and he is an amazing cook. Will never follow a recipe, but can make some amazing food just throwing things together, that’s just how his brain works. This drives me insane. I’m more of a baker, as in I will always follow a recipe, to the T, and whatever I’m baking will always turn out the way I expect it to, every time. And I’ll more than likely use the same recipe for whatever it is until the day I die. Probably a shitty analogy, but whatever.\n\nI also loathe when people are late, or forget things, especially if it is habitual.\n\nI think that ISTJs are somewhat perfectionists, and of something doesn’t turn out perfectly, we will blame ourselves (even if it’s in no way shape or form out fault) and berate ourselves for not being able to hammer it in to perfection. I’ve had a couple of ‘catastrophe modes’, and they’re not pretty. It’s very hard to come out of it, because all we’re thinking is ‘if it’s not perfect there’s no point’. \n\nI do not like managing other people or telling others what to do. I am a good co-pilot or assistant manager, but I only enjoy being responsible for myself. \n\nWhen it comes to emotions, I do not like talking about them or explaining them. \n\nISTJs are determined, stubborn, and loyal. Not good romantic partners, though. 
4	Please remember that all ISTJs are different and unique. Even if an ISTJ doesn't portray or show emotion, that doesn't mean they don't have feelings. While I cannot speak of others, for me my emotions are the initial motivation for action. I strongly care about those close to me, and therefore I am motivated to work hard at whatever I do. \n\nSince my job doesn't require a lot of emotive energy, I don't display much of it (I am an engineer). Some I work with may take that as me being a douche/jerk/etc, but that's far from the truth. My entire day is motivated by my emotional drive to do a good job. As I have gotten older I have learned to have more emotive conversational qualities and not take myself too serious, but I have worked with ISTJs that are older and still give off an off-putting air. \n\nReally ISTJs (in general) are task driven "duty fulfillers". I am sure others here would agree that they value those with strong ethics (even when they don't align with their own), annoyed with those that waste their time with non-realistic what-ifs, and have only a select few hobbies that they share with even a smaller group of friends. \n\nIf someone were to approach me (at work since thats where I am lot of the time) would be: "Hey "darth_haterade, I have this problem that I am trying to solve and think you could help me." \n\nClear as mud? 
4	- I reminisce about the past a lot\n\n- I'm serious, most of the time\n\n- I'm private with my life. I don't post on social media often compared to my peer group.\n\n- I like to observe first then engage\n\n- I need a decent amount of down time (aka loneliness time) after exhausting myself\n\n- I want stability and happiness the minimum.\n\n-  I hate drama.\n\n- I use past experiences as a guide to what to do present time \n\n- I hate when people are 15+ minutes late unless they have a valid excuse. \n\n- I do what I say and say what I mean. I hate playing these silly mind games.\n\n- I suck at flirting\n\n- I always come early/on time for all commitments\n\n- I don't mind drinking, smoking, and partying. Just not every fucking day or 3+ times a week. Moderation is the best.\n\n- Very critical of family members and friends\n\n- I feel like every time I feel a positive emotion it feels forced and not natural\n\n- I respect all opinions and try to understand all sides. However that does not mean I immediately like their opinions.\n\n- Registered as an Independent voter\n\n- I need some structure/plan. Logisitcs are amazing.\n\n- I don't like gift giving. Never understood it. Not to mention my parents ruined it for me. \n\n- If you want me to tell a story or about an experience, I'll take a while cause I like to be as detailed as possible.\n\n- It's easy for me to be overwhelmed in situations I never been before. I eventually engage.\n\n- I do take crazy risks from time to time.
3	Hey friend! Im an INFJ who tends to get wrapped up in ISTJs. My man of 8 years is an ISTJbut we are divorcing this year.  Not from hate,  but we just realize we are very very different people. \n\nI love ISTJs for their simplicity, honesty,  and logical thinking. Ive only realized now though that I'm not a freak and that there are other people who think and feel like i do.  He has tried so hard to understand my vagueness or grandness over the years but now he knows he will be happier with someone a little less volatile.  We will definitely stay buddies.
2	Where you say you have a positive attitude about things and look for the positive and all, I have a huge neutral approach and attitude and all. My neutral territory is like the bell curve and it'll take at least 2 standard deviations to make it out of "neutral territory" so most ppl aren't "friends" they're "ppl I know" and the same for ppl on the opposite end of the spectrum. It takes a whole lot to get me upset and I vary rarely get what I would call "angry" and those (any emotions really) emotions last a very short period of time (were talking minutes). I don't think I've ever been "elated" in my life and I can't think of anything that would make me that way. Very strong emotions are true outliers and downright uncomfortable. 
2	I work in an urgent care. 
2	Istjs are the worst match for enfj due to that blind fe so it rubs your fe dominant the wrong way and sadly thats somehow true \n\nIm not an istj but an isfj and i can speak for this because i have an istj friend whos like this. When my enfj bff tells stories, my istj friend gets annoyed because he's not being specific with his stories. She s nice too but thats just the way she is lol\n\n
1	Here's a tip to understanding us: be really specific. For example, asking me how ISTJs think is too vague. I don't know where to begin to answer that. Ask really specific questions and you'll get good answers.
10	Do other types ever find you condescending?	My boss is an ISTJ and very good with certain things (like spreadsheets, and other fact-based things). However, sometimes he gets tunnel vision and really can't see the forest for the trees and gets really caught up on if something is 100% literally factual or not. He's an editor and I'm a science writer. When I turn in pieces to him, he will often compare the two versions and try to point out discrepancies as if catching me in a lie and then use that as a jumping board to say that I have to turn in a factual story, etc. The thing is, none of these stories are wildly inaccurate (and my ESTP coworker has had more beefs with him on this than me so I know it's not just me), it's just that some things turn out to need a little tweak here and there with language to make it more accurate. But I believe that this is part of the revision and editing process. But when he talks to me about them, it feels like he's trying to corner me and shame me into feeling like I did something terribly wrong. And sometimes he will be so stubborn about one of his edits when I try to make the point to him that another way of wording something is better that it feels like I'm talking to a stone wall and I feel completely shut down. He won't even consider what I'm trying to say and immediately goes in with a rebuttal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat is up with this? Is this common amongst ISTJs? Have you ever been told you come off this way? Does he mean to make me feel this way? Am I misinterpreting? Or this completely by accident? Or is this not an ISTJ thing? What is he thinking?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks!!
10	MY INTP friends ALWAYS points out how condescending I am.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI try not to be...
8	I have been told multiple times I come across as condescending.  I like accuracy, I get frustrated when people (repeatedly) don't follow instructions, and I get very frustrated when people are less-than-competent and try to overcompensate by being overly "friendly" or social.
5	I think we like to be factual above all else.  My favorite ISTJ quote:\n\n“You are not entitled to your opinion. You are entitled to your informed opinion. No one is entitled to be ignorant.”\n\n― Harlan Ellison
2	When I give out constructive criticism, I mostly come across as condescending (even when I don't intend to be) to people who aren't familiar with me because I usually deliver it in a straightforward manner. This is a very typical ISTJ trait and we actually make for very good editors and auditors due to our extra careful attention to detail. We're also mostly fixated with the status quo particularly if it's been working very well for the longest time, unless anyone can convincingly debunk that with solid proofs and explanations (this explains your boss' stubbornness especially if he's a veteran in your industry). Trust me, we expect the same candor when we're asking for criticism so don't take it personally. Maybe you can try writing your opinions to your boss next time so you'd actually have a chance to present them rather than expressing them verbally where he can just cut you off mid sentence. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI work in the beauty industry and regularly deal with customers firsthand so I've learned to dial down my blunt-ness as it's commonly misconstrued as condescending especially when I deal with women a lot. Even with this conscious effort of reducing the very strong Judgment factor in my personality, it still seeps through the cracks and I'm occasionally called as strict and rigid. I find that I develop relationships with male friends easily too because they appreciate my "say what you mean, mean what you say" approach. I usually come off as intimidating to most females hence I only have a few girlfriends. 
4	Doesn't sound MBTI related TBH.
1	I’m not an ISTJ but my SO is and he is EXTREMELY condescending. I often find myself saying things like, “Yep, you’re right. I’m just an idiot. /s”
1	My brother is ISTJ. I am INTJ. Yes, we are both condescending. :)
1	Stop being dumb, and do it the right way= problem solved. \n\nJk\n\nBut I think what would work on me \n\n“I hear ya. And get your point. But since I am the one writing this, I specifically chose to say it this way. To get MY point across. But I appreciate the feedback. 
1	I've been called pedantic many, many times.  My one member of my PhD committee was pissed when I corrected him on terminology on the field.  So, yeah...
1	So I'm going to devil's advocate for a minute here, and for the record, I agree that the feedback you're getting could and *should* be presented in a better way. \n\nLooking at this from your editor's point of view, he's been placed in a position of trust where his role in this is making sure that the stories you print aren't wrong. In his mind, this position of trust requires that things are printed how *he sees* them as accurate, and he is duty-bound to correct what he sees as errors. He might be frustrated with you and your coworker(s) because you're putting him in a spot where he has to fight you over how things are worded in order to ensure accuracy, most people don't put their pants on in the morning looking forward to fights at work.  \n\nAs an aside, I had to learn to deliver feedback too because I used to come across as confrontational when people couldn't see things the way I needed them to. \n\nI would approach this with your boss in terms of efficacy - let him know that there is a way to provide feedback to you that will get better results, which he will probably be glad to know. No one in a position to lead or supervise others should take joy in making the folks they're supervising feel bad or frustrated, you're on the same team and are working towards shared goals. Make sure you do this at a time when you're feeling calm, if you start with "you're a bad boss and suck at giving feedback, do it this way instead, moron," you won't get very good results.  \n\nBest of luck, I'm sure your boss isn't trying to come across this way, and probably isn't even aware that it's making you feel the way it is. 
1	I get it usually. It's due to tone and directness though I absolutely say it without any kind of intent to be condescending.
8	What are some hobbies you enjoy and why?	
16	Cars, games, financial analyzing, studying and crying  
12	Cars, computers, video games, lifting weights, and snowboarding 
8	Games like dungeons and dragons. It's a both a structured and creative way to socialize.
6	Martial arts, pottery, playing guitar and hiking. The former 3 can take a lifetime to master. I really like things that fall into this category.\n\nSee: [Jiro Dreams of Sushi](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1772925/)
5	Guitar - once you learn a few chords and strumming patterns, you can play so many songs that it's fun until you can learn the harder ones. Practicing at something and feeling the improvement on a regular basis (when you actually practice lmao) is a great feeling.\n\nRunning - Same with guitar, it's only really fun once you start being able to go long and fast IMO. Trying to get back into running this spring. It's also particularly fun for me because I'm tall and lean.\n\nDnD - I play with a group of people on an almost weekly basis and it's fun being creative with your character. I also like the idea of an entire world being built from one person's creative drive (and our DM seems pretty into it).\n\nGaming.\n\nA few minor things: Learning another language is cool but so much work. I learned to juggle (just 3 balls) recently and that was surprisingly easy. More people should give it a go, it's a big reward:effort ratio becase it's easy to learn and seems impressive because not many people can do it. I'm also trying to learn how to do a standing backflip and a handstand. And play the harmonica. I've also been bowling a lot recently with a friend and it's a lot of fun trying to put in effort to get better, especially because I've never taken bowling very seriously as a sport. I guess you could say learning minor talents here and there is one of my hobbies.\n\nI've been wanting to get into martial arts and bouldering (I used to climb trees all the time as a kid).
5	Fishing (I’m incredibly patient), gaming and lifting. 
3	^(Disclaimer - ISTJ female here, hello)\n\nReading: I love getting lost in stories and escaping for a bit, but I don't like to sit and read as it doesn't make me feel productive enough. Enter audiobooks and my other hobbies that I pursue while listening to audiobooks so I don't feel like I'm wasting time. Keeps me from overthinking and gives me something to focus on.\n\nOrigami: This is almost a mindless pursuit of mine now. I've memorized several forms and can fold them without paying too much attention. I enjoy the process and the beautiful results. Plus, jars of origami stars make for great 'heartfelt' gifts.\n\nGaming: I play mostly relaxing games like Animal Crossing, Stardew Valley, and SimCity. I like the feeling of control that comes from shaping the worlds in these games.\n\nColoring: Helps me 'be productive' when my depression gets bad, and clears my mind when the anxiety gets bad.\n\nBaking: I love using freshly baked goods as a social interaction starter. It's a way to make sure that I don't have to go to people and that they come to me. An introverted win. But again, the process is enjoyable and it fills my home with wonderful smells. (I've been branching into bread lately and wow does it smell fucking good.)\n\nCleaning/Organizing: I don't know about anyone else, but I want my space to be under my control. I enjoy the visual aspect of a clean space that's curated to my tastes. There's also a joy in ridding myself of things I no longer need/things that were taking up space that could be otherwise used more efficiently.\n\nGardening: This is something I'm trying to get myself into more. Plants bring a sense of liveliness to me, and I love the feeling of getting lost in a sea of bright green. I've kept several indoor plants that bring an extra something special my space. I'm currently trying to move more into outdoor gardening 1.) to spruce up my yard so that it's not the eyesore of the neighborhood, 2.) to grow fruits and vegetables that I can eat/give to those close to me, 3.) to make myself go outside more. I'm an absolute hermit, what can I say?
3	Linux, its a puzzle, and I enjoy solving them. 
3	-Playing bass/guitar and writing music, or trying to at least\n\n-DnD and worldbuilding.\n\n-Videogames. Warframe, rocket league, and R6 siege are my most played.\n\n-Tabletop games. Magic the gathering is super fun with a bunch of friends.\n\n-Reading. I love big fantasy novels :)\n\n-Podcasts. Love having one on while working / housework / playing a chill game like Warframe or viscera clean up detail xD
3	Bowling: it is just relaxing to me
2	Rubik’s cubes. Learning and memorizing algorithms; repetition. Joy of solving. 
2	Running & road cycling - The exercise helps me clear my thoughts and anxiety, it keeps me in good shape. It's basically the only way I hang out with other people, so it helps me be a little more social.\n\nReading - I read fiction for entertainment. I love thrillers, adventure and a little fantasy.\n\nHouseplants - I guess I'd call it a hobby. I enjoy taking care of my indoor plants and seeing them grow and flourish. \n\nBoard games - my husband (an ISTJ also) and I are homebodies but we enjoy playing games. We have some that are silly/mindless and others that take more skill. Sometimes we play just to kill some time. 
1	Knitting and reading
1	Crocheting : I can do it mostly be feel. It's passive stimulation for bored hands and I can watch TV while doing a simple project. If I'm doing something complicated, it occupies my mind when I'm anxious.\n\nQuilting : its a skill I'm developing so I can see progress which makes me feel good. Takes a shit ton of planning before I even start, which is satisfying. You can see a large amount of progress in a short amount of time. And it satisfies the tediousness of my personality. 
0	\-creating and implementing systems, mainly financial and life organization\n\n\-gym\n\n\-practicing and deepening my faith.
-12	Farting. Because it smells of rainbows.
6	Do you guys find babies cute ?	
12	Only mine. Most others can fuck right off. 
9	Humans? No. They remind me of those mandrake roots in Harry Potter. \n\nFelines, canines, otters, etc? Abso-fucking-lutely!
10	No they look like wrinkly bags of skin that shit pee and cry. 
9	Not really, but I’m childfree so that probably skews my perspective a bit. 
7	No. Never. They aren’t. 
6	occasionally yeah \n\nside note: but I don’t really want kids in the future 
3	Definitely yes! It’s walking and talking children I’m not here for.
3	Not really. Puppies are much cuter. (I'm Female)
3	The cute ones are cute. Some are ugly.
2	Sure. 
2	Human babies no. Sometimes they can be cute once they have moved past the useless sack of meat stage and can start walking around and being useful. 
2	No
2	No. (33 y/o ISTJ female)
3	Is water wet? Babies are sooo cute...until the crying and diaper stuff
1	Yes
1	Not usually. Sometimes there's one that's just adorable, but that's rare. 
1	Yes. I used to think they were cute but didn’t even kind of want one. Then one day it clicked and I got baby fever and wanted one really bad. I honestly used to think I’d never want one. But now I’m almost 4 months pregnant ;)
6	what makes you feel supported & loved when you have a shitty day?	i know this is person-dependent, to some extent, but am curious about y'alls answers. from nf partners, too, how do you best support your istj partner during their rough times? \n\nthanks!
10	Personally, alone time. Speaking with loved ones and letting them know that I have had a rough day and would like to have time alone to listen to music, watch a show, or play a game. Distract myself for an hour to decompress then talk with them once I feel more   \n like normal. Getting that alone time and having ones that respect that lets me know that they care.
6	When my wife hands me a drink and takes care of cooking dinner. All without pressuring me to talk about my day. And if I do need to vent, she listens without trying to fix the problem or give me any sort of pep talk. 
5	I dont like talking about my day right away. I like it when I can just have some quiet time and lay down, usually in bed. I like it when my partner is next to me but just doing their own thing and not bugging me. After I have settled down I usually go roll over to them and just want to relax and cuddle with them. Just takes me some time to get myself together.
5	ISTJ here. I love it when my partner quietly runs his hands up and down my back. The whole hand, palms, fingers, thumbs. Not masseuse style. Just the weight of his hand rubbing the back. 
2	Beer.   Red or amber ales.  Stouts with coffee or chocolate flavors (or both).  \n\nFor really bad days:  Scotch.
14	ISTJ, I beg you, just return my favorite book	When it comes to sentimental possessions – what is the deal?! I know this sub is overrun with ISTJ former lovers. Sorry to add to it. You are WONDERFUL, mostly. \n\nMy ex, an ISTJ, has one of my favorite books of all time. I’d like him to pop it in the mail. How can I ask him to do it without seeming like I’m looking for a way to reconnect? Previously, even when I was very straightforward, he’s made incorrect assumptions and tries to read between the lines. Even when I’m just communicating matter of factly.\n\nThe reason why I’m overthinking the transaction is because I really really want the book – without getting looped into any other back-and-forth.\n\nI have notes in the margins, highlighted portions. So that copy is way more valuable to me than a crisp, new one. When I let him borrow it, I explained that it was sentimental. Right now, he has a backlog of books to read for work and it’s not a priority at all.\n\n&#x200B;
26	In plain English.\n\n"Hey - please send me my book back".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe tend to respond well to directness.
12	"Look I'm not tryna reconnect, all I want is my book back. Thanks."
4	I considered writing a long sarcastic reply about creating nuclear fusion capacitors but instead Ill just say....\n\nDont make it complicated just ask for the book back... Or... Theres always Amazon.
7	He won’t read into it. \n\nJust say: “I’d like to get my copy of [book] back, should I pick it up or would you prefer to mail it back to me?”\n\nThe end. 
3	Hey a-hole, send me my damn book\n\nThat should make it clear
2	Do you have a mutual friend that can get the book for you?
1	Just ask for it back. And stop contacting him for anything afterwards. 
0	Send him a box with a return shipping label inside, tell him he has a deadline of a week and if he still hasn't returned it get the cops involved.
1	Is it a limited edition/first pressing book or something? I’m curious as to why you haven’t just replaced it.
0	Survey on Personality and Flirting behaviors	Hey I am a doctoral Student at a University in the South. I am studying flirtation behaviors, specifically trying to catalog specific flirting behaviors taken from several experimental studies. Thank you in advance for taking the time to take the survey there is an opportunity to win a gift card if the entire survey is completed. You can back out at any time.\n\nHere is the link to the survey\n\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JMQP5PJ
5	Didn't you submit this same thread a little over a week ago? \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ISTJ/comments/atzblc/survey_on_flirting_behaviors_and_personality/
1	Wanted to get thoughts on this from ISTJs?	So my boyfriend is an ISTJ and I’m an ENFP and we’ve had many arguments. I don’t think we can go a week or two without arguing about something. Usually it’s because I feel like he doesn’t understand me as well. Last night I brought up how I wanted him to change his tone when he talks to me because he sounds so aggressive and that I’ve been unhappy because of it. When he talks to me in such an aggressive tone it makes me feel like I’m being yelled at or something, especially when I’m going to him to vent about something.... Anyways this convo escalated to the point of breaking up. I was the one that made him break up with me which was stupid of me. I know I’m the one at fault here. I called him back to talk about it and it ended it with him saying that he’ll try to fix it even though it’s been a reoccurring problem. And ever since last night he hasn’t messaged me or anything so it’s making me worry and overthink. I know he probably feels hurt right now over what happened last night and then me literally calling him back right after.... sigh. My emotions took over me and i was just in the heat of the moment. I talked to a close friend about this and she definitely said I was at fault here and that I should apologize. But right now since I know he’s hurt about this whole situation and probably mad and annoyed so I don’t want to bother him. What do you guys think I should do? Should I just give it one or two days to let us cool down or message him now saying I’m sorry? Since I feel so bad I don’t want to bother him even more. \n\ntl;dr
3	> Last night I brought up how I wanted him to change his tone when he talks to me because he sounds so aggressive and that I’ve been unhappy because of it.\n\nDespite your sharing, I suspect we all lack some context for this.  That said, we ISTJs tend to speak very plainly and directly.  I can see how that can be perceived as aggressive, especially when we're annoyed at you.  \n\nI'm not sure how you phrased your request, but the root of it doesn't seem unreasonable.\n\n> But right now since I know he’s hurt about this whole situation and probably mad and annoyed so I don’t want to bother him. What do you guys think I should do? Should I just give it one or two days to let us cool down or message him now saying I’m sorry? Since I feel so bad I don’t want to bother him even more.\n\nYou've covered both of your options (Wait a couple of days and message vs. message now).  Both have their up and down sides, and I'm not going to pro/con those for you because some of that is going to be specific to you and your beau.\n\nWhat I will say is this: If you can't hold back and feel like you must communicate with him right now, acknowledge his potential need for space, apologize, and leave it at that.  Something like "I know you still need some time/space, but I just wanted to say that I'm sorry and I'm ready to talk whenever you are."
2	>"I don’t think we can go a week or two without arguing about something."\n> \n"he sounds so aggressive ... I’ve been unhappy because of it ... it’s been a reoccurring problem ... I made him break up with me(?)/he hasn’t messaged me ... I’m the one at fault/I should apologize"\n\nWhen you envision a happy healthy relationship, is this what you had in mind? Because if not, let him go.\n\nIt sounds like a dead end abusive relationship. You could sort out your communication issues in counseling and continue wasting time with this fuck wad, or you could free yourself up for the guy who won't leave you guessing as to how he feels about you.\n\nRead *He's Just Not That Into You by Greg Behrendt* when you get a chance. Since it's a reoccurring problem it might help you recognize the red flags of a problematic relationship.
2	I dont think this guy deserves to be called a ‘fuck wad’ because we dont know the whole story. \nI have no idea why you or your friend think that you are guilty because him getting aggressive while arguing is pretty horrible and a genuine reason for someone to feel hurt.\n\nSounds to me like an argument that escalated and both of you seem wrong (you only because you said so yourself) \n\nMy advice to you would be to just relax and engage yourself in activities that interest you. And really hold him accountable as well for screaming at you. You seem to be concentrating only on the part where you went wrong which will obviously have you feelin guilty and restless. Remind yourself that he was wrong too and you deserve an apology too. You tried contacting him once, now you can relax and wait for him to get back to you. If he does, talk it out with a sound mind, make sure you let him know where he went wrong and also apologising for what you did. \n\nAlso STs take their sweet time when conflicts arise unlike NFs who start feeling a lot of emotions and want to fix it as soon as possible. NFs come to all sorts of conclusions while STs are just literally keeping themselves busy from thinking about their partners. You are on their mind but in a different way from how they are on yours. So also take this into consideration. 
2	My ISTJ bf often comes off as aggressive and angry with me over things that he would have no reason to be upset over. Now that we’ve been together for over three years, we’ve had lots of chances to address it. I truly believe he doesn’t think he’s being aggressive. He simply thinks he is concerned and making a point. We’ve actually had a conversation where he asked me how I would like him to act in those situations. I explained to him exactly what I would like him to do (listen more, don’t try to solve my problems, and don’t drive issues into the ground). He definitely has worked on it, i have realized his intent and have been more patient and less sensitive, and things have really improved. However, I never felt that he was being abusive. If you feel that your bf’s behavior is abusive, then I would move on. 
3	Is it possible that what's happening is something like this: \n\nWhat he sees as chatter, you see it as discussion. \nWhat he sees as a discussion, you see it as an argument. \nWhat he sees as an argument, you see it as personal attack. \n\nIn my experience, xNFxs are most prone to this.  I had an INFJ former boss and an ENFP friend where I have to constantly think about how I say what I say, rather than just the contents. Which, as an ISTJ, I found extremely tiring and unsustainable. \n\nI'm not saying that this is necessarily bad on your part, but if you're going to make you two work long term you should talk about this so you're not arguing so much in future. Because IMO in a relationship his intention is more important than your perception. \n\nFor now though, give him a couple of days. He'll want to have his mind on things that aren't relationships right now. 
1	>Last night I brought up how I wanted him to change his tone when he talks to me because he sounds so aggressive and that I’ve been unhappy because of it. \n\nContext: I'm not ISTJ, I'm INFJ in a very healthy relationships with an ISTJ. \n\nThat said, I don't think this is at its root an MBTI issue, though some of the surface markers may fall into that. But I think at the core it's something not related to MBTI.\n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners accept the other for where and who they are. Meaning, requiring someone to change is not healthy in a relationship. Sure, people do change over time however flows for them - but changing something about themselves in order to please the other person should never be a request or demand in a relationship.\n\nAnd specifically in your case - you want your boyfriend to change the *tone in which he speaks?* Really? \n\n>I called him back to talk about it and it ended it with him saying that he’ll try to fix it even though it’s been a reoccurring problem.\n\nand \n\n> we’ve had many arguments. I don’t think we can go a week or two without arguing about something. \n\nThis is not sounding like a good relationship, to me. I know, I know, it has so many good parts and yadda yadda. But really, this kind of fundamental stress is not part of a strong healthy mature relationship. \n\nBest wishes for figuring it out, whatever it is for you.\n\n
1	My question would be this... Does he talk to other ppl with the same tone as he talks to you? Does he have a resting bitch voice or does he talk aggressively to you and kindly to other ppl... If it's the later, then there's a respect issue and your good to let his ass go... If it's the former, give him a couple days to process and then talk to him about it. He does have the right to not want to be in a relationship with someone tho. 
2	Recontact an ISTJ	Hello, \nI was wondering how to reconnect with an ISTJ that I haven't seen or written for more than 2 months? If we have not been part of their daily lives for so long, is it difficult to find a friendly complicity? \nThank you for your feedback.\n\n
11	For me with 99% of friends / acquaintances, regular contact isn't needed. I cherish the meaningful few relationships that I do have. And if I don't hear from you in 6 months I assume all is well...
8	To me, that would be hardly any time at all between contact. So I would just act normal, like there wasn't even a break in your conversation. 
5	I would say to just reach out.\n\nI don't know about anyone else, but for me, I have a really difficult time keeping up with people I don't see every day/week, so if I fall out of contact with someone, it's most likely not because of any animosity I have towards them. It's just that I'm so focused on what's happening that day and then the next and the next, that it easily flows into an "out of sight, out of mind" mentality for me :|
4	I remember you, I think. Didn't you post about this here before?\n*looks around*\n\nYeah, here, from a few weeks ago: [ISTJ ex](https://old.reddit.com/r/ISTJ/comments/ap6je3/istj_ex/)\n\nJust for context so people don't waste time going over the same ground again.
4	For me it’s not a problem.  I have a handful of friends I only see every few years or so and I LOVE how we immediately drop into very comfortable rapport bc we know each other so well.  Feels like no time has passed. 
4	I would be entirely fine with it if I would be on the other end. At times I experience this too, where I want to be back in touch but don't know why or how, or am too focused on other things.
2	MBTI-wise, what type is your “ideal” match?	Obviously it’s just a hypothetical, but I’m just curious to see what other types you’ve meshed the best with?
5	INFPs. Still introverts, same values functions, but different strengths.
4	I’m an ISTJ married to an ISTJ and out of everyone I’ve ever dated, he’s my most perfect match. I feel like ISTJ might be the only combo that really thrives being with another of the same MBTI because of our mutual concern for responsibility, honor, consistency, loyalty, sensibility. Like I’m sure there are other “more exciting” combos out there, but those were better for dating - definitely made me appreciate my ISTJ even more once I found him. And interestingly I didn’t know he was ISTJ til a couple weeks ago when I had him take his test. Also interestingly, we got married in the Catholic Church and had to take their compatibility test during premarital counseling - and we only answered one question differently from each other out of the 150ish questions. 
3	I noticed the best matches for ISTJ would be ones to go for likewise people leaning towards introverts. other ISTJs, INTJ, ISTP, ISFJ I think. Not really into feelers most of all. INTJ is my fav but I'm a bit biased. 
2	Im an INFJ and *somehow* everyone i am interested in ends up being an ISTJ. Its very very strange. I keep telling myself I wanna find another Intuitive.. yet here i am, pursuing one of you again. \n\nSorry its from the opposite perspective, but i needed to share that love haha
2	For some really annoying reason, many of my past interests were in women that are polar opposites (ENFP), which were horrible matches from my experience.\n\nPersonally, I think my ideal match would be any MBTI that is an S and a J, E/I and T/F are don't cares for me. But I think S and J make me very fact/duty oriented, and strongly inclined to plan and do things properly.\n\nN's tend to be abstract thinkers, and they can really frustrate us S types, as they tend to communicate their ideas in a vague manner, as opposed to S, who are much more detailed.\n\nP's, still can get along with them, but not a perfect combo because they tend to like keeping their options open. While I do like them, I find that their lack of commitment to setting a plan in stone can be rather frustrating\n\nWelp that's what I have to share on your question\n
1	My ISTJ friend said “anyone who is clean, honest, and intelligent” when I asked him. Seems like low standards until you consider how many people in your life *actually* fit those criteria.
1	Ideal type for ISTJ is said to be the ENFP. These two types share every cognitive function but in reverse, making them fit together like two peas in a pod. In socionics this is called duality or yin-and-yang, ideally complimentary and balanced relationship:    \nISTJ's functions: Si,Te,Fi,Ne <-ENFP from this end      \nESFP's functions: Ne,Fi,Te,Si <-ISTJ from this end     \nENFPs and ISTJs also seem to marry each other quite often. [Happily married to an ISTJ!](https://old.reddit.com/r/ISTJ/comments/8sbfy7/happily_married_to_an_istj/)    \n     \nOther types that are great matches for ISTJs are those that value either Ne or Fi as their main functions. These are types like INFP, ISFP, ENTP, INTP: [**MBTI type matches for ISTJs**](http://personalitycafe.com/istj-articles/284-love-types-istj-7.html#post3833786)
12	What makes ISTJs feel loved and appreciated?	What makes ISTJs feel loved and appreciated?
18	I think it’s going to vary from person to person. For me, physical touch (holding hands, cuddling on the couch) and quality time (my partner being completely present for me like I am for her [no talk about work or problems that I feel I need to solve], us watching Netflix and then talking/joking about what we just saw). \n\nISTJs need to be with someone who respects their routines and traditions while encouraging them to explore the larger world and the beauty of a connected life. 
16	Everyone has their love language, but a common theme may be when a partner unexpectedly takes care of an obligation for us and does it *to our standard of excellence*.  ISTJs tend to be task and efficiency driven and having something properly taken off our to-do list is a big deal.  For example, coming home and finding that my SO did the dishes or tidied up my living room to my standards is a big deal
7	Answers will vary. No two humans are exactly the same. \n\nWhat would make me appreciate a significant other: \n\n- Lots of physical touch (cuddling, hand holding, etc) and at least a decent amount of quality time with just the 2 of us\n\n- Helping me out w/ problems regardless how minute or dreadful they may be when I tell her about them\n\n- Honesty\n\nThat's all I can say because I have yet to be in a relationship.
6	A listening judgement-free ear. Touching with the whole hand, fingers, palms, thumbs. Feeling safe, both emotionally and physically. A well cooked meal. Joking banter. 
2	Honesty, directness, consistency. \n\nCommunication atleast once a day just so I know things are well. Mind you, I do not want overkill on the communication because I need my space and despise clinginess. \n\nLove physical touch..holding hands,cuddling, etc. \n\nQuality time is also a big thing for me. \n\nI ultimately feel appreciated when there is mutual effort and consideration. 
3	Out of 16 types, 8 are light and 8 are dark. ISTJs are one of the 8 light types:	
3	That's really funny. As an ISTJ I am in the "public sector" for spiritual vocation/career. My INTJ bf is very much a self-employed entrepeneur/self owned business kind of guy.
9	Have any of you ever struggled with your sexuality?	I have always thought I was straight, but lately I'm not so sure anymore. I am currently friends with an ENFP, and I am having these feelings that I have never really had for another man before. I feel ashamed and strange even though I shouldn't. He does so much for me and is an extremely good friend. Has anyone else ever had this for just one other person before? I've never felt like this for any other man...so what is going on?
10	Yes! I'm a lesbian woman who struggled with attraction to women and considered men during her teens. It's perfectly normal to feel strange. Have you considered pansexuality/bisexuality? Take your time. Sometimes platonic attraction and romantic attraction get mixed, but you'll have your answer sooner or later. There's also the chance that he may be the only man you'll ever be attracted to - sexuality operates on a spectrum.
6	It doesn’t matter who you love, as long as you’re happy. One of the things we ISTJ’s struggle with are emotional connections. But if you have this connection with your friend, go for it. As Ron Swanson said, “Nothing ventured, nothing gained.” In any case, I trust your judgment, and support your decision.
2	I'm a gay guy and it's been pretty clear to me since puberty. It's more like I went through awful anxiety and depression because of my sexuality. I just wanted to fit in and do my best to hide it, but I felt like I got cursed with something beyond my control. I was perfectly okay with other people not being straight, but I absolutely did not want to be gay.
2	I’m openly gay, but I knew as soon as puberty hit. No confusion ever really. Though I guess I needed to learn to accept it at first.
2	My bf is bi. He's very quiet about it because basically he's attracted to women and have relationships with women but likes to have sex with men sometimes. He doesn't consider himself anything other than traight because he's not interested in the man. Only the dick (basically). I've met quite a few guys who are on the bi spectrum lately. From guys having sex with my bf so they can have sex with me to a group of guy friends who all have sex with each other with or without their girlfriends. Having a relationship sexual or non sexual with a man doesn't make you gay and you have to give up women forever or anything. It's not a 100% commitment one way or the other. And it's your choice how open you are about it. And it's OK. 
10	How do you recover from a long period of chronic stress?	In the movies it's always wild nights of dancing in Ibiza, driving a motorcycle across Southeast Asia, or a spiritual retreat to the Himalayas.  Do you prefer to do something "crazy" or settle back into a simple and familiar routine?  Would your answer change if you did not have to worry about time and money?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy "chronic stress" I mean any situation that is a constant source of stress and unhappiness and that you cannot remove from your life for whatever reason.  A few examples may include leaving a bad relationship, quitting a job you hate, or recovering from a serious illness.
9	I prefer to settle back into a routine, since routines help me feel more in control of my life. I love being at home, so when I’ve been stressed I like to take time and just clean and organize my home as a way to make my environment more calm. I think if money were no object, I would invest in an expensive item for my home that I could enjoy, like a new TV or furniture. 
6	I too would like an answer to this question. I'm super vulnerable to stress and can never get rid of it for very long.
2	I cut as much of the stress source out of my life as possible then fill that hole with something fulfilling, especially if the bad thing prevented me from pursuing that fulfilling thing.  There's a lot of alone time involved, lots of doing nothing productive.  In my case, that's a lot of time spent enjoying a game with a good story that I can use as a means of escapism.  Eventually when the hole has healed, I get back into a normal routine.\n\nExample: I ended a long-distance relationship about a year and a half ago that was a huge time sink that made me unhappy.  I spent the next several months intentionally single, not going near dating sites or anything, and spent my newfound free time replaying the Mass Effect trilogy and really focusing on my martial arts hobby.  I didn't take any drives longer than half an hour. After a few months I felt like I had "recovered" enough lost time to move on and went back to dating.
2	If the stress is over and behind you, I recommend a long period of chronic home.\n\nIf you're in the middle of it, hit the gym 4 times a week. Or more generally, have a very consistent routine that you enjoy doing.
2	I also play video games. Katamari was my go-to for a while because the game allows you to pick things up with the magic ball you roll. The more you pick up, the larger the ball gets—which feels so soothing to me. 
1	Reading is a good escape and has helped retain my sanity so far. I could read about exotic places and for me it's better than actually being there.
1	With normal stress, I'll spend a day at home or with family and friends doing something relaxed.\n\nWith chronic stress, I spend long periods alone, driving no where in particular just to see the world breathe, spending money on expensive/impractical things, reflecting in nature, writing, and either avoiding home completely or never go out.
1	Studying engineering and ending a relationship was a fun period a couple of years ago. I'll second the guy who said cleaning cause organizing/reorganizing my room and such is usually a good one.\n\nI find what works best for me is shifting all the pent up energy into some hobby, i.e. exercising and climbing has been a good one for me, it's harder to be thinking about day to day details when you're trying not to crush your self with a weight, or hanging above the ground, or running outside etc. \nBut in the short term, it's usually a cup of coffee and burning a few hours on a book/video game/Netflix etc. 
1	Finish everything and anything work related relax by sleeping or something \n\nOnly do something big like going out if I know exactly what’s going on and it’s not a waste of time 
1	I snapped at work Wednesday and Thursday and Friday I was off. Thursday I didn't do anything. I was invited to go somewhere and I told him that I wouldn't leave my house if it was on fire and I meant every word of it. The next day I drove around by myself a bit and then went home to make dinner and veg out some more. The next say after work I went out with a friend. Didn't enjoy it, I still needed more whoosh. Yesterday I went to my bf house and we cuddled all night. I feel much better. 
9	What are some questions ISTJs are open to answering?	ISTJs are usually very reserved, but when asked, what type of odd questions are you guys comfortable in answering among friends and acquaintances?  \n\nEDIT: Some of you guys say this is too broad. What about this: What are some things people have been surprised about when you answered a question of theirs? For example, among friends, I am completely fine with answering sexual related questions if its not crazy detailed. My friends are surprised by this because I don’t seem like the type, but I don’t mind being asked. 
21	I am open to any and all questions, but am hesitant about ones on my emotional state if I don't trust you.
8	How much money I make and my savings and investment strategy. I think the idea that money is taboo is silly and counterproductive. 
3	I like specific questions. (How's that for an istj answer?) If you are specific enough in your question, I can surprisingly go on and on.
2	I am not open to answering this question, because it is too broad.
2	I think we generally enjoy giving advice and talking about our hobbies. Questions where we can answer with either are usually welcome
2	Im totally open a out my sexual practices with the caveat that I don't share anything that would make my partner uncomfortable... He's really open too so theres not much limit.\nI can't think of anything I wouldn't answer honestly (if appropriate) if asked. 
1	It depends who's asking and what is being asked. I'm open to answering more so "superficial" questions such as what am I majoring or what soccer teams I like.
1	anything except very personal and touchy things. 
1	I am open to pretty much any questions and will do my best to answer any of them. Some questions might be difficult to answer, but they do not bother me. For example, my ENTP uncle once randomly asked me “what is your passion?”. It was difficult to answer because it’s such a broad question and I do not tend to have a thing that I am very passionate about, but I was not bothered by the question.
1	I am obviously not an istj. Hahaha! Okay let’s get that out of the way. Entj here, and professionally confirmed.\n\nI think it is really dependent on the person. I notice this istj I know well. And most people if you can get 10 words out of his mouth you’re lucky but I can make anyone get out of their shells. So I talk to this istj quite a bit. As far as I know he talks to me very extensively. 
20	What personality traits attract ISTJs?	What personality traits attract ISTJs?
53	I don't know about other ISTJs, but for me I like when people are:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\-honest\n\n\-direct\n\n\-organized\n\n\-competent\n\n\-able to give me personal space when needed\n\n\-interested in talking about music/art/film for extended periods of time without getting bored\n\n\-content with me not changing to their whims\n\n\-not prying into my life if I'm not feeling it\n\n\-not too loud\n\n\-nerdy\n\n\-not shallow (they don't have to be super deep, but yeah)\n\n\-silly (I won't also be silly, but I can appreciate it in others)
3	I like the idea of having traits, strengths, and weaknesses that are different from my partner so that we compliment each other, though there are some things we absolutely need to be on the same page about. I don’t think I’d get along well with another ISTJ, since a lot of my problem areas would be their problem areas (specifically communication). I also like someone who pushes me to improve myself and gently nudges me out of my comfort zone. \n\nSpecific traits I’m attracted to: genuine kindness, down to earth, adventurous, sense of humor, good communicator, laid back, good listener \n\nHave to have in common: views on finances, cleanliness standards around the house
3	Direct\nDisciplined\nClean\nOrganized\nNot afraid to hold their own ground\n
2	Im not too certain about what attracts me but rather what deters me and turns me off from people, being: Invasive to my personal life when I'm not comfortable sharing, Expectant of "lovey-dovey" affection/Clingy(?), Being oblivious or unable to read between lines, Repetitive and boring (conversations being a routine that I'm able to predict what they're going to say), Guilt tripping or when they're not direct with their feelings
2	At the moment I absolutely adore my GF's conscientiousness and high level of organization.  It's nice having someone who *gets* my need to be on top of things.  Her sense of humor and inclination to joke around and tease is also great.  I also appreciate when partners can talk about conflict in a relationship without feeling like criticisms or requests are personal attacks.  Introversion and independence are major pluses.
2	Honest, dependable, funny and a good conversationalist. I hate small talk. 
1	Sense of humor, good hygiene, smells good, has an interest, competence, able to hold a conversation about something important. Confidence. Has a skill and is good at it. 
1	I tend to be attracted to people that have a high amount of neuroticism because I have a low level of neuroticism and I enjoy helping people reduce stress and being a reliable person for them to lean on. I also like people that are not sugar coated at least in front of me. I love when people rant to me and value my advice. I also really appreciate when people notice small things about me or remember things about me or things that I have said. Someone that helps take care of my practical needs and takes the lead
1	Men’s shoes.	Gents - what’s your 1 pair of go to shoes?\n\nI’ve been a Chuck Taylor low-top black or grey guy for awhile and my current pair need replacing.
1	Depends on weather and what's the occasion.\n\nIf it's gonna rain/snow (or is already) then I wear my boots. \n\nIf it's not raining or snowing and I'm doing something informal, I wear either my Jordan or Nike sneakers. \n\nIf I'm going to a more formal event, I wear dress shoes.
1	Sketchers.  Anything else hurt my feet. 
1	Currently, a pair of 4" Danner steel-toe work boots. I do miss my Redwings, but nobody sells them locally anymore.
1	NB 501s, classic look, can go with casual or athletic wear, super comfy
3	How do you recognise when person is ISFJ instead of ISTJ?	There is also mirror effect but I am not sure if I am ISFJ or ISTJ.
4	Your question made me curious so I did some looking. One thing that sealed me as ISTJ was this analogy: A program or product you use at work has been discontinued. An ISTJ will be concerned with how the loss of the program will affect the other processes/projects in the office. An ISFJ will be concerned with how the change will affect the people in the office and how they accomplish their work. 
2	Google and read the differences between cognitive functions Te and Fe and you’ll know right away. They are so different. I don’t mix up isfj vs istj much as they are so polarizing. 
2	Fe often cares a lot about how the group is feeling and wants to make things pleasant for all. ISFJs are big on this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nISTJs who don't value Fe don't give a shit unless it's pointed out to them, but ISFJs pick up on this naturally. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, ISFJs, due to being terrible at Te, also don't have much respect for universal facts and ideas typically and prefer to follow their own logic with tertiary Ti. ISTJs re often like this with their personal Fi values as well.
1	ISFJ has fe and ISTJ has te and also istj have fi and isfj has ti.\n\nGenerally because of fe isfj loves and care quite a bit about a lot of people. They are very concerned about people and loving. For example nursing attracts a great amount of sfjs in general, including one i know personally and one I know of who’s a caretaker. An istj definitely feels but comes off a bit colder. They care more about getting stuff done, more goal oriented and a bit less people centered. Also isfj can sometimes be called a little outgoing, and usually very well liked. fe has a very good grasp of social situations and social cues. Te is very much the functions about getting stuff done. A lot of istjs are definitely not in to nursing or caretaking. A lot of them are in technical fields such as computing or logistics.\n\nEven if isfjs are in such field they are the caring one out. A lot of fe users have great emotional connectivity with others.
16	Learning empathy?	I need it for work apparently.   For coworkers.  But how... 
19	We don’t know either. We are ISTJ’s after all. 
9	Whoa, that's a hard one.
10	Find the person you think or is known to be very empathetic and just copy/study the type of things they say.  Try to remember to use some of the phrases once in a while and pretend you know what you are doing.  
7	Ugh.
5	Time to process. It's never too late to go back and show empathy, methinks. Sometimes we get too caught up processing the moment in our heads we forget everything, or everyone, else.
3	I’ll be honest with you. I’m a manager and god id hate to work under myself. I have no idea how to show it, it really reflects on how my employees perceive me and how hard they work for me.I think we just rule with an iron boot to ensure we get it done y’know.
5	Marry an ENFP.
3	I think it takes a lot of willpower to maintain empathy, but at the same time it feels artifical and therefore disingenuous so we might as well do nothing I guess
2	I’m in the same boat. Got great feedback at work barring being empathetic with my peers. Help?
2	First of all, this made me laugh.. am I being unemphatic? Heh. "Put yourself in someone else's shoes". Think how you'd feel about a situation if it happened to you on your best/worst day. If someone says they're scared of something you think is trivial, try not to laugh - there must be something you're afraid of that you wouldn't appreciate being made fun of for. \n\nLet people know you're listening to them by restating what they said or asking questions about what they're saying. It'll help you understand where they're coming from.
2	In most cases you can't really "learn" empathy. \n\nEmpathy is pretty much feeling what other person feels and feeling their pain.\n\nSympathy is feeling pity or caring for someone experiencing misfortune. You don't have to know what the person is going through to know that they suffer, therefore you may feel bad.\n\nLast thing is compassion, so trying to relieve one's suffering. Now the fun part is, that you don't need no empathy nor sympathy to be compassionate. \n\nIt's kind of like this "ok, that person has issues, as social species we need support to feel better, therefore I need to say something nice to make that person feel better and GO BACK TO WORK".\n\nAs much as Te likes to always find solution to one's problem, this is not always needed. It is really just easy as:\n"Oh, he was cheating on you? You didn't deserve that, what an asshole!" \nJust one stupid comment that will show them you are on their side, or at least feel bad for them (even if you don't) and they feel better.\n\nI recommend writing down possible responses to their suffering, so you may have some routine in this. I base my whole social life on scripting. \n\nYou can also try to find someone more socially competent and ask them for possible responses.
1	Just say sorry a lot.\n\nWhy? No idea.
1	I must be a weird ISTJ because I'm highly empathetic. It's just easy for me to feel other people's emotions as if I'm absorbing them from the atmosphere
1	Work with people.
1	You can and do experience empathy daily. You just think you dont because a lot of things dont concern us, but when they do, ISTJs are just as empathetic and caring and concerned as any other person.\n\nYou have tert Fi; when something sparks your value system you feel it, you care about it. If you want to try and practice more empathy, dont "put yourself in their shoes" thats not authentic for us. Instead try "when have i been in a situation similar to this? How did i feel? How might i have felt the way they do? How are we similar and different?" That will give you a jumping off piint for a deeper understanding of someone you may otherwise not want to empathize with.
1	I have a hard time putting myself in someone else's shoes...i guess I feel like those aren't my shoes, I have no business wearing them. I have my own problems why do I gotta try yours on too.... I also know that this is one reason I'm not leadership material. 
1	I'm not sure if what I'm advising completely encompasses all that there is regarding empathy but I would suggest making an intentional effort to observe how you communicate with others verbally and non-verbally and incrementally add new habits to your repertoire. Some of the habits I feel will take you closer to coming off as an empathetic person are: \n*Learning about and practice validating emotions \n*Learn about and practice active Listening \n   this will involve things like: \n-giving appropriate eye contact when others are talking\n-incorporate phrases that encourage the speaker to continue talking like "Tell me more" \n- every now and then you can summarize or repeat what someone has said to get confirmation that you are understanding them correctly like "If I'm understanding you correctly what happened was _____" \nIt's kind of hard to pinpoint all the habits that kind of give off the impression that you are being empathetic but I think in general at least for listening the main things are: understanding (respecting the fact that there are two sides to an issue and truly listening and withholding judgement), Genuine Interest/Attentiveness. \nTo be honest I really feel like it’s just a handful of things you just really need to consistently change like maybe a 20% change in behaviour and that would help tremendously. When I think about empathy I feel like it’s not hard to see that if you do the following people can start to see a shift in behaviour: \nValidate the emotions of others \nGive off the non-verbal and verbal cues that you are interested in what people are saying \nMake an effort to show to people that you truly value their perspective and want to understand what they think and feel\nA big thing as well is to become conscious of what emotional invalidation is and what it looks like and it’s things like: \n “Don’t be so dramatic.”\n “Deal with it.”\n “You can’t be serious.”\n “But it doesn’t make any sense to feel that way.”\n “Why are you making such a big deal over it?”\n “You shouldn’t let it bother you.”\n\nThis may sound silly but another thing that can help is to do some research and notes about emotions and general theories of why and when we feel a specific emotions . And one of the habits, related to emotional validation you can build is offering your suggestion as to what you think the person is feeling. “You seem pretty upset”, “It sounds like you’re feeling pretty disappointed”. At the same time you have to accept that the person is the only one who\ntruly knows how she/he is feeling and if they correct you accepting their correction is a\nvalidation of their emotions. 
0	Need help from matured ISTJ girls	I am sorry that its going to be long. I don't mean any disrespect but just hurt.\n\nI am an ENFP guy recently ISTJ girlfriend broke up.\n\nIstj girlfriend 28 year: Depressed/suffers from anxiety and negetive thinking because of her childhood experiences with bipolar mom\n\nShe was very happy because I was able to understand her depression and was with her after therapy sessions. She was so peaceful that I came into her life.\nIn the beginning of our relationship she and her friends got drunk too much which was a huge turn off for me. I almost wanted to breakup..I was mad at her. She started crying. I told myself to forgive her and never to leave her because I did not want to take away that happiness or peace which she got after years. I never told this to her though but I had to love her more because it is my decision to be with her. I forgave her but also had to love her more so that her value in my heart doesnt go down (its a decision)\n\nI was mad about her friends for couple of weeks whenever she said she is meeting them. Thats it one day she broke up. I literally begged her(not out of desperation but to explain why I didnt break up with her). She blocked me everywhere and its been 30 days.\n\nISTJ's are freaking blind for emotions. Who would want to not breakup with a few extra pounds,durkard, depressed and anxious person? I dont have any benfit from my decision but its my decision to love her bring her out of her pain. It is the worst feeling when your mind doesn't listen to you.\n\n\nYou may ask why I decided?\n\nI wanted to be with her and give her strength because I have been there (anxiousness) and I know the pain.I was optimistic about our life together. \n\nBecause pain is pain for anyone. No one should deserve pain or suffering. Is someone is going through pain it is our responsibility as a human to bring them out of it. \n\nExample : \n"Pain of you breaking your finger, tears, suffering= pain of someone breaking their finger, tears, suffering"\n\nIf you want to avoid your pain then someone should also be helped/helped to avoid breaking their finger.\n\nUpdate:\n\nI met an ESFJ, ENFP(exactly my type and also I really liked), and talked to many girls in this month because ENFP quickly want to avoid/skip breakup pain by replacing it with someone or something. But it didnt work for me this time. I myself told the Esfj, enfp girls that it wont work and disconnected with other girls because I coukdbt take this istj girl out of my mind.\n\nShe unblocked me over fb but not of instagram. I texted her over phone but no response. Istj's see only their way but no other possibilities or alternatives. You are brutal to others and also yourselves but you dont realise that because you don't see it.\n\nI admire your personality type when it comes to planning, decision making and dedication. \n\n\nWhat should I be doing now?\n\n\nIs it time to turn on my T type which makes me ENTP one of the worst personality types which makes me senseless to anything or should I wait for her.
6	Don’t wait for her. \n\nAs someone who struggles with anxiety and self-worth due to my childhood, real peace can only come from within and she needs to work on that without a crutch. Drinking heavily is also a crutch. Your ex needs professional help. \n\nI don’t care for how you seem to use your “love for her” as a way to convey how you’re a good/better person. How you love her despite the flaws. I’m sure you have flaws too. \n\nThere’s nothing to gain by sticking around, hoping your ex will come back around. \n
2	I'm trying to make sense out your story but I cannot. I wouldn't be surprised if part of the story is missing here, no offense.\n\nAnyways, she moved on and you should do the same. She was unstable and you seem like a good person, you'll find someone else. Time will heal! Best of luck my friend.
1	Hey, sorry this happened to you. You really did care for her, but it didn't seem to be enough - someone in poor mental health might not be able to accept your love at all. When I struggle with similar issues myself, loving someone else as fully as I can is simply out of the question. My mental health becomes a glaring problem to me, something I feel like I need to fix on my own. I wouldn't want to cause someone else unhappiness from being with that version of me - maybe she's looking out for you too, in a more, to her, logical way. When I'm down, I have trouble considering other people's emotions and tend to shut them out until I'm okay again. To be honest, I would see your behavior as overbearing.\n\nI think the best thing to do here is move on. If you've let her know you'll be there for her if she needs you, that's all you can do. I hope you take care of yourself in the meantime. I'm sure she wants you to, too.
1	She is taking you for granted and does not sound like she is appreciative of your feelings. Even as an ISTJ, we tend avoid connecting through emotions but should at least be wary of their significant other’s feelings and make an effort to dispel any negative factors like distrust. If I were to be in her shoes, honestly, I would want some space to then realize how special you are to me or have some value to my life.
0	Bottom line is that we sever relationships pretty easily for one reason or another. If you tried to step between her and her friends, that's a real good reason to drop you. We don't bond with people easily and we sure as hell don't want to give up several ppl that we've bonded for one person who may not share the same values but impress them upon us anyway. And really, all she needs to not want you again is to find a shiny new guy to attach to. Ppl are super replaceable to us. It's a defense mechanism and it works like a charm! Find a new lady. Don't try to control her. Don't try to fix her. Don't try to segregate her. 
12	What does flirting look like for an ISTJ?	There’s an ISTJ I know who seems to be almost hiding a smile when I’m around. He and I spend a lot of time around each other one on one and sometimes have deep conversations. I’m not a particularly flirty person though, and I don’t suspect he is; nothing has been outright said or done that would imply interest. How can I tell?
38	ENFP here. A few clues I’ve picked up on throughout the years... If they’re romantically interested in you, there may be a physical attraction but they don’t usually leap in, they take a while to see if you’re a suitable partner. They’re extremely “acts of service” oriented. They’ll do something nice for you but it usually won’t be romantic, so it’s hard to tell if it’s a flirtation or a kind gesture... they may help you with a task at work, or run an errand or ask you if you want anything from the soda machine etc. If they like you, they’ll find reasons to be around you. ISTJs don’t hang out and play nicey-nice w people they don’t like. That shy smirk is adorable and yeah, in my experience it’s a sure sign they’re nervous/excited about being around you. You’ll need to be clear about your interest.. “hey I’m sorry if this is weird, but I just wanted to tell you I really enjoy being around you and if you’re interested in getting to know each other better, I’d love to spend some more time with you... maybe a date sometime. If you’re interested, you know where I’m at!” Give them some time... they (and the other IxTx’s) like to take some time to evaluate the situation and see if you’re a worthy partner. Very pragmatic people! 
11	Without more details, here is my advice: \n\nWell having deep conversations is most likely a good sign unless you are good friends? Then I'd say that is more normal. \n\nFrom my personal experience, and assumption of most guys and other ISTJs, we're terrible at judging if someone is interested in us. Your only hope is if you initiate flirtation which cannot be misconstrued as anything else. But your surest path to knowing would be to just be straightforward. ISTJs can handle straightforward haha. \n\nGood luck. 
11	As one, I don't get it and later discover someone was flirting and I'd be like, oh!\nI like a direct approach to things.
4	Mostly done without you knowing it. ISTJs tend to use social media as a way to learn more about you. They might throw you a like on an older picture. In person they might back away/leave. \nFinding common ground (conversation) is a great way to get one to open up to you, especially someone who is highly introverted. Make them feel comfortable and they will be more likely to show interest in you.
4	I rarely feel comfortable flirting with someone I'm interested in unless I see signs that they like me too. My feelings show through my actions, which can come off as just being nice.. maybe see if he treats you with special care, offering extra help and such. I need to know the other person is interested before I let myself be flirty, out of fear of breaking boundaries (a romantic interest is considered a friend first and foremost - I'll need to observe more interactions before taking steps to the next level). Also, if I'm constantly seeking to spend one-on-one time having deep conversations with someone, there's a high chance that I like them.. watch for consistency and increased comfort. If this tests your patience, look for ways to make your interest known, and don't be subtle :) hope that helps.
2	I go extra mile for people I like. Ill do/make something nice for them.\n\nI wish people fit some magic formula I can plug variables in and get an answer but that not how it works despite MBTI or any other test. Only sure way of knowing, however, is asking. Suggest going out for a coffee or lunch one day... And work it from there. 
2	From what I done:\n\n- Compliment on their appearance or how they smell \n\n- Tried sexting though I do need encouragement \n\n- Spend or tried to spend a lot more quality time with them\n\nHonestly I'm just really uncomfortable with flirting. And if someone flirts with me I don't know how to react other than saying "thank you" and smiling.

3	Hey fellas, INTP asking for help here	Btw my English sucks, but please bear with me\n\nHey, so as the title says, I need help trying to figure out why my ISTJ buddy behaves the way he does, without dissecting him, it would be too invasive, don't you think?\n\nAnyway, we were having a discussion, he stated that the sole purpose of life is just to be happy and enjoy, which triggered my disagreement immediately. We had discussions on this topic quite a few times, but each time it ended up with me explaining why he should be precise with his terms and not mix them up all the time. \n\nThis time I had a lot of spare time, so I decided to finally answer him fully without him interrupting, he asked me why I think happiness is not the purpose of life.\n\nI, being excited to finally be able to articulate my argument fully, wrote a soul crushing argument, and gave him the alternative point of view, to which he responded - I see where you're coming from but I'll stick to my ways, not to say your argument is bad, it's just that we all have a right to our own opinion. I mean sure - we all have that right, but that doesn't make every opinion equally as good.\nNow I honestly would just give up on talking with him about deep topics, but I don't want him to screw himself over, I honestly care about him(Fe inferior)\n\nAny tips on how to deal with this situation? Is this an ISTJ thing, or is it something unique to him perhaps?\n\nThanks a lot in advance!\n\n\n\n\nEdit: formatting, am on mobile
12	I will disagree with you.  On the subject of your own life, your own opinion on how to live it, is the only one that counts.\n\nIf you can provide a persuasive argue, and change someone mind, that is fine.  But you didn't do that, as he was not persuaded.
6	Hmm I would disagree with his opinion to a degree. I definitely think a big part of life is being happy and enjoying it, but that shouldn't be your only goal IMO. I think that making the people you have in your life happy is equally as important, because ultimately, humans are the most important thing in life. Yeah you can live a very hedonistic life and enjoy it, but I don't think it'd bring as much fulfillment as having good people in your life. \n\nI can understand him basically saying to agree to disagree. I do that with my friends a lot. I don't believe certain opinions are better than others, at least with topics like this. He's not really hurting anybody by being happy and enjoying life. But they're are opinions that are actively harmful compared to others, like anti-vax etc. 
7	While I don't necessarily agree with his opinion, I do agree with his response. \n\nI think everybody should live their lives the way they want to, as long as they are choosing the lifestyle willingly and consciously and are not affecting other people.\n\nPersonaly, I don't think I could change a strong opinion I have of something unless provided with a few very strong facts, and those just don't exist on a topic as subjective as one's purpose in life.\n\nIt may be easier to just agree to disagree. Unless he's being self-distructive, which is a different discussion.
4	I'm not ISTJ but in a relationship with an ISTJ. (I myself am INFJ)\n\nI don't understand why you think purpose of one's life is something universal based on your own perspective that you can argue is applicable to everyone.\n\nMy SO and I see different purposes for our respective lives, and we're in a serious relationship! As a couple, our interest is whether and how where we're each coming from might (and/or might not) converge and intersect. \n\nIn relationships of all sorts, whether friendships or otherwise, the ability to listen and connect well across difference - including the basic understanding that this other person is not you and doesn't see or experience or desire things identically to yourself - is actually a sign of maturity and health, IMO. Your approach seems to lack that basic maturity from what I see in the OP.\n\nThat you believe you can and should argue with him about how he identifies his own desires and purpose is mindblowing to me. \n\n>I honestly care about him(Fe inferior)\n\nA great way to express that care is to respect him for where he's coming from, to do your best to accurately understand where he's coming from in the first place, and to support that as well as you can. 
4	How to deal with it?\n\nStop trying to change him or make him have some moment of enlightenment. You’re the problem here. Is reaction is completely on par with his type. \n\nWhat are you even trying to achieve? #rhetorical
3	Maybe your friend had other things on his mind, or wasn't feeling well, or, just for some reason, had run out of fucks to give just now. He might give you a better answer later. 
2	Yes its very ISTJ (very Si dom and Fi tert)\n\nTo convince an ISTJ you must make them believe their way of thinking is what you are saying, or at least similar enough.
2	>  I see where you're coming from but I'll stick to my ways, not to say your argument is bad, it's just that we all have a right to our own opinion. \n\nThis is the correct response. \n\nI recognize you’re giving advice based on what you think is best from a place of caring, but what he does with his life has no effect on yours (provided he’s not your dependent or stealing from you). \n\nWhen I was younger, I was more likely to give *unsolicited* advice because I thought I knew better. While I may still have those thoughts, I find I have mellowed in some ways because what would be imo the smartest decision is not necessarily the *best* decision for that other person for a number of reasons I may or may not be aware of. \n\nOur past experiences define us and how we react in the future. Unless you’ve actually walked a mile in their shoes, just keep your opinion to yourself unless they ask for it, if you want to maintain the friendship. 
2	Didn’t read all the comments, but I cant believe how people doesn’t agree with you! Instead of helping you to help your friend, they try to argue with what you said instead ughh. People, the focus here is HELPING HIS ISTJ FRIEND, not trying to blame this intp for his not properly constructed arguments!\n\nI think the misconception here is, your friend is living his life for the pleasure, which equals to temporary happiness. This is what actually you’re trying to say right? You want him to stop being dependent of the pleasure life can give to him. What I mean by this for those who disagrees is, for example someone who loves eating. He can eat alot of what he loves, it gives him pleasure. If he cannt control the portion , how frequent he eats, then this causes diabetes and obesity. And then eventually death. Pleasure is just a form of escapism of reality, and I think this is what your istj friend is doing.\n\n\nEventhough I said all that, I am not sure what advices to give. But I’ll try. One things to do is to change his environment. I think the little step is to organise his home (if he lives alone) or his room. Make it clean, and let all light enters the room. Make it as fresh as possible. I think this let his mind to clears up a bit from overthinking. \n\nI was also depressed before, and I know how I dont actually listen when people gives me advice because being depressed is how I can enjoy myself, being alone etc. Some change that I do is to try avoid listening to depressing songs, because it makes me becoming more miserable myself. These little things makes a greater change for myself, maybe you can identify whats on him too.\n\nI have a brother who is an istj, and it is also hard to win arguments against him (im intp). My mom told him to stop smoking because it is not good for his health. He does’t care. But somehow, one day he stopped smoking. And that change is due to his determination for a change (he doesn’t have money to buy ciggarete). He cleaned his room, becoming more hygienic himself and actually surpised by some changes he seen from not smoking. And all that is started after watching Youtube videos. He changed himself without any personal human intervention (only the impersonal = someone from the youtube video). So if they have the determination, everything falls out easily as an istj must and will achieve what they want if the set their goals themselves. Maybe dont try to force him or makes him feel forced about something, but make him realize it himself, to make his conditions better (by indirect interventions)\n\nI know I am not really answering your question. But just read what I have, maybe it does help abit. Sorry for my english though and messy thoughts (Ne).
2	If discovering your MBTI type changed your life (as it did mine), how do you handle the (scientific) criticism of it?	Alternate title: Is the MBTI the Thinking Man's horoscope?\n\nMy background (can be skipped): \n\n>!I spent most of my life up to age 25 struggling (and failing) to understand myself and other humans. Fortunately, my 1st employer out of grad school paid for my 1st MBTI test, where I came out as an ESTJ. This helped me somewhat. A failed relationship 3 years later made me realize I'm an \*I\*STJ (I think I answered the original test in a manner that skewed towards extroversion, as only very recently has the stigma around introversion started to go away.)!<\n\n>!Since then, my understanding of myself and others has gone through the roof. I know my limits, exactly which situations and people I'll thrive in and around, etc. My self definition has solidified, resulting in breakthrough confidence, among other things.!<\n\n>!Basically, I'm the poster child for the MBTI: the person who was lost at sea about themselves until they took the test.!<\n\nHowever, in recent years there've been a lot of really well thought out and valid attacks on the test (such as this [one](https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2013/mar/19/myers-briggs-test-unscientific).)\n\nHow do you folks who found the test as life changing as I did reconcile that with it possibly not being accurate or giving useful results?
7	I think that as long as MBTI is just used for observation and a little prediction there is no problem. I mean if you have a person that always rafts the same way to a specific situation it's only reasonable to expect them to act the same way again when you put them in the same situation. So that's the 16 types, basically putting people on categories on how they are propably going to react to certain situations. However the cognitive functions aren't proven and I don't think they should be used much. 
5	A system can have valid criticisms but still hold some meaningful truth.  I'm hesitant to predict anyone's behavior based off MBTI but it's very useful for understanding behavior in hindsight.
4	Still depressed cause Ive been fucking up my entire life but now I know why

2	Have you taken a learning styles test? I describe it to people like that. How proven is learning styles? But they are useful. You know you are a kinesthetic learner, a lecture learner, a visual learner, a social learner, ETC.... so how do you use that? Easily by understanding how you learn and you understand how you do things and what your strengths and weaknesses are.\n\nSo say you are a hands on kinesthetic learner. You try to take classes like that or do work like that. Or adapt classes with more hands-on experience. If you work try to include more of this in your work.\n\nLikewise here.\n\nIf you are an istj si te fi ne, right? Okay let’s see.\n\nYou have si what does si mean? You are gifted with details and facts, with more concrete type of learning. Probably lecture based. Okay. Fine. That seems useful right? You like to do things step by step. MOre pragmatic. You prefer useful pragmatic information and more trivia based stuff. Si. Good at research stuff. Good at reading and following directions. Very protocol based. Check. Thats also si. Good at applying and using past memories and events. Check. All the things that are si based. Use that to your advantage. Explain it to people like that. I have a gift for these things.\n\nYou are a thinker and you tend to be very much in to efficiency and being pragmatic and productive. Te. Big on accomplishing things, and if needed leadership. Te. You are good at getting stuff done and you are a very competent person. Te. You have the gift of organizing things and such. \n\nTell people it like that. ISTJ sometime doesn’t work for people.\n\nFor example I tell people not immediately about mbti but I tell them this.\n\nYeah, I tend to be a natural leader and have that gift and I have the gift of knowledge. (This is ni.) I am also good at discernment and insight (this is also ni).  So yeah, and you know some people are better at that and some people are more logistical people. Some people are more extroverted and some people are really more introverted. And some people really do well with connecting with others or expressing their feelings and really championing there causes. Some people are great at enforcing moral codes and such, very gifted at keeping in touch with their morals. Some of us are naturally more emotional then others or more in to rational thinking, not that the people who are emotional isn’t rational and vice versa. But they tend to naturally be inclined you know. You see it right?\n\n\nI don’t mention anything about mbti. The things in parens are for you reading this I don’t speak them. But they understand and most people honestly agree with me. I can see that. I think some people in certain roles of my life don’t see the te because I am a low level worker and volunteer as a non-leader role and my fi can be triggered at this place. This was at church today. I am part of the greetings ministry and we actually had a discussion about mbti but I didn’t bring up the name or word mbti to anyone just talked about it. No one could disagree with me. I think a lot of people don’t really see te on the greeting ministry. I am just very enneagram 3 there. I sometimes talk to them about that but honestly haven’t really too much but I’d do the same thing. \n\nDoes this help?.
1	The way I figure it is this: proven science always describes reality, which non-scientific methods work for specific cases (read: people) but not necessarily the population at large. Ergo, it can work for individuals, but that doesn't mean it'll work for others.
1	any ISTJ on paper would understand that "feelings" are not science. if it makes you feel better sure, but the fact that you can score two different things 3 years apart means it's obviously not written in stone. jung and freud had some good ideas but many are pseudoscience. 
9	How do you feel when you thought you had a strong friendship with someone but they move on.	Hello! Just trying to see if its me that only feels that way.\n\nI'm currently in College and thruout the semesters I had made a few connections with classmates. They always seemed enthusiastic to come in and just casually talk before/after classes. Some even stopped me in the hallways to greet me and ask me questions about me. Even shared social media accounts/numbers.\n\nMost of those connections, they have been extroverts. While I understand some are super open and everyone they talk to is their "friend." I feel like they "forget" me.\n\nI just feel like they know a lot of people that I'm insignificant to them and they just say hi cause we just happened to have the same class. \n\n**I just feel everyone moves on so quickly from my life that I can't start friendships.**
3	I get that.. we ISTJs can take some time to get to know, and it can feel like we're left behind for something more exciting. What I've noticed is that extroverts usually want to hang out more than I am used to, and they can sense that from me. I also tend to keep people at a certain emotional distance, so it's easy for people to see me as being "too cool" for them. Best thing to do is reach out yourself, and keep an open mind/heart about their love for you - they may be waiting for you to come around. I know my friends do.
3	I have the exact opposite problem: I'm terrible at maintaining friendships and it's all my fault. I'm not the type to message or call out of the blue, plus I prefer attractive, fashionable, cool, cosmopolitan people. In many ways, I'm a victim of my own elitist BS, but doing otherwise (spending time with people I'm not super into or who don't meet my "standards") bores the hell out of me.
2	I kinda felt the same way in college, at first. While it definitely sucks, there are ways to get past that stage of friendships. The classmates I grew closest to were people I began studying with or would grab lunch/dinner with after class and they were usually from my major classes so I could schedule future courses with them too. I also made several new, long lasting friendships when I began working, since we all saw each other on a regular basis and also hung out to talk about the coworkers/customers we didn’t like. 
2	Honestly, what you described doesn't seem to me like a strong friendship, so I guess they were just being nice to you and you misunderstood it... but you could make an effort to talk to these people and maybe even some other classmates and create an actual friendship. May be hard at first but it generally becomes more natural as you talk to them.
2	A lot of extroverts tend to make rather shallow friendships with a lit of ppl while introverts tend to make deeper friendships with fewer ppl. Most of the ppl you develop a type of friendship with will be at the  acquaintance level. Meaning your friendly with each other, hang out from time to time, follow on social media, etc, but it's not a long term fulfilling friendship, and that's OK. You'll only ha e a handful of ppl who make it to the "friend" level. Ppl who will follow you in life, through thick and thin. Ppl who may not be there every single day, may have long periods of time without a lot of contact, but still love you and care about you, even when they aren't in your ass. Those are the ppl you need to focus on. Keep those aquantances in your back pocket tho, in case you need to happen to need someone who knows someone. 
1	We’re all on our own journey. Occasionally paths cross, but they eventually separate, and that’s okay. Don’t be sad the friendship ended, be happy that it happened. Personally, I don’t expect my college friendships to last. They will end either at graduation or when one of us gets married. It doesn’t keep me from attempting friendship. However brief.

8	Advice on getting along with an ISTJ dad to an INTP son	So my dad and I get into petty arguments that go on until mum breaks them up, I understand that this is sort of supposed to happen in the teenage years but still when we have 5 minute arguments about something as minor as the correct amount of metal to leave on the lid of a can of condensed milk as to make sure it doesn't fall off (this actually happened a few hours ago)
4	I've had many arguments with my ISTJ dad, he is logical but not all his assumptions are correct and up to date! \n\nI'd say before arguing, try to get your facts (and his) straight. ISTJs like to see facts that are coming from a legit source, and they are open-minded about evaluating and accepting them. \n\nWhile arguing, do it with respect. We INTPs can take (even appreciate) a harsh debate, one with heated discussions, calling others wrong, being called wrong by others, full blown and no remorse! ISTJs aren't like that, they prefer calm debate and peaceful exchange. INTPs in Ti mode may see their voices raised without them even noticing, which the ISTJ may (wrongly) perceive this as you becoming angry or pushy! So: calm... and respectful... ;) that is the only way things move forward. \n\nISTJs are extremely impartial and cautious, while INTPs usually choose a side soon even if later we need to change sides with more information coming in. So we are more flexible in debate, while they are less flexible but very open-minded regardless. I've had many cases were the debate did not seem to actually have gone somewhere, but later me or my ISTJ dad would change our perspectives for the better. \n\nINTP and ISTJ are a great personality match, they share Ti and Ne according to model G stack. But Ti and Ne has more energy in INTP, so he should expect to have the upper hand most of the times in the discussions. Yet in your case (and mine) the ISTJ being the dad, has the higher status that needs to be respected, so we INTPs need to be even more flexible and carefully proceeding. It is good to be reminded that we are arguing with a person who loves us and we love them, and the fact that this person also happens to be logical and fair-minded. The situation could be much worse, like having a dark/unhealthy or an emotional/illogical dad. \n\nWish you both have wonderful times together... Peace. \n\n
2	I'm an ISTJ married to an INTP for years. We personally don't argue often but when we do we argue very differently and it's pretty much never productive. I will say we both have a strong need to be right so when we argue one of us usually dismisses the other one because we are convinced they are wrong without actually listening. Try calmly presenting your dad with fact based evidence. If you do it loudly or emotionally he probably won't listen. We absolutely hate being wrong, but that also means that if we are proven wrong we will accept it because otherwise...we would still be wrong and we don't like that.\n\nIf he still won't listen to you when presented calmly with facts... That's probably more of an age thing than an ISTJ thing. I have an ENTJ dad I have been butting heads with my whole life, but it's worse now because he's so set in his ways that he doesn't like to take into account any new research/discoveries/studies etc. done in the last like 20 years that disprove an old way of thinking. 
2	Sounds like you're a teenager who needs to shut his mouth about smalls things because guess what you aren't in charge. If you were having actual arguments about things that affected your life it would be one thing. \n\nRead "How to Make Friends and Influence People"\nYou will learn that sometimes you just need to let people be right, even if they are wrong. \n\nThis is something you should work on now and I don't think this has anything to do with your personality. To me you are young and think you need to assert your intelligence. Learn to be humble and not to bother with the small stuff. 
3	Curious INFP	Hey all! I've been dating a guy for about 3 months  who I'm fairly certain is ISTJ (I'm not 100% sure as he's not taken the test). I'm curious to learn more about your type, & was wondering if any of you had insights into what you believe makes a relationship work well for you? Anyway, thanks for the advice! Hope your day is going well 
4	Personally, I take a very practical approach to relationships.  What works is if the relationship checks all the boxes of "must-haves" and none of the boxes of "deal breakers".  I appreciate level-headed, rational approaches to solving problems and a lack of drama.  Throw in a spark of adventure every now and then and talk to me in my "love language" and I'll be happy!  I'm sure your partner has his own quirks and preferences but the above should cover some of the ISTJ traits.
2	Hi! I've dated an infp for about the same amount of time. Things I looked for were consistency and direct communication - due to my perceived coldness, my infp became fearful of expressing their feelings. Admittedly, I would be baffled by them at first - but please continue putting your feelings into your guy's head, even if he misunderstands them at first - he may need time to reflect. If you ever feel like he isn't expressive enough, say so - he will appreciate it and should take action. I needed to know what my infp needed, and vice versa. For me, a relationship works well when I know what my person wants, they recognize my actions, they're happier for it, and show me they love me in ways I can understand (and like said above, know each others' love languages!).
1	As an ISTJ who is married to an INFP, I will say that we usually balance each other out well. We do have our clashes at times, but we talk through any problems we’re having to come to a mutual understanding (which is important for any good relationship!) and agree on any behavior changes needed. I often forget that I need to be sensitive in my wording, but a gentle reminder now and then is all I need to rephrase things before I say them. We ISTJs can be very blunt with our opinions and forget how easy it is to offend others. More often than not, our opposite ways of thinking benefits the other. If he has a problem at work, I’m quick to come up with a solution that he may not have thought of. When I bring up issues, he explains what the other person (or people) may have been feeling in the circumstances and why I may have angered them. It’s also great to hear all of the ideas he comes up with, because I can determine the steps needed to achieve them and push for it to happen.\n\nThe most important advice I can give is to COMMUNICATE! You will have misunderstandings, but my husband likes to use analogies with me so that I have a direct and clear way to understand his feelings without any need for interpretation. Be specific and be as rational as possible!
2	What should I do when an ISTJ is huffy with me? (She's my sister)	 Today my ISTJ younger sister asked me to do something for her but I refused because I was busy. She kept saying and saying it again do I got angry at her and shouted... Now she behaves like shit and she's on my nerves every seconds of tonight...\nWhat should I do to her? I really want to refuse any fights but she's still on my nerves with the things she do.
5	I feel the age dynamic may complicate things between you. She’s probably still learning how to communicate her feelings. For me as in istj if I asked my sibling or parents for help- I needed it. Being independent and driven, I often don’t like reaching out in any form, so if I asked for help and didn’t get it I may even have felt embarrassed for asking. 
2	We don't feel strong emotions for very long so leave her alone for a while and she'll get over it. Trying to address it while she's still pissy will just make her pissy. I know I have a hard time finding words when I'm upset and that makes me even more upset because I feel like a stuttering babbling idiot. In my head it looks almost like a moving van gogh masterpiece of nonsense.... How do you find words for that? Especially when it's happening in the moment? Also, a lot of the time, when I get THAT upset.... I am almost never really upset about what just happened, that's just the point where I cracked. I'm really bothered by 500 other smaller things and 7 medium sized things that's just making me overwhelmed. So I wouldnt really focus on what upset her today, it may be more along the lines of the whole fucking month has been bullshit for one reason or another and she snapped today. And she'll be over it tomorrow. And you'll both be ok. Because if there's anything an ISTJ is good at, it's being ok after a blow up. 
1	That's fine too. I mean, she's your sister, it's not like she's going any where. And if she does open up, hear her, she may not need advice or solutions, she may just need to be heard. Ranting is good for the soul. I don't have a sister but I hear they make good rant partners. Just spewing whatever bullshit you want to without fear of judgement or ridicule, getting all that "stuff" off your chest so you can approach it again with a fresh mind and heart. 
1	you will argue, because you are 2 different ppl with two different minds, and if any two ppl always agree, that means one of them isnt thinking. And I assume your both thinking ppl. It's not uncommon for 13 yo girls to have depression... I had it, my daughter had it, my mom had it, hell, I think everyone I know was depressed from age 12 to 16. And those depressed girls make sure everyone in their house is depressed too. That's not ISTJ, that's teenage girl. Of course, severities differ and all, but some depression is normal. 
1	wish i knew this would resolve so many arguements with my ISTJ dad
11	Is this potentially ISTJ guy interested (ENFP Female)?	Confused as to whether this (possibly) ISTJ guy I like is interested in me. For some background, when we first met, I had to be the one to introduce myself to him. Managed to do some small talk where he asked questions about myself back, but I felt as if I had to be the one to extend the conversation. Later that night, I asked a friend of his what he thought of me, and my friend promised to ask him. So, the second time I see him, my friend tells me that apparently he thought I was really attractive, and says that he's probably interested and that I should give it a shot. We all go out to a club, and I notice that this guy I like is sober and sort of lingering in the back by himself. Eventually, my friends decide to leave the both of us alone and he asks if I'd like to get a drink with him. When we get our drinks we go outside to have a conversation, and this is where things start to get confusing....\n\nI'm used to guys being the one to lead you around, and initiating most of the action (For instance, I do think its worth noting that earlier I had to be the one to ask if he had instagram and he enthusiastically gave me his account and followed me back immediately... Moving on tho...) I noticed that as we were walking to the smoking patio he kept following me around rather than the opposite... (generally speaking most guys I've interacted with would be the one to lead the way, hold your hand, or lightly drag your shoulder across the room from one end to the other).... So then, the conversation I had with him is like our very first where it's me just asking him questions about his interests, basic life story, and all this nonsensical small talk, and he occasionally gave some lengthy answers but once again he seemed rather silent and unemotional.. \n\nEventually I sort of get closer to him, like lightly lean against his arm as we're conversing (mainly because some guy rudely interrupted our conversation and tried to talk to me... wanted to give this stranger a signal that I was with someone else)... and he doesn't seem repulsed or seems to retaliate against my touch or anything... but there was no emotional response or reaction to the physical contact... I don't think I made him uncomfortable or anything because we continue the conversation as it was.. but later on when we're alone again and back at our halls (I'm in uni)... we decide to sit on the couch just to chill, I decide to lean my head against his shoulder and the same response... no reaction whatsoever... never asked me to stop cuddling, but he didn't reciprocate the physical contact either (with other guys usually more light displays of physical affection are returned like an arm around my waist or shoulder or something, but with this guy it's nothing...) I couldn't tell if I made him uncomfortable or whatnot? Maybe I came off as too strong with the light physical contact... but in the past I've never had a problem with guys feeling hesitant about that...
15	As he doesn't push you back when you touch him, I'd say he probably likes you and is just really nervous because he probably doesn't know how to react. It remembers me when I (an ISTJ) acted like a statue while a guy I used to date started touching and kissing me. I really wanted to do something but I just didn't know how to cope.\nSo I guess you could ask him why he doesn't do anything when you touch him and he will probably, over time, start acting like an actual human being and less like a fucking sculpture.
3	Yeah, we're not great at reading social cues, and the more subtle they are, the worse we miss them. We're also not great with small talk.\n\nIf you like him, tell him so, and be direct. If you want him to reciprocate the physical touching, tell him. Again, be direct.\n\nAnd when I say "be direct" I mean "if you're worried that it might be too blunt, say it."
2	This all seems perfectly normal to me. SOP for an ISTJ is to be reserved and stoic in all things, as emotion tends to get in the way. Not to say we're robots, inside his head things were probably going mental.\n\nIf you want this train moving faster, be more direct. Social queues and games aren't very effective with us. It's also worth noting that we make a big deal about relationships and you shouldn't push harder if you aren't serious.
2	I'd trust what his friend say.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nISTJs tend to be EXTREMELY nervous when someone shows interest in them that's beyond the friendship level. And if he is inexperienced in this "department" it'll be even more evident.  ISTJs are also honest and most of the time have no reason to lie.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe doesn't push you back when you touch him or are close to him. It could be either due to not being familiar with the situation or that he genuinely likes you or both. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHim also following you is probably his way of showing interest. I think I did that when I show interest in a lady at a party and want to take things further than grinding.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHim enthusiastically giving you his insta is actually relevant because he probably thinking that you're into him if you asked for contact, though phone #s would be better imo. Make sure you actually message him and text him. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou're gonna have to be initiating a lot at first until he gets the hang of things. Then he can take it over from there. Be gentle and soft cause dude's probably nervous as hell and don't want to fuck things up.
1	If i were you, to kinda chip away at his wall and find out more about his interest level in you, I would rely on texting. We don't read social cues or body language, small talk is unbearable, responding appropriately, especially to someone new, can be really hard for us. We are, however, really smart, interesting ppl, who have a lot to say. Texting takes out the social stuff that were no good at. You can get to know him better, and you can be open (blunt) with him about what your looking for and he will take those conversations and follow through whe your together.... But right now... He dont know what his next move should be. He's still shocked he got past the "staring til she talks to me" stage. 
1	I am ISTJ and from your description he seems interested. However you need to be more blunt and direct if you want a reaction out of him. On the other hand its totally understandable if his lack of reaction is turning you off. ISTJ and ENFP is as opposite as it can possibly get
2	What is your mbti and love style?	
1	ISTJ, 1. Quality time, 2. acts of service and 3. words of affirmation
1	I'm an INFP. My primary love languages are quality time & words of affirmation
1	ISTJ. Craving my presence, unconditional kindness, humor, amazing sex. 
0	just wondering how ISTJs would respond to this	If we count judgments of *moral obligation* out of the equation,\n\nQuestion 1: How is murder logically fine?\n\nQuestion 2: How is murder logically wrong?\n\nNOTE: Feel free to write down whatever thought you have, whether it is emotional or just plain retarded.\n\nEDIT: phrasing
5	Without morals i don’t think you can objectively say murder is bad or wrong. It’s a bit like asking what makes [insert color here] the best color. You can’t answer without an opinion with the color question and you can’t answer without morals with the murder question.
2	My thought is that murder is fine if it prevents a more serious event (burglary, car jacking.) and not find if it is without due cause (killing unjustly just to kill) \nObviously if there is a less violent way to resolve a problem I’d explore that first. 
2	Maybe\n“fine” because we’re on a piece of dust floating around the cosmo and we’re all going to die. \n\nNot okay because you’re deciding when that person dies when it’s not your decision. 
1	The use of deadly force is allowed when used in the defense of the nation (invasion), in the defense of others (hostage rescue), and in self defense. Use of deadly force against the innocent and unarmed is never allowed. In addition to these three conditions, use of deadly force may be used by agents of the gov’t to prevent an escape, to prevent damage to property, or to prevent a terror attack.
1	1. Murder can be logically fine, if the end results are of greater impact ie killing one individual to save multiple lives. Or as self-defence and a few other reasons I agree with others have posted. \n\n2. Religion I guess idk and to maintain society and not become chaotic 
1	Murder is fine is when it's evident that someone wants to kill your ass and you kill that person in self-defense, or when a person is a really big threat to society and will not comply with police orders, or to prevent a more tragic event (i.e. terrorist attack, school shootings, from the opposition to win the war, etc.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMurder is more so morally wrong, unless the situation is one mentioned above. You're taking someone's right to live away from them. You're taking them away from their friends and family. However, sometimes it's warranted. There's really no logic to murder since in the state of nature, that wouldn't exist.
1	"Thou shalt not murder."\n"Love your neighbor as yourself."\nI believe morality is based on a transcendent being. That's it, really.
7	Any ISTJs dating or married to ISFJ? Does it get too boring?	Getting closer to ISFJ female, and it’s really up to me to move the relationship forward - if I would want to. One thing that makes me think is we are quite similar, with both being introverts, with both leading Si....\n\nFor those that have this kind of relationship- does it get boring? How do you overcome that? How do you grow & go out of comfort zone? Do you sometimes wish you were with someone more spontaneous? \n\nThanks ahead for the replies! 🙏🏼 
4	It doesn't get too boring if you make an effort to try new things every so often.  It's great to have someone else who appreciates having quiet nights in, just make sure you break your routine every now and then!
3	ISTJ here, I dated an ISFJ for 9 months and just started dating an ISTJ last month. It comes down to effort. Little things and big things. Both types notice the little things and see them as being sweet, while putting effort in doing different activities shows big things and helps break routine. Doesn’t have to be life altering, go out for a walk in the park, go out for some ice cream, watch a movie, etc. just go out and have some fun. Like any relationship once one party doesn’t put in any effort it will fall apart, my ISFJ didn’t want to put in the safe level of effort and commitment and it all went to hell fast.
20	ISTJs in group tasks	As an ISTJ still in school, whenever there are group tasks, 3 of the following either happens: \n\na) Do the whole thing myself and have it as a ‘back up’ assignment whilst everyone else wastes time \n\nb) Amongst a group of mostly introverts become the leader and delegate minimal tasks to others or tasks that I can’t do such as animating or keep all the important, big tasks for myself \n\nc) Advise the group leader on what we should do, providing information, research and advice \n\nHow do other ISTJs approach group tasks? \n
9	B mostly. \n\nIf no one wants to step up to lead, I will but I would much rather prefer to be in a supportive role. But if I think the leader isn’t doing it right and isn’t listening, I’ll take over instead with logic to support why. 
3	I opt out of I can, I literally asked the teacher if I could just work by myself. 
2	When I'm at work, usually it's a one person job, but sometimes there's a second person that's technically equal but I usually take the leadership role in those situations. Unless, of course, I'm working with a work beastie, then we just goof off while getting everything done in half the time so we can goof off some more. 
3	I would say I most closely do C. I have only lead a group assignment once, and that was because the leader was chosen randomly by the professor. It was honestly harder than I thought. Just reaffirmed my idea that I'm not the best at leading. I just had trouble simply trusting everyone to do their job and ended up doing more than I needed to. I would say I basically did B during this time, but like I said, tried to "help" everyone doing their part and ended up doing too much honestly. \n\nOverall, I didn't hate doing group projects honestly. I just MUCH preferred being a contributing member and not the leader. 
1	Don’t feel lazy, it’s not a competition. I was simply sharing my experiences. :-) \nMy intended major has been accounting/econ with the hopes of going into finance (either working as an analyst or financial planner) but that’s as far as I have gotten with it. 
1	Mostly C but sometimes A depending on the group. I rather support from the back than lead the project.
1	I have done all 3
8	Survey on Flirting behaviors and Personality	Hey I am a doctoral Student at a University in the South. I am studying flirtation behaviors, specifically trying to catalog specific flirting behaviors taken from several experimental studies. I was wondering if I could post to this community as it seems relevant to my topic. Thank you in advance for taking the time to take the survey there is an opportunity to win a gift card if the entire survey is completed. You can back out at any time.\n\nHere is the link to the survey\n\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JMQP5PJ
4	The bulk of this survey is not about flirting. 3 pages of personality test??\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I quit. Too long. 
3	Wow was questioning whether to try this after reading other's comments about it being so long, but it's been very revealing so far. I didn't ever think about how bad I am at flirting frankly haha. Will finish soon!\n\nEDIT: So I'm onto the section on how well these fit my definition of flirting and I'm honestly confused, do people normally flirt with most of these methods? Especially ones like touching their butt/legs, asking if they want to have sex etc? I honestly could never see myself doing this, guess that's why I'm nowhere near the best flirter IMO ha.
1	That was interesting. Thank you.
1	Done! Good luck.
1	Sorry. I couldnt make it past the laundry list of demographic info collection
1	Done!
1	Try mentioning ahead of time that there’s 200+ questions
7	Any of y’all fall for an INFJ? If so, why?	
6	INFJs are getting so much hate recently, I love them as long as they don't get mad at me lmao
4	My boyfriend of 6 years is INFJ. Part of what I like most about him are how different we are in the ways we connect with people and I’ve been able to learn a lot from him and be inspired by him. He’s so considerate of all people and is a great communicator, whereas I am naturally not. He’s also a lot more decisive than I am and isn’t hesitant at all to stand up for what is right.
2	I wish I asked this of the last woman I was interested in. \n(I’m an INFJ)
1	I'll chime in with an ENFJ I just dated, if it helps. \n\nI fell for her because she was so different to me honestly. I had never dated someone so caring, intuitive and we had some of the best conversations of anyone I've dated as well. \n\nIt ended up not working because we were too different IMO. It was very refreshing coming from dating an INFP (I believe that was her type, it's been a couple years) to find someone that felt like we filled in any gaps each of us had. Unfortunately, [there were problems we couldn't agree on](https://www.reddit.com/r/ISTJ/comments/a6dlup/future_cohabitation_problem_with_enfj_so/), and her being flighty on things in general, which led to us basically drifting apart and we recently had an amicable breakup. We're still friends, and I honestly think it'll be nice to have basically my opposite type as a friend. \n\nHope this helped at least a little. 
1	From the other side: I'm INFJ in a 3+ year relationship with an ISTJ. I can't speak to *why* she loves and values me, it puzzles me sometimes. I feel so fortunate to have her in my life and it's hard to see myself from her POV. But there is no question that she loves me and that she pretty deeply values having me in her life. That is quite explicit between us. 
0	Ew no. Too much Fe and Ni.
8	Tips on handling stress as an ISTJ?	I am a teacher and this term I was promoted into the upper grades where the curriculum is different to what I'm used to, parents are a nightmare to deal with and the kids are doing terrible. To make up for my lack of experience I started cutting any fun out of my life and reduced my hours of sleep, that in turn affected my relationship and caused issues, which led to a breakup.\nStill I didn't improve as much, returned to smoking in an attempt to calm my nerves, to no avail.\nI'm feeling under fire, weekends are spent staring at social media unable to move a muscle, and lifting the blanket in the morning to go to work feels like bench pressing a 1000 pounds. \nWhat are the things I can do to reduce the stress levels in my life? Changing my workplace is not an option at this point.
10	I have to force myself to maintain a healthy work life balance otherwise I won't manage my stress well. That means I:\n\n1. Try to stick to a 40 hour work week (except when truly urgent projects need my time) \n2. Actively schedule "fun time" into my routine. "Fun time" has to be spent doing fun stuff, like gaming, working out, building something etc. No work allowed.\n3. Strictly follow my sleep schedule. Getting lazy in that area makes me tired (less productive) and more vulnerable to illness. \n4. Ditch all social media outright.  You can't waste time on Facebook without an account. I still come on reddit to kill time but it's not a problem for me.\n5. Eat right, even though I don't spend much time cooking. \n6. Stay active, including going outside. \n7. Don't worry about things that are outside my control. \n\nSee if you can get counseling. I hope this helps
5	My school district offers free counseling. Can you talk to a counselor? 
3	I've always felt setting up a routine can a bit daunting to begin with.\n Sure, it's someting to strive towards, but first, you need to start somewhere! Anywhere. Somewhere simple preferably.\n\nI suggest you meditate. This helps me when my head gets too fuzzy that I can't think strait.\n\nHide in the bathroom at work for 5 minutes, close your eyes and breathe (maybe find a closet if breathing in the bathroom is not so nice).\n\nDo the same at home, in the evening or weekends. Put down the phone/social media for 5 minutes. Get a meditation app, or set a timer if you must.\n\nAnd remember, meditation is like a shower. It doesn't matter if it was successful, or if you're good at it. What matters is that you do it.
6	It's so fucking cliche, but exercise is your friend in this realm. You'll need to establish a solid 20-30 minute workout routine and build that shit into your weekly activities - do this at least 3 days / week. For me, it's a combination of running and martial arts. I can't think straight unless I sweat a little each day. And it's very noticeable to me days when I don't get any exercise. It is a PITA to establish the habit, but once you're in the groove you will be happy you made the effort.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs far as it being related to MBTI - I know that I am very much a creature of habit and really thrive in an environment heavily moderated by routine. I run M, W and F. And martial arts are T, W, TH and sometime Sat. It's just part of my daily routine now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMake the effort - you will be repaid in spades.
2	As a fellow istj I can relate to your situation. Meditation and breathing exercises helped me a lot. 
2	Cutting back fun was a good option for the time being because even if you go out to have fun, you wont have any with this weighing on you. Cutting back on sleep doesnt help anyone though - get your sleep schedule back on track.\n\nIf the curriculum is not something youre used to, then take time to master it until it becomes something you are so comfortable with you are more an expert than anyone else. \n\nAs for the parents and kids, i dont know what to say besides know your limits and boundries and make them clean. Set expectations and communicate them clearly. Clear regular communication to help the situation with bith the parents and the children.\n\nLastly, i think a therapist would help. You seem to be experiencing extreme anxiety and avoidance
2	Si values what is familiar so when an ISxJ gets a new job, it takes a bit for them to get used to their “new normal.” This uncertainty causes anxiety and stress. When an ISTJ is stressed about stuff, they tend to go catatonic and either sleep or numb themselves to hide from the stressor. The very best thing you can do to combat the nerves and stress is to work out! ISTJs are grounded, down to earth, physical people and they need to exert that nervous energy in order to get good sleep and focus on making the best of the new situation until it becomes Si-normal and you can be comfortable in the environment again. I hope everything works out for the best! I’m an ENFP so I’m all excited for your new opportunity, because of course I am. Haha 
2	Bottle it all up inside and tell no one!! At least that's how I manage.
2	I started consuming cannabis.  It is not for everyone but it has changed me in positive ways and helps with stress levels
2	> cutting any fun out of my life\n\nUnhealthy.\n\n> reduced my hours of sleep\n\nAlso unhealthy.\n\n> returned to smoking\n\nOK getting cancer might help your situation, long term /s\n\n> staring at social media\n\nBad for mental health.\n\nYes, you're overwhelmed. But you're responding to the stress with self-destructive behavior. Since you're an ISTJ, you should be able to set up a routine where you portion out time for yourself, relationships, and your job. For example, during the workday MAX OUT on your job. Once that's done, drop it and move on to the next thing (you time, for example.)
23	Lacking Emotional Connections	It feels like I'm watching people live their lives on a tv screen.\nI interact with the others, but it feels more like talking with non-playable characters in a Bethesda game.\nI suspected lacking empathy, which would indicate sociopathy. Having felt remorse in the past disqualifies this as a factor.\nWhen I read the ISTJ description about our difficulty regarding emotional connections, it hit me like a sledgehammer.\nHow do you maximize the human experience, while lacking a vital component of the human condition?\n\nEdit: I appreciate all of the responses. It's good to see that I'm not alone in this matter. I like the idea to express affection through acts of service. I intend to avoid mind altering substances, but I will definitely adopt a dog.
23	I find it hard to care about people and feel empathy until I know them. That obviously doesn't mean I'm a rude and selfish person, but rather that I do what I do because I think it's right rather than because I feel empathetic.
14	Hello there. \nI’m an INFJ male raised by an ISTJ mom, and just left a relationship with an INTJ female; there are somethings that I would like to share: \n\n1. You are capable of empathy, and expressing emotions, you just need to learn how. \n2. Love and affection are not the same thing. When I was younger, my mom showed love by making sure things were taken care of. She maintained the house, and prepared us for life. She’s not the affectionate kind. In fact I remember trying to cuddle with her as a boy and she would respond as if I was a stranger sleeping next to her in coach, leaning on her shoulder. But I knew that she loved me. She showed she loved by meeting all my non-emotional & psychological needs. \nAfter we took the love languages test as a family, I learned that my mom loves to receive love and give it via Acts of Service. understanding that she was an ISTJ, the emotional dynamics of Te/Fi, with her love language, it was glaringly clear to see in retrospect that she loved her children dearly. So dearly. We just didn’t know it at those times. \nWe all have superior work ethics compared to any of our peers, none of her children are lazy, we all know how to adapt with little, and we can make a dollar out of 15 cents. \nShe sent her love into our future. She made sure she trained us to be capable of training ourselves should the time come when she wouldn’t be around. \nShe did well. \nAll of her children (INFJ, ESTP, INTP) are well developed in Fe (my Fe is quite contagious 😬), so being raised by an iron hand, Te adept, single (dad left the picture, so you know how bitter ISTJs can behave sometimes), West-African mom , it was easy so compare her to some \nmeanie-mom fictional character. \n\nLove the way you know how, even if you can’t say those words, or you don’t like affection. And learn to be okay with hugs and kisses from someone who doesn’t know how to manage their life. \n\nBe aware that if you shun some forms of love (provided it’s appropriate) from some people- it can close that door of affection forever. My mom made that mistake with all 3 of us. \n\n\n3. Know your love language. And practice speaking other languages. \n\n4. Show love as best as you can to those that matter. Do it comfortably, don’t force it. Be honest if you’re in a relationship, tell your SO that you’re trying to learn to love. Ask for patience from them. The seed of such honesty can grow into a forest of expression, understanding, affection, love, gentleness, and kindness so rich that the fruits there of will change your life even if you two break up. \n\n5. Hangout with people you want to be like. Sometimes you’ll have to go through the motions in order to prime the pump.\n\nI don’t know if what I have said helps, but I have expressed all of this with sincerity of heart.\n\n\nI’m happy to answer any questions. \n
10	Yup. It’s so hard for me to care or show empathy. It took me a while to show my closest family members how much they mean to me. 
3	I struggle with showing any kind of emotion, and I struggle with reading others. I've recently been trying to force myself to show my feelings towards my family. My mother has been really supportive recently, and I feel the urge to say "I really appreciate this". But I've just said thanks and so on... it's hard man..
4	1. Quality of friends over quantity.\n2. Get a dog.
2	I struggle with showing any kind of emotion, and I struggle with reading others. I've recently been trying to force myself to show my feelings towards my family. My mother has been really supportive recently, and I feel the urge to say "I really appreciate this". But I've just said thanks and so on... it's hard man..
2	I have a rather strange strategy that I think I can only get away with because I smile a lot and am very non-threatening, but I hug practically everyone I know (other than people at work, though I hug a lot of them too). \n\nFrom the moment I meet them I tend to try to greet people with a hug. I have developed multi-stage and tailored hugs for different levels of friendliness and different ways other people hug back. The amount of comments I get on my hugging skills I wish I could make it a career.\n\nI find it very difficult to warm up to people and that makes it difficult for people to warm up to me. However, by using such a very personal, warm, welcoming gesture and making it a normative, non-invasive, non-judgmental action, I have found that it has lead to people being very warm in return and this accelerates a closer connection to others.\n\nThe closer I feel with others the greater my empathy is and the greater I feel a deep sense of affection for my friends. \n\nThere may also be something to say about doing acid and MDMA and how they may or may not have restructured my brain. I feel I have shifted more towards being an ISFJ over the past few years. 
2	Ask more questions. Get to know people. Dive deep into life and enjoy each bite
2	I find it hard to really care about others beyond sympathy/empathy and giving out solutions. Don't get me wrong, I do care but at the same time I'm too scared to get further involved.\n\nI guess the way I maximize human experience is by putting myself out there whenever I feel brave enough and go from there. If a stranger approaches me asking for directions, I help. If a classmate need help with hw and I'm free, I help. \n\nWith close friends, we have more intimate conversations like goals, political beliefs, etc. But all that feeling and vulnerability topic I try to keep them to myself. \n\nOne of my RAs said "if you can't cry in front of your friends, then you'll struggle with forming bonds" or somewhere along those lines.
2	I felt the same way for a long time, but now, I have embraced the lack of empathy aspect of my life and have become an enthusiastic spectator in most things. I don't miss having expressive emotions and all, most of the time I'm thankful I don't have them. My poker face is my strongest defense mechanism. I do love going out and watching people experience those things that I dont have though. 
2	> It feels like I'm watching people live their lives on a tv screen\n\nSame. It rarely feels like anything (outside of romantic relationship stuff) touches me. \n\n> How do you maximize the human experience\n\nBasically, fake it! Other humans don't appreciate empathy as much as they appreciate *empathetic behavior*. For example, validate people's feelings (usually by listening to them and then replying with "So you feel <insert a rewording of what they just told you>. Makes sense." etc.\n\nThe great thing about this is because as an ISTJ you're basically a robot that happens to be human, you can do this on autopilot.\n\nObviously there's far more to this than what I said, but one step at a time ;)
2	ENFP with ISTJ colleague	Hey Guys, already posted in mbti but my Post doesn't appear. Maybe you can Help me?\n\nSo, this colleague of Mine is usually not very complicated, which is something that I value highly.\n\nBut lately he is trying to tell me something and I really don't get it. I think (!) He wants to tell me that I annoy him in some way. When I approach him about it He says, I should Not worry, it is his Problem (after specifically mentioning, that something is "boiling" within him concerning me and him lashing out at me once because of it. He also mentioned that He didn't like himself doing that).\n\nWell I am greatly confused and ask him If we do have a conflict that needs resolving. He says no, we don't, but He will start practicing something on me.\n\nGuys, I am so confused. This is like the chinese sign room for me, the only thing I can do is stfu about it and I am very Bad at that leaving stuff unresolved. But I really know that to keep asking him now will make everything worse. 😂\n\nSo my Last straw is asking other ISTJs on here: wtf, guys? What's the problem? 😂
5	If I had to guess, I’d say that there *is* probably something about you he doesn’t like.\n\nHe seems to feel that saying it out loud would only make the work situation worse.\n\nHe probably thinks it’s something that you wouldn’t be able or willing to change even if he brought it up, and therefore bringing it up would only make things worse.  \n\nThat, or it’s something small that just annoys him more than it should for some reason and he’s realized that the way he feels about it is an overreaction.  He might think that he would not be being reasonable in bringing it up.\n\nIt would help to know what he “lashed out” at you for.\n\nThis is just a wild guess and there’s no reason to think this about you, but, when I worked with some ENFP’s in the past, I felt like they sometimes pushed off work on other people too much (often in the form of asking favors or for what I saw as unnecessary “help”). 
2	Put on your thickest skin, and then say this:\n\n"I'm pretty sure there is something about me that bothers you. I know you don't want to talk about it, but I want to try to fix it. Please tell me what it is so I know what I need to fix."\n\nHe either still won't tell you, or he will tell you very bluntly and hurt your feelings.
2	Look... Sometimes ppl are annoying as fuck, but it's not that your personally doing anything wrong, there's just something about you that wears on his nerves to no end. It may be the tone of your voice, something super benign like that... And that really isn't your problem. That is the problem of the person who is annoyed. We tend to be really fair minded about things and realize that if we're annoyed about something benign, we need to adjust our attitude rather than expecting you to stop doing something that's not harmful. Hell get over it soon enough. Just give him time.

7	Showing you that you are special to me	I am an infp(f), dating an istj(m). He recently told me that he doesn't see/believe that he is special to me because a lot of the things I do to show him I care, I do for other people, too, in terms of going out of my way to make them happy or hanging out with them. I want to adjust and focus more of my care and attention to him, but idk if that will be enough, and if there is anything more I can do or say to convince him that I do care about him and that I want to be with him. \n\nHe also says he can't believe I would still want to be with him even after the times he has hurt me, and I don't know how to convince him that I have completely forgiven him and that those things don't make me sad anymore because I believed his apologies. I told him these things, and more, but he is still unhappy, and I'm wondering if there is a way, whether that be words or actions, to prove to him that he is special to me and that I'm not going anywhere.
10	mmm unfortunately i dont think this is a personality type thing, its more about the individual and their love language! maybe make him take a love language test? otherwise simple ways i like to be shown affection is when my so takes interest in my life, shares things with me, tells me they love me, spends time with me, maybe some compliments
2	At the most simple level, if he does not want to be happy and is conflicted about his feelings, you can't do anything on your own to help him sort out his inner world directly. If you want him to sort these things out then the best thing you can do is be there for him as support and maybe let him figure it out while he talks to you (or give him space to figure it out on his own if he needs that). It's up to him to be there for himself, trying to rely on someone to feel whole usually doesn't go well.
2	I would say that this is a very internal (Si-Fi) thing. You have completely forgiven him, but he has not completely forgiven himself. Words of reassurance are effective to a point, but what he needs is time. 
2	the previous comment about love languages is certainly something to consider, and on that note, you might want to look at the apology languages as well. some people don't take apologies the same way as others. you might have forgiven him, but if he has a different apology language, then he could still feel guilty (and he might also be holding something against you, perceiving that you haven't "apologized" for it "properly" yet). but yeah, what the others said it also true; and this is an issue he will likely need to work through over time. therapy can be useful for that. 
2	Not sure if this is helpful or not, but I have this conversation with my INTJ husband of 12 years sometimes. He says he shows his love by doing nice things, and I think they are all either things he is responsible for doing or that he would do for anyone because he's a really nice guy. There's nothing that's just for me.\n\n\nI also don't understand why he's still with me. I mean, I'm grateful, but I don't get it. Maybe I will never understand. But I just accept that he is and try to work on being the person he deserves.
8	Jobs for ISTJ teens?	I'm thinking about getting a job this summer and am wondering what would be a good summer job for an ISTJ. Preferably something that doesn't put me in front of customers.
13	I worked at a library shelving books throughout some of high school and eventually at the checkout counter. I loved it!
6	I truly think interacting with people is a skill that needs to be trained and that customer service work can be a humbling but necessary experience for our growth. Now I'm not saying to be a cashier or anything like that - but make sure that you aren't forcing yourself to never grow by the jobs that you choose. For example - I work as a bus driver for my school and it's great. I provide a necessary service and it forces me to interact with people and serve the public - overall a very fulfilling job that has developed me as a person while also not being mentally exhausting (such as a store customer service job). Working these types of jobs also teach you to treat working staff with respect and dignity, which is invaluable 
5	I know you said that you don't want to work with customers, but keep in mind that being able to work with people you don't know or perhaps don't even like is a skill that can really set you apart in any career.  A temporary summer job may be the perfect opportunity to learn this while the stakes are low.
3	I worked at a bike repair/tour shop for a summer and ended up really liking working with my hands to make repairs or do routine maintenance. There was still a customer service element to it (which is pretty much unavoidable for entry level-type summer jobs) but it wasn't as much as something like retail or tutoring. 
3	I hated people until I got a retail job in a photolab. It was a good mix of working in the lab and talking to people. Ended up getting really good at showing old folks through their cameras.
2	So this depends on what you like and what you want out of a summer job - some of my favourite summer jobs involved straight manual labour, because it helped me stay in shape during the school year, but bricklaying isn't for everyone. \n\nIn terms of a job that's a good fit for an analytical personality type, I'm a big fan of tech support work, odds are there's a call centre in your area that's looking for people to answer tech questions. Having done that kind of work, I found that talking to people on the phone was a lot easier than in person, and it feels like solving puzzles. 
2	Working a summer camp for kids? I did it and loved it! 
1	just my two cents, but as a teen that wasn't the biggest fan of talking to new people, the best summer job I had was working a gas station;\n1) talking to customers can be tiring if on till 8 hours straight but it's damn good experience for faking conversation skills in real life.\n2) lots of routines and tasks that needed to be taken care of (stocking, cleaning, inventory etc. )\n3) customers (and often co-workers) can do dumb things and provide you with unlimited anecdotes for all your future social interactions.\n..Spent ~2 years working there, and possibly would have been longer if the old management wasn't replaced by really inexperienced owners.
1	If you want minimal customer interaction and a summer/temp position, try retail or night stocking at any large establishment. You typically work off hours, have days to yourself, get a little bump in pay (shift differential), and might not ever even see a customer only fellow coworkers. 
1	I used to work at my brother’s seafood restaurant. He hired the ISTJ girl that lives next door. Such an exceptional worker. As much as I don’t really click with ISTJs (I’m an INTP), they are terrific employees. If I ever own a business, ISTJs will be at the top of my list when searching for workers. Good luck with the job hunting!
1	I always followed my interests. \nWe owned a bookstore when I was growing up so I could learn about my interests by reading. \nIn my mid teen years I started a job as a photographer for a newspaper. Then as I neared 19 I worked as an admin assistant for a team of real estate agents. After that I worked in law enforcement. My point is follow your interests and you will find jobs/ways to make money doing what you enjoy.
2	"Offense to Truth"	
3	Why did you post this on ISTJ?
13	My boss thinks I'm not honest	My boss is an ENTJ. He thinks that I am trying to pull one over him all the time. For instance, I had a project that I had to work on that involved processing files. It was an urgent project. He asked for an estimate to get the project done and I said a week based on how much time it took me initially. Now, I've always learned to give myself a buffer--it stops me from overpromising and burning out too hard in case trouble arises. The number of files I had to process were in the hundreds as opposed to a handful that I usually get.\n\nI made the process extremely efficient ended up processing those files 2-3 days earlier than expected. I stayed late for 1.5 hours one night just to get some extra work in. When he asked for an update two days later, I mentioned that I finished it and he was surprised--not in a good way. I shrugged it off because I got the work done right?\n\nA week later we have a meeting and he points out this specific scenario as an example that "[you] don't know how to manage your time" and that "[you] don't know what [you're] doing if I'm giving timelines like this". And that he can't trust me on this project because I don't know how to organize myself because my timing appears to be extremely off? I'm paraphrasing.\n\nI don't get it. I got the work done earlier than expected so I can pass it off to someone else to start. What's the issue? Sure, I overestimated, just so I can provide a buffer. And yes, I powered through given the urgency of this project. And I didn't lie.\n\nShould I have just twiddled my thumbs and not doing anything for an extra 2-3 days? Should I just have lied about the progress of the project?
10	Overestimating by 16-24 hours is quite a bit, but you were honest.\n\nHas you boss tasked you with something similar in the past?
8	I was wondering why he only found out it was finished when he asked for a status update. Did you really only finish it a few minutes before he asked? \n\nI get not wanting to over promise and under deliver, but the over estimating the time it takes is an issue as well, especially if you work in a team environment and the manager is trying to balance workload. If it’s going significantly faster than you had anticipated, you can give your boss status updates to keep them in the loop. \n\nIt kind of reminds me of the time we had to go to a house to meet a dog they were fostering. My husband insisted we had to show up **30 minutes** early, because of what his mom drilled into his head as a child, to make a *good* impression as this was essentially the interview. \n\nGuess what? The wife who was responsible for fostering wasn’t home as they were still at soccer with their kid. The husband let us in, but really couldn’t answer any questions and didn’t feel comfortable showing the dog. So she got in at the agreed upon time but by that point it felt like we were overstaying our welcome, so we left 10 minutes after. Needless to say, we never got approved for the dog. \n\nBeing late is disrespectful, so showing up 5-10 minutes early is ok, but showing up too early shows a complete lack of awareness of what anyone else has going on too. 
3	Have you explained to him how you arrived at your estimate and why you were able to complete the work faster than the estimate?
3	If you overestimate by a couple of hours, it's no big deal. If you overestimate by several days, you should let your boss know the next day at the latest. I think it's better to overestimate on hours, but there's a limit; if it's your first project of this sort, it's natural that you could overestimate by a significant margin, but not letting your boss know that you've finished two or three days early feels almost deceitful. What was your rationale for not telling them?
3	Proactively communicate; Dont wait for him to ask for an update. \n\nGive him an update when there is an update because it can be seen like youre sitting on work that still needs to be done even though it doesnt... And that can seem like youre hiding it. I can see where his mistrust is coming from.\n\nInstead of him being upset by thinking he caught you in some sort of lie, communicate and let him be impressed with your progress
3	I'm a developer, I've both under and over estimated by months before.\n\nSometimes it just can't be helped.
2	Out of curiosity is your boss billing someone for your time? Like is this work part of a contract with billable hours or something like that?
2	I don't think you should have lied. I think it's unreasonable that you should have a perfect idea of a timeline. I do think that you should have gone to him as soon as you were done and let him know it was finished, and say "i found out a way to make it more efficient, so it took less time than I thought". That might be some of the disconnect - if you don't tell him when you were done and had waited another 3 days to let him know that you were done, he would think you're being dishonest because you were just trying to get out of doing any work for those 3 days, and clearly didn't understand the urgency of the project.
1	This isn’t a personality issue anymore then your boss just being an unreasonable and backwards asshole. 
1	They’re looking for fault.

3	Am I accurate in my understanding/description of ISTJ "predicting based on past experiences" here? How and how not?	Hi ISTJs. I just posted a comment in another sub [Tangent, actually some of you might be interested in checking that out too, it's new and called r/NoNonsenseMBTI and so far seems way more sane than r/mbti]. \n\nAnyway, as the title says, I'm curious to get your take on my accuracy (or not) of my understanding/description of ISTJ "predicting based on past experiences" in my description. \n\nPasting below some excerpts. The original comment, which includes the compare and contrast with my process as an INFJ is [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/NoNonsenseMBTI/comments/arykeo/weekly_discussion_thread_2182019/egqut2a/).\n\n------------------------------\n\n**Context**\n\n>My SO (ISTJ) and I (INFJ) are entering a phase of figuring out whether we should take a really significant step in our relationship. Typical for us, we're being cautious. Each in our own ways. She's ISTJ enneagram 9 (not sure the wing). I'm INFJ enneagram 6w5.\n\n>One thing that has come up for us both is that we each have our way trying to predict whether it is likely to be okay for us to do this... and in our discussion, the fundamental unreliability of 100% certain prediction of whether it will actually work out for us. Like, there is a point at which deciding based on our modes of prediction doesn't work. Nonetheless, we each have thing about prediction and our own ways of trying to do it.\n\n>We both require information, but of different kinds.\n\n-------------------------\n\n**My attempts at description of what it is for her, based on my understanding thus far:**\n\n>For her, prediction is built on a build-up of everyday experiences with me over time, which in turn is layered on what she has experienced in past relationships. For her, then, trying to predict if this step will be okay requires time for adding more everyday experience with me. I'm not sure if I'm describing it accurately here, doing the best I can though.\n\nand\n\n>So the upshot is - time is important to us both, but for different reasons. ... For her, the time itself is at the core - just having the ongoing lived experience of us together in the details of everyday life and checking internally if that sits well with her for a more serious commitment than we have right now.** \n\nand\n\n>I can't really imagine what it's like internally to try to make decisions in a predictive way based on an accumulation of everyday experience in the past and present. Because for me, the future is just its own part of a landscape and it is arranged however it is arranged - it doesn't naturally arrange itself in past-harnessed terms of what comes before it. There's not a straight line there, in my perception. For her, though, that lived experience is solid and the best way for her to try to predict what is mostly likely to happen. For me, there are links between points in time, but nothing that can reliably be used predictively from the accumulated details of everyday experience. But I see that for her, this is real and solid and important. \n\n\n--------------------\n\nIf you'd be willing to share: What do you think, how am I doing with understanding and describing this correctly? What am I missing or not seeing right? I welcome your thoughts and comments!
8	I don’t really want to say that I speak for all ISTJs, but I relate to her. I don’t really understand how you wouldn’t use past experiences to predict things. \n\nPeople have patterns. It’s easiest to know how to act if I recognize the patterns. The more time I spend with someone, the more I see their patterns. If it doesn’t hold with what I’ve seen previously, it does throw me off. That’s learning though. \n\nI would definitely say that the longer I’m around someone with no red flags, the more comfortable I am. 
2	Whoever that is isn't the 1st person to experience this issue. Many people can't seem to fathom pattern interpolation and extrapolation; it's like describing color to someone born blind.\n\nThat said, ISTJs and other extrapolators have to bear in mind that the future can't be predicted, and just because a situation is *likely* to turn out in a certain way doesn't mean it *will*. In other words, give things a chance.\n\nNow, obviously, there are some life changing events - such as having kids - from which there's no turning back. I've seen quite a few people who weren't cut out to be parents jump headlong into that, and they're just miserable.\n\nThere's no right answer here. You have to find the right balance between extrapolation and giving things a chance. One of the unsung things about relationships is how much negotiation they involve. It can take months or even *years* for a couple to finally be on the same page regarding something.\n\nOne thing I will say is that **BOTH partners must be totally onboard for major life steps**, otherwise you risk creating resentment that destroys the relationship over time. Do NOT proceed if there's any doubt by either partner (this is where the negotiation above comes in.)
1	Jet's MBTI - Cast Podcast	Hey Reddit, my name is jetplane48 (ESTP 7w8 sx/sp) and I am starting up a podcast in relation to MBTI. Fundamentally, the goal of the podcast is to educate the viewers of several Typology systems through a series of one-on-one's with others who are interested in the same topics. I have been conducting interviews for many years (MBTI related) and this is just an extension of that, however, I want to discuss topics that the audience wants me to cover. Naturally, I'll come up with my own material but I would love to explore topics that others have in mind. I am busy with school for the next few months but when I finish, the goal is to eventually be more consistent with these podcast uploads if this turns out to be popular enough. I'm very excited to get this started, and let's see some questions!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAR20eDTSOg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAR20eDTSOg)\n\n&#x200B;

17	I just want to say istj women aren’t hiding anywhere, we’re just living our lives unflustered by whatever it is you’re aiming for.

9	I’m a homebody. I found my partner through a dating app because I don’t like crowds and spend all my time at home when I’m not at school, work, or running errands. My out-of-the-house hobbies are hiking and choir, so maybe figure out a hobby you want to share with someone and look there? There’s no like one place ISTJs hang out, it depends on their unique personality.
6	ISTJ here. I regularly go out on the weekends... dinners with friends, bars, sometimes clubs.\n\n
3	My hobbies are martial arts and pottery. I see a lot of variety of people in these classes even though the activity itself is mostly solitary. 
3	Pretty much any place where ISTJs need to be, where it involves our hobbies, and maybe hanging out with friends. Work & home are definites.
2	Movies, museums, the zoo, the arboretum
1	I go to the bar, usually alone, and enjoy watching the madness that is everyone else and make snide ass remarks while drinking my beer. I'm also found on dating apps. If you don't get filtered out as creepy or undesirable I'll invite you to the bar with me... But if your super clingy and stuff it won't happen twice. 
1	Here's how to find an ISTJ or ISTJ-like lady:\n\nLook for a woman with a senatorial, hawk-like, or aquiline presence. She'll be standing straight upright, smiling politely (if at all) and apparently detached from what's happening around her. As in, she's fully aware of what's happening, but she's somehow above it all. \n\nApproach her directly. Do not try to hide your interest; ISTJs don't have time for coyness and she'll already have made her mind up about whether to give you a chance within the 1st 30 seconds anyway.\n\nNow to actually talk to her. Do NOT use a pickup line. From your observation of her, there might be something she considers important. If she's wearing a t-shirt with a logo, ask about it ("Is that a CrossFit t-shirt?" "Dell, huh? I didn't realize they're in town, what do they do here?") Keep the conversation about something concrete, but the tone positive and energetic. The point here is to have a stimulating conversation about something of consequence to *her*.\n\nInject parallel details about yourself ("I went to a conference like that too!") etc. At the very least this should get you her number/contact details over the course of 15 min or so.\n\nAll the best!
0	Church . Istj females are big with religion. 
1	What do guys think of Enfp's?	Especially the male ones? 
7	Annoying, to be honest.
3	Have a lot of close ENFPs in my life - my brother, a good friend, and now my SO. Tbh I've never been annoyed by a person's ENFP-ness until my SO. Just because I'm an ISTJ doesn't mean I don't need some air time! And God I wish his friends weren't so important to him. My friends are important to me too, but between us it's like a me versus his friends thing which hurts tbh.
2	Fun and exhausting. 
2	One of my best friends is an ENFP, whom I\`ve known for 3 and a half years. Even though I think of him as unstructured and messy, I\`ve learned to appreaciate our differences. He likes to say a lot of things out of nowhere and tell me what he\`s doing, which I don\`t really know why he\`s telling me all of those things. There are way more examples of how we act different from each other but I am very glad to know him and ENFPs can make for great friends for ISTJs if their natural differences are acknowledged and respected.  
2	I don't think of enfp's
3	I thought male ENFPs were a myth. Like female Dwarves or male Elves...\n\nSeriously, though, my older sister is probably an ENFP, but my only certain exposure to ENFPs has been from trolling y'all's sub.\n\nY'all seem to be very high strung, but y'all wouldn't be too bad if/when you settle down a bit.
1	That answer was to be expected 
7	ENFP here, how to approach an ISTJ?	I recently met an ISTJ, we hit it off really well, I have never met someone so structured in my life, it really piqued my curiosity and things started to speed up in our romantic relationship. But out of the blue, He’s told me that he can’t keep up, so we’ve had a break with no contact this last week. It was honestly really hard for me, but I knew that he needed the space to recuperate. I waited patiently for him to contact me when he’s ready and he did so today and we’re meeting tomorrow.\n\nShould I listen to my gut and stop seeing him, if my ENFP energy is too much for him? Or should I keep exploring the possibility. As complete opposite people, are we too different to make a romantic relationship work? How do ISTJ approach the decisions to become exclusive? Because from what I’ve observed it does not seem to be driven by his feelings.\n\nEdit: we had a really good talk about where we’d like to go from here, and we’ve both agreed we are very different and it would take a lot of work romantically. Oddly enough, we both enjoy each other’s company and have now blossomed our relationship into a savage, brutally honest friendship that I am loving way more than when there was romantic pressure to be super considerate of each other. I feel liberated to express freely without holding back and he feels no pressure to react to my every thought because I don’t put that pressure on my friends. Thank you for all the great insight into this personality! I would say my curiosity for the ISTJ is still not quenched, you guys have so many qualities I admire! I will definitely tone it down if another ISTJ comes into the romantic ring.
17	I'm not going to say whether you should stop seeing him, but maybe I'll give a bit of insight as an ISTJ that'll help you figure it out yourself. \n\nWhen I hang out with an ENFP friend I generally need to "prepare" myself. I'm not saying this is a bad thing, but ENFPs can easily be too much for ISTJs. Rather than one significantly changing to accommodate the other, I think the best approach is for the two to meet somewhere in the middle. As the ENFP this'll mean taking things slower than you might normally like, not spending as much time together as you'd like, etc.. \n\nThis may be hard for you, but I'd like to remind you of a few things in preparation for if you do go ahead with this relationship: \n\nISTJs like to take a bit of time to think things through, especially for the bigger decisions in life. Right now I'm in the process of choosing a new phone to buy - I've already spent 3 days researching, and I'm not even done yet. Relationship decisions would take even longer...\n\nSometimes he'll need space. This could mean lots of things, but most of the time he'll want alone time - not that he doesn't want to spend time with you - time with himself and for himself. \n\nWith regards to how an ISTJ might make that decision, it is partly driven by feelings but not exclusively. There are practical implications to any relationship and if I think that our lifestyles/dreams/preferences are different enough then that may be enough grounds for me to reject that relationship. But you've probably thought about that already. 
7	At least for me (fellow ISTJ) I decide to continue to relationship based on how things have gone. Is the person good for as in do they add more than they take from my life? What was/is my initial feelings about them? If I had any moment of “I like them I’m keeping them around” then I decide that I’m in it, I’m not bailing.\n\nEnfp’s ARE too much for istjs lol but one of my most rewarding relationships (although platonic) was with an enfp, changed my life for the better.\n\nAllowed me to view things in a different way at times, allowed me to experience what it was like when you’re a bit chaotic. Made me appreciate differences as well as the way I was. Bc I could not handle being an enfp that’s for sure.\n\nCommunication is important especially bc the thought process used differs and things may be interpreted differently from time to time.\n\nIstj’s are slow, we don’t move as fast as you, we need to THINK a lot before feeling mildly comfortable with something. And we also don’t express or communicate as much as we should and as much as you.\n\nIf you can work with those qualities then go for it! Good luck op
3	Id never advise an ENFP to *not* trust their gut, but I should ask: what are you looking for in a relationship? \n\nQuite a few of my friends and relitives are ISTJ/ENFP couples and the match works out amazingly... But an ISTJ isnt someone an ENFP has a super fun fling with; An ENFP settles down with an ISTJ. If youre still young, you may not be ready for an ISTJ relationship\n\nFor his part, you just need to give him time to process things *internally*... He needs to feel his feelinings, think through them, and come to a conclusion about how he feels/thinks - and he needs time to process all that without distraction
3	The brutal honesty approach may actually be a boon when dealing with ISTJs. Knowing where you stand on matters makes our job of calculating the situation easier. Just remember if you get romantic with one, it's serious business from our side of things. I'm sure hanging out with your friend will make it more apparent after some time.
2	I've had several ENFP friends and even though we hit it off, it doesn't really make for a lasting friendship in my experience. We are simply too different. I don't think opposites attract. You guys really are too much, even though you're great optimistic people, but just as a duo? Seems sketchy. What seem as charming traits at first will get annoying in the long run, and finding you have to suppress yourself is going to turn into resentment. With all that being said, I do think you should go give it a try because not everyone follows mbti stereotypes and there are multiple personality aspects that you two may be compatible with, and it's still possible you share things in common. 
2	For me, when approaching a relationship, I tend to place myself just outside the boundaries of relationship status for as long as I can. I watch all the dynamics between us and stuff. Examine all the feelings, yours and mine. And, really, if I'm satisfied with the quasi relationship status (we're together but not bf/gf) I'll stay there indefinitely. I'll be ok with a status change if it's necessary, but I'm in no hurry to do it. And if I do, ima need a damn good reason to do so. Your gonna have to be Hella special to me to commit to changing my routine and including you in my life everyday. 
2	/u/swaylyn, /u/thekashdaddy, /u/AttackYuuki, /u/amplifiedrain:\n\nI'm not OP nor am I ENFP. But I am quite interested in hearing more about the ISTJ internal process of experience over time as related to decisions about relationship seriousness. My ISTJ SO openly talks with me about this but we're in a pretty intensive phase right now and we have so SO many other things to discuss as well, and I feel like more information from other ISTJs could also help me really grasp what it is internally as info-processing.\n\nI don't want to hijack this thread, and I don't know if it would be annoying for me to put up a separate discussion on r/istj (I mean, all these non-ISTJs asking for the ISTJ perspective here has got to get wearing, yeah? or if PM discussions would be better or what. But I would love to do some brain-picking of anyone who'd be willing to allow that. Would PM or a separate thread work for any of you?\n\nalso, /u/sicamngo, how would you feel about me having a discussion about this in your thread given that it might be of thread-hijacking nature given your initial intent?
12	How to actually get out and meet people as an ISTJ.	I (20 M) want to get out and meet people. More specifically girls. Right now I basically come home from work and do stuff on the internet until I go to bed. Then I wake up, go to the gym, go to work repeat. \n\nOnly time I really go out is when I go grocery shopping. It's not that I'm afraid of people or anything. I just have no interest in doing anything else. I literally cannot think of a single hobby I would be interested in that involves others.\n\nThe only way I can think of meeting girls is by talking to store employees. But, I know this would be seen as annoying after awhile, and they are just trying to do there jobs. There are no girls where I work, so that's off the table. Online dating has yielded a few matches but no dates as of yet. Meeting girls through friends hasn't worked out too well either, as those girls don't really seem interested.\n\nI understand that to meet girls means I must meet people. If I go out to just meet girls, that will get me no results. However my motivation to meet more people is to meet girls. Kind of a catch 22. I heard about volunteering, but I'm not really passionate about a cause, and if I join a group to meet girls, and there are no girls, then it is waste and not something I can commit to.\n\nI work full time (in a career, not just a job.) I'm not in school. I've been told that I'm a 7/10. On a bad day maybe a 6. My work takes up most of my time, and a lot of my experiences are from my job. Aside from doing stuff on the internet I have no real hobbies. Last girlfriend I had was when we were both in middle school.\n\nI was hoping some of you could give me suggestions to meet people, mainly girls, that I may have missed. Something which fits with being an ISTJ.
10	Im on 4 different dating sites. Now, tbh, I'm definitely not an average dating sort of person, but I know how to meet ppl on the dating sites.\n\n 1. Don't try to meet everyone you talk to. You gotta spend some time weeding out the crazies and undesirables. \n\n2. Don't get discouraged if someone stops talking to you. They aren't required to like you anymore than your required to like them.\n\n3. If you do get to the meeting point, don't go in looking for a relationship. Go in looking for a person, a friend, an acquaintance, etc. That's a lot of pressure to meet someone who's sizing you up for wife material. Nor should you accept that from someone else.\n\n4. Don't stop looking just because you start talking to one person. She might not pan out, and that's OK... No reason to start your search from scratch.\n\nOnline dating is great for us. Most conversations are over text. You can talk as much as you want. If they're too chatty and annoying... Block they're ass and never deal with them again. 
9	For some reason, as ISTJs we consider ourselves boring and uninteresting and common, when really we have extremely active inner worlds and our takents only seem ordinary because they are so common to *us* personally. You are more awesome than you think.\n\nWhat are you passionate about? What could you talk for hours about? What are you an expert in? What do you value? ...these are important to know because not only you will want them in a partner, but its a great way to figure out how to find people like you.\n\nIs fitness important to you? Sign up for a class. Nature lover? Join a bird watching community. Avid reader? Bookclub! The next Gordon Ramsey? Take a cooking class. Need to find god? Join a church. Are politics a passion? Is hiking your thing? Join a hiking club. Find your county's local political group. The more you go out the more ppl you see - so go out with your friends as much as possible too.\n\nAlso, remember to be present in everything you do... The ppl you share your daily schedule with share your routine because they have it in common with you. Include them. Be aware of who else goes to the gym with you, who else is at the coffee shop in the morning with you, etc.
4	Have you considered volunteering?  It can provided a way to meet new people with some structure. Your reason for being there will be the volunteering, and you might happen to meet some women.
2	turn 21 and then join your local kickball league
2	You've gotten some really good ideas already, but I'll just interject to say that even if you are working full-time in a "career", you still definitely have to put the time into the dating (or meeting people generally) scene to get any results. It's simple math; input and output. Finding the time is mostly a matter of time management. You say you go home after work and just hang out on the Internet until bed, which is pretty antithetical to meeting anybody.\n\nAre you into board games? In my experience, ISTJs tend to quite like them, and board game meet-ups tend to be pretty easy to attend, *plus* you get to meet a lot of fellow introverts and nerds. I'd suggest maybe committing two hours per night to a board game group. Honestly, it might be good as a form of networking as well, if your career happens to have a social aspect. Therefore, even if you don't meet girls, you at least get to have some fun and meet some potential professional contacts.
1	Make time to go out and be social. \n\nAs a hard core ISTJ, esp the introvert, who works from home, I can go a week without leaving my house. So I know what’s it’s like. \n\nOnline dating is great, but the social skills I lacked, messed up most of them. \n\nI read THE GAME, realized I could learn this stuff and would go out and practice. I would talk to 20 hot chicks a week for starters. \n\nI got so good at talking to women, then coaching other guys how, I actually moved to LA to work for Neil Strauss. \n\nStarted my own company teaching 9 years ago. \n\nI picked an opener and went out and practiced. I then started figuring out how to get the convo to flow in a cool way, to cool stuff, without coming across like bragging. Then, how to smoothly get a phone number. \n\nStill an ISTJ, still love my alone time, but never alone for more than a few days...if I don’t want to be. Pretty awesome. ;)
1	People aren't gonna show up at your door, so something's gotta give. It sounds like you have to figure out what you're about. Everyone's passionate about something, and if you haven't found that something yet, then you need to work on finding it. Once you figure that out, you'll be able to balance it with the necessary work (yes, *work*) of finding/meeting women. Also, your passion will come across in your interactions, and they'll see you as interesting.\n\nThe biggest mistake many men make is thinking that having a job and stability is enough and forgetting to be interesting as well. Don't do that. 
-5	Join a church, Volunteer, Travel.\n\nDo not go clubbing, Waste of time. \n\nSkip the whole bar scene. It is also a waste of time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a few ISTJ mates. All with similar troubles.\n\nJoin a vegan circle, Put up with the smell for a bit. Get in with a vegan girl then slowly bring her out of the fold.\n\nYou are not only doing gods work by saving the vegan but you are also dating. 2 birds 1 stone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut in all seriousness. Just join any community group with a majority of female members. Get cosy and take your pick. Watch out for the other seedy guys doing the same. Hahaha.
8	My child is maddening	I have 4 kids. My younger two boys (13yo and 10yo) are true extroverts. The 13 yo has a bunch of friends that he chats with and games with and does all his extroverted stuff with. My 10yo, however, doesn't have this network of friends yet. This child is the chattiest thing on 2 legs. He's all about the blah blah blah. Small talk is his friend and there isn't a though that has formulated between his ears that hadn't come out his mouth. My other 3 kids, know that when I come home from work, I need about 18 minutes to decompress and get right with the world. My 10yo is completely oblivious to this. I've tried to explain it to him but I think theres so much going from brai. To mouth that nothing goes from ears to brain.\n\nDoes anyone else have a child that they struggle to be kind to because they got way too much to say? And how does one handle this, because I have 8 more years to listen to his blah blah blah and I'm not sure I can do it. 
6	When I got to the “he’s all about the blah blah blah” lmao this post was an interesting read\n\nI don’t have kids but wow you only need 18minutes to get right with the world? THAT is impressive.\n\nCan you bribe the 10yo? Or the 13yo to keep him busy?
3	Every parent feels this way about their kids from time to time. It's ok to vent, but 1) you need to listen receptively so they will continue talking to you through their teen years, and 2) there will come a day when they will be grown and gone and the silence will be deafening. It's hard to imagine that day now, but it will come. Give your chatterbox a hug and then give him some chewing gum. 
3	You sound like a complete and utter entitled child. You being an ISTJ does not magically make you incapable of being compassionate towards your child. If you struggle to be kind to your child, you have issues. Plain and simple. This is your child. If you are the only one he talks to, then you need to help him branch out. As his parent it’s your responsibility to help him, not complain about how he makes it difficult for you to be kind to him. Abhorrent. Absolutely abhorrent. Shame on you. Shame shame shame. 
1	Sounds to me like he doesn't have anyone to talk to. You're the only person who he feels comfortable with talking to. I used to be like this and It drove the few friends I had away. Turns out when you only have one person to dump all of your problems and other interesting things on, they get overwhelmed. In contrast, when you have a group of friends, you can parse out your socialization among them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not sure how you could help him find some more friends, but it sounds like that is what he needs.
1	I assume you’re an ISTJ yourself?\nThat is so cute and funny to be honest, although I feel your pain. Mind if I ask if the father is a big chatter too? I’ve always wondered if personalities are genetics or completely random.\n\nI don’t have kids myself so it’s hard to give advice. I’m sure there are some parenting subs on reddit who could give practical advice. Maybe find him some sorts of social circle like sports or something ?
1	> I need about 18 minutes to decompress and get right with the world.\n\nStay in your car. Go for a walk. Take those 18 minutes before you walk in the door. \n\nI suspect that’s why rush hour traffic is so bad in the afternoons compared to the mornings where I live. Parents who are expected home but want to delay it so they do 10-20 under the speed limit to increase that blissful “me” time in the vehicle. 
1	This possibility of being stuck 24/7/52 with something that won't shut up for 18 years straight is why I don't have kids.
16	How ISTJs deal with suffering	I noticed that I can easily ignore people that caused me suffering or simply act like the problem never existed. So, if someone is bothering me or making me suffer in some unnecessary way (when I can choose not to deal with it), I am able to simply block the person in my life and/or act as if nothing had happened. Sometimes I keep talking to the person normally and they have no clue I'm pissed or annoyed with them in any way.\n\nIs it an ISTJ thing? Do you identify with that?
15	Yes, but only once I've become convinced that the other person can't or won't change their behavior.  At that point I simply detach myself emotionally even if outwardly I'm still polite.
16	Pretty much.\n\nYou identify the source of you misfortune and you eradicate it with efficiency and finesse.\n\nRemoving emotional cues is part of your personality. Some more observant people can pick up on it, but the vast majority will never notice.\n\nISTJ to a tee.
6	I have definitely done this in the past.\n\nThis may be TMI, but my father, as a "way to protect me", didn't tell me that one of my really close relatives was passing away soon. She was someone that I cherished deeply, but he kept this as a secret from me because he and she were on pretty bad terms for several years even though I had nothing to do with their "bad blood". When I finally learned that she passed, I was so upset to the point that I sobbed for hours, something I normally do not do. But somehow I just got over it. We've never talked about it to this day - I just simply pretend it didn't happen and live about my life. But this is certainly something I'll never forget about him.\n\nIn other situations where people cause me pain and unhappiness, I simply cut them off. There was a guy I was talking to for a while, but he was manipulative and messed with my feelings. He also did some contradictory things that screamed "stupid and immature" to me. At one point we had an awful falling out that I eventually forgave him for. But he kept doing the same, stupid things that I simply didn't want to deal with it anymore. So I blocked him on all social media and that was that.
6	I dont maintain relationships with toxic ppl. I don't allow them to hold me hostage with their negativity, I just turn my back on them and they never hear from me again and I'm om with that. This includes my brother, most of my cousins, all of my aunts. Family, friend, doesn't matter. I have a pretty large neutral territory in my evaluation of ppl, so if someone treats me in such a way long enough that they reach a "toxic" label, they're out. However, ppl have shitty days or go through rough patches and if they say or do something uncharacteristically shitty on Thursday but Friday they're ok. Im not gonna dwell on Thursday because I have shitty days too. 
4	Like the flip of a switch. Especially if I feel like it’s intentional, I have no problem moving on easily. I am very forgiving of misunderstandings or accidents though.\n
3	Awww man why lol I’m an ISTJ and I only communicate and speak up if it’s something that needs to be nipped in the bud. Setting boundaries to prevent further trouble. (This is the only progress I’ve been able to make in the whole conflict suffering area of my life)\n\nBut when it comes to constant people in my life I normally stay quiet assuming I’ll get over it, it’s not worth making an issue over, etc. I just don’t think about whatever it is that upset me until it’s forgotten.\n\nMy friend says I wait until things pile up before getting mad and then it seems like it’s random to others but it’s not to me because it’s a collection of things that I finally decided to stop ignoring. \n\nI’m not afraid to cut someone out of my life if I view them as bad for me. Or to avoid being in their presence \n\n
2	[deleted]
2	ISTJ thing. I’ve been know to do the same. 
2	Depends on the suffering; if it's from someone else's action [or lack of] I either be confrontational and let them know what's wrong or I simply cut it off my mind once I relax and breathe.\n\nIf it's more internal (feelings, bad memories, etc.) it's a lot harder to get over and it takes time. I'd just cry out my feelings when possible and in complete solitude and move on.
2	Yeah, it's a very very very ISTJ thing. Very. And as an ENTJ who is very direct and cold, even I am baffled at how direct and minimal you all are while talking.
2	I remove problematic people from my life with the force and ease of flicking a crumb off a table. There are others I keep at arm's length because they have issues I don't want to contaminate my personal life/home front with.\n\nI've found other people seem to have tremendous difficulty with doing the same. I don't.
1	Nailed it. I identify with that very closely.
1	Jupp I've done it
6	Ideal jobs for ISTJ?	I currently work in medicine in the US- I love what I do, but the constant harassment from higher ups about making more money, cramming more patients into a workday, etc. have made me really start hating my field. I know it's not confined to just my workplace because I am a part of a larger community relating to my occupation and it seems that it's the same everywhere in the US. I'm considering going back to school and starting fresh. Does anyone have job recommendations that suit ISTJ personalities? If you're an ISTJ that loves your job, what do you do and what makes you enjoy it?
7	I work in registration at an emergency room and I fucking love it. However, I enjoyed it so much more when I was at a smaller rural hospital, not because it was slower paced and whatever, but because it wasn't a top heavy, over corporate, beurocratic nightmare that the busy inner city hospital was. Also, I had more responsibilities so it always stayed interesting. I wasn't just a registrar, I was also the HUC, security, and operator. I also worked nights because i am a night person and I knew that I didn't mesh well with the day shift leadership. I don't need to be told how to do my job. I do it every fucking day. I do a damn good job at it. Take your ass back in your office and get off my back. Idk what else you can do... This is the only field I've ever thrived in. 
6	I'm the HR representative for benefits, leaves of absence and FMLA. I also do all of the HR data entry and reporting. Most days I love my job.\n\nI have to give a 25 minute benefit presentation to new employees which caused me a lot of anxiety at first but I know my material so I can handle it now.\n\nHandling leaves of absence and FMLA has given me more compassion for human suffering, instead of being a robot with no feelings so I think it has helped me grow as a person. I also have policies and laws to follow so that satisfies my need to follow the rules. \n\nThe reporting might be my favorite part. I enjoy compiling and manipulating the data. I'm a total spreadsheet nerd.
4	Any type of job where you are assigned a task and can just run with it. No need for a supervisor to watch over you because you will do the job better than most (unless it requires pure creativity...then you are screwed). Things that are task driven really. \n\nI am in IT, an Engineer now but really I have an Ops/admin mindset of 'how things should be.' I sometimes struggle with pure creative thinking so I force myself to play devil's advocate on any decision and constantly ask INTPs (which are prevalent in Engineering roles) for their opinions. 
5	I work in public accounting as an auditor. \n\nI really enjoy it because of the structure and attention to detail it involves everyday. I get to interact with people just enough to where it  doesn’t totally exhaust me. \n\nOverall it’s a steady, organized, and dependable job that really showcases certain strengths of an ISTJ.
2	I currently work as a data analyst for a large HR company. I work in a niche department so my workload is predictable and manageable (most days) so I can efficiently plan my days/weeks to maximize the amount of output I can produce. I am in school for a totally different profession though, looking to work in a medical examiner's office. Healthcare, government, and military roles seem to fit well with the ISTJ personality. It just depends on what interests you in those areas. 
2	Before I left to stay home with my kids I also worked in HR like many have posted, but I managed the culture and communications department, so we did all of the things that make employees feel engaged and informed. It was the perfect balance of HR structure but opportunities for creativity and positive interaction with others. For most of my life I’ve known I wanted to plan parties, not attend them, so this worked out perfectly for me. 
1	In my experience, I've met quite a few ISTJ field engineers who are very happy with their jobs.
1	I’m a manager for a multi billion dollar company. Enjoy the thrill of it but I’m very insensitive towards my subordinates. Which makes the job a lot harder but it’s mainly numbers and people. Studying to be an engineer.
1	I am a scientist (sort of. I just finished grad school and don't have a job yet). I get enough interaction in lab and meetings that I don't feel like a loner but I still spend slot of time with my own thoughts when writing/doing stats. I love it although I frustrate myself sometimes with second guessing and procrastination and I don't ask for help half as much as I should. 
1	ISTJ ex	Hello, \nI haven't seen or contacted my ex ISTJ for a month and a half, because I needed to distance myself after I knew he was back in a relationship. Before we were together, we were friends, if it helps understanding... \nI would have liked to know if the ISTJs were returning to their ex spontaneously or if they were waiting for the person across the street to make the first move. \nI have no idea if this moment of pause and silence, for both of us, can end and return to a healthy foundation or if it is better not to even try. Thank you for your advice\n\n
12	I was married to an ISTJ for almost 20 years. From my experience, they’re highly pragmatic and if they don’t need to talk to you anymore, they won’t. Think: Ron Swanson. 
6	Your post is a little confusing. You broke up and now he’s back in a relationship with someone else? Or you’re just hoping to win him back? \n\nWith my experience with ISTJ’s, once they have closed a door, they are not very willing to open it back up. They will take the time to move on without looking back. I broke up with my ISTJ bf a few years ago on a whim (I was mad at a situation and highly emotional and overreacted). I came back three days later, and we talked. It was very difficult as I already felt that he had moved on. It took time for him to decide he was willing to try again and time to rebuild trust that I wouldn’t just walk away again. I know for sure that if I had waited any longer, he wouldn’t have taken me back because he would have gone through the healing process and closed the door on our relationship. 
4	The ISTJ thing is irrelevant here. He's in a new relationship. It's over. Accept that and move on.
2	ISTJ have a fairly easy time moving on. Once we have moved on and found a new shiny person to connect with, we can reestablish a friendship but there will be extremely strict boundaries that will not be crossed or you will be cut out without a second thought. Those boundaries WILL make you uncomfortable and we're ok with that. 
7	Does anyone here work in a career that's not primarily a desk job? What is it?	I've been poring over lists of careers that are supposed to be a good fit for an ISTJ. However, careers like accounting or financial analysis (typical office desk jobs) sound boring to me.\n\nIf you work in a job that doesn't focus on "flying a desk", would you mind sharing what it is? I'm not saying it has to involve no sitting at a desk, but does minimize it.\n\nThanks!\n\nEDIT: I appreciate all the responses, they are very interesting and I'm reading them all. Keep 'em coming!
11	Air Traffic Controller
6	I do stage props for a regional theater
7	Prop coordinator for a theatre, lots of walking around with weapons and bossing people around and yelling at them. But getting to figure out the logistics is fun and it’s a good mix of interacting with people and getting to do things however I want as long as it gets done. I also enjoy getting to organize everything however I want. 
5	I know ISTJs who are foremen on construction sites.  There's still alot of desk work, but alot of outside work, too.  
5	Landscape architect.\nDesk job with some variety and site visits thrown in the mix :) 
4	Environmental management, OSHA workplace safety, and careers in that vein. There’s always something to be done, especially if you manage multiple sites. Lots of travel if you have a BS or MS. 
5	I’m a language professor whose teaching persona is very extroverted, which means I need extra alone time to recover after class. 
3	I started my career as a medical technologist.  We are the people who test your blood samples in a medical lab when a doctor orders blood work.  I now am the manager of the lab so I do a fair amount of desk work but I still test specimens.  I also started a small farm that I work on as my personal project https://www.facebook.com/sunnypatchfarmct/
3	Massage Therapist.
3	(Training to be a) Field service technician for a line of electrical industrial equipment. However, I hope to move to a position in electrical utilities within the next 5 or so years.
3	My ISTJ ex husband is in the military, he works on helicopters and can’t stand the desk-jockey life. 
3	Band Director. Having to be extroverted for work can be exhausting, but I only find that for performances. Day to day for my students I don't feel like I have to be someone I'm not, and because I love my subject it's not hard to share enthusiasm about it. :)
3	Project manager. Mostly desk work but lots of human interaction, political maneuvering in the company, facilitating small and large meetings and relationships, networking and schmoozing. I actually have started loving that social aspect to my work and can get a lot of adrenaline from it but I still always need downtime after a few days straight of it.  
2	I'm a screen printer at a family business... pursuing medical school though.
2	My husband is an ISTJ and he works as an analytical chemist - he likes it because he’s up in the lab a lot and able to solve problems while still being pretty analytically thinking in his  work. 
2	Gas company service technician here and also possess a plumbing license. Desk jobs are absolutely NOT for me at all. I am extremely computer savvy and have built a few in the past. But I am blue collar through and through.
2	I'm studying to be a psychologist. Even though I'm not completely sure if I'd be a good therapist, studying people and behaviors really interest me.
2	I run an Engineering testing lab. My technical staff are busy doing a variety of tasks with products, fixtures, data acquisition, control systems.  There's some desk work, but not a lot.  It's indoor work, technical, detailed, and fulfilling.  As an ISTJ it is quite satisfying!
2	I'm a chemist
2	I fix saxophones. It's hard to describe why this is a perfect fit for me and probably other ISTJ. 
2	I teach. It's draining .
2	Marine Canvas fabricator. I make stuff for boats.
2	Nursing. And we’re few and far befween in this sea of Isfjs
2	I'm a nurse. It's actually much more enjoyable than I thought. But that could be because I work at night, so a lot of the time I don't have to talk a whole lot after the first few hours. Currently on a cardiac/med surg floor, but hoping to move to an ICU where the patients are usually unconscious and sedated.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this job if you just can't stand conversation. There are times when I'm stuck talking to a patient/family for an hour or more (this is rare of course since it's night shift. I imagine it happens more during days), and yeah it's pretty exhausting, but I like it overall.\n\nWhen I first got to college I was split between this and engineering, glad I chose this path as there are plenty of avenues to go down with a BSN. If I ever get to where I can't stand talking to patients, I can go to nursing informatics for instance. 
2	Sign language interpreter. Working freelance on a job-by-job basis usually gives me plenty of time to recuperate in my car between appointments.
2	I am a registrar at an urgent care clinic. I love my job. Don't necessarily love my patients every day. Before this job I was a registrar in the emergency room and I loved every bit of that job and plan on going back in the not so distant future. Every day was different, but I was doing the same thing for every patient. So there was the predictability of the registration process but you never knew what was going to come through that door next, a runny nose or a gunshot wound. I live for organizing chaos
1	My ISTJ SO is an economist who made his money with (legal) sports betting. \n\nMy ISTJ ex-bf was an ironworker who had previously been a helicopter mechanic. 
1	I'm a teacher. Yes, that involves a lot of "peopling". But, thank goodness, I'm in a portable, so during my lunch and planning periods I can shut my door and play my music, sing along if I like, or listen to the quiet. I think the ISTJ thing helps me with the "peopling" because it gives me some detachment, which is necessary for dealing with kids. I could not sit at a desk all day, and I don't. I'm up and down and do a lot of walking. My typical day, per my iWatch, is 12 hours of standing and 2.5 miles of walking. I have great organizational skills, and I am able to weed out details that would just bog me down. 
1	Currently in college as a finance major but as soon as I gradate I will start my path to become am commercial pilot.  
1	Machinist, Forktruck driver, and soon a trucker.\n\nMost sources that point you in the direction of a "job that fits your personality" ignore blue collar, skilled trades or smaller name jobs. I think ISTJs can do well in factory work because it requires precision and everything to be within specifications. Driving can also be a nice fit as it keeps you from being dragged into social situations throughout the day.
4	Opinions on Conservatism/Right-Wing Politics	I've seen a hypothesis that SJs, more than any other type, is prone to take conservative/right-wing views in various degrees of intensity more than any other political world view, and I want to test it out in the real world of ISTJs (i.e. all of you). What do all of you think about the usefulness/validity/desirability of any of the varieties of conservative thought out there? 
19	Interesting thought.  ISTJ here, I like to think that I don't take sides and look at everything at an unbiased view but many of my positions tend to fall conservative / right leaning.  Would be interested to see some formal study of Myers Briggs vs political leanings
16	The stereotype of ISTJ's being conservatives or "traditionalists" does actually apply to me. I get the sense that this kind of thought is losing desirability in society. Not much I can do about it though; I really don't like imposing my ideas/beliefs/opinions on others. 
14	I believe people as a whole could be much more responsible, does that make me right wing?  I think life is very manageable if you make the right decisions and make plans.
22	Fiscally conservative, socially liberal. \n\nI don’t care what you do in your private life as long as your actions don’t negatively impact or infringe on the rights of others, and that you don’t feel entitled to have people pay your way. 
6	Another libertarian. 
7	I think you'll get somewhat skewed answers asking here on Reddit.\n\nGenerally, I think ISTJs tend to have the same political affiliations as their immediate community. I do think there is a tendency for small-c conservatism, as ISTJs tend to be tradition-oriented realists who like to see empirical evidence for proposed policies. Anecdotally, I've noticed you guys tend to favour scientists being in charge, rather than businesspeople, lawyers, or career politicians.
17	I generally agree with the conservative side of things now. I'm more of a libertarian. Not in an Anarcho-Capitalist fashion, but I believe the government should be SEVERELY limited. \n\nAt 18, I was pretty progressive, but I believe that's because of the teaching that they do in university. Finding out how the vast majority of our professors were progressive and even outted Marxists kinda pushed me off of it. Now that I'm out of school, I can learn about things from a more neutral point of view. \n\nI definitely don't agree with Conservatives on everything, such as drugs or being pro-life. I believe that drugs should be decriminalized/legalized. I also believe abortions, at least in the first trimester, are much preferred to bringing another child into the world that is likely unplanned for etc. I also disagree with Conservatives on the Military as a whole. I believe we should only have a Military big enough to defend us from attacks. We should pull out of every other country. I also don't agree with the increased survellience they insist is to "prevent terrorism." It has largely been a wash, while reducing our privacy. \n\nOn the flipside, I disagree with some Progressive policies. I believe that guns should be completely legalized. I don't agree with most Progessive's idea of immigration. There are quite a few countries that have a stricter immigration policy and no one seems to mention that. They are pretty successful compared to what's happened to countries that had fairly open borders recently IMO. Another thing I disagree on is healthcare. The ACA was a negative thing for many, including myself. I'm not saying what the Conservatives have offered is much better, but I disagree with the idea of Universal Healthcare as a whole. Generally, whenever the government intervenes in something, it makes it worse IMHO.  
10	Similar to another poster, I found myself leaning more towards the Left in highschool/college. Maybe it's aging, or working, or being a parent, or how much further the left itself has gone, or some combination thereof... but I find myself leaning more towards the right the last 3-4 years (I'm a 29y/o male ISTJ, FWIW), perhaps libertarian at times. \n\nAs much as I need/crave rules and order in my daily life, I think there's too much we try to legislate, versus people taking responsibility their own actions and raising their children to do the same. 
13	Both sides have good and supportive arguments to fix whatever issue. I look at it from an unbiased perspective and weigh the pros and cons. 
4	Constitutional conservative here.
4	Not an American, and while I do have an idea of what stances the left and right take, I did a quick Google search to look at key points of contention between the two.\n\nSeems I lean quite distinctly to the liberal side of things. \n\nI am pro-choice. I am pro-euthanasia. I am pro-healthcare. I am pro-gun-control. I am pro-marry-whoever-the-fuck-you-want-so-long-as-y'all-are-consenting-adults.  I am pro-fix-this-global-warming-shit, pro-oil-isn't-gonna-last-forever-let's-find-something-else, and pro-get-religion-the-fuck-out-of-politics-please-and-thank-you.\n\nMy feelings on the death penalty and the decriminalisation of drugs are...complicated.\n\nISTJs are known for their respect of the status quo. But if tradition means fucking over someone else for the sake of it, then that tradition needs to change. 
18	So I’ll go against the grain. I’m an ISTJ and I am very progressive/liberal. I am very concerned with social justice issues and I think unregulated capitalism has created needless inequality and environmental destruction. I think some form of democratic socialism is the best way to address the externalities that make capitalism unsustainable.
3	I consider myself fairly neutral, if not left leaning.. though I do really prefer to take on traditional roles in relationships which is where the S side comes out a bit. 
4	I’m a libertarian myself. What makes you think that most ISTJs are conservative? Is it because of the old Ben Shapiro meme about facts and feelings lol?
2	ISTJs are very traditional, so that generally leans us towards traditional views in conservatism. However, we’re also easily shaped based on how we were raised, which typically gives us similar views as those we were raised around (family, friends, etc.).
1	Just no. Social Democrat here
1	I suppose it really depends on what views in particular you're talking about. The nebulous left-right system creates a lot of contradiction within the wings. Some right-wing people want more restrictions on x, others want fewer.
3	I would argue that right-wing/conservatives appeal to gut-followers instead of the brain-followers. And some [science actually backs that assertion](https://www.psypost.org/2017/06/study-people-left-right-use-different-cognitive-systems-make-moral-judgments-49187). So I would bet the opposite of you.
-11	ISTJ here. Full blown white nationalist.
7	Is this an ISTJ or INTJ?	Before anything, I'd like to thank everyone in other mbti communities for helping me learn a but more about how the cognitive functions work. Overall I've gotten a good foundation on what type I am. From what I learned, I'm most likely not an INTP mostly due to the fact that I kinda see myself as rigid when it comes to my own way of working, and in general my goals. What made me used to think I was an INTP was of how I tend to be rebellious and outspoken, to the point of sarcasm when i felt that I was treated badly and I was miserable. My best friends who were INTPs were usually huge procrastinators with projects which annoyed me, but I always enjoyed talking to INxPs in general because they and i tend to be on the same wavelength in conversations, but that's as far as it goes. Overall I'm just gonna give a bit of more info about myself and see what vibe you guys get.\n\nBut now with my current job as a Logistics Admin assistant, I pretty much feel more confident and more at home, to the point where i feel more prestigious in my life. I used to work In fast food and always felt like I was constantly seen as incompetent due to me having my "head in the clouds" or focusing on other things other than the menial work I was given. At my new job, it has purpose. Logistics on the other hand is the organization and coordination of everything. Literally my job is to be myself, organized, structured, and factual, which I love! \n\nIn my life, I was always seen as shunning any ideas that I saw as out of place, and viewed my way as the best way. My best friends saw me as very outspoken and blunt, to the point of being openly cruel and heartless about others for selfish gain. And the funny part is that I was a bit immature back then and took pride in that. I'd rather be viewed as cruel and heartless than weak and incompetent. My views on it is that I value being on top of everything, not leaving everything to last, and most of all, work towards the goals that are revelant in your life.\n\nMy mannerisms tend to be of someone who is reserved, but arrogant at times. I don't mind this as I have a reason to be. If I am surrounded by disorganization, I will be anxious and WILL make my voice be heard, or I will have huge anger issues. I like having a calm and clean look, I usually try to look presentable because I want to pretty much show myself as someone who is efficent...and appearances matter especially when you want to prove a point. Most of the time though, especially if I'm somewhere unfamiliar, I become incredibly reserved, to the point where I kind of have to force myself to smile.\n\nAnother thing about me is that I focus more on things than people in all honesty. I like focusing on video games, lore, stories, and things that are considered long-term. I daydream about a future where I own a company and I can finally work in the background while I have everything in control and consistent. Anything that seems late or delayed I can be frustrated easily.\n
10	You've just described an IxTJ.\n\nImagine you get an email from a client, asking if he can schedule a call with you to go over an upcoming project. He's pretty busy, but he asks if you are available Thursday at 6.\n\nAre you more likely to 1) Immediately assume the client means 6 PM, since it would be highly unusual for anyone to schedule work at 6 AM, and besides you know from past experience this client puts in a lot of late nights, or 2) Rush off a quick email to the client asking him to clarify if he meant 6 AM or 6 PM, just to be sure.\n\nINTJs rely so heavily on their *logical intuition* they would be much more likely to do #1. ISTJs are so *methodical* they would be very uncomfortable proceeding until all the details were confirmed and locked down, so they would more likely do #2. 
-3	ISTJ.\n\nConsistency isn't an INTJ value, being a "player" is.\n\nINTJs are ready to justify ANYTHING! ISTJs on the other hand, they care about doing what's right. \n\nISTJs are logical and organized, while INTJs are machiavellian and greedy.\n\nISTJs are open-minded and impartial, INTJs are power-hungry and dominating.\n\nEisenhower was an ISTJ, Nixon (and Trump) are INTJs. 
22	When ISTJs go full psycho	
7	His personality type is one of the more believable aspects of his character. Only an ISTJ would try that hard to stay within the lines.
3	I have no idea who that is, but the look on his face in this picture is very believable to me as an ISTJ's "full psycho" face.\n\nWho is that?
2	As soon as I show the picture I could not help but laugh, my cousin says I act or could potentially be like Dexter 
48	istj managing stress	I went through a bad bout of anxiety 2 years ago (which thanks to therapy and meds I am recovered).  I happened to see this article and it helped me work through it.  I even took it to my therapist because it really helped ground my anxiety and give me a better understanding of it.\n\n[https://howtokillstress.blogspot.com/2016/09/the-inspector.html](https://howtokillstress.blogspot.com/2016/09/the-inspector.html)\n\n**ISTJ – The Inspector**\n\n**What Stresses out an ISTJ:**  \n– Being in an environment that is in disarray  \n– Looming deadlines  \n– Being forced or asked to do things that don’t make sense to them  \n– Being asked to do something without a plan or direction  \n– Frequent change  \n– Having to innovate without any past experience to rely on  \n– Being asked to do something spontaneously  \n– Too much extraversion (excess people contact)  \n– Emotionally charged situations  \n– Unfamiliar surroundings  \n– Dealing too long with abstract or theoretical concepts.\n\nWhen faced with stress overload, ISTJs may fall into “catastrophe mode”, where they see nothing but all the potential of what could go wrong. They may beat themselves up; berating themselves for things which could have been done differently, or duties which they failed to perform. They will lose their ability to see things calmly and reasonably, and can become depressed at what they see as a bleak future. Under chronic stress, the ISTJ may fall into the grip of their inferior function, extroverted intuition, and become a “dramatizer”. They may become intensely angry, rigid in what they’re doing, outwardly critical, pessimistic, and embrace an overwhelming fear of the future.\n\n**How to help an ISTJ experiencing stress:**  \n– Give them plenty of space.  \n– Listen, and provide provable affirmation of how they’ve overcome or done something well in the past.  \n– Break a task down into manageable pieces.  \n– Do not give generalized compliments.  \n– Put things that have to be done in sequential order.  \n– Don’t brainstorm. If they are in the grip of their inferior function, extroverted intuition, brainstorming will only make things worse.  \n– Don’t give them more to do. Give them a break from responsibilities if possible.  \n– Take them seriously. Don’t patronize or judge them.  \n– Encourage them to exercise, unless this would sound like an insult.
11	Thanks a lot for this, so much of it rings true to me!
6	Thank you so much for posting this. As an Ne-dom, my general brainstorming seems to drive my partner nuts (especially when stressed), so this is a great reminder to just STAHP.
5	> – Being in an environment that is in disarray\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDepending on the source of disarray.  I was raised by a hoarder, so I'm used to disarray at this point.  If you disturb my disarray in some fashion, it bothers me far more than the fact that the disarray exists.  Yes, it's chaos, but it's my chaos.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>  \n– Looming deadlines\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDepends on why the deadlines are looming and if I'm on pace.  If the deadline is looming because unrelated distractions kept me from working or because information wasn't provided until the last minute and thus set me back, then yes, I'll be quite stressed. \n\nIf, on the other hand, I'm on pace, everything is in line, and I'll be finished by the deadline according to my schedule, then no, no reason to stress.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>– Being forced or asked to do things that don’t make sense to them\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYes.  Especially when those things aren't explained (in other words, make it make sense, and it's far less stressful).\n\n  \n\n\n>– Being asked to do something without a plan or direction\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's add some icing to this cake:  When I create a plan or direction for this thing I've been asked to do, and then you come shit all over me for doing it wrong even though you gave me no indication of the "right way," especially when I'm done or nearly done.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>– Frequent change\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCan confirm.  Even when the change is for the better, and even when I know that beforehand.  Change is inherently stressful.\n\n>  \n– Having to innovate without any past experience to rely on\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEspecially when, as above, I finally get past my own hangups and innovate, only to have someone come along and whine about how I did it wrong.  If there was a right way to do it, why the <insert preferred expletive here, mine starts with "f"> didn't you just tell me to do it that way to begin with?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>– Being asked to do something spontaneously\n\nCan confirm.  I like having plans.  Sometimes my plans are "stay at home and relax," but they're still plans.  If you ask me what I'm doing tomorrow (or later tonight, whatever) and I say "nothing," don't assume that means I want to go play laser tag or paintball with you.  I already have plans for tomorrow.  "Nothing" is a plan.\n\n>– Too much extraversion (excess people contact)  \n\n\nCan confirm.  I need some time where the only people I have to deal with are my dogs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>– Emotionally charged situations\n\nYes.  Especially when "Here's some logic which should diffuse the situation" results in the emotions blowing up even worse.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>– Unfamiliar surroundings\n\nYep, although this could just be a specific manifestation of the "change" mentioned above.\n\n>– Dealing too long with abstract or theoretical concepts.\n\nSure, but if we're allowed to apply some SiTe to them and practically apply or solve them, that can be rewarding.  \n\nI'll add another stress inducer, although this might be a personal pet peeve rather than an ISTJ thing:\n\nMoving the goal posts in an argument.\n\nThis is getting long enough, so I'll stop rather than tackling the "how to deal" bit, but it's accurate enough.
2	Thanks for posting! Usually I only see descriptions of the inferior function grip when it is so helpful to have a list of what might cause it and strategies to overcome it. 
2	This is so me.
1	damn daniel, thats me.
1	Question for OP and/or other ISTJs willing to answer on this one:\n\n>Do not give generalized compliments.\n\nWould that be because it codes as a sort of non-specified expectation? Like, *"Great, now I'm expected to keep living up to that, what do I need to do to do that??* ----> more stress\n\n?\n\n>Listen, and provide provable affirmation of how they’ve overcome or done something well in the past.\n\nI freaking love that provable affirmation one and will tuck it away for possible future use with my SO. I can really see how that would be good for her when under stress. Not sure if I've ever done it or not, but if so it wasn't with consciousness about it ... I love stuff like this to put in my "how to support my sweetie" toolbox :).
5	ISTJ-ENTP friendship	Hello boys and girls, \n\nI've just now noticed how well balanced is my friendship with an ISTJ. When I get distracted by the big picture of things my friend brings me back to the details and how they are in that specific instance. \nI love how we are in many levels the opposite and can push each other in some areas. For example his careful organization sometimes makes him exausted and prevents him from enjoying the moment, while my "on the go" approach shatters his rigid regime and makes him go "maybe I should just chill". i have countless examples like this.\n\nDo you have similar stories? What's your take on ENTPs? 
5	My experience with known ENTPs is somewhat limited.\n\nMy general impression of them is that they're like an excited puppy.\n\nI like puppies, so odd as it may sound, that is actually a compliment.\n\nJust stop biting when I say "ow," or I may swat you on the nose and say "NO!"
2	I think my son may be one of those ENTP type ppl and when everything is just chill, he's a pretty cool kid. Funny, bright, always around and cares about others and stuff. I noticed that his perception of the world is so huge and fast that he passes up opportunities to learn from others so he puts himself in a position to fail far more frequently than necessary, which bothers the hell out of me, but doesn't seem to bother him at all. I try hard to teach him to slow down and focus more on things that are important and take one thing at a time, Prioritize tasks and get them done. And I know that those lessons will never take because there's nothing wrong with him, he's a wonderful child who is just fundamentally different t than me and that's OK..... Unless he wants to talk my ear off when I walk in the door from work. That's not ok. He has to shutup for 14 more minutes. Those are the rules. 
2	Yes! I am an ENTP female and am close with an ISTJ male. (I’m like 99.7% sure he’s ISTJ.)\n\nAnyway - yes, I also find that in our differences, we balance one another out.\n\nSometimes the differences are more stark and require adjusting. For example, his meticulousness (and how it impacts speed) at times has driven me nuts. It took some time to get accustomed to this difference. However, now that I understand it a bit more (and even if it’s different than how I would do things on my own), I find these differences to be quite endearing.\n\nWe are both logical, which works well together. though I think we also are often able to offer different perspectives to situations.\n\nI find that his strengths tend to balance my weaknesses, and vice versa. It has seemed like we are able to interact in a way where we healthily push each other outside of our comfort zones.\n\nI also find that interactions are quite enjoyable and stimulating. From all that I can tell, he feels the same way.\n\nHope this information helps!
41	Sleeping is my passion	
11	This post is too real on many psychological levels.
3	I want to do some traveling to different places for different reasons.\n\nI love geology so I want to go to iceland\n\nIm Hungarian so I want to see what my great grandparents left when they came to America.\n\nI want to go to Scotland because I love listening to the language, it's English, but that ain't fucking English, you know.\n\nI want to see Tokyo to experience that vast busy-Ness as a spectator from within.\n\nI want to see the rainbow mountains in China, again, geology. Also want to see where they're making all these amazing dinosaur discoveries.\n\nParis, London, Venice, normal touristy places have very little interest to me, however. I'll still go if somebody else pay for it tho. 
4	The one place I would want to visit is disney world however I fear I will feel depressed when\n\n* I have no sense of direction\n* There's little time\n* We get on 3 rides\n* Ride I wanted is closed\n* Walk very slow due to crowds\n* We leave early due to emergency\n\nI think I'll just hang out at good old disneyland for now.   \n
2	I LOVE traveling and meeting new places. The feeling of being foreign leaves me in awe. Couldn’t relate less to this post 
4	I am an INFP (22m) who likes an ISTJ (22f). I need some advice	Hello everyone. I like this girl for about 3 months now. I've met her online and been chatting with her in Facebook almost everyday. I always initiate the conversations because I'm a really clingy guy. She replies thoughtfully and nice. Most of the time she even adds emoticons to her replies (if that means anything).\n\nThen the communication between us lessened because she got a job that she loves working on. I've been keeping in touch with her sometimes by sending a "hope you have a nice day" in the mornings and asking how her day went when she's home from work. It's been harder for me to talk to her because we don't chat anymore like we used to. Her replies got bland and serious. I just assumed that it was because she's stressed and tired from the workload and the change.\n\nI asked her out to watch a movie with me just recently and l made it clear to her that it was a date. I must say it was pretty successful considering it was my first time asking someone out and I think it's her first time too. We talked about a lot of things and I even gave her a gift. I know how you guys don't like gifts that much but I tried to be as practical and thoughtful as much as possible. It's an earphones cable clip organizer because we were talking about it before and I really wanted one too so I got her too. She said it was really cute (it's her favorite character) and thanked me.  After the date she messaged me online, she thanked and wished me a safe trip going home.\n\nFor a few days after the date we were chatting online normally and then she got busy again from work and returned from her 'serious mode'. So I apologized and asked her if I was bothering her because I keep on trying to chat her everyday. It took her the whole day to think about what to reply (she saw the message in the morning). She said she didn't know what to say and I shouldn't be sorry because she's actually grateful that there's someone who cares about her.\n\nI asked her out again to eat dinner after work. I suggested Monday but she said that she doesn't like that day. So I asked her when does she want and her reply was "no idea yet". My friends says that she rejected it and she's not interested anymore.\n\nI really overthink a lot and it does feel like she's not interested with me anymore. Should I just stop initiating conversations and give her more space?
11	Ah the elusive ISTJ female. They are an interesting type to say the least, and im an ISTJ guy (22) who just started talking/seeing my own ISTJ female and has been dumped by another ISTJ female.\n\nOk bro lets break this down together as I show you my world. So ISTJs are very polite, especially to close friends. First off, text conversations can feel like pulling teeth depending (wether we like you or not) on text proficiency. TBH, if an ISTJ doesn’t like you, we will just not respond to messages and we won’t hangout with you. Emojis are a big thumbs up. Next, what have personal interactions been like since the date? I know you said you haven’t seen each other as much, but, have they been friendly or does she give you a cold shoulder? If you are getting the latter, she doesn’t like you bro. \n\nFinally, you asking her out again. When an ISTJ likes someone, we basically become mini stalkers. We love soaking up as much info on said person (even if we have been friends with them for years before). Our minds become focused on that person, and our minds process about a million scenarios analyzing compatibility and how well you fit in our image of what our future path is. The first rejection to the date isn’t something to worry to much over, ISTJs are very busy especially when we go “get sh*t done mode.” But, the fact she isn’t trying to reschedule and gave an IDK definitely isn’t good. \n\nHonestly bro, I she went on the date out of respect for your friendship and to see how it went and then decided that it wasn’t going to work. She will probably be polite still. Give her some space, try to hang out in a group setting (have someone else invite so it doesn’t look like you are asking her out again) to see how she responds with a face to face interaction.\n\nWish you the best friend
6	>I asked her out again to eat dinner after work. I suggested Monday but she said that she doesn't like that day. So I asked her when does she want and her reply was "no idea yet". My friends says that she rejected it and she's not interested anymore.\n\nConventional wisdom suggests that if someone turns down a date because they're busy, but makes no attempt to reschedule, they're letting you down gently.\n\n&#x200B;
6	I’m an ISTJ female and I’m afraid she’s rejecting you. That’s how I see it. I don’t think I’m that cold. 
4	ISTJ woman here. One of the biggest things that make me lose interest in a guy is frequents texts like "hope you have a nice day".... Like, how am I supposed to respond to that? It falls under the "small talk" category, in my opinion, and we don't do that shit. If I get frequent texts that I can't respond to in an interesting, engaging, and conversational way, my interest drops immediately. It's actually really annoying to me. If you want to try to reignite her interest, give her a couple days, and then text occasionally with something meaningful, interesting, or funny. If you want to ask her back out, send a pic or link to something nonromantic and interest g to her and say something along the lines of "hey, saw this and thought you might like it, wanna go?" and if she says yes, go as friends and have a good time. Make is super easy. She will appreciate that.... And if you buy her anything, make it nachos. We love nachos. 
3	Why not just ask her directly if she's still interested?  ISTJs value clear communication and directness.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut based off what you're posting here, it sounds like she's lost interest.  If there's anything left there, then giving her space is your best bet.  In my experience, clinginess is a turn off--especially when I'm under stress and my emotional/social energy is depleted.  
3	As an ISTJ female (30s), I cringed really hard at the gift and one-sided, short responses. \n\nMaybe it’s just me, but as a female... bros, we can see what you’re doing. Old timey courtship of: talking, gifts, eating out... relationship?! Felt like just that. Like a conveyer belt I don’t want to participate in and was never asked about, but damn, here we are. \n\nI understand that you like her, *but what makes her like you?* Did you guys meet at work? Did you meet at a mutual interest event? Do you have a common interest to share?\n\nI ask because I see dating kind of like a work meeting. Hey now, I am an ISTJ and I love my job (shrug).\n\n1) If I show up to a meeting and the presenter doesn’t have a point, or a PPT, can’t really describe the project, is constantly asking me small, trivial questions... I’m not interested, they don’t have their -ish together, I’ll just walk out and let them know to contact me when they’re actually ready. \n\n2) If I show up to a meeting and the presenter is there already set up and on-time I scurry to not be out of place. If they have a clear presentation that applies to me (my expertise, experience, or interests) then I’m locked in - especially if the person is giving mutual respect - taking time to not just say “what are you thinking” but more detailed “you mentioned _____ and that caught me off guard, do you have experience with ____?” This gets a person talking about their interests, which is a lot easier if you’re actively doing something at the same time. This goes hand in hand with knowing the audience and preparing for the ensuing conversations.\n\nPlease, please keep your self-respect and dignity. No gal wants to be chased alá Pepé Le Pew style. If you feel she’s not interested, and you share no mutual interest, you’ll be hard strapped to find and gain an interest in one of her subjects in the short time and present it to her without the fact that you’re new to the item and it will be woefully obvious you picked it up just for her. While this may seem sweet and I can see nice intentions, it comes off as pretty creepy and you lose yourself. Be yourself. You’ll find someone who likes you back for you, mate. 
1	Lmao when she said she doesn’t like Monday 😂 that is too real. I’m an ISTJ female and I can assure you all of that sounds both familiar and reasonable.\n\nSounds like you’re doing everything right and yes her change in response is due largely bc of the changes happening in her life. Adjusting to a new job and it’s stresses for sure and maybe even some other stressors in her life she hasn’t mentioned.\n\nI’m sure she appreciates you reaching out to her, it’s less anxiety inducing and stressful that way. But if you’re worried if she’s interested (and I’m sure she is) don’t msg her for a day or so and if you hear nothing msg her and act like nothing happened just continue on as usual “hey how are you” (whatever you usually say). \n\nBasically the only way to know she’s interested is if she agrees to go on a date (have her pick the day bc I have a feeling she’ll have a preference) or if she communicates with you on how she’s feeling which... seems unlikely but isn’t impossible.\n\nFor me personally, I don’t like texting if I’m upset, anxious or stressed so I don’t always respond that same day. But I never ignore my msgs. I also don’t like to talk about what’s making me feel that way bc I rather keep things light and good vibes with others. But getting out of your head is a good thing and reminds you of the nice side of things she just needs to remember that.\n\nAnd good job in the practical gift, seriously a lot of ppl don’t understand that. I hate random stuff and then having to act like I like it which will only encourage more smh but give me what I asked for and it’s fine or something practical and functional and It’s a pleasant surprise\n\nGood luck dude! 
4	Interested in talking??	Supposively you ISTJ's are compatible with my type of ESFP and.. Of course.. I love to chat with people. I'm interested in having new people to talk with..  Wanted to see if any of you are? (Through reddit messaging or whatever)\n\nI thought I'd at least try. \n:) 
38	Here’s a tip: we love talking about ourselves and our interests, and we’re great at answering specific questions we know the answers to. However, we’re typically not much for “chatting,” making conversation, or talking about something without a reason to.
17	I hate small talk. I love big talk.
13	The comments in here are exactly why I joined this sub.  I just love knowing people think exactly like I think.  I'm not completely alone in this world.
13	We tend to not enjoy talking just for the sake of exchanging words, but ISTJs can get really carried away if we\`re talking about something we\`re really interested in. Most often we are happy to talk to people who can easily lead conversations, at least that\`s what I think. I can be interested in some "big talk" as mentioned in another comment
7	Don't you know the internet is a dangerous place to make friends?
5	Why are you interested in talking with ISTJs in specific? 
3	It would be helpful to give some info about yourself first. Such as your interest, hobbies, asl, etc. 
1	I have an ISTJ brother. I mean he seems to talk a lot about things he does, things he’s interested, or his strong distaste in some things (rant coming).\nBut I guess I’m close to him he seems to go on about stuff, I just listen.\nHe has even mentioned that he doesn’t think I understand what he says about some things (his bloody maths and charts), but appreciates that I listen.\nHe appreciates genuine people. So be truthful because they will smell the bs.\n\nAs far as actions go....\nHe notices when people are nice and courteous, even opening a door for someone will put you on his good books.\nBut on the flip side seems to get pissed off at rude people who inconvenience others. I mean stuff I could brush off, ruin his day.\n\nI’m not sure what he’s like with strangers but I know he’s quite honest and straightforward but he wouldn’t be purposely rude.\nHe also seems to laugh a lot at silly humour. (Don’t know if this is an ISTJ thing or personal thing)\n\nThats just my experience with ISTJ brother.
1	Sure. Go ahead. 
8	Needing some career advice from the ISTJs who will know me best	I have an engineering degree and a masters to switch disciplines (i.e. chem eng to mech eng). From high school until this point, I had no direction of where I want to go with my career. I went into engineering because it was more of an ego thing (dumb younger me). I'm very apprehensive about continuing with the technical route. But mind you I only did engineering consulting roles, which were not a great fit for me. I ended up going on stress leave because of the way my coworkers treated me and that it was very difficult to complete my job with how things were handled.\n\nI'm currently in a role which combines analysis and art. I do a lot of number crunching, but the other element of the job (I would say 50-60%) involves being strategic and being conceptual and abstract. There are meetings with lawyers involved and even though I have to crunch numbers, there is a defensible side of it that I need to do. It's not my favourite at all. \n\nI had a talk with my boss today (ENTJ) and he mentioned to me that I really need to get the calculations to be perfect and work a lot on strategic thinking. It's a huge pressure for me considering that I had little mentoring in my previous engineering roles, so I never was able to develop strong habits properly check my work. He also wants me to develop my strategic thinking and to get better at coming up with solutions and take charge as opposed to asking for directions all the time. From what he has seen is that it is a bad sign that my colleagues need to double check my work. It is a sign that they don't trust me. To him, it should be perfect and never have to be double checked.\n\nI understand that my boss is giving me a push and part of me wants to be a better team member, but on the other side, I am wondering if I should do a career switch to a job that is more tailored to the ISTJ personality. I heard that actuary is a very good fit.\n\nI still don't know what to do or what direction I want to go. I know that I haven't given engineering a fair chance. But there are parts of me that are very apprehensive about my ability to be in an engineering role due to my past experiences. I know that my strengths are: Process improvement, analyzing data and working on excel. I'm a perfect worker bee and will be happy to do any work, but I get bored very fast if it becomes repetitive.\n\nSo I'm hoping that since ISTJs know me best, what's your take on this? I'm lost in the emotions and details of what I have to do and don't really see the big picture to ensure my success in any job.
7	I am an ISTJ working in process improvement (lean six sigma specifically) and my role is about 30% crunching numbers and 70% implementation and change management.\n\nI'd say that Process Improvement comes quite naturally to me -- I'm all about efficiency and using the least amount of energy and resources to achieve an outcome (being productively lazy), and changing things incrementally outside of work. My job is basically doing exactly that.\n\nCompared to other analytical roles (e.g. actuary) where the numbers have got to be spot on and are an end in of itself, the numbers I work with are a means to an end. (Te likes efficiency and applicability). \n\nHowever, I struggle internally whenever I run into a project that involves headcount reduction. Not all projects will be like that. But trying to balance the accountability to my organisation, and harming others by having a hand in their layoffs still leaves a sour taste in my mouth. (Conflict with Fi values)\n\nI guess the only thing challenging with the role is the self-doubt and dealing with risk. Doing the analysis, coming up with a recommendation, and then implementing always brings things back to inferior Ne -- what if my analysis was wrong, what if this doesn't go to plan, what if... \n\nJust my 2 cents. Depending on the type of projects you are working on, the organisation, and your personal values, your mileage may vary of course.\n\nI suck at strategy and planning. Implementation style roles or even Ops is something I excel much better at.
3	Not to be presumptuous, but i think a therapist would be the most beneficial. If you change jobs  the same underlying issues might follow you there.\n\nWhen i was younger, i had a terrible job that opened up and exploited my worst weaknesses. I was having panic attacks from work stress and asked my doctor if there was sick leave for that. Luckily, my docotor recommended an excellent therapist instead.\n\nWhat was so crazy to me was in so many aspects of my life, ppl looked up to me: i had confidence and i was in control, but work messed me up, i second guessed myself all the time, and i was so worried about screwing up (unhealthy perfectionist)... My boss saw it and she hated it so she only made things worse. And of course all this happening made me more scared of what could happen *the next time* so i was paralyzed of even moving forward on anything and i started procrastinating on my projects and leaving them till the last minute because everything was wrong in my view (or at least, everything could be better) and anything i did myself without help or approval was just going to be bad... Even talking about it now gives me chills thinking about the person i used to be.\n\nTherapy was a godsend
2	> I am wondering if I should do a career switch to a job that is more tailored to the ISTJ personality\n\nI wish I could answer this more directly, but I heard my calling as early as 4th grade, so I've never been able to give good advice about how to figure out what career path is best for any given person.  (When your dream career is basically handed to you that young, you don't have much of a "finding" process to share with others.)  \n\nI will say that you should avoid stereotyping yourself based on your MBTI type, especially with something as critical as a career field.  Actuary work sounds boring as hell in my opinion and I'm an ISTJ.  On the other hand, I don't often see my field (Chemistry) included in "ideal ISTJ career" lists, yet I've never doubted that I was meant for this line of work.  (Then again, I'm mostly doing analysis, so maybe that's a typical ISTJ thing.)  \n\nIt also sounds to me like you have an issue with confidence.  I don't know what you mean by "the way your coworkers treated you", but the impression I get is that you let your coworkers push you around in some manner (justified or not).  That probably reinforced their (apparent) idea that you can't handle your work (which is why they constantly check you) and you aren't helping that notion by always asking for directions (whether that's justified or not).  Your boss wants to trust your work and it sounds like the best way to sell that trust is through confidence.  Be confident (and correct) enough in your work that you don't need your coworkers to check what you did and be confident enough to tell them to sod off when they try to anyway.\n\nPersonally, I gained almost all of my confidence through work experience (knowing I'm competent and can work through problems) and picking up martial arts as a hobby (once you know how to handle yourself in a fight, other people become a lot less intimidating).  Maybe the artsy/abstract part of your job means it's not for you, but try sticking with it long enough to develop a sense of confidence in your work.  Hope this helps!
1	I work in ME as an analyst, also dabble with Environmental Health and Safety (OSHA) and day-to-day 5S, lean, and small project management. \n\nI enjoy my number crunching and directing small groups at a high level to tackle broad problems. I manage the holy Jesus out of Kanban boards and pride in always being on time and on budget for projects. That alone has given me at least a boost of credence to upper management as I’m the only lead analyst and no other analyst does inter-departmental PMs besides me.\n\nWhy does this appeal to me as an ISTJ? Because it forces me to be increasingly agitated with ‘solo checks’. By spending time building in second and even tertiary checks, you build confidence in catching and correcting your own errors and rely less on others for validation/verification.\n\n*E.g. in Excel you might need column C to be column A + column B. It’s easy enough to just make the formula... but that’s one check. Go a step further and verify that IF(C-(A+B)=0,””,”ERROR”).* \n\nJust by double checking you’re reducing your own false response rate and increasing your credibility, at least by a little. This is an incredibly simple use, but consider automated load testing or a number of other tools to validate prior to presenting. All this doesn’t mean to never ask for outside input, but being the person constantly asking other engineers how to engineer (let’s be honest, this is what it feels like with MECOPs sometimes) can be overused.\n\nIf you’re not confident in your abilities, build them up. If you make simple, easy mistakes that kind of make you slap your head - make a second check system! If you’re slapping your head, guess what coworkers who have been pointing out the same issue after multiple projects is thinking. Reduce your issues, reduce your risk of errors, reduce exposure as someone who needs a hand held through projects. \n\nFWIW you sound willing but maybe in a tough work environment. Maybe you can ask for a senior engineer as a mentor?
15	Does anyone else get irritated by nitpicking in arguments?	When I'm in an discussion or listening/watching one, having someone start their (counter-)argument with "well, you see, actually..." is more than enough to make my blood boil, because I know what's going to follow is something that *is* technically correct but misses the spirit of the thing that's being discussed.\n\nDoes anyone else experience this or is it not so common among ISTJs? I guess I'm okay with other kinds of nitpicking, sometimes maybe because I'm guilty of them myself, but this is only about nitpicking in arguments.
22	Not me. I don’t want to be wrong for a second longer than necessary and if they’ve got a valid point that’s fact-based and logical, then I’m all for hearing it. \n\nWhat makes my blood boil are emotion driven arguments. I don’t care how much “kinder” the result - facts are facts and they don’t care about your feelings. 
13	Well, you see, actually, I'm usually the one picking nits in an argument, so no.\n\nI'm more irritated by people ignoring facts and logic that are counter to their argument *because* those facts are counter to the spirit of their argument.\n\nArguments should be decided based on facts and logic, not "the spirit of the argument" or your feelings.
3	I am that person lol
3	I'm the one who usually nit picks in arguments. What irritates me is emotional arguments.
3	I see where youre coming from, but it depends on the "well you see actually" ...are they arguing in good faith or trying to twist the argument into a "gotcha" moment? \n\nI have no time for people who want to play words games to win an argument, but i have all the time in the world to hear a different opinion thats sound and logical and "well you see actually" just might be better than my view ;)
1	It depends. If it's my spelling or pronouncing that's being nitpicked, it may annoy me. But if I said something wrong, even though it's small, I like being corrected. It's important that everyone is on the same page. I correct small things like that all the time.
1	I hate that shit..." Well actually one time 1500 years ago this one armed midget in out space managed to....." SHUTUP! That's not even what we're talking about.\n\nGenerally I can't stand nit picking at all. It's just spending time and energy looking for something wrong and 99% of the time it's insignificant and just makes you look ugly and of poor character.\n\nRant over, your welcome. 
1	My istj husband is always nitpicking, and I don't mind the corrections as I'd like to know if I'm wrong, but I do mind if the entire point of what I'm trying to say gets derailed into a looong group discussion on the semantics :p
1	I'm about to say that an ISTJ that I know of tends to do this to me and I saw a lot of comments saying they're the ones nitpicking, lol.
1	I prefer that the central premise of an argument be addressed. It's why I tend to avoid online debates: frequent decay into tangential disputes.
6	Building confidence at work	I know that I'm good at what I do (analysis type work) and I get along with everyone. I have social anxiety as one of my mental illnesses. I work with an ENTJ boss and a INTJ coworker. They always have an interrogation type approach and it really bumps down my confidence a notch.\n\nThey don't like specifics so when they talk to me it appears complex and hard to follow. I usually get it after they explain it a couple of times more simply or slowly. I feel dumb and they have a condecending tone at times.\n\nI feel like I'm being walked all over. Can any other ISTJs provide some insights on how to improve my confidence?\n\nSwitching jobs isn't a solution for me. I know this situation will come up again and I'm not going to get a new job everytime my personality clashes with someone.
6	I got most of my confidence at work by building up a solid background of experience that I can use as "proof" of competence to myself.  I believe it's clear to my coworkers that I can handle 99% of my job independently so when I do need help I don't feel like a helpless idiot but rather a competent person who's not in their area of greatest expertise.  If someone doubts my abilities it's their fault for being wrong, not mine for being incapable.\n\nIt's also helpful to know your strengths and weaknesses and tell your coworkers (when it matters) so you can both understand each other.  For instance, I have a hard time remembering/processing verbal instructions because I'm not an auditory learner so I just tell people to show me how something is done or I try to get written instructions "because that's just how my brain works".
2	Know what you do - be the one and only expert in what you do. Own ever aspect of your job - work towards better numbers and bigger success and take credit for it.\n\nIts also really good that you can tell how they communicate best so you already know how they would like to be communicated with. Whenever possible, dont be overlly detailed or wordy with them; Keep it short and to the point.\n\nIf you can talk to your coworkers one on one, thats better (so it doesnt feel like theyre ganging up on you) ...dont *react* to them being condecending, instead *take control* of the conversation, let them know how you will receive infomation about a project, ask for specifics and be firm, yet casual - like its an obvious thing to ask for... Give the impression that specifics and details are the most normal thing in the world, and if he answers all vague and obtuse, look at him like he has two heads. Control the conversation. Thing is, its just one communication form over another, his is not better, and needing specifics is not worse. \n\nI have to work with an INTJ at work sometimes and i find when i press him for details the reason he doesnt want to give them to me is because he has no f**king clue. So keep that in mind - what you may be reading as condescendion might actually be their annouce at their own personal inability to be specific.
2	I find myself in a similar situation at work sometimes... My manager explains things to me in a way where I think I get it, but when I start the project it's not at all what I thought. He doesn't seem to give me the right details. This might help, I have learned to do these things when I'm interacting with him.\nFirst, do some research on the project/job before talking to your manager. If I'm walking into any situation with at least a little prior knowledge, I'm likely to get more out of it.\nRestate to your manager/cw what you think they are instructing you to do. Something like, "To be clear, I should do...." Make sure you share the same understanding of your task.\nHere's the thing. If you show that you are trying to do your job in the best way possible, they won't be mad. If you ask a ton of questions and still do it wrong, they will get frustrated. Before you leave the conversation, be sure you have all the info you need to proceed. \nMake sure it's evident you're learning. Ask a question, get an answer, retain the info, use it, and don't ask the question again. \nIf all else fails, talk to your manager and explain that you learn a little differently and that you might need a few more details in the instruction process.
1	I think that remembering that their approach to you doesn't reflect on you, it reflects on them. So when they're being condescending or whatever, that's a character flaw on THEM. Not you. You can't control that and you just have to accept that there's no way to fix that in other ppl.\n\nYou know that they're going to behave that way, you know that you'll understand their instructions eventually, and you know that you'll meet their expectations. So fuck them. Don't let these assholes trigger you anxiety. They do that shit for fun. 
16	Thoughts on venting	I’m just curious of your thoughts on venting. I totally understand letting some things out and then moving on but I often encounter situations where someone presents an issue, someone comments with an explanation or solution and the person replies “oh, just venting” or “I know how it works but just venting.” I’m always left wondering, well did you want a solution? Or, if you know why that happens why did you present it as a unsolved problem. 
18	I vent to myself to release frustration. Venting to others feels like a pointless waste of their time and an unnecessary interaction for both of us
6	I vent to others to possibly garner another perspective I hadn't thought of myself and thus other options to resolve them.
3	This is rampant on r/rant. Like did you just wanna scream at the sky or just find a bunch of people to agree and relate to you? 
3	When I vent, it's to get other viewpoints in on the matter. I welcome solutions or opinions. 
2	When I feel the need to vent, it\`s normally to get another perspective on what I\`m venting about. Sometimes when saying things out loud I can change my view on the matter, but having someone else share what they think is really helpful for understanding
1	Many people are not looking for advice when they vent. When I do it, I’m trying to let the emotions out so I don’t bottle them. I like to hear other viewpoints on the situation as well. \n\nSometimes, I know the issue and how to fix it, but need to vent anyway. Hearing the same solution that I already know doesn’t help in that case. Then, just a sympathetic ear is nice. No blame but just a sincere, “That really sucks,” is enough. Maybe even share a time when you felt similarly and how you dealt with it. \n\nIt’s more about feeling better emotionally than trying to find a solution. Let out the bad feelings and try to keep it calm. If I’m looking for actual advise, I try to phrase it differently. “I have no idea what to do about...” and such. 
1	I vent to a couple close friends and my boyfriend sometimes, whether it's work-related or whatever it may be. I don't expect a solution I just need to get it out and like to have someone there to listen, that's all. Generally the same goes for when people vent to me. I don't try to offer solutions unless they ask what I think they should do. I don't find anything wrong with venting once in a while or listening to someone vent for their own sake.
1	I think venting is all about expressing the emotions, anxiety, and angst that is associated with the problem in a safe way. Meanwhile when you say the things out loud it give you an opportunity to hear the things and register them in a different way than they had been Bouncing around your mind which gives you a chance to organize those thoughts ultimately leading so some semplance of psychological peace. Venting isn't about problem solving. Someone who is venting isn't asking for advice. They're asking for a safe place to be heard. If you have advice to offer, wait til the rant is over and ask if they would like feedback. If they say no, respect them and shutup. 
1	I vent, but rarely to or at others.  Generally, my venting and/or ranting is done in my truck on the way to or from work or when I'm in the shower.  Namely, times when I'm alone.
1	>“I know how it works but just venting.”\n\nI sometimes experience this myself, though I mostly do it in private.\n\n"Yes, I *know* 'why,' but that doesn't make it sound any less stupid. Yeah, yeah, I'll do it/accept it/whatever, but still."
9	Opine: ISTJs may be more prone to PTSD?	ISTJ here. Just curious what others opinion is. Actually, not just curious, I have it. In all other aspects of my life, I have a wall, barrier, tough shell...whatever. It's been over 5 years and I still have counseling.\n\nI was contemplating if (according to my ISTJ) this is normal or if we are susceptible to the diagnosis.\nTia
3	I'd believe it if someone said Si-Fi loops were responsible for making us more PTSD prone. We vividly relive memories on a regular basis. 
2	I guess it could be; when "in the grip" our inferior Ne makes makes us fatalistic, overwhelmed with dread and fear, and paranoid... So perhaps the function we have the least control over is the one running amok with a traumatized part of ourselves we also have little control of
3	Obviously everyone is different, but I have ptsd from childhood trauma. I built a massive wall which I have been in therapy for a long time to deal with. I could see how ISTJs are more prone to wallishness and compartmentalizing which is great for the short term but detrimental long term whereas other personality types might exhibit more in the moment anxiety and stress. 
1	Idk. I worked in the ER for 3 years and saw and experienced some fucked up shit. I don't think I was ever really effected by it because I don't create the bonds with people and experiences that would psychologically scar me. It would take something truly personal and substantial and painful to get me there. 
1	What are your enneagram types.	
3	5w6\nBut the 4 hit home in a violating kind of way.\nWhere did you take that test?
3	5w6 here as well, a whole new world of understanding myself and especially other people opened up when I discovered the enneagram. Of course once I learned about it, I then had to research the heck out of it.
2	Type 1
1	I’m 4w5! Also, Sleeping at Last created songs for each of the enneagram types (he’s in the process of writing the song for type 8 right now) and they ARE SO BEAUTIFUL. His song for type 4 (my enneagram) made me feel so understood but so exposed at the same time. He also has podcasts describing the creative processes for those songs. Highly recommend! 
1	It was a while ago, but i believe my type is 9... Specially 9w1
2	Help with ISTJ husband (separated)	Good evening\n\nLooking for some MBTI-specific input on my current situation. Separated (in-house cohabitation) with my ISTJ husband. He can be quite 'unhealthy' - very rigid, always has to be right about everything, can't admit fault, very childish when angry, quite mean and cruel sometimes, flooded by his emotions in general (both good and bad), very little empathy for other people.\n\nWe separated due to a perceived abandonment /betrayal on my part (no cheating or anything involved - I took a job long-distance and we were hopefully going to move together and it didn't work out). Also due to him finding me overly emotional and irrational. I was angry for a very long time due to ways hes behaved that I perceive as controlling. I am probably an unhealthy INFJ!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, just wondering what works for you in these situations. Healthy or otherwise. I want to reconcile and I'm trying to really let him take it at his own pace (he's said he will try although he keeps prevaricating). I'm struggling.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't really know what will happen but I would like to try to understand, better. \n\nI find him very confusing sometimes as I feel like when he's emotional, he isn't this rational person at all and his words and actions don't match up, but he insists they do. Also he gaslights so the whole thing leaves me scratching my head.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDisclaimer - he is a lovely guy overall and I know the above comes across as harsh but its just an intense situation (separation!).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you 
5	Never been in a serious argument like this having to do with separation/divorce, so take that as you will.\n\nIf I ever have an emotional time, I basically will shut down. I'm trying to work on that, but in the few instances where I feel myself getting overly emotional, I rein it in and just kinda go blank. I'll process them on my own when I have time to myself to think it over internally. \n\nI also have a tendancy to think I'm always right, but trying to work on that as well. I tend to be very logical and don't really care how it makes others feel. My current and previous SO have pointed out that I seem to lack empathy for the other person in an argument, and I agree. I see arguments as a disagreement about something factual, when an argument regarding how I or someone else feels about something, I don't really care to argue about it. \n\nI can't comment on the gaslighting thing, as I don't personally think I do that. Never heard someone mention me doing it either, but no way to positively rule out me doing something like that. 
3	He is leaving threatened by change, he might fear losing you and that's why he is leaving you.\nParadoxical, but at least I function like that. 
2	Either i can see the future or this is a repost
1	We don't process emotional stuff very well and when it gets to a point when we actually do express it, it's usually a whole disjointed mess that doesn't make any sense, and certainly doesn't line up with what we're thinking. I would focus on what he says  when he's not being emotional because that's what hell act on.\n\nWhen I'm an emotional mess, my words may sound like "omg, I hate all of this, and I'm so angry, and everything is so fucked up, and Idk what the hell I'm supposed to do or how to do it" and then ten minutes later, I'm like, "ok I had my melt down, let's fix this shit so that dont happen again" and start making plans to move forward. Don't make too much out of his emotional outbursts because he isn't either. We think that emotions are an inconvenience that's get in the way of the important stuff. Like problem solving
1	If he don't know what the right answer is, then you make the decision. This is your relationship too and he don't get to keep you in limbo while he gets to be cozy. 
15	ISTJs, how often do you develop a serious crush?	female ISTJ here. just wondered how often other ISTJ people have had serious crushes on someone? all my life i’ve had very light crushes on girls just because i thought that they were attractive. usually if they say/do something that i dont like or agree with, the crush is immediately gone. i tend to gush about my light crushes to my online friends so they think i develop crushes easily. \n\nit’s hard for me to develop a serious crush because i don’t have a lot of irl friends and it’s not my thing to crush on someone that i know from online. \n\nthe only person i seriously liked (maybe even loved) was a close friend of mine in high school. she’s an ESFJ so i admired her energy and appreciated how much she took care of me since i’m usually the one that takes care of others. \n\nanyways, sorry for the long post. have you guys ever had serious crushes before? 
18	I don’t get a lot of crushes, don’t fall in love easily. But once I do it takes forever to get over it.\n\nIt seems like it’s every 2-3 years for me, it’s like a cycle...
6	Not often, and never goes further than that. 
7	I'm probably atypical in this regard but I fancy bloody everyone, though maybe only lightly(though that may be due in part to my hatred of being single). Pretty rare I'll be SUPER into someone, but if I am it's almost like an obsession... 
3	When I was in primary and secondary school, I had a crush on any girl that even gave me the time of day. Definitely not love, since I was just a kid, I didn't know what that truly was until later in life. But yeah, back then I was constantly crushing. As for SERIOUS crushes, I usually only got those on someone who I then subsequently started dating. As time went on I got more cautious and selective with who received my affection.
3	Funny enough, I never got them often. I had a few crushes as a kid (every two years, in fact) that lasted awhile. Then maybe 2-3 as a teenager. I had a few periods of attraction in middle school that ultimately faded after a few weeks. Looking back, all my crushes were either long term or extremely short lived (aka: not serious).\n\nAs a young adult, I received the terrible advice to just date someone if I was attracted to them physically. I thought a lot of people were cute, so I ended up in a lot of superficial relationships. A lot, if not all, of my relationships with boyfriends ended after a few weeks because I knew it wasn’t right. I think the longest relationship I was ever in was four months. I was in the middle of one of these types of relationships when I met my now fiancé. We’ve been together eight years and are getting married in September! I think I was always logically waiting for someone who fit me and was as serious as I was willing to be with the right person... if that makes any sense. 
3	I didn’t really start having crushes until the end of middle school or beginning of high school, and they’ve all been pretty light. I think a heavy crush and/or love would only happen if I know the person well as a friend beforehand.
3	33/f ISTJ. I have never had a serious crush on a person that I haven’t known explicitly well. I never thought “oh, they’re hot. I’d like to have sex with them” either. You might want to look into demisexuality. \n\nTurns out r/demisexuality is a thing. Also asexual, allosexual, and a slew of other terms to define sexuality further. For me demisexuality is about establishing a functioning knowledge of the other person, establishing I like them and feel a mutual respect with them, and then I can proceed with ‘normal’ checklists like they’re attractive, we share hobbies, etc. 
3	I don't get them a lot. I have infatuation phases with one or two people a year (unless I'm in a relationship like rn) where it gets a little deeper, like I'll constantly try to talk to them all day via messenger/text.\n\nPeople are typically kept at arms length. I'm very private emotionally, so I lean on flirtations leading up to sex (barring the act itself) to express interest. This cycle usually lasts about 1-3 months before something in me flips it off, and it can be on very minor things (like if they don't wear cologne/deodorant). If my infatuation lasts longer than the first three months, then I'm going to fall in love, but my emotions usually develop quite slowly.\n\nWith my bf it's quite a different scenario, since we've been talking for about 5 months now, and I fell in love with him within the infatuation period and it's only gotten stronger instead of abating.
2	Throughout primary school and now my first year in college I’ve had maybe 2/3.  I don’t ever do much with it, just keep them in mind
2	I don't know about "crushes" per se, but I tend to take a shine to folks (or not as the case may be) really quickly, and it takes a bit to change my mind once I do. \n\nI can acknowledge that people I know are attractive, and that they might be someone I would like to spend time with, or be in a relationship with were the circumstances right, but it's not a case of being in love with them unless we are together. \n\nI think it's a side-effect of the ISTJ tendency for loyalty, where if I'm in a relationship with someone, I have the *hugest* crush on them, but I'm really good about not feeling that outside of my partner. 
2	This is actually a pretty interesting topic I hadn't thought to view through the lense of my personality type before ... it is kind of comforting to know it seems to be more rare based on the few responses here.  I'm 31 and have only fallen for 2 women and only ever had minor crushes which can usually be dismissed easily.  I've dated a lot and I keep waiting to feel this "spark" you hear about.  And I'm like JasonTheRobot, the last woman I fell for was about 3 years ago and I still think of her almost daily.  
8	Need your perspective on a particular ISTJ’s behavior.	I’m not exactly sure if this is type related, Ne grip related, stress related and/or enneagram related (self preservation 6 phobic). \n\nMy father is in his 70s and I (INFP) have moved back in to help out with things. \n\nI understand he’s restless, bored, overmedicated (age and ailments), perhaps a bit lonely, perhaps feeling worn down from lifelong obligation (he’s the first to help *everyone* and has taken quite a bit on his shoulders all his life. \n\nSo he’s been taking on projects. Starting a huge garden project. He will *endlessly* research the ins and outs on how to do things. Almost out of desperation to keep himself occupied. Have all these ideas and questions. Asks anyone and everyone for advice and information.\n\nNow he wants to start an Alpaca farm. Scratch that an Ostrich farm. Repairing and building. Endless research. Calling people incessantly.\n\nHe does lack Fe and Ne is a weak point. I get it, I’m just now becoming aware of my own Te and am doing some work to incorporate that into my own life. I’m more considerate of *not waking people up at 5am* to express new ideas and ask even more questions. \n\nI’ve been blunt but I’ve also been astute enough to see when he’s anxious and how he can get hurt if I bring certain things to light. So I’ll appease. \n\n\nWhat advice can you give (considering all the aforementioned factors) to help my Dad soothe some of this anxiety? Or just help him feed what needs to be fed constructively. He’s driving a lot of people nuts. And he’s told me that if he doesn’t do this *”he will die of stillness”* and I’m not sure if he’s keeping busy to keep shitty feelings at bay. I can’t make this assumption but we are a lot more alike than we are different so... I get that possibility as well.\n\n\nThoughts? I can’t quite articulate clear questions. \n\n* Is this stress behavior and Ne inferior shit coming up? \n* How can I help him *enjoy* the process rather than research out of anxiety, for example.\n\n(Lack of Fe- the blindspot...is just the ISTJ cognitive makeup. C’est La Vie. So calls at 5am waking people up is none of my beeswax!)\n\n**Thanks for your responses. You’ve brought much needed clarity. Please keep the suggestions coming! You’re also giving me ideas to help keep him happily busy!!**\n\n
9	I am not sure if I have much advice or even how type related it is. I know I enjoy having things to do and have always been the "family manager." when I didn't have a job I flitted from idea to idea and couldn't commit to anything. Again don't know how type related that is but his actions sounds like something I would do. Mainly, he needs something to do and probably a routine. I am someone who needs structure. So maybe he needs to volunteer every other day at set hours, read in the mornings, garden (or other activity) in the afternoons. Go for a walk in the evenings after dinner. \n\nAlso, endlessly researching is a compulsion of mine. My fiancé usually just lets me talk /research and he knows I'll come to the right conclusion eventually. 
3	Your dad's situation resonates with me.  My dad recently retired and immediately built a massive workshop and started practicing/teaching Tai Chi (these were entirely justified, by the way, not misguided impulses).  If/when I retire, I plan to do something similar.  I need to *do* things in my free time.  I need projects to work on, new hobbies to master, something to push me out of bed in the morning.  I need to be productive.  I need to *live*.  If I don't, I have to force myself to calm down and actively remind myself that it's ok to do nothing sometimes.  Why is this the case?  I don't know.  Maybe it's an Si thing, maybe it's a Type A thing, maybe it's just my quirk.\n\nIt sounds like your dad has the same drive so you should help him find something to work on.  If he's like me, this drive isn't ever going to go away so it's best to indulge it.  The thing he works on has to be meaningful, it has to relate to his interests, it has to present challenges, and it needs to be time consuming.  Si does mean we like working with our hands and we don't mind being left alone to figure something out.\n\nAn ostrich farm sounds too tedious for what it gives him, will probably be expensive, and is a bit ridiculous to boot.  My suggestion is to see if he'd enjoy woodworking.  It's hands-on, there's a infinitely high skill ceiling, he can be creative with it, and if he really gets into it, he could set up an Etsy account and find productivity in selling nice things to people.  He doesn't need to jump right into a full-on workshop like my dad (he was practically raised in construction), just let him dabble for a bit.\n\nI hope this helps you understand your dad!
1	Can't he just be impassioned? I know after high school I became depressed and REALLY needed an outlet. When people are depressed they need hobbies. I dug out a pond, gardened and learned a lot about it for about 2/3yrs. It was like a safe haven mentally and puts your skills to use. If I was you, I would encourage your father to develop himself and his skills. This is a time in his life where he can focus on himself for once. I would respect your father, join in. 
4	Any professionals wanting to keep their team more in sync and organized?	I've made an app that helps keep your team organized and accountable regarding asks, action items, announcements, etc. Looking for any feedback, positive or negative. If you aren't interested in using this, please let me know why. https://getpigeon.app
1	This is such an ISTJ app.\n\nYou will never track me. I am an ENTP.\n\nNot being accountable for my laziness is the best thing about my job.\n\nHow dare you try and take that away from me.
11	Do some ESTJs annoying the living crap out of you sometimes?	I feel compelled to rant on something that happened tonight.\n\nSo, long story short my ESTJ roommate was driving me nuts tonight. We were hanging out with a couple of friends, and throughout the night she was making some know-it-all comments or some comments that gave me the impression that she felt like she was superior to everyone else. Things like directly chastising other people for making mistakes in board games or trying to tell people what to do when she herself probably didn't have the best idea of what to do in a certain situation.  And there was another situation where her boyfriend and I shared blame in a mistake we made, but she made me feel like I was all to blame in that situation.\n\nLater I introduced a new type of card game to everyone that I used to play as a kid all the time, and she proceeded to make some crass remarks about certain rules being weird and how "this \[particular rule\] is so different from every other card game I've played - this just seems so weird to me." It was as if she was annoyed that there was such a "weird" rule at all. To which I, at that point fed up with her attitude, snarkily replied that, "we're just trying to have a good time here.... it's not like we're playing for money or anything high stakes, so take a fucking chill pill. Shut your mouth, play the damn game once, and deal with it." (paraphrase, but it had that sort of tone :))\n\nMaybe I was just super sensitive tonight and irrational, but I also just didn't want to deal with her attitude anymore. I usually get along with her, but her directness tonight in particular just really made me unhappy.\n\nEdit: sorry about that unfortunate title mistake lol
12	My dad is an ESTJ. Last night he told me to start the gas fire which I have done countless times before. He is sitting in a lounge chair watching me. Tells me to get the matches out of the cabinet. I turn on the gas. He tells me to throw a match into the fire(I’m rolling my eyes like “no duh”). I light a match and throw it in the fire but miss. So I get another match. He is sitting there just berating me; saying “light the match first” and “throw it in” over and over. I pull out another match, light it off of the first one, throw it in, and the gas ignites. Then I turn around and say “would you shut up, I know how to light the damn fire.” We both laugh. That’s just our relationship. But it’s totally characteristic of ESTJ and ISTJ. The ESTJ wants to micro manage and the ISTJ wants to be left alone because it’s perfectly capable on its own thank you very much.
7	[deleted]
4	Sounds about right. My ESTJ friends does just about everything listed in this post\n\nDon’t know if that’s just them or he’s just immature, can’t really tell the difference. 
3	My co worker is an ESTJ, and as much as I love him, he overwhelms me a lot 
3	Oh boy I feel that one. I have a few ESTJs as friends, but one of them (who also is my roommate) can be very annoying. For no reason, like bruh take a chill pill I know what I’m doing.\n\nVery micromanaging. His last roommates listen to him apparently, and when I moved in he tried to force his weird rules on me. That didn’t work. 
2	My dad is an ESTJ.\n\nIf things aren't being done as efficiently or timely as he expects, hoo boy am I going to get an earful!
2	My ex is an ESTJ and there wasn't a thought that went through his head that didn't come out his mouth, no matter how mean, hateful, insignificant, dumb, or crass it was. He would go out of his way to make ppl around him feel awful and small and never had a kind word to say about anything. He'd tell the same story over and over and over again but if I said the same story twice in six months I had short term memory loss and was dumb. We've been broken up for a year and a half. I call his ass out on his lies and patronizing every time now. 
1	I'm ENFP and my life has been only romantically engaging with ISTJs and that's kinda interesting	Our functions are literally opposite one from another.\n\nENFP: NeFiTeSi\n\nISTJ: SiTeFiNe\n\nWhich, in theory, could make me think "oh, that's a good balance", but when one of us (or both) are not well enough... Like a Ne grip in an ISTJ or NeTe loop, for example.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith the 4 experiences I had (and I'm only counting relationships +1yo) I learned a lot, which is quite nice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd I just wanted to share this because it's really random but I think the world deserves to know   \n\n\nPS: pls don't hate
4	ENFPs and ISTJs are duels in socionics. Which is theoretically known for easy communication. Especially since you're Si seeking which is our dominant function, and we're Ne seeking which is your dominant function.
1	That’s interesting. \n\nWhat attracts you to ISTJs? What’s your biggest dislike?
5	(Survey) Relationship Between Personality Type and Drug Use	
19	I have never smoked or done any drugs including weed.  (And I live where it is legal.  Even have a drive thru less than a mile from my house.)  I've only had about 10 drinks in my 56 years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNever liked the idea of losing control.
7	I'm curious if I'm in the minority of ISTJs that use illegal drugs. \n\nI know many will type us as traditionalists, but I believe I'm not alone in saying we won't follow tradition blindly. This is one of the cases where I believe the tradition makes no sense. 
3	Considering this only posted to 3 or 4 of the other 16 types, re results are going to be heavily skewed. 
1	The question about choice of recreational drug should not be limited to one option. There are people who have multiple choices. Personally I drink and smoke weed.
1	Among the most ISTJ books ever written is [Pihkal (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PiHKAL) in which a pharmacologist and his wife meticulously catalogue their experiences with an expansive repertoire of synthetic psychotropic agents. Would recommend (the book of course)
0	Youtuber C.S. Joseph Concludes That Ben Shapiro Is ISTJ	
12	Shapiro is an ESTJ. CS Joseph is atrocious at typing.
4	Ahh shit, so am i
15	Atheists?	I was raised in a Jewish household, completed all the rituals etc. As an adult (and after being exposed to other communities) I lost my faith.\n\nCurious about the community’s religious beliefs or lack thereof. Logic and reason reign supreme around here so I imagine I’ll see a lot of similar responses, but I’m genuinely curious.\n\nAlso - Happy Friday :)
18	Agnostic atheist checking in. I was raised non religious and called myself an atheist for a long time but eventually found that to be too much of an absolute.\n\nWhile I don't believe in a god or grand design etc, I don't pretend to know for certain if this is true or not. I don't have proof there is and I don't have proof there isn't.
9	Practicing Catholic checking in
8	I was raised non-denominational Christian by my Dad and Methodist by my Mom.  Growing up I only went to church with my Dad on his weekends, but stopped going from my teens-early 20s.  I started going back to church (non-denominational Christian) on my own about the age of 22.  I try to go every Sunday, but I'm not perfect.  So, practicing Christian here.
7	Raised with no religion, became a Christian after meeting my (now) husband (INTP). That was almost 30 years ago. 
6	Being raised as an atheist I (36M) am leaning towards Taoism in the past couple of years. I simply find the notion that real truth can't be spoken rather fascinating. 
5	Brought up Protestant , atheist most of my adult life.
4	Raised in a Muslim household. I lost faith around junior year of HS because I slowly realize that this is not the lifestyle I want to commit to. My mom said that God will answer all of my troubles but It has not and I thought about the kids suffering in Syria, Yemen, and Iraq and how their prayers are not answered. I also read the translation of the Qur'an and found a bunch of messed up quotes (especially with how it slanders Jewish people). Not only that but when I read the translation, Muslim elders questioned me about my motive.
5	My parents half-assed tried to raise me a baptist. I thought for the longest time that my dad was an atheist, but no, just too lazy to wake up that early on Sunday.\n\nWhen I was a small child, <6 years old, I was convinced that there was something wrong with me because I couldn't "hear the voices" or "feel the spirit" when praying. As a result of that and many other things, I was a god-doubting agnostic from about 8 years old until I met my future husband at 15, then atheist since. I'm lucky to have met someone who shares my lack of belief. 
5	My familiy is christian, but they where very good at letting me know I could belive in anything I want. I chose to be an atheist when I was around 15. Got nothing against good people who happen to be religious. I just find any kind of god highly unlikely to exsist.
3	Well I (23m) was raised orthodox christian but when i grow up i became atheist.. 
3	Non denominational Christian checking in, I love information and finding out the why of things. I love science and technology but for me there are still unanswered questions that science can't quite figure out. 
3	I'm an Atheist but not sure how common it is for ISTJs. I was raised without religion (parents are believers but didn't impose any type of religion on me).
3	[deleted]
3	Raised Southern Baptist, deconverted in college. I’ve been an agnostic atheist for about 10 years.
3	From a purely logical standpoint, atheism it's just as illogical as any kind of theism. There is just as much proof for *no* god as there is for a god. \n\nI have more respect for theists who know their are no facts and just believe with faith, and for agnostics who acknowledge that theres probably something, but theres just no way to know for sure
2	I am an atheist; I was raised protestant but stopped going to church when I was allowed to make my own decisions regarding it. On the list of things I'd like to study is theology- just to understand why people put so much trust in something for which there is no proof/ realistic reason to believe. Prayer also freaks me out \[ especially in governmental/work related settings- love the first amendment\]. If you feel the need to ask a non existent being for help to do your job - running a government- maybe you shouldn't be there in the first place. It is more logical in settings when control is really out of your hands, like hospitals (though it is still in someone's hands- a doctor)  The pledge of allegiance runs along similar lines for me. 
2	I've met quite a bit of atheists or agnostics that manage to be less logical or reasonable than a hardcore Ken Ham creationist.
1	Practicing Presbyterian reporting in.
1	You honestly believe that first statement?
1	atheist turned Catholic
1	I converted to Conservative Judaism.  The structure and ritual appealed to me and the openness of my rabbis to answering questions keep me interested.
4	Have any of u dated or are dating an ENFJ?	What are the pros and cons?
5	With an ENFJ (F) right now. \n\nPros: \n\n* Amazingly encouraging. She makes me feel like I can do anything I put my mind to. \n\n* This kinda goes along with #1, but she really seems to balance me out, as I'm normally on the slightly cynical/realism side. She is always so optimistic, we can have endless conversations about just about anything because of this I believe.\n\n* Can read me like a book. I've never had a partner that is able to read my normally emotionless self. (Guess this can be a con as well depending on the situation though)\n\nCons:\n\n* She is very flighty with her goals/ideas. I can't tell you how many things she's told me she wants to do/improve on in the ~9 months we've been together. From quitting cigarrettes (don't get me started on how many times she's tried quitting), getting back into exercising, to things like keeping an actual schedule and being on time etc. \n\n* I don't think this is an ENFJ, but it REALLY grinds my gears. She's religious, but leans towards buddhism (her words), but she is also into spirits and has crystals in her place above the doorways etc. If we continue dating an eventually move in, this would be a dealbreaker for me. I'm an athiest, but I'm generally ok with most religions, like if it was just the buddhism, I'd be fine with it. But the chanting with crystals etc is too out there for me\n\n* Another one that I think is to do with how flighty she is, is her messiness. Everything from her house, to her car, to her phone layout is messy as can be. She occasionally cleans it all out, but she let's it get messy again for several weeks/ months before that happens. 
2	I’m an enfj with an istp partner if that helps!
5	ENFP (M) needing advice on an ISTJ (F)	Taking things slowly with her, I really don't want to mess up things. We've been on 3 dates now, got set up through a mutual however I find it very difficult to read her through texting. We have both accepted the fact that we are terrible at texting so we try to call instead when we can.  I had a 3rd date with her last night, a lovely bonfire on a beach, we did run into a couple of obstacles that had cut the night short and got her stressed, she also had work early morning. Compared to the first two dates we were allot less intimate, maybe this is due to being on a beach? Regardless, she did text to make sure I got back home safely which then I responded to. The one thing I admire about her personality is she is very straight forward, I am currently being left on read. I might double text if she doesn't contact me in the next 24hrs. If she told me that next time we'll do something at my end before I drove back home, the below average night shouldn't be a deal breaker right?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe had work today and may have been exhausted, I know I won't see her until next week. Any pointers or advice for a turbulent ENFP Male? She is more turbulent than me though.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, she struggles to show emotion which I'm fine with, but I suck at leading and don't know if I should try and be dominant from now on if I want to get more intimate, without sex.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLove your Personality type, Thank you for your time!
6	>I am currently being left on read.\n\nDepending on the exact exchange, she may not think it actually requires a response. For example:\n\nHer: I just want to make sure you got home safe.\n\nYou:  Sure did, love muffin. Thanks for checking.\n\nHer: [No response needed]
6	Confusing... Is the issue the being left on read? Because i think you can tell by now ISTJs dont like to shate their emotions and A LOT goes on inside that never gets shared. So sending us a bunch of tects you expect us to respond to, especially with lovey dovey responses, just gets overwhelming. \n\nENFPs get on real well with ISTJs, and ENFPs are really good at reading people, regardless of how much they freely express... So fall back on your natural gifts to navigate this.
3	I (M) dated an ENFP (F) for about 3 months a couple years ago. Sex was amazing but we clashed over everything else. She loved going out, I wanted to stay in. I relied on past experiences to process information whereas she tried to intuit the future which I find absolutely silly.\n\nIf you read literally any post / forum on this combo you’ll note that it’s a very, very hard relationship to maintain. \n\nKeep in mind we like structure, a sense of fair play and being left alone mostly. If she has an issue expect to hear about plainly. \n\nAs always, people all individuals and don’t expect her personality to align perfectly with any description you read online. \n\nGood luck. 
2	ENFP (M) with ISTJ wife here (been 7 years, married for 1). I’ve been seeing a lot more of this combination on Reddit lately, which is interesting because historically I’ve always read that this was a difficult mix to have. I really have to wonder if things like digital communication has changed the dynamic.
2	Coming from an ISTJ female who is pretty good at "being" outgoing, she may be taking the time to recover from the social interaction, it's nothing personal. I spent a lot of last week with my new partner (ENFP) (we also work together) and by Friday I was stressed out and snappy from not having any alone time. I told him I needed Saturday by myself and he was fine with that. He was amazed at the difference in me on Monday, saying that I was happy and responsive again. She may have just "gone into herself" a bit, give her time - it's nothing personal !
1	Don't try to read her, over text or in person. We are extremely literal so there's really nothing to read. We will either tell you or we won't.... And we won't share it right away. She's not going to initiate things or take a dominant role in the relationship. That's just not what we do. But once we know where things are going, we're on board. 
14	Large Group Events	How do y’all feel about going to events or parties where you don’t know anyone well? For me, I only feel comfortable going on trips or to parties where I know or can potentially get along with at least one other person. I always think of putting myself out there but end up being uncomfortable in these situations
30	My immediate thought upon reading the title, before I even opened it, was "No thanks.  I'd rather not."\n\nAfter reading the post, I'm sticking with that position.
8	No.
4	I love going out to concerts and bars and stuff. I don't care if I know anyone or not. I'm not there for them, I'm there for me, I'm there for the music, I'm there for the beer. Everyone else can kiss my ass. Sometimes I talk to ppl all night and usually never talk to them again in my life, and sometimes I sit there with my beer enjoying the music, watching the crowd and having a great time all by myself.\n\nI feel like needing someone to go with me to feel comfortable ultimately trickles down to asking someone permission to go and I'm a grown ass woman whose served her time staying home waiting for someone else to have a good time so I could have one too. Fuck that shit. 
3	I want to. But I feel like I’m not social enough to meet random people and connect with them. \n\nI also prefer to go with groups where I know at least a few ppl. 
2	I can and actually enjoy doing it for work. If it's purely social, which I have to do a lot for my ENFP boyfriend, it's like fucking mental gymnastics :( Hate it!
2	It depends on the certain variables. What kind of event is it, who's going to be there, what time will it begin, what time will people actually arrive, etc. While I'm definitely one that prefers his alone time I'm not opposed to going out occasionally. While some of us may have similar dispositions I don't think everyone here will refuse to go to a large group event. 
1	Normally, I'd go to events/parties if I know at least one other person. However, if I really want to (and that itself is a rarity) I will go to an event/party where I don't know anyone (or anyone well).
1	I fully agree. A minimum of one person that I know/can get to know is required. Like most other people commenting, it depends on my obligations too. If it's a commitment and I know no one then I don't have a choice, otherwise hard pass.
1	I generally don't enjoy large group events, especially if I don't know anyone. I can put myself out there if I know someone at the party or if the party is with people that share similar interests with me. I try to go to events on occasion, but only when I feel like pushing myself a little. 
15	The 7 Work Habits of Highly Effective Introverts	
8	ISTJ dating an INTP	Curious if anyone has any experience dating an INTP. I am an ISTJ female currently seeing an INTP male. 
7	I am married to an INTP male for 2 years, together for 6. Pros are we both like to stay in and relax. Con is he views the world a lot differently than I, but this is also a pro because it has expanded my mind and his too.
7	I am an ISTJ female who has been with my INTP husband for almost 28 years, 24 of those married. I can’t imagine being with anyone else. 
4	The genders are reversed for us, INTP lady here married to my ISTJ guy. It's the best relationship I have ever had. I feel incredibly lucky to wake up with him every day. 
1	INTP male married to ISTJ female, more than ten years of happy and healthy relationship. We have deep conversations and share many interests, we are open-minded and honest with each other, and our love life hasn't shown any signs of decay! \n\nIt's a best romantic match according to socionics model G, where the two types share Ti and Ne. \n\nISTJ's other best match is ISFP. (they share Si and Te) \n\nINTP's other best match is INFJ. (they share Ni and Fe) \n\n
1	I'll be the odd one and say that I did not enjoy my relationship with an INTP. I was going through severe depression and he made my day to day worse by putting me down constantly. He always convinced me that I was the cause of our problems. I get along with INTPs as friends though. 
5	ENTP with ISTJ parent	Im [21] an ENTP with an ISTJ parent that I just dont get 90% of the time. We get into it constantly, and the other parent has to intervene. \n\nToday is a day I dont work or have any play scheduled. So, Im enjoying a relaxing day of nothing. The ISTJ in my life would rather me use this free day to CLEAN. Like wtf man. I cant imagine a thing I would like to do LESS. \n\nThey tend to be condescending and make little remarks that get under my skin. [Truth is, Im better at cleaning than them. Im just cluttery and disorganised. But I keep things sanitary, esp when I clean spaces like the kitchen Im way more thorough than them. Thats why I hate doing it! It takes forever bc I do a good job] \n\nBut to me, on a day I would love to have unstructured time to unwind, they seem irked. And once theyre irked they stay all mad until I grovel bc thats how they are. \n\nAnd I dont understand how their mind works at ALL. Theyre the complete opposite of me. Im not living here much longer, but Im tired of being stressed. \n\nDo any of y'all who get along with ENTPs know how to make up for the differences? How would you explain why this person is that way? Why are they so tightly wound? Is there a way I can communicate I dont want to do the thing without pissing them off???? Is this how a normal ISTJ acts?  \n\nIm just laid back and never hold grudges [So I dont understand why they stay mad at me all day over a brief interaction]. I think things should be done when people want to do them. And cleaning a superficial mess is not a high priority to me, esp in the privacy of my bedroom. I will clean spaces that are public or need sanitised without complaint [unless Im extremely drained]. And my room is currently much cleaner than usual.\n\nTL;DR- my ISTJ parent stresses me out. How do I understand them and reason with them? How do I get them to understand Im not lazy just bc I dont constantly want to be working on tasks?
5	I wouldn't call us wound up... Highly organized, structured, minimalistic, clutter free, and timely, yes. As an ISTJ parent of teenagers, they do often get upset with me because of the same sorts of things. But here's the deal.... Im not raising children, I'm not raising teenagers, I'm raising adults. I'm raising the finished product. Just like cattle farmers don't raise calves, and chicken farmers don't raise chicks. In adulthood, you gotta get up on your days off and do all the shit you didn't have time to do or want to do on your days on. Being and staying organized, keeping your area clean, having few unnecessary things laying around, etc everyday makes taking care of things on your day off take up less time. We aren't good communicators so it may not seem like that's the lesson being instilled here, but in the long run your being taught adulting skills that you will value one day. This also teaches a strong work ethic, which is important to us.\n\nMy 19 yo daughter HATED this stuff... At the time.... And she's so glad I drilled it into her before she moved out. She thanks me regularly whenever she has to deal with someone her age whose parents didn't teach them this stuff.
2	First off, I am sorry you are having this issue. I am sure its frustrating. My younger brother is an ENTP and had the same problem. My dad and I are both ISTJs and my brother often felt like he was being picked on. I think what you have to understand is that ISTJs are very productive. We tend to feel like there's a million things to do and we just tackle our to-do-list all the time. I think it might be hard for your dad to understand why you wouldn't want to use your time the way he does. He may incorrectly viewing you as "lazy" or "unorganized". Of course that doesn't mean you are any of those things. I think he may be unfairly judging you by viewing your actions through his own lense.
2	I relate more to you than your parent. This might be better explained by enneagram than mbti.\n\nSome people just can't stand to see others relax. It might be envy...
2	It's easier to convince someone a clear surface is sanitary than a cluttered surface.\n\nAnd I'm not saying your wrong. I'm expressing what is going through our minds when we hear your side of things. In YOUR house all this is pretty benign. You can clutter and sanitize and not bother anyone else. In YOUR house, that is. Right now, youre in THEIR house and it's effecting their psychological wellbeing.\n
2	I know ppl say any type can get along blah blah blah, but Ive noticed ISTJs and ENTPs constistantly butt heads. \n\nI have a theroy; ISTJs have the potential to be unintentionally calous and cruel, while ENTPs have the potential to be quite knowlingly calous and cruel. So when an ISTJ is being "mean" an ENTP can interpret it as being completely calculated and intentional and a direct attack... And its like 99.99% of the time not. The ISTJ doesnt even realize theyre coming off as a jerk, or maybe theyre just having a bad day or something.\n\nI dont know why, but of all the T types, ENTPs seem to be quite sensitive to this. They take the ISTJ grump behavior the most personal. Just remember, its not personal. And ISTJs can be reasoned with. They are logical and you are logical... I know ENTPs hate doing this for some reason, but: explain yourself. Erase all emotion and explain your position logically. Dont you love debating? Tell your ISTJ parent why you need a day to relax. Make a case for yourself until *they* are satified. Achieve victory. Done.
7	ISTJ’s. What stereotypes are not true for you?	Hey, I am an ENFP guy, and after having read through socionics theory for 5 hours straight (ENFP’s can be quite thorough once you sparked their interest), I discovered ISTJ’s and ENFP’s have a dual relationship, as in most favourable.\n\nNow I was wondering, what are ISTJ actually like, if they are apparantly so compatible to me in theory. What are they like in real life.\n\nI can read all the descriptions, but I’s rather hear what makes you different from those descriptions. \n\nAs an ENFP I can say, for example, that I love sports. Dancing, surfing, sailing, those things are amazing. I also love ‘doing’ things. This is in contrast to the stereotype of lazy too focussed on thoughts. Of course I certainly have that element, but it doesnt define me.\n\nSo my question for you is what makes you you. Are there ISTJ out there who do art, or are really focussed on sports , on looks, social things as opposed to the stereotypical etc etc
32	Being really focused on sports actually *is* a stereotype for an ISTJ.\n\nThe description isn’t too far from the truth.\n\nSome things that are different for me are that I don’t *like* following rules but I can see their importance.  But if it’s something I think is dumb, I either won’t follow it or will do something that should end up on r/maliciouscompliance .\n\nI also am a big procrastinator.  But only to a point that I know I’ll still be able to get the work done.  But I definitely wait until the last minute a lot.
19	I hate working.\n\nIf i never had to work another day in my life and was an unproductive lazyass with no resposibility... i would be sooo happy. I think ive worked enough already to last me TEN lifetimes 😑
7	I'm a pretty straight forward ISTJ. I'm really into roleplaying games like dungeons and dragons, and music. I play 4 instruments, for fun and in bands. I don't know if those aren't ISTJ things, but those are my only outlet for my creativity.
6	- I procrastinate but to the point that I know I'll still be able to get work done with some time spared.\n\n- I do some songwriting (mostly back in HS but some in university). I also write in my journal my thoughts and feelings.\n\n- If I find a rule stupid I will break it. However, when it comes to doing drugs and drinking I do so moderately.
7	\*ISTJs. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMultiples don't get apostrophes. Maybe the stereotype of being a Grammar Nazi isn't true?
5	I'm pretty emotional.  \nI have a strong distrust for authority figures, though I will respect them if they're competent.    \nI draw n stuff.  \nI'm very romantic.    \nI'm significantly goofier than the stereotypes would have you believe. :P 
3	I've played music since I was 8 (it's one of my biggest passions) and find it easy to read and absorb other people's emotions.  The "stoic" ISTJ stereotype only applies to me when I'm not feeling energetic. 
3	ISTJ here, happily married to an ENFP. I can tell you our most important differences: \n\n1. Before making a move or a choice, especially if it's job-related, I need to think of every possible scenario, because I need to picture best- and worst-case scenarios and be prepared in case the latter happens. I become anxious if I don't. My SO just doesn't get my behavior, because unlike me, he chooses to be optimistic and deal with situations as they present themselves. He does plan a little, but not as much as I do.\n\n2. What causes anxiety. For me, anything related to social interactions or people possibly judging me; not being the best at everything I do (this leads to procrastination). For him, toxic environments (he's deeply affected by other ppl fighting in front of him for example); health issues. We calm each other a lot in stressful situations, and usually when I'm anxious, he's not, and vice versa.\n\n3. What we're good at. We're both good at breaking down problems, but he's got creative and practical solutions; I like analyzing more theoretical stuff and finding complex explanations (sometimes just because it's fun). \n\n4. OMG COOKING. We used to fight all the time when we cooked at home, because I just Need To Follow The Recipe (let me rephrase: multiple recipes, which I compare beforehand before choosing according to various criteria), and he just... makes stuff that he hopes will turn out ok (also: likes creating new recipes from picking random stuff from the fridge). \n\n5. I could go on forever...
2	P.s. I am also interested in knowing how to spot ISTJ’s hehe. Would like to do some real life experiments now that I know.
2	Liking reading, but that's probably add
2	My kids call me "extra" all the time. I'm super flamboyant and stuff. Loud hair, loud clothes, loud persona, quiet mouth and body language. I LOVE being out with ppl and going to concerts and bars and stuff, I just do it quietly. I'm super spontaneous and always up for an adventure. But that's my outside of work life. 
2	Not interested in sports. At all.
1	I procrastinate a lot, but like others commenting, it's because I know I can get the job done in a given time so I just put it off. 
1	I’m the listening ear to complainers at work.  They know I’ve been there forever; they know I will listen and not judge; they know I will offer practical advice about the situation if they want me to; they know it will stay between unless I think it needs to go up to the next level (and then I always warn them that I will need to let so-and-so know because it’s important), and they know that I understand their frustrations and the need to just let it out sometimes.  🤷🏼‍♀️ I have no idea how I came to be approachable.    \n\n  “So my question for you is what makes you you”...\n\nI live and breathe routine.  Routines make my life easy because I don’t have to stress about anything...I already know this works, so I’ll just do that.  I work hard and efficiently so that I can be lazy the rest of the time.  I will kill myself at work trying to get things done on time and done correctly, but once I’m on my own time, I’m very laid back.  I’m much harder on myself than I am others.  I don’t really get involved in other people’s situations or care how they live. You do you and just let me do me.  All of these are typical ISTJ qualities, I believe. \n
1	Basically all of them to the point where I stay away from the label in mbti if I can in favour of socionics
1	ISTJ and really wanna be a stay at home mom. All they talk about is how career driven I'm supposed to be and I wish there was more stuff out there for ISTJ women that wasn't just career, wanting to be independent, etc. 
1	I love music and can read it, but like picking up new instruments and learning stuff by ear. I like art, though I don’t care for sports. Love fantasy and RPGs. I’m not religious.  Left-leaning politically. Don’t like traditional gender roles. Great sense of humour (though I’m probably not the best judge of that).\n\nI need my alone time, but make small talk with strangers all the time. I procrastinate with most things, though I’ll always give a great “product” on time. I don’t like change much overall, but will almost always push for change if it means getting something done more efficiently. I work in Information Managament, which really calls to my organizational side, but also requires adapting to frequent change and getting others to let go of “the way they used to do things”. \n\nI don’t like to break rules, but I won’t necessarily follow rules that don’t make sense. Think of it more as a “lawful neutral” personal code. \n\n\nStereotypes that hold true: Don’t like some types of change (especially environmental/physical), love routine, like to plan ahead (and make backup plans), very organized, neat freak, uncomfortable with emotions to a degree (like comforting people), perfectionist, can be hard on myself, can be judgmental of others, hate dishonesty/lack of loyalty
10	How do you communicate emotions (better)?	I have a hard time connecting with people because I seem uninterested like a brick. Other types can convey their emotions very clearly through the way they talk or body language. It's often unnecessary to listen to the exact words because you can see/feel they are passionate or anxious.   \nI can't do that good enough, no matter how hard I try. Stressing words works to a certain degree, but my tone changes just slightly between my most passionate subject and the most boring.   \nPeople often have no idea how I feel about something unless I find words that describe it. But finding those words is so exhausting, takes too long and I'm often misunderstood. It's really frustrating when I actually care a lot and others think I don't.\nEdit: Ok that's exaggerated, but you get what I mean...\n\nDo you know that and what are your tricks to communicate so that others can relate?
4	My best advice would be to parrot their own enthusiasm/can't stand it language back at them.\n\nIf you overhear one of these folks you are dealing with say "God, I absolutely go nuts for Chik-Fil-A Waffle Fries" - you could use the "go nuts" phrase for something you love and they'll understand your passion.\n\nOtherwise you might be using words that have meaning to YOU but not to THEM.\n\nThat would be particularly true for people from different generations.\n\nCan you give a more concrete example?\n\nBecause if you show up in a Star Wars shirt, with a Star Wars phone cover, a Star Wars watch, drinking out of an R2-D2 cup and you say "I'm really into Star Wars" - even if you said it in monotone I think it would be difficult for people to not believe you.
3	I tend to talk a little bit faster and use more adjectives when I'm talking about something interesting to me. I also follow up my statements wit "does that make sense" or something like that, because I know that I don't always communicate well and I want be sure I'm understood, it also gives them a chance to join the conversation (because I forget to include them), or ask for clarification.\n\nOur enthusiasm comes out with active involvement, we aren't really able to fake a convincing bubbly, happy, bouncy personality and that's OK. Leave that to those E people we don't understand, lol. They dont understand us either. 
1	Just be yourself
1	I know we get mis-stereotyped as emotionless robots, but what youre describing here is... extreme. This is beyond an ISTJ quirk
1	I hear what you're saying and I have the same problem where people tend to misunderstand how I'm actually feeling because I'm not expressive enough, I don't have the right words etc.\n\nDon't take this the wrong way but I wonder if you're seeking some sort of validation from the people you're trying to connect with. \n\nWhat I've come to learn (and accept) is that not everyone I meet is going to See Me or be intuitive enough to dig beneath the surface of who I seem to be. And guess what? That is okay. It really is. Because if I base my sense of worth and happiness on other people's ability and/or willingness to validate me, I'm going to be disappointed very often. \n\nAs long as *I* know that I'm not a fraud when it comes to my true feelings about a given topic, I'm good. The people who, for whatever reason, can't recognise that, won't recognise that. The people who can, will. I've learnt to let life surprise me with the latter group of people. You just never know who might show up in your life one day and this person just gets you. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
1	"Emotion status: sad"
3	How can I (20F ENFP) go about asking an ISTJ (22M) whether he has plans to marry me in the future/sees a future with me?	UPDATE: Initially when I asked he said he doesn’t know and doesn’t want to think about this now. But after further asking he said he doesn’t want to give empty promises and wants to take things one step at a time. :) \n\nWe have been together for a little over a year now, and I’ve already met his parents (we’re quite close), and close friends. The reason why I want to ask him this question is because I’m afraid of committing into something that will eventually turn out to be a temporary fling. \n\nWe are young and not financially stable yet (I’m still a student,  he’s currently serving the army which is mandatory for males in our country), but since we have already been together for a year, I want to know whether he has any intentions to marry me in the future someday, be it 5-10 years from now but I’m not sure how to bring it up to him.\n\nHow can I ask him in a serious but non-pressuring way since my ISTJ is not really good at expressing his feelings? \n
12	I concur with asking him directly and plainly. You can always preface it with something like "I'm not trying to pressure you Into anything, I just want to know."
4	Can’t you just ask him point blank? My husband is an ISTJ and we had this conversation like 2 or 3 months into dating. I asked him what his goals were for a romantic relationship, what his values were in terms of things like fidelity, commitment, child-rearing, etc. He took it fine. It was just sort of an orientation conversation, to make sure we agreed about what the best outcome looked like. \n\nAnd as we got more and more serious, we continued to have the conversation, just in deeper ways. Once, my dad told a story about how a former coworker went into a coma or maybe persistent vegetative state, and that it wasn’t clear whether he’d ever recover, and his wife divorced him. I asked my husband what he would do if it had been me in that situation. We disagreed about the morality of the situation and almost broke up over it, because it seemed like we had different opinions about the seriousness of marital commitment. Anyway, we worked it out. \n\nYou should be able to deal with difficult conversations head-on, if your relationship is going to be successful. Just try to address it practically, not emotionally. The goal of the conversation is just to find out if your goals for the future are aligned. 
3	We're straightforward folk here lady.\n\nJust ask him, he'll tell you the truth. It might not be the answer you want, but it'll be honest.
3	You could ask him, but it does seem a little but early to bring up marriage. I (45f)am in a relationship with an ISTJ (38m) and we've been together for over three years. I just recently brought marriage up to him. I just said, "Hey, do you see yourself getting married one day?" And he said, "Sure, when the time is right, I would like to marry you." That was about it. I think asking him point blank would be best. In my experience, my ISTJ prefers direct conversation rather than beating around the bush. 
1	Just ask. Don't drop hints or fish for it. Just sit down and talk. You'll get an answer pretty quickly 
1	I know, for me, I need a direct conversation laying out the terms and conditions of said relationship, almost like a business negotiation. And the relationship definitely does not have to fall on traditional relationship grounds, its whatever makes you both happy. 
1	>UPDATE: Initially when I asked he said he doesn’t know and doesn’t want to think about this now. But after further asking he said he doesn’t want to give empty promises and wants to take things one step at a time. :) \n\nWhen an ISTJ makes a commitment, it is solid beyond solid. This makes so much sense to me. You two have only been together a little over a year. Way too early to be promising to commit  for life IMO.
6	Emotional Intelligence	How are others ISTJ's emotional intelligence? I scored a terrible 57/100 on the Emotional Intelligence 2.0 Talentsmart.com site after reading the book. I knew it would be low but I didn't expect it to be that bad...
5	I have no idea what emotional intelligence actually is, but it sounds like something I would be terrible at. I bought the book a long time ago, but I haven't read it yet. Im still pretty sceptical about the whole thing x)
4	I noticed my empathy went up after I worked exclusively with people. Didnt like it but learned to deal with it and increased my EQ a bit. I dont think we are peoples people per se but we can certainly learn to be.
3	I've always thought of myself as very emotionally intelligent. I think reading a lot, especially at such a young age, contributed to this. But, my dad is also an ISTJ and he is still strengthening his emotional intelligence. \n\nEdit: grammar
1	Hmmmm... I got the book few months ago haven’t read it yet. Gonna have to give it a go and then take a test. \n\nI’ll reply in a year or two 😂😂😂

66	Help me I’m FEELING	
11	I just want to get rid of the strong negative ones. Gotta stay rational.
12	Honestly if someone find the way to do that OR to understand them I wanna know
3	I at least want to get rid of the really strong negative ones. They mess with my rationality.
3	Edgy
5	They take up too much memory
2	Man, I wanna rip the store that forced me to download this crap (I'm on mobile)
2	Am I the only one here who isn't bothered by their emotions? Being rational doesn't mean being a robot. Feelings are great for alerting you to the presence of hidden data points that may affect your decision process and can bring catharsis in difficult situations if you don't let them take over completely. Louis CK had a funny bit about this on Conan
2	I tried that feeling thing once.. I almost died. 
1	Can't find uninstall program. error 402
11	How (bluntly) honest are you?	I’m curious as to where you so called ‘draw the line’ and whether you can give some examples/scenarios.\n\nFor example, if a person you know in prone to crying asks you ‘do you think I’m (insert good quality here)?’ And your answer is no, would you tell them ‘no’ or say ‘you’re a great person yada yada?’ Or do what I do and just remain silent…\n\nAnother example. Would you say something nice to a person, just to validate them if they were fishing for compliments?\n\nHopefully my question makes sense :)\n\nEDIT: Thank you for all the responses, upvotes for all haha
25	I don’t like to lie, but I am conflict adverse so I would probably say no but you have this great quality or if you work on x, y and z, you’ll improve. 
5	I would simply say no, and probably wouldn't tell them what a great person they were (unless it was true). The principle of "if you don't have something nice to say then say nothing at all" keeps me silent in such compliment fishing expeditions. \n\nFor example, I know a hypochondriac who veers the focus of any group discussion into herself and her vague ailments. One day she had a group of ailments that closely mimicked the flu, but she had divided into symptoms of Renards, Fibromyalgia and allergies. I told her I thought she had the flu and nothing more, which sent her into a rage. How dare I simplify her self imposed complexity? \n\nIn most such situations,  I keep my mouth shut, not seeking to dampen others social games. But occasionally I will be fed up with lies of appeasement and blurt out some true statement. In a social group, I will be ostracized,  even though privately each individual will agree with me.\n\nWierd.
5	How blunt I am depends on a variety of factors, including but not limited to: who I'm talking to, what we're talking about, etc.  In general, I only lie when I have no respect for the person I'm talking to, or when I'm avoiding discussing my own private issues and I don't consider them close enough to open up to about.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I'm talking to sensitive people or discussing topics that might hit close to home for some people, I am hyper aware of how I word things.  I don't filter my thoughts or opinions as much as I sugar coat my words, phrasing things in a way that a person might feel less attacked by.  For example, this is from an actual discussion I had with someone:  \n\n\n* Default phrasing: I think you sleep around and pretend you're doing it for your own enjoyment because it allows you to pretend you're in control of the situation when actually you really crave validation and closeness but are afraid of being taken advantage of again.\n* Actual phrasing: Do you ever think that maybe you have casual hookups because you want to feel close to someone but you're afraid of getting hurt?  \n\nIn the case someone asked me if I thought they had a specific quality, I would tell them the really great qualities I see in them, providing specific examples, but I would gently tell them why I don't consider them to have that quality.  I would also add the disqualifier that I could be wrong, but that's just my limited observations.   In general, I try to get my idea across without triggering emotions that would cause someone to either resist or shut down without really hearing my thoughts.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf I know someone is fishing for compliments, I may indulge them depending on how much I like them.  I have a friend who is transitioning and she's very insecure about her appearance and in general is an anxious person, so while sometimes I do find it annoying, I tend to be very generous when she fishes for compliments.  Someone who I might have less esteem for will probably just be ignored in attempts to fish for compliments.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut sometimes I'm blunt.  I did tell my manager I would be job searching if I didn't get a promotion--and I didn't mean it as a threat or anything, it was just matter of fact since in an earlier conversation he'd asked me to please tell him if I ever started looking for other work and we had already been discussing a promotion for some time anyway.  I also met my current SO online, and after about a 2 days of the usual small talk, I told him the topic bored me and I wanted to talk about something deeper and more personal.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn general, if I'm blunt with someone it's either a sign of tremendous respect (the expectation you understand me at my own level and I can drop social niceties) or it's a sign of impatience and disrespect (fuck your feelings, you annoying twat.  Leave me alone already.).   ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯  
3	I prefer to be honest but either state it in a neutral way or add a compliment sandwich. I'm conflict abundant though so I won't say that kind of stuff unless asked a specific question.
2	I'm a hyper sensitive ISTJ with a chronic aversion to conflict so I'm more likely than not to say what someone wants to hear (unless it's completely untrue) and I'm very wary about protecting feelings.
2	I hear the word "blunt" and the word "rude" a lot by my family members. While I am not being rude or blunt. I just call it like I see it. 
2	I would be honest and explain myself on why. Possibly also give my opinion on how they can change. Even though they may cry, I still have to be honest.
2	I told a friend of mine the other day: If you don't want to hear my honest answer, don't ask me a question.
2	I dont have the right to be unkind to someone for no reason, however, I will not lie to someone, especially if they are fishing for compliments. I usually give a neutral non answer if I don't have anything nice to say. If I do have something kind to say I'll tell them without prompting. If someone continues to fish for compliments and I still can't say anything kind, I'll tell them to stop fishing. 
2	I would say "no" if it does not apply to them and give them possible solutions to improve upon it in the example you asked. I prefer to be honest/neutral.
2	I usually don't say something that I think will make someone upset or cry.. If it's a negative thing I try my best to put it in the most polite way possible. However, I don't really find myself in these situations very often. I tend to avoid lying though.
2	I’m honest, but I try to maintain at least some level of tact.
2	Encouraging word is one of my love languages, and I don’t like to hurt peoples feelings, but I also have a hard time lying.\n\nI try to think of how best to position something to them, that will have the best outcome possible.\n\nSo if they ask me a direct question, that has a negative answer, that WILL NOT go over well, I try to go into *constructive* criticism mode. Use a verbal illustration of some kind, liken it to something I or someone I know is going through.\n\nI deal with my dad who is very sensitive, and he will ask my opinion of his art forms a lot (mostly ‘do you like it’), and if I give a 100% honest answer, he usually gets angry (because his feelings are hurt).\n\nSo I ask if it’s okay to tell him what I think, and I will tell him the things I like, and the things I don’t like as gently as possible, and give the reasons why, and tell him stories about how my own creative process works, and stop to ask “does that make sense?” And also gage his emotional state frequently, sometimes I will preface something with “Okay I really am not trying to hurt your feelings at all when I say this...” if I’m afraid something might catch him off guard.\n\nOn the flip side, I’m known to offend people by mistake, when I’m just joking around and cutting up, with people I didn’t realize were that soft. So there’s that.\n\nI guess it’s all about the person, and the situation.
12	Getting an ISTJ to talk is like...	...telling yourself to bang your head repeatedly against metal walls and then desperately trying to break out of a metal cage using just your hands and battling it out with a stubborn and strong bat. Yes, bats because one ISTJ friend of mine is like one. He doesn't talk much and insists on replying with one word answers and it's decreasing my endurance with trying to continue conversation with him. \n\nI'm kind of giving up right now should I? I've been told that when you guys do that you ain't that interested lol
32	I'm a girl, but yes. If I'm interested I can talk a lot, but I am also perfectly happy not talking if I don't want to.
17	I have no middle ground. I either am so interested I cant shut up or I feel like my mind is blank. When my mind goes blank, I feel like if I try to come up with something its disingenuous or I feel like I'm pulling teeth. 
9	If the question is a yes or no question, I will reply with yes or no. If not, I will answer with a short sentence, for efficiency.  I never chat just to chat, I need a problem or a question or else I'll have problems staying invested in the conversation.
10	If he has no interest in having an actual conversation, then he probably never will.
3	Seriously. 
3	I think my dad and I are both ISTJs. When I visit, it's so hard to get a conversation going between us unless there's a third person.
2	Find out about his interests. Like the others on here, I hardly say anything when J answer, it’s always short and to the point. Find out what his interests are. If he sees you as an acquaintance and not a friend yet, you’ll have to poke and prod a bit at his interests to get him to say more, but he’ll definitely pipe up when he gets comfortable. I’m a really quiet person, but when I talk about an interest with a close friend I talk so much I get winded.
2	I like to talk. However, I suck at maintaining conversations at times. Also if I do not know the topic, I will not be able to contribute much.
2	Is this a romantic interest?\n\nAre conversations in person or over texting/social media?\n\nIt kind of just depends for me.\nIf I really don’t care for someone *at all* I will try to stay polite but keep interactions as short as possible. So they stop talking to me. Because I can’t stand them.\n\nOr I’m really busy and they picked the worst possible time to try and shoot the breeze with me. I’ll keep it short and Sweet and maybe even communicate to them that I’m swamped, or in the middle of a project. Then visit with them later.\nI don’t do major interruptions while I’m trying to get things done.\n\nSometimes I’m just really tired and don’t want to *not* talk with them or reply, because that’s rude, but can’t spend an once of extra energy.\n\nOtherwise I’d say I’m fairly talkative.\n\nBe advised though...some people are just crap at texting/social media, regardless of their type.\nSome people are crap at communicating regardless of their type.\nAnd in my experience guys are generally less talkative then girls regardless of their type.\n
1	Talk to him about one of his interests.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLike I'm usually talkative if you bring up music I like or cooking or Geography or something.
1	Lol.. I think I am kind of like your friend when at the workplace.. but I make it obvious when I really don't want to talk.\n\nMy previous boss said I don't reciprocate enough haha. Problem is conversing is kind of like an on-off switch for me, nothing good or meaningful will come out if I'm tired or zoned out.\n\nEdit: ISTJ, that flair is outdated
1	[deleted]
1	Not necessarily, it depends on the topic and the person. 
1	Because it feels I am just saying words if I dont have interest. Its a total waste of time.
1	Gotta talk about something important. When I feel the need to talk I have a handful of ppl I feel comfortable doing that with and if your not on the list, then you'll never get it out of me. I'm not going to talk about surface level bullcrap, like the weather, and I haven't met a comfortable silence I didn't like. Mindless chatter is super annoying and I'm not going to bring up something to you that I don't you to bring up to me. That's not limited to super personal stuff, that also includes insignificant bullcrap. And most things are pretty insignificant. Be willing to have a comfortable silence with him. It's OK it you don't have anything to say. He don't want to hear it anyway. 
1	Sometimes I don't talk... and when my friends text when I'm in that kind of mood I reply because I don't want them to think I'm ignoring them but it's not my usual prep instead it's very responsive to what was said and that's it, to the point. \n\n&#x200B;
1	ISTJs only say what they mean to say and thinks is necessary to say. So they won’t put in fluff in their speech. \n\nIf you want him to communicate more, be direct about it. Like “I noticed that you’ve been giving me short answers. I’m interested in knowing more. Would you be able to share more about xyz?” \n\nISTJs are not great at reading people and will miss cues. So be direct about your needs and wants. They will usually be receptive. 
11	Any ISTJs married or in long term relationships with an ENFP?	If so, what's been the hardest parts of your relationship? The best? I'm a 34(f) enfp who has been married to a (35)m istj for 15 years (together for 17). Just looking for some perspective. For me the worst part is his lack of communication and the best is that we have the same sense of humor and he always can make me laugh. There are so many other things (good and bad) but I want to hear other experiences 
13	As a male ISTJ I've dated several female ENFPs. Drove me crazy, couldn't do it. \nGood luck!
7	ENFP (m) with an ISTJ (f). Together for 7 years and we passed our one year marriage anniversary this August. My wife seems more communicative than most ISTJs in regards to her feelings. We have a good understanding of each other and I don’t believe we have a hardest part, though I now need to work more on myself to be more consistent, organized and on-track. I currently feel like it’s my flaws that bring down our relationship as a whole.
5	Our love languages are also opposite so we've had to spend a lot of time learning to express love differently, as well as communication. I wrote a blog post about our marriage.  \n\nhttp://hotandsourblog.com/2018/03/06/opposites-attract/
3	My ex is an INFP/ENFP. He was very conflict avoidant which made communicating on his end bring our relationship down. lasted almost a decade though. I enjoyed how soft he was, that he was so caring and sympathetic to others - but he ended up relying too much on their acceptance and desire to be liked. It left a bad taste.
2	ISTJ female married to an ENFP male. We really haven't had any complications.   Sometimes he wants a little more freedom to do his own thing which is hard to do when he wants to stay home for that. I'm a stay at home mom so if he's only going between work and home I am not sure how to help him with that. He's gotten much more comfortable with Te as our relationship progressed which has given me the patience for things he does around the house. I've also become more comfortable with his playful nature.   \n\n\nCommunication has always been a big deal for us from the get-go. We don't feel judgement about asking each other the hard questions and we are good about continuing a discussion with more questions or clarifications rather than jumping to a conclusion. 
2	What's happening to make you wonder?\n\nMarried 39 years. I'm the istj. If you (the enfp) are able to talk about money without getting emotional or feeling blamed, your golden. If he is able to manage money long term planning, you'll be okay. He may be handicapped from always living in his little bubble of life in the moment.\n\nAt about 40 years old, she (enfp) started developing istj traits like getting exhausted in social situations. We have become more alike.\n\nOne of our rules early in marriage was if we asked what you are thinking, you couldn't say "I don't know," or "nothing".
