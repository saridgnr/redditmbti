2	Youtuber C.S. Joseph Concludes That Elizabeth Holmes Is ESTJ	
1	Why is that important thread, I mean it sound as if this is a surprise, yet I watched only 5 minutes of her footage and there is 0 surprise about that.
0	Introverted Sensing;	How I use Si.\n{I'm ESTJ so I guess it makes sense I posted this in r/ESTJ }\n\nBy Nora herself\n\n\n   To me, introverted sensing is focusing on inconsistencies, what that means is always focusing on minor details and comparing it to what you know that this object or the thing happening, for example: Lets say I was talking to a person, I'm already making a pattern and memorizing how they are talking, and when I learn more about this person, I sort of have a map in mind, so sooner or later, I start noticing any inconsistencies or changed in this person's behaviour or look, in how they talk, move, or etc (Especialy since these are traits or factors I generally pay attention to).\n\n   So so far you gathered that it's about looking for inconsistencies and constantly noticing minor details, but what about my memory? Well I'd say memory is not that relelvant to Si, but it's very common they have a good memory. I can still remember many of my dreams of many years ago in great details, I can still recall the feeling of foods on my tongue that I've tried years ago, I can recall lots of moments and feelings that I perish and loved within that moment, which is why I'd be happy to experience many types of moments and can often live in the past because I can suffer certain nostalgia for certain sensations or emotions.\n\n   I'm pretty stubborn and kind of hate change too, mainly the political or sociological one, for example how the word nigga (at least in MY AREA) suddenly became offensive. I strongly state that I don't care what you suddenly find offensive (disclaimer I don't swear much anyways though), you loser were using this word all your life and I will not change just because you suddenly became a pussy. Same goes to most SJW related topics.\n\n   Something that I do not find relatable about most Si users that they're really good or useful for is how they care about wisdom, or learning from past mistakes, I'm too impulsive and don't really care to "analyse" or "think about" my past, like yeah I know shit happened, but who cares, I want to experience and do this thing right now, and whatever happens happens, I can fix it anyways and it won't probably be my fault anyways.\n\n  Oh and I easily notice it when people look different too, even if it's a minor change.\n\n     Written with much love and greatness,\n       Nora
4	Holy shit, Nora. Get over over yourself.  
5	This post was good and informative till the 3rd paragraph, at that point you sound very idiotic and uneducated.\n\nThe word nigga is offensive due to history of whites saying it on racist terms and implications to blacks. Get over your self and off your high horse, not everyone is pussy people just have respect.
1	>I strongly state that I don't care what you suddenly find offensive, you losers were using this word all your life and I will not change just because you suddenly became a pussy. Same goes to most SJW related topics.\n\nHAA GAY!!!! üòÇ ü§î
-2	Woah, you're on here!  Hi dude!
5	When was the first time you realized you loved someone and how did you know?	
3	When words failed me.
2	I'm generally over confident and rather loud, when I was first in love, I got awkward as hell, I gave myself zero attention and made sure the girl I loved was my top priority. I actually felt jealousy whenever she didn't talk to me (I shrugged it off though bc we all have a social life and I can't be too possessive).\n\nI was 17, our relationship could've lasted years, I had no issue in sharing a future with her, especially since we didn't really have any conflicts. (I was only uncomfortable by her over display of affection which overwhelmed me bc I didn't know how to act or deal w it).\n\nAnyways, she cheated on me which my lame ass shrugged off bc I kinda expected it as it was a common behavioral pattern from her.
2	lol. "love." It's so frggn frustrating and headache inducing when I feel like I'm not in control of my feelings, especially when they seem so illogical. That's when I knew I was in love. I was like how is it possible to love this seemingly unspecial person and yet they're so freaking special to me and they're presence brings me so much unexplainable joy and happiness. We're still dating and plan on being each others forevers lol.  
1	just wondering how ESTJs would respond to this	[u/throwaway3n1p](https://www.reddit.com/u/throwaway3n1p) and I are currently working on gathering answers for how thought processes work in different MBTI types. This is just out of curiosity, not an attempt to stalk you according to how you think of grave crimes. All replies are appreciated!\n\nIf we count judgments of *moral obligation* out of the equation, \n\nQuestion 1: How is murder logically fine?\n\nQuestion 2: How is murder logically wrong?\n\nNOTE: Feel free to write down whatever thought you have, whether it is emotional or just plain retarded.
4	I'm estj and these set of questions bother me :(
4	According to Wikipedia:  \n\n>Murder is the unlawful killing of another human without justification or valid excuse, especially the unlawful killing of another human being with malice aforethought.\n\nWe take this as our premise.\n\nSince the act of murder lacks justification we can conclude, that murder is per definition unreasonable. If there was a reason to kill someone, there also would be a  justification or  valid excuse to do so. Logic is systematized reason, therefore  all murder is illogical.
3	This does not seem very scientific. 
1	Survey on Flirting behaviors and personality	Hey I am a doctoral Student at a University in the South. I am studying flirtation behaviors, specifically trying to catalog specific flirting behaviors taken from several experimental studies. I was wondering if I could post to this community as it seems relevant to my topic. Thank you in advance for taking the time to take the survey there is an opportunity to win a gift card if the entire survey is completed. You can back out at any time.\n\nHere is the link to the survey\n\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JMQP5PJ
1	Describe your experience with the Te/Ne loops, or Fi grip	
0	ENTJ or ESTJ?	Hi everyone, I posted this on the ENTJ forum and some come up with the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãESTJ and I would like your opinion\nMy test results are ENTJ, in some ENTJ with Loop (Te/Se).\nWe know that the tests are not completely reliable so I have studied the various functions, I have made my own idea and now I write here to get some confirmation.\nI am 23 years old, I did Scientific High School because as a child I wanted to be a doctor, but after seeing that the hospital is not my environment, probably lack of empathy, I opted for Business Studies.\nI have made this choice because I am interested in the "position of control and power", have more knowledge because I am mainly interested in starting my own business, or, if it goes wrong, being hired to play a senior role (if you have thought of the CEO congratulations you‚Äôre right). \nAlways aim to have a main role in a group, organize, say what to do and I can‚Äôt stand that others are too relaxed, slow or don‚Äôt take things seriously, but at the same time I also know how to be humorous to ingratiate them.\nI tend to be among the most organized and I want things to be done with principle.\nPrinciple that often turns out to be my point of view in fact I tend to do things ‚Äúon my way‚Äù.\nYes, I‚Äòve been defined arrogant or as a "I do everything" or "what I say is law", and I don‚Äôt like others told me what to do.\nDespite this I like to discuss ideas and theories, but I always tend to the pragmatic side of the thing and hardly change my mind if I'm not totally convinced.\nA black or white situation.\nI am quite "future oriented ", but at the same time I‚Äôm interested in the present moment and act for what I want.\nI make decisions quickly, but if it‚Äôs very important, I prefer to have as much information as possible.\nI‚Äôve been called selfish, unable to put myself in others shoes, I'm not good with my emotions or those of others, but I'm ready to help when you really need, even without being asked.\nWhat makes me doubt I really am an ENTJ?\nThe procrastination in the study: I ‚Äã‚Äãhave always done and I continue to do it at the University.
8	ESTJ or EXTJ isn't just about control and power. Honestly, that's not really connected to us at all. \n\nThe only thing I might get from your post is that you are Enneagram 8. But you could be ESTP for that matter. \n\nWanting a controlled environment is not the same as wanting control over every single person in our lives. \n\nESTJs aren't really the type of people who want to rise to the top and be in control. We like being in charge because we often times see ourselves as strong problem solvers. We are good at planning ahead and calculating different outcomes and how to respond to each of them. \n\nESTJs are commonly found in middle management. We don't want to oversee people, we want to work in the middle with them. It's not that an ESTJ wouldn't end up as a CEO, it's just not likely. A lot of ESTJs are okay with being somewhere in the middle. They work really well on teams, they just might prefer a management position so they have some control and say in how things are done. \n\nYou came to us describing yourself and the only thing any of us are getting from what was written is that you're someone who likes to be in control and have power. That's all you seem to want in life. There is so much more to ESTJs, and all personalities for that matter.\n\nThere are people who want control and power, and people who want to be leaders. One of them is respected and the other isn't. One of them is earned and the other is often times taken. \n\n\n\n
2	In my experience, ENTJ have a common style of conversation where they will have difficulty balancing conversation with other people. If an ENTJ starts talking, it's very normal for me as an ESTJ to only get in an ok when appropriate, but not my own thoughts. They'll often change topics multiple times and we won't return to the original discussion too.\n\nIf I need to leave, I'll have to interrupt. They'll acknowledge but if they start talking again, they'll keep going until I leave.\n\nI think that the actual problem is that they have trouble closing off their thoughts. This is especially annoying to ESTJs as we want other people to listen to our views too and are very conscious about using time efficiently and stating our thoughts clearly and succinctly.\n\nOverall, they are still good friends and I just realize that it's a personality conflict and not something personal between us.
1	Try carefully reading through socionics profiles and seeing which ones you identify with. These are more detailed than MBTI ones which makes it easier to figure out your type.    \n[ESTJ by Gulenko](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=LSE_Profile_by_Gulenko) | [ESTJ by Stratiyevskaya](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/42480) | [ESTJ subtypes](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/7546-LSE-ESTj-Subtypes-discussion-and-examples?p=139868&viewfull=1#post139868)   \n[ENTJ by Gulenko](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=LIE_Profile_by_Gulenko) | [ENTJ by Stratiyevskaya](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/42486) | [ENTJ subtypes](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/46746-LIE-ENTj-subtypes?p=138234&viewfull=1#post138234)    \n

4	I get annoyed when food bloggers/reviewers do not include dish prices. Is that ESTJ related?	Hi,\n\nWhenever I am reading review of the restaurant (tripadvisor for example), I get annoyed when a person describes the dish, but does not mention the price of it. To me it is absolutely crucial information and I do not understand how it would not be for anyone else.\n\nLet me explain why - you read a review about the dish, see its photos. And in order to decide if that is a good deal (and if you'd consider visiting) you must know the price. Simplified example to get the point - lets say the average price of x dish in the city is 10 euros. So depending on the pricing you would know if it was a good deal (and worth visiting) or not. If it is 15eur, then maybe skip that place, if it is 7 eur - super deal and priority visit.\n\nRestaurant reviews without price mentioning is almost useless to me, because how would you know the value?\n\nCan anyone relate? I am curious if this is something of ESTJ thing, or just me thing (I value everything via price/quality ratio).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPs: I also get a facepalm moment when someone writes "price for two with drinks was X". I am like - wtf, do you know that drinks have various pricing and you di not even mention how many of those you got. It is completely useless information, how can anyone not understand that when they write it.
3	Well, I don't really trust reviews, to begin with. \n\nPeople aren't thorough or detailed about why they gave it 2 stars.\n\n- Didn't like the color (2 stars) That has nothing to do with the product. What about the quality? The fit? \n\n- Ordered the wrong size (1 star) Again, YOUR FAULT. Or when they say they ordered small and they complain it was too tight, like I'm sorry you lack the ability, to be honest about how big you might be. Not trying to sound so negative, but some people just cannot accept they are bigger than they think. \n\n- Didn't know this was part of the jacket (1 start) --- You FAILED to read the description about the \narticle of clothing, that does not warrant you the right to give it one star \n\nAlso, you can agree with a review on Amazon or say you found the review helpful which I find very misleading because all you need is an account, not proof of actually buying the product or knowing anything about it. So you could get a bunch of people agreeing that the product sucks when they have NO knowledge regarding the matter. That's a great way for competitors to come in and ruin reviews. \n\nI just have serious trust issues with reviews because I rarely have issues with items I buy. And having a background in business I know companies will pay people to do reviews, both good and bad. \n\nAnd don't forget Yelp. The most untrustworthy of them all. \n\nSeriously I could go on and on about how much I hate product reviews. Leaving out the price isn't that big of a deal, it's not understanding how to give a fair review that I hate.  
3	I couldn‚Äôt agree more with this post, I‚Äôm all about that price/ quality ratio! 
4	Wanting to read a new book! I‚Äôm going to the library to pick one up today. What books do you ESTJ‚Äôs recommend?	Has anybody read 1984 by George Orwell? Thoughts? 
4	Ender's Game or Replay by Ken Grimwood. Both pander to different ESTJ fantasies.
3	Watership Down, by Richard Adams\nThe plotting, strategy, and struggle are fantastic.\n\nYou won't be able to find them at a library, but The Twelve Kingdoms fantasy series is translated from Japanese and was everything I wanted in terms of character development, world building, and characters. Read it online/ ebook at www.eugenewoodbury.com\n\nThe X-wing series in the Star Wars legacy universe were Reddit favorites from that canon. They're hilarious (the Aaron Allston ones), well plotted, and have great characters.
2	The Dresden filed by Jim Butcher. The first one is called Storm Front. It‚Äôs an urban fantasy about a wizard P.I. In modern Chicago. 
1	The defining decade by Meg Jay was a powerful book for me. Got me out of a rough spot in life \n
1	Educated - Tara Westover\n
1	The last science fiction novel I enjoyed throughout was Old Man's War: The Ghost Brigades. It is the second book in the series, but the first one was good too. 
1	I remember 1984! I had to read it for school
1	I read 1984 IN 1984‚Äìvery dystopian.\nIf you like a bleak future, ‚ÄúBig Brother‚Äù (this is where it‚Äôs from) always watching then read.\nI didn‚Äôt, even though I was in 7th grade I still wouldn‚Äôt recommend/like it now.
0	Hey can you all look through my post history?	so I have lots of posts up there. I don‚Äôt know how many. but people can see what I write and say. I wouldn‚Äôt say I am much different besides maybe being more social and talking to a lot of people in real life.\n\nSo I would really like someone who is an estj to go look through my profile. Do I seem like you or one of you folks?\n\nThanks please explain.\n\nDo you folks think I have fe?
1	Have you considered ESFP? I've read through some of your history and everything seems to point to that.\n\nThis site may be helpful for you [https://www.typeinmind.com/sefi/](https://www.typeinmind.com/sefi/). I've pulled a quote from this site that seems to fit your use of Te quite accurately under the ESFP description demonstrating Te as your 3rd function instead: \n\n"In a lot of cases, Te is the protector function of the SeFi. When one of  their values comes under attack, they rely on a direct, matter-of-fact  Te communication style to defend it. When they feel so strongly about a  subject that they know they must take action on it, they tap into this  part of themselves that is powerful and commanding to take a stand for  that what they believe is right." 
1	I would say you are a feeler for sure, not just based on your comment and post history (which definitely spells out F to me) but, [feelers tend to be religious](https://www.truity.com/blog/religion-and-personality-type) more than thinkers. 
5	I retook the test and went from an ISTP to ESTJ. What are the differences?	
3	Well, I just retook a test and went from ISxJ to ESTJ. Like others have pointed out, it could be a manifestation of taking the tests on a bad day.\n\nDon‚Äôt forget, it‚Äôs near impossible to objectively type yourself. \n\nEdit: Grammar is hard.
2	Pretty sure ISTP is ESTJs shadow stack and vice versa...were super stressed the first time or are you super stressed now?
2	Yeah, it‚Äôs the shadow stack.\n\nMassive differences.\n\n\nAre you more process over outcome or do you care about your outcome more?\n\nHow many goals do you set and how many do you really actually complete and accomplish?\n\n\nDo you have a winning urge? Do you care to win all the time?\n\n\nHow good is your memory?\n\nAre you attracted to environmental details? Do you tend to notice many details in your environment?\n\n\nDo you use comparative type of languages. This is like that, this isn‚Äôt like that?\n\n\nWhat is your leadership style. Do you like to lead groups and are you a good leader?
2	What is your sense of humor like? ESTJs like dry humor, understatement, wit, puns, and subtlety.\n\nWhat characters do you like and what personalities do they have?\n\nIn a debate, ESTJs focus on understanding the other person. They're usually looking for a logical contradiction that even their opponent will recognize.
1	same. made a program that has 70 questions from the kiersy temperament sorter scale II, and twice, i got estj, other tests claimed istp, and istj (once). unless i fucked up somewhere
6	Opinions on Conservatism/Right-Wing Politics	I've seen a hypothesis that SJs, more than any other type, is prone to take conservative/right-wing views in various degrees of intensity more than any other political world view, and I want to test it out in the real world of ESTJs (i.e. all of you). What do all of you think about the usefulness/validity/desirability of any of the varieties of conservative thought out there?
11	I‚Äôm about as far from conservative/right wing as you can get sooooo
11	I‚Äôm no expert on the matter, but I believe that ESTJ‚Äôs are commonly mistaken as rigid due to our auxiliary Si. It‚Äôs viewed as something that clings to ‚Äútraditional views.‚Äù Having said that, I personally believe that most other types are overlooking the way ESTJ‚Äôs use it.\n\n\nFrom what I know about myself, I‚Äôm by no means Conservative or Right-Wing on most issues, with the exception of guns and balancing the budget. I believe my Si is more a tool that says ‚ÄúHey, this works and it‚Äôs proven. So, why change it? \n\n\nThe flip side of that: I see things that don‚Äôt work, for example, privatized healthcare and see that single-payer and multi-payer systems in other developed nations works in reducing costs, covering more people and increasing access across the board. \n\n\nI don‚Äôt cling to tradition for the sake of thing not changing. Instead, I cling to proven solutions and struggle to change if I believe it to be unnecessary. Hope this helps. Feel free to ask me any questions.\n\n\nSorry if that was long-winded.
4	That's a very broad question. However as for me I am very conservative by my country's standards. And I definitely connect that with my SJ-personality. I am pretty earth bound and find most left wing policies to be rooted in utopianism. I also trust my own judgement very much, which I guess count's for the "very" part. I like hierarchies, strong morals and authority and would like to see more of that, not less.  
3	Personally, I see myself as a moderate. \n\nThat said, I actually sympathize with the philosophical aspect of conservatism, as in "don't fix what is not broken", "reformation instead of revolution", "change? yes, but just one step after another", "Power should be decentralized and decisions need to be constitutional", etc.\n\nI can't stand most right wingers though. From my point of view, they want to experiment with the system just as much as the left wingers do. Forcing their unworldly ideologies upon everyone of us.
2	I wouldn't consider myself right wing or conservative. I consider myself moderate and somewhat traditional, especially within my own party (registered Democrat). I'm not against change, but I do place value on how things have traditionally worked and advocate for moderate reforms vs. radical change.\n\nFor example, I'm not into overhauling things such as the electoral college, a complete ban on the 2A, or handing out "free" things like college education. To the latter, I'm over this pro-socialism wave (and I am a Democrat millennial) which ties back to my ESTJ personality of believing that hard work will get you far and you should work for what you earn.\n\nI think there's definitely validity in tradition but I also think progress can be good, in moderate steps with attainable goals. I don't believe in overhauling the system that's worked since inception, but I believe there's lots of areas to be better in. I should add that I work in lobbying so I work a lot with both Ds and Rs which definitely contributes to my "moderate" views and willingness to be bipartisan on things.
1	Yes
1	ESTJ values tradition, things that should be that way because of tradition etc. So they would rarely be "progressive".\n\nAlso they value logic, facts more than average (as some left wing policies are objectively anti logic).
1	Okay yes it‚Äôs the si part si is not actually rigid but it‚Äôs seen as that way because no one really knows or understand si. I am far from rigid just common sensical and pragmatic. I may go for the old or something I am familiar at first but I can change. If I change I can become scattered but I will do it. I will answer your question, but I‚Äôll give you a real life example.\n\nI was going downtown today and I assumed it was opened. I was going to go there because I‚Äôve ordered from there and it was good. So the familiar. I was half way there and took a look. They were no longer in business. Okay now what? I was taking buses. So I looked up lunch spots. And then thought about it, hmmm. I don‚Äôt really want mexican today. I wasn‚Äôt opposed to it. I was going to go to a vegan place at first so I looked up another one. And how to get there. On the process I got off and on a total of 4 buses. Three changes. Because si no longer works I have to use nae. I am okay but not the best at it. I got off and on really quickly at consecutive stops all of the buses stopped at all three stops so I was good actually. But i ended up going to a vegan place. Not a big deal I didn‚Äôt go to my first choice of restaurant. I am often like that there is a default but if that default does not work I am okay and sometimes I will try other stuff if recommended when I feel up to it. Some times more some times less. I get use to new environments really quickly. After I tell you what I am going to tell you maybe you‚Äôll be surprised by my lunch option.\n\nI also don‚Äôt want you to generalize. STJs are widely distributed I don‚Äôt think all of us are one party or another. I also know a conservative ENTJ and she knows ENTJs who are on all sorts of stances. So yeah. Also s types doesn‚Äôt mean conservative and neither does the for si aux or dom types. I‚Äôve actually seen more liberal xstjs on here or xsfjs and it‚Äôs not uniform. I‚Äôve also seen all types of religions for xstj and xsfjs.\n\nPersonally though. I am super conservativve, very much so yes. I am an american conservative. I am closer to tea party though. I am a conservative Christian too. Some people would call me a fundamentalist. I subscribe to right winged ideals in the government. I think for one that prayer should be still in schools. We do it in congress. I support trump. My candidate of choice was CRuz who‚Äôs actually NOT ESTJ he‚Äôs ENTJ. I liked him for his ideas though and I hope he‚Äôd run again. I am a political science major. I am now in contact with the trump campaign in Los Angeles county where I live. Yes a really blue area. I hope to volunteer with them. I am working with a conservative woman who‚Äôs running for senate seat here. I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs ESTJ. Hahaha! I am an extremely outspoken conservative.\n\nPlease remember it‚Äôs only some of us.
6	What are some qualities you look for in a partner?	
3	The qualities I look for in a person heavily depends on the path I'll take in the future. My path meaning goals, plans, circumstances, etc. After all, I want someone who I could live with, someone who won't heavily disagree or interfere with the structure of my life.\n\nMy opinion is not to represent all ESTJs since MBTI is just a description of thought process (cognitive functions), not too much about personality. Though I'm sure that if we gather enough answers from here then put them all together, we can find the main traits or general qualities most ESTJs look for.\n\nI will also add that the biological or psychological needs differ for each both sexes and three sexualities. (Anyone who said there are more genders or sexualities is a moron)\n\nAnyways, here are the qualities that I look for:\n\n-I want my partner to be interesting, knowledgeable, and clear about her beliefs \n\n-I want my partner to be fully open to me, as that's a responsibility if you're in a relationship\n\n-Too emotional or sensitive people piss me off, but so do emotionless people with no character. I like a balance\n\n- I'm actually really loyal and supportive, and I fully expect the same from my partner, a relationship to me is considered a trial for a bigger purpose aka marriage, and it's important to always be available for each other no matter what\n\n- Honestly as a quality is a MUST\n\n-I get bored very easily, I'd love for my partner to be very outgoing and exciting yet predictable or at least tells me what she's about to do. I dislike ambiguity and not knowing what to expect.\n\n-On top of everything, I just want my girl to be reasonable, factual, and mostly relaxed yet fun to be with
2	I don‚Äôt really look for certain qualities/have a long checklist-I feel like it‚Äôs kinda a package deal-no one can be perfect. But bottom line for friends and people I‚Äôm dating-honest and loyal. \n\nAs for SO, I‚Äôd say I have a ‚Äòtype‚Äô that I usually go for-stable, down to earth, reliable (routine-based/predictable), reserved-if we‚Äôre talking about MBTI, ISxJ-current crush is an ISFJ if that helps üòä
3	How do you view other estjs?	Do you feel that the general hate you receive from the mbti community is warranted based on your interactions with other estjs? 
7	We receive a lot of hate, but I think I am surrounded by an amazing family and awesome friends. If people hate me, I am oblivious to it. \n\nMy dad is ESTJ and he is the one person I hold the most respect for. He has always been a good dad. Worked extremely hard for the family, and did what needed to be done. But no matter how hard he was working, he made it to all 4 kids sporting events. He made a point to show up. He even helped and worked as coaches or volunteered for any events. He wanted to be as involved as possible and now he has 4 kids who might struggle at times, but they know they can count on their dad for anything. \n\nWe lived in the country and any time it snowed he would take his tractor and plow our driveway and every single neighbor within a half a mile.  Every weekend he was helping his dad or siblings with any help they needed. He is someone who gives his time an never complained, it's just what he loved doing. \n\nPeople just don't dislike my dad, and if they do, they still know how good of a man he is so their hate doesn't really last or they keep their mouths shut.  He works extremely hard at every job he has, if there's one person who could get a good recommendation from any previous job, it's my dad. \n\nMy dad worked as a garbage man for a family business and their son was awful. He would scream and yell and make mistakes and refused to take the blame. My dad loved the job but he knew it was time to go. He planned it out and he told them if your son lashes out one more time I'm leaving. And the son went bonkers so my dad left. My dad put so much energy and time into that job and was always getting them business. He helped them so much that when he quit everyone else cut ties with the business too. They figured if my dad of all people quit, there was a good reason and they weren't going to support the business anymore. And the business went under shortly after. \n\nMy dad has spent his entire life building his reputation, which is exactly what his father did, who I think was XSTJ as well. So he saw the example and followed it. And that's what I want to do. \n\nESTJs are amazing people, so fuck what anyone says. \n\nUnhealthy types exist in every kind, and if you want to judge an entire group it says more about you than them anyways. 
4	I think (mostly) everyone on this subreddit is pretty cool, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve met another ESTJ is real life tho. I can‚Äôt really make a judgement, but I think I could be friends with another ESTJ, but not live with or date one :) \n\nThere‚Äôs always going to be unhealthy ESTJs, just like every in every type-so I understand if people have a bias against ESTJ due to past experiences. If you don‚Äôt want to be friends with me, why would I want to be friends with you? 
2	I don‚Äôt have issues with most of the people here. I know another eSTJ in real life. We‚Äôre both really political and we both love each other. I like the guy a lot. I mean if you push his boundaries. Obviously. Yeah. He‚Äôs probably not going to be likable but most people like him, most people don‚Äôt push his boundaries. They are very reasonable.\n\nHe‚Äôs my professor and serve as a city counselman. He was the mayor at one point.\n\nSo I think both of us are wildly loved in our communities. Just the opposite of the descriptions. We both know everyone and lots of people.
2	She recognized me even before I was familiar to the MBTI. My 7th grade teacher would always tell me that I am very similar to her. Many years later --after I took the MBTI test, studied the cognitive functions and concluded I was an ESTJ-- I asked her what her type was, and she said she's an ESTJ! LOL\n\nI love her and respect her. I still contact her to this day. She's very down-to-earth and extremely organized (which I LOVE). I remember when we'd have class trips, she would give everybody a task (a detailed one) and the plans would come together really well. She was really caring too, made us write down our birthdays on the class calendar and would write a note for each of us on everyone's birthdays. When I consult her of personal issues/problems, she'd always speak the truth, very honest & direct. \n\nShe's an healthy ESTJ, and I'd consider myself as a healthy one too. We got along well :-) 
2	ENTP and ESTJ as friends?	Hey it‚Äôs that ENTP again ... this is kind of a follow up on the other post about understanding ESTJ on a personal level.\nIt‚Äôs almost been 24 hours since I posted that and my ESTJ friend just acted out of character ... like shit.\nI‚Äôve always had difficulties with my friend, we initially bonded over interests, aspirations and morals and I always found her reactions amusing. I‚Äôm very assertive, my other friend is aggressive and she is quite passive. We usually hang out as a trio. But I always found my ESTJ friend quite insensitive and lacks the ability to acknowledge other people‚Äôs efforts and sacrifices for her. That was usually our main conflict, her not putting in the same effort as we were, she‚Äôs very oblivious to the fact that we care about her but I don‚Äôt think she realises our efforts. She doesn‚Äôt notice things until they come up. I‚Äôve always admired her work ethic although she is not academically smart and tries to play it off as if she doesn‚Äôt study or works as hard and we‚Äôre similar in the way we don‚Äôt express our feelings a lot and look for effective and rational solutions. Everything I said up until this point in normal behaviour.\n\nThe problem is she got a boyfriend. I‚Äôve discovered that TODAY. She‚Äôs been dating him for A MONTH. Now I won‚Äôt lie but I do feel betrayed at the fact I was not worthy enough to know from the start, and she told this friend that I don‚Äôt know that well before me. She is my best friend but once I found this out I was questioning if she thought the same, but I didn‚Äôt express my anger to her because I needed to collect my thoughts and I needed to be sane for her to listen to me, my other friend found out before me. THIS IS A VERY LONG STORY.  If you want to know the full story feel free to message me. But in summary she used my other friend for herself disregarding my other friend‚Äôs feelings and efforts, displaying no remorse for my other friend. She used her for her boyfriend who doesn‚Äôt even treat her right, and has a toxic relationship. I always thought she was rational but she is a complete slave to her emotions when her boyfriend only shows lust.\n\nMy friend (Not the ESTJ) and I are very disappointed with her and she is so blind that she doesn‚Äôt see it. She thinks that everything is okay between us. My other friend believes we shouldn‚Äôt openly express our feelings to her until the time is right, but I feel like scolding her right now because I always kept it in when she doesn‚Äôt acknowledge us but she crossed the line with this one.\n\nTo clarify, I do not hate her at all and have no interest in cutting her off from my life. I‚Äôm just irritated and frustrated that I always have to point something out for her to realise. \n\nI‚Äôd like to know your thoughts. \n\nAs a bonus, I feel like I said so many negative things about her that I‚Äôm going to talk shit about myself to kind of balance it out, I am cold and rude and I purposely say things to incite a reaction, I take pranks to far and laughed when I discovered she had a boyfriend because I didn‚Äôt think it was possible that someone would want to be with her. \n\n\n
3	I think you ought to stop relying too much on this personality thing. Remember that this isn‚Äôt a perfect science. Every person is an individual and while some people may share *similar* traits, they can and will act under their own steam. No one is a perfect image of their personality category. \n\nThat being said, it sounds like some high school drama that you‚Äôre dealing with. And I‚Äôm not trying to down-size that, it really really sucks to go through it. It‚Äôs good that you took the time to think before talking to your friend. But you may want to think from their point of view. Despite what it may seem, it might not have anything to do with you. \n\nTalking to your friend and expressing how you felt in a NON-ACCUSATORY way would be a good option. And remember, any personality can get along with one another. There are so many other factors that go into it. I‚Äôm an ESTJ and my best friend‚Äôs an INFJ. Just as an example. 
3	Okay, I'm going to give you a different perspective. \n\nI cannot tell you how many guys I've been interested in and got all excited only for it to end in a few weeks making me feel like a dumbass. So I might tell casual friends but I won't tell my closest friends because I don't want to get excited about something that isn't very serious. \n\nI also think my efforts go unnoticed ALL THE TIME. I'm actually having roommate problems right now because no one thinks I do anything around here. And I purchased half the house when I moved in because no one wanted to contribute anything. So I took everything I purchased back. And I can easily live in my own space without sharing, I was only sharing and helping out because I thought it would be a nice thing to do. And now they are all flipping their shit because we don't have dishes, trash cans, towels, toilet paper...etc. And I couldn't care less. You want to be ungrateful and bitch, go right ahead but don't ask for any favors in the future, because the answer is no. \n\nSometimes you need to take a step back and try and see what other people do. Because we can easily see things from our own perspectives and it looks like people don't care, but they do, they just care in different ways. \n\nI actually have an ESTJ dad. And he fills up our gas tanks when we visit home and checks our oil. He does so much to help other people out and never asks for anything in return. He sees it as his duty and that's how he shows people he loves them. But is he going to sit and talk about feelings with you? No. Is he going to comfort you when you're sad? No. Because it's not his strength and instead of getting mad at him for what he can't do, I thank him for what he can. \n\nAnd one last thing. I am a fucking moron at reading peoples emotions and problems. Unless you say it, I just won't figure it out. And when people lash out at me for not figuring stuff like that out, I get so angry and because you couldn't communicate to me the problem I have a hard time feeling bad for what happened. Lashing out at me for something that happened 3 months ago isn't' going to get my sympathy. You suck at communicating and expect others to just figure shit out like we're all capable of reading minds. \n\nBut ESTJs aren't perfect people and we can really suck at times. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
1	How do you know she‚Äôs even an ESTJ?\n\n\nYeah, I would be kind of perplexed myself, I usually tell those I know well, and if I didn‚Äôt. I simply forget and it‚Äôs like oh sorry and there‚Äôs a reason, didn‚Äôt get to you too busy. And I mean it. If you see the work I do you‚Äôll know hahaha! I am now getting more. Hahaha!
1	I'm not an ESTJ. I'm an ENTJ female who's been around the block more than a few times with toxic people and friends' relationship drama with toxic people. \n\nIf I'm reading between the lines correctly, your ESTJ friend is in a very bad situation with this guy. A big red flag to me is that she's saying how much she *loves* this guy even though it's only been a month. Her secretiveness about the relationship is another huge red flag. That's really not a good sign. \n\nFrom my experiences with situations like this, you won't be able to talk her out of it or make her "see reason". \n\nHer bad behavior is also not about you. I know it feels personal and I know from experience how much that sucks, but it's not. She's all wrapped up in this, she can't really see anything or anyone else right now. Her perspective is skewed and she's not going to be capable of having a rational discussion about this for awhile if I'm seeing this situation accurately, though of course I don't have all of the information. \n\nYou and your other friend are taking the correct approach by not confronting her. It will *not end well* if you do that. I cannot stress that fact enough. \n\nIf you want to message me about this privately you're more than welcome to. This really sucks, I've been in this kind of predicament before. It's not fun. 
1	Let me explain a bit about ESTJ dating.\n\nWe often leave relationship status ambiguous for a while, especially if we're talking to INFPs. INFPs seem to be especially cautious about dating. Meanwhile, we're comfortable just figuring each other out for a while and not declaring things a date.\n\nI've known several friends who hung out for several years and eventually decided to just make it official and start dating.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSimilarly, ESTJs like stability and don't like having to update people on things like "we just started dating!" One week later, we break up and now we have to update all of those people and it feels silly. We'd be much more comfortable talking about people that we've gone out on dates or are interested in than that we just started dating.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother issue is that we get concerned what other romantic interests we have might think if we took someone else out on a date.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinally, we often separate romantic interest from specific questions about the relationship. These questions include things like:\n\n"I have kids and she's indicated 2 years ago that she doesn't want to deal with that. Would she make an exception for me?"
1	My best friend (honestly best friend is not an adequate word, she's my soulmate lol) is an ENTP and we always get along. If I didn't tell her something / if she didn't tell me something like that, maybe we'd both be a little disappointed, but we'd express it to each other directly (i.e.: "why didn't you tell me? :( but I'm happy for you! blah blah etc) and get over it right away lol. We know that things happen and we can't always update each other right away. I think we have that basic trust that we'll never betray/hide something from each other on purpose. But also, I don't think I'd not tell my best friend such news for a month...\n\nI also agree that it might not be a personality thing. Altho my soulmate's ENTP and ESTJ, and our interests aren't exactly the same, we grew up in very very similar backgrounds (similar family dynamic, socioeconomic status, etc). Sorry if this didn't help, but nah, I don't think it's a personality thing. 
1	ESTJs are in benefit relations with ENTPs where ESTJ is the benefactor to ENTP, so they will always slightly dismiss you as being less important to them. This relationship type is very common as friendship and for making acquaintances, and fairly common among married couples, even though there is always slight dissatisfaction present. It's described being similar to older sibling (benefactor-ESTJ) - younger sibling (beneficiary-ENTP) kind of relation. If you want to read more about it see: [**MBTI types matches for ENTPs**](https://www.personalitycafe.com/entp-articles/281-love-types-entp-11.html#post10020698) and [**MBTI type matches for ESTJs**](https://www.personalitycafe.com/estj-articles/283-love-types-estj-3.html#post2423173)

1	Counterphobic 6 (easily mistyped by others as 3 or 8) but that basic motivation of safety/comfort and providing it for others is DEFINITELY still the core...\nalso with the in group/out group stuff and the admiration for what we think is ‚Äúlegitimate‚Äù authority/structure while completely devaluing/ignoring what we think is ‚Äúillegitimate‚Äù or ‚Äúunnecessary‚Äù authority/structure, I‚Äôm surprised there aren‚Äôt more ESTJ counterphobic 6s.
1	I am 3w4. :)
1	3w2
4	Wanting know ESTJ on a personal level	Hey it's your mortal enemy, an ENTP.\nI've been researching about this type because I'm curious to see if it really matches with my friend.\nBut most of the description detail how an ESTJ is professionally. But I'd like to know how they are in their personal lives.\nThe good and the bad.
10	My husband is ESTJ - maybe this will be helpful from another perspective? \n\nHe‚Äôs outgoing and will talk to anyone and everyone but mainly because he really receives a lot of assurance from people liking him. However he doesn‚Äôt love people flat out. You have to fit his particular requirements for him to bring you into his inner circle. Once you are his person, however, he is incredibly loyal and protective of you. \n\nHe is very fact based, to the point, and sometimes lacks empathy when the situation doesn‚Äôt relate to him, or is illogical. \n\nHe is very regimented which means he‚Äôs extraordinarily reliable, however on the downside, inflexible. \n\nPerhaps it‚Äôs just him, but he‚Äôs incredibly coachable. You have to be someone he respects or loves but he will take it heart and immediately start applying that feedback.\n\nI‚Äôm an ESFP - I think we balance each other really well. I think our shared E&S means we perceive the world the same and have the same kind of language but I have more of a free heart-driven approach vs his scheduled head-driven approach. It‚Äôs a wonderful way for us to bring both sides to the world and meet in the middle.
6	Outside of work and school I pretty much keep to myself. I like spending time alone and don't want to be all that active. Which has led me to have quite a few introverted friends. I'm actually best friends with 3 INFPs. I honestly don't know how I keep finding them, but I'm just so drawn to them and I feel like we really click. One was from my a job, one was my roommate and the other I met in class. \n\nThis might sound a little weird, but I don't like sharing my friends. I want time alone with them. If they have a hobby or favorite activity, I'd rather make it more personal for them. Instead of getting a bunch of friends together, I'll find time to hang with them alone. I do have friends I hang within groups, and I enjoy that time, but one-on-one is what I prefer. And I think that's why I get along so well with introverts. \n\nI also really care about family. I try and visit when I can, even relatives. I grew up with a big family and we always had gatherings so I know my relatives pretty well, so any chance to catch up and meet them, I make the time. \n\nI care about work and school a lot and can seem very serious at times, which has rubbed others the wrong way. But I promise, the second I clock out, I'm no longer on work mode. Work stays at work, and I am really good at separating my work life from my personal life.  \n\nMy weak point is I sometimes get really frustrated when those I care about don't live up to the expectations I have for them. My (INTP) brother dropped out of college for a year and I was so mad at him. I felt like he was so close to graduating. It ended up being really good for him and he did go back and found something he's passionate about. In hindsight it was good for him, I just had a hard time accepting that. \n\nThe INFP who was my roommate is the exact opposite of me in every way possible. I honestly don't know how we get along so well.  And she needs to be given the space to be her own person. She's brilliant in my eyes but struggles academically. She's read so many books and is so creative, but if she isn't passionate about something, she struggles to find the motivation. She's taught me that most people aren't like me. They don't want the same things as I do, and I need to learn to back off and let people figure things out for themselves. \n\n\n\n
5	Oh my GOD. Your description is literally like reading about my own life (also ESTJ). I live with my best friend who is an INFP (also someone I find to be BRILLIANT but dropped out of college and hates school) and also prefer one on one or one on 2-3 time with my close friends as opposed to giant groups, despite being very extroverted. DAMN. My INFP friend makes me a better person because she forces me to recognize how normal it is to sit down and take breaks, and to back off from trying to problem-solve when it‚Äôs not something others explicitly ask for (I have a tendency to offer solutions to problems because it‚Äôs how I show I care, but i don‚Äôt need to research the best migraine medicine for her if she doesn‚Äôt explicitly ask me to lol). I also have a trigger point at the concept of ‚Äúcompetence‚Äù‚Äîif other people (esp in the work setting) are displaying what to me appears incompetence, I will feel RAGE towards them. (Kind of a ‚ÄúYOU HAD ONE JOB!!!!‚Äù Sort of thing). I think I take a joke pretty well and have a lot of self-deprecating humor myself, but even JOKES related to my own competence I will shrivel up and die on the inside. Getting older I‚Äôve learned how to not react destructively to that but it still STINGS. Unsurprisingly, there‚Äôs not a lot of situations where friends joke about my competence because there‚Äôs no material for the jokes-lol. But when they do it‚Äôs usually about social competence and I internally just lose my shit. Trying as an adult not to lash out irrationally at that üòÇ
3	Male ESTJ here.\n\nI often don't know how I think or feel about something unless it comes up as a topic or someone asks about it. Then I'll organize my thoughts extremely quickly and answer as if I had something prepared. Sometimes I would have to write about a book in school and my answers were terrible because they were generic because the prompt was generic and I didn't know what was important. Then we'd have class discussions and I'd do amazingly well and my teacher didn't understand why I could do one and not the other.\n\nI crush on INFPs really easily. I'll try to hang around and talk with them for a while so it looks like it's happening naturally and gradually. I actively seek out TV shows, movies, music, art, and comics with INFP themes characters, and writing.\n\nWith some people, I'll talk for hours if I can pick through their mind or I like their stories. With most people, I'll get tired of it within 30 minutes or an hour and want to play a game or something. This is especially the case at parties. This is comparable to other people preferring to get together with 2-3 best friends. It's easier to control things to do your favorite things and have good conversations.\n\nI have witty, dry humor. I like teasing people just a tiny bit and getting a big reaction out of them. I have a friend that I got really good and he says he'll hate me forever for it. We're still best friends and whenever he brings it up I laugh so hard and tell him I love him for it.
2	You can get to know me if you want, just send me a message. I love to talk! School is starting so yeah, may be more prudent to trade numbers or e-mails or I add most anyone on facebook I have mostly the blind community on there. I am a blind ESTJ. But I don‚Äôt say anything important I treat it like another forum and I just post up some thoughts here and there, welcome to join and we can talk on messenger. But what I am suggesting is find me outside of reddit but message me here first.\n\nI think it depends on eneagram.\n\nI am a 3w2 317.\n\n\nI am really social outside of school and I imagine work. I‚Äôve done a few things. And when I do volunteer and called to mentor and stuff I am quite different. But yeah, outside maybe you can tell maybe you can‚Äôt. I act no different then I do on here. Well maybe, I answer mostly questions on here but yeah. I am very relaxed. I think it‚Äôs harder to see te really at work. I don‚Äôt know what you see. You see it more in a laid back way in my speech and interactions but yeah. Not sure. I don‚Äôt know what function is dominant in outside of work fun conversations.\n\n\nMy 7 of my enneagram tritype comes out really well after work or not in school or doing mentor consulting type of stuff.\n\nI can be a show in itself. Hahaha! I talk a lot. I can be really entertaining in my own way. But my 3w2 is still very prominent. So it‚Äôs not a pure 7 thing. But I have some fun too. Silly jokes like being goofy.\n\nI can‚Äôt see so now if I run in to someone to make light of things I say.\n\n‚ÄúOops, I forgot you were solid sorry.‚Äù\n\nI don‚Äôt joke around or blatantly tell joke after joke, but that type of humor comes out.\n\n\nI am very jovial and talkative. I can talk someone‚Äôs ear off. Hahaha! I talk aboutn the other person a lot or a shared interest.\n\n\nI am also a 3 so I blend in to the environment type of conversation. Whatever interest them. Ah, yes. Si is probably the function I use most in social interactions. I try to match you in conversations.\n\n\nI had an ENTP friend and still kind of do. He‚Äôs an interesting character. Apparently he and I share a bit of similar music, I use jazz only when studying. And he likes that stuff. He use to chase me around twitter and debated anything I posted on there. I got tired of that. I never said no for a while. But I sometime saw Geoff‚Äôs name and just never got back to him for a while. I was with a controling ISFP boyfriend. For a while and I finally blocked him. And then later it‚Äôs like this is really stupid? And then I unblocked him. We sometime talk but it‚Äôs rare we didn‚Äôt talk for a while.
3	Estj and memory?	So how good is it really? Do you agree si makes you really good with memory? Of course everyone will say they don‚Äôt have bad memory but just wondering. I know a few of us seem to have it. Here‚Äôs a question.\n\n\nremember back to your school days or if you‚Äôre in school it‚Äôs the question for you. Do you have to study? Or do you just pass tests and don‚Äôt study? Even if you‚Äôre in university?\n\nIs it just me or is it a stj thing or an sj thing, so si, that we have superb or near photographic memory.\n\nFor instance I am at a university and I an studying political science it‚Äôs my 8th year in school, and I have really never needed to study, really. I just remember stuff. I don‚Äôt study and the lowest grade I usually get on tests are b grades. If not even a. I get a grades often enough.\n\nI am not trying to brag I just want to know if it‚Äôs all of us, if it‚Äôs si. Or maybe it could be si te.\n\n\nAlso if someone tells you a password or a number can you remember it? My sister gave me her password last summer I think. I haven‚Äôt forgot it. I went to the apple store to basically trade in her phone so I could get a new one because I gave mine to her. And I was able to remember her password, not the exact one but the letters not how it was capitalized. But she was shocked. My father told me what his gas numbers were for his car and I am sure I still know the number. I should make a way to forget it because it‚Äôs useless information. Sometimes I feel like a walking textbook because I know too much and remember everything. \n\nAnybody else?
2	Yup-I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs not only the memory for test recall (classic non-studier A student here) but also for pattern building‚ÄîI work with severe persistent mental illness and I will recognize behavior patterns very quickly in new clients or even acquaintances that remind me of an extreme case. In a way that might easily be mistaken for intuition. And I still go back and verify, like I would never cite my Si as a reliable credible source but I will say that it allows me to bypass a lot of analytical or learning processes, as long as I‚Äôve analyzed or learned them at some point before! When I first found out about the MBTI I assumed that pattern building was because of N and was very confused that I had a preference, however slight, for S??? \n\nAnyhow my brother is an ISTJ who also middles pretty hard on N vs S but the slight difference between us (me leading with Te followed by Si and he leads with Si followed by Te) plays a huge role in the career fields we‚Äôve chosen‚ÄîI like to help develop larger scale interventions and in school for public health, he‚Äôs in medical school and happy as a clam to memorize facts and figures all day! 
2	My memory is amazing. I remember everything, but the ability to remember everything can kinda suck when you have traumatic events happen, or we're a victim of a bully. I can recall almost every single insult anyone has ever said to me, and where I was when they said it. \n\nI don't have a planner because it's not necessary. I just remember dates and times and my schedule after looking at it once. \n\nGive me a list? I'll remember it all in the exact order it was given to me. \n\nI love my memory, but there's a lot of stuff I wish I could forget as well, and sometimes I tend to relive certain situations over and over again. \n\nI do really well academically too, but sometimes I can get a better grade and still feel dumber than everyone else around me. Remembering things doesn't necessarily mean I understand it. \n\n\n
1	I'll remember discussions that I've had, especially other people's positions on issues and arguments, often years later and better than they do.\n\nFor tests, if I can really absorb a concept, I'll remember it. My understanding might fade if I don't use the concept though.
2	Your experience (s) with Ni	Hello everyone. I'm going to keep this short, sweet, and to the point. \n\nWhat do you all make of introverted intuition, and how, if at all, have you utilized it in your life? \n\nThis question to me seems like an interesting one, since we all have PoLR Ni. \n\nI'm on a quest to figure out how it works, and thus far, I cannot understand in depth. 
1	Aren‚Äôt we just blind to it? I‚Äôve been chasing this idea for a while. We just don‚Äôt use it and we don‚Äôt really know what it is. I do now just by observing but it‚Äôs still a little bizarre to me. I don‚Äôt think we use that function or anyone use their 7th function or am I wrong? I know that my INtJ friend for instance don‚Äôt know and dont really like fe that much. And probably doesn‚Äôt like it too well.
1	I like to think of Ni as intuition of time. \n\nI often find Ni acts as a stressor for me, and it manifests when I have a sense or have a gut feeling of how something may unfold. I am vulnerable to uncertainties ‚Äî This vulnerability, I believe, acts as a stressor that causes me to get started on things early (or be proactive rather than reactive) so that I can somehow exert some degree of control over the unknown future.\n\nMy conscious use of it is poor and without confidence, but subconsciously I think this uncertainty nudges me to act on my goals if that makes any sense...

7	My ESTJ BF brags a lot.	My ESTJ boyfriend is an amazing person who is loyal, good to his family, responsible, fun, successful etc etc. \nOne thing that I don't understand about him though, is that he brags excessively. \nIs this a typical ESTJ thing, insecurity or possibly something else? 
6	I jokingly brag a lot, I‚Äôll say something like ‚ÄòHD student right here yada yada‚Äô but we all know it‚Äôs a lie haha\n\nI guess it depends, but either he‚Äôs really proud of his achievement (and it comes off as bragging, when really he‚Äôs just excited, I‚Äôm always scared I‚Äôm going to do this-so I only share my achievements with people really close to me), but maybe it‚Äôs just your boyfriend idk 
4	I am an estj 3w2. And I use to do it. It‚Äôs an ego thing. I don‚Äôt do it as much anymore. Haha! You don‚Äôt have many friends if you‚Äôre too brag heavy. I use a lot of it for motivational stuff but otherwise I keep it more humble. But it‚Äôs a ego issue. We are often really proud of our accomplishments though. And we talk about how it works a lot of times to give examples that it does work or to motivate others.
3	I spent years doubting myself and feeling really down about myself and my abilities. \n\nI ended up watching a TED talk that honestly just flipped a switch. And the more I said good things about myself the better I started to feel. \n\nI am so much more confident now and just all around way happier and I have a tendency to brag in ways. \n\nI wouldn‚Äôt necessarily say I do it excessively but if I‚Äôm proud of myself for something I‚Äôll tell someone. I think sharing your success can sometimes come off as insecure but some of us are just proud of our own accomplishments and want to tell others. \n\nNow doing it in every single conversation would be weird. 
5	Pragmatic differences between ESTJ and entj?	I have done my research. I know what the functions are, I can type people fairly well. I can recite definitions but I am not going to do that. I can go with how the function stacks look in my dreams. Hahaha! Anyway. \n\nI know what Ni and si are. But what are the differences pragmatically? In real life? Give examples caused by Ni and si differences.\n\n\nAlso here are some odd questions\n\n\nDo you think as estjs we are louder or brasher or both than entjs?\n\nDo you think it‚Äôs easier to tell what we think then with entjs?\n\nDo you think that ESTJ and ENTJ tends to express there te differently or how much they are willing to exercise it?
4	ENTJs argue a lot more, and they‚Äôre much quicker thinkers so they‚Äôre good at it. 
3	I think our Si makes us less likely to take risks. \n\nI see a lot of ENTJs being entrepreneurs and honestly there is nothing remotely exciting about that to me. My old boss put all of her savings into her business and thank god she was successful because I couldn‚Äôt think of a worse disaster. \n\nI also have seen ENTJs to be a lot more open on social media. Active every day always posting something new. Sorta too open in ways. And I haven‚Äôt logged into Facebook in a year and only use Snapchat to send videos and pictures of my cats and Instagram to send memes. \n\nIn a way, ENTJs actually intimidate me. I think they come off way more confident and sure of themselves and their ability to put themselves out there makes them more likable. \n\n\n
1	There is a number of differences listed in these profiles. Generally ENTJs give a lighter and less serious impression in conversation than ESTJs and are more visionary, while ESTJs are much more thorough, reliable, and demanding in their work.    \n[ESTJ by Gulenko](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=LSE_Profile_by_Gulenko) | [ESTJ by Stratiyevskaya](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/42480) | [ESTJ subtypes](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/7546-LSE-ESTj-Subtypes-discussion-and-examples?p=139868&viewfull=1#post139868)   \n[ENTJ by Gulenko](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=LIE_Profile_by_Gulenko) | [ENTJ by Stratiyevskaya](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/42486) | [ENTJ subtypes](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/46746-LIE-ENTj-subtypes?p=138234&viewfull=1#post138234)    \n
3	Help! Is my mom an ESTJ?	Hello! INTP here. I'm fairly new to this system and I'm having trouble typing the types I'm not familliar with.\n\nI gave my mom (53) multiple tests based on functions to get a basic idea (I know tests aren't to be trusted, but I needed to start somewhere because she's very confusing). She scored as ESTJ multiple times. I then read the description to her and she agreed with a good part of it, but I'm still not convinced.\n\n(I'm probably going into stereotypes here, but I barely know anything about this type, so I apologize)\n\nFirst of all, I was almost sure that she was a feeling type just because how emotional and irrational she can be, especially in comparison with me and my brother (INTP and INTJ). But while she was doing the test, she always ended up choosing thinking over feeling options, especially the ones related to Te. \n\nAnd now that I think about it, her Te is strong when it comes to her job, I think? She has also been a manager for 15+ years and stepped down only because it was too stressful and she got tired of fixing what other people messed up. The thing is, everyone there respects and loves her, and even now they want her to be a manager again. She is both nice and demanding, very annoyed with mistakes but won't punish anyone unless necessary, knows how to do her job but often ranting about those who don't. She's good with everyone but won't be fake nice (says she dislikes those who put on a fake show?).\n\nShe loves to be in the right. Often when she tells a story, she needs to pinpoint how the other person told her 'yeah you are right'. She's proud of how rational she is. And now I'm thinking she's probably a thinker indeed, but it's different at home.\n\nShe has been a wonderful mom to us. This is where I'm most confused. We lost our dad at very young age so she tried her best for us to live well and she managed it. Both me and my brother made it a standard to do well in school so she hasn't had a chance to be demanding and stern. In fact, she's quite lenient and we get along really well. The only times we fight is when we don't show enough emotion/compassion or when we say something sarcastic or accidentally harsh.\n\nWe have it, of course. When my mom is sick or tired, I'm deeply concerned, but I fail at showing it. Then she sulks for hours and I can't communicate it with her. Her usual sentence is (in calm and emotional voice) 'you have to understand me'. She is never hysterical but often has such moments where it's like she's requesting an emotional response. She doesn't have actual arguments, it's just her feelings being hurt. But maybe this is just mom behavior? Or maybe she's lonely? Does it have anything to do with ESTJ?\n\nShe has a few good friends but doesn't have much energy to meet them often - she comes home from work tired and doesn't like having guests over for too long. But she likes it when it's people who are very fun or if she hasn't seen them in a while. At those times she's very outgoing and cheerful.\n\nShe takes pride in being very independent and says she will never remarry because she would hate it if a man came into our house and started ordering around. She always minds her own business with people unless asked for advice.\n\nShe isn't too intellect-oriented or a researcher; she wishes she had a hobby but never starts anything and is pretty stagnant. She is interested in history but won't make active effort to read about it.\n\nI won't make this even longer lol I hope I gave you enough insight to try and confirm that she is an ESTJ or deny it. Thank you in advance!
6	I resonate with a lot of things you said, but I suck at typing sooooo\n\nI guess the only thing I feel like I should probably explain is this and ESTJs reasoning behind why we do things\n\n>This is where I'm most confused. We lost our dad at very young age so she tried her best for us to live well and she managed it.\n\nWhen people are relying on me, I see it as my duty to do what I have to do. Everyone has been through shitty things, but the world doesn't stop just because those horrible things happen. People need us, so we can't be focusing on the past-we need to help those and look after those who need/are relying on us-hopefully that makes sense.\n\n&#x200B;
5	Absolutely ESTJ
3	I suck at reading, didn't read all that.  But if she is I will pray for your immortal soul.
3	A mom ESTJ here! Your mom sounds very much like me. I think women ESTJs often present very differently than male ESTJs because we are often a lot more feeling and less demanding. The ESTJ descriptions you often read seem to describe the men more so it can be a little confusing. 
2	Goes on /r/estj:\n\n>First of all, I was almost sure that she was a feeling type just because how emotional and irrational she can be\n\nYep, INTP lol
2	Can‚Äôt be sure she is. What do you mean by irrational. I mean I think all the time even at home. Possibly ESFJ?\n\nI am rather good at typing so maybe we can figure it out.\n\nI mean lots of people are good at some of the stuff you‚Äôre saying.
3	Describe your childhood?	What were you like as a child? Let‚Äôs here some accounts?\n\nWere anyone really overbearingly te? Bossy and controlling?
1	[deleted]
1	ESTJ dad and INFP mom. old ESTP brother, younger INTP brother, younger ESFJ sister. \n\nSo I usually kept my circle small. I had one best friend from early on and we pretty much spent every moment together. Until sometime in middle school when another girl came around and kinda fucked it up. Then I ended up meeting a new girl who I sorta latched onto and we became best friends shortly after. \n\nWith my siblings it was alright. It's a lot better now that we are adults though. My ESTP brother was a bully, he loved being the center of attention and getting a reaction out of people. He often times bullied me in front of people which really hurt me. Honestly, he was nothing but a jerk and even to this day he is still an asshole. But I'm much more successful and in doing way better than he is and that's what eventually made his words towards me meaningless. \n\nBut while all this happened I also had a cousin who was my exact age and bullied me to extremes. It was rough and got to the point where my parents helped me transfer to a new school. Growing up in a small town I felt like people who didn't know me were judging me and I felt like my life would be defined by this small town that I grew up in. \n\nI wasn't popular, I was actually pretty awkward. I liked my small group of friends and spent a lot of time by myself. I was very independent and happy. \n\nFor me, one of the struggles I dealt with was trying to be my own person while feeling constantly judged. I was definitely weird and by trying to be myself I had some pretty awkward moments but I did eventually figure it all out. I guess I'm glad I was able to be independent and not end up letting the expectations of everyone around me define who I became as a person. \n\nWas I bossy and controlling? I'm not exactly sure, but I was a take charge type of person. I volunteered to lead and had no problem being in charge, and honestly, a lot of other students weren't comfortable, so I sorta think I was doing everyone a favor. \n\nBut I got in trouble A LOT. I was a good kid and really didn't like getting in trouble so I was a teacher's pet. But when I felt like my friendships were being threatened I got mean. I once wrote a letter to a girl who "stole" my best friend. It was bad and I got into a lot of trouble. I think they knew I was just 12 and didn't know any better and the visit to the office scared the living shit out of me. \n\nLearning to control Te is rough. I was quite outspoken from an early age, and it took a few fuck ups before I learned to chill out. I was fired at 16 for sending what was classified as a harassment text. Honestly, this was 11 years ago and texting was brand new and I don't think the company had the right to fire me over a text like that. But regardless I was fired for it. And then at 19, I had a job where I also "spoke my mind" and got into some trouble too. Honestly, looking back I really struggled with learning when to speak and when to shut the hell up. \n\nMy mom said I was the hardest kid, and thank god I had an ESTJ dad who knew how to handle me. He honestly was a huge help for me growing up. He understood my crazy mind and he knew how to deal with it. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 
5	Does estjs talk a lot?	So, I have heard this a few times. And stuff but I don‚Äôt know how true it is.\n\nDoes ESTJs not talk a lot? I have heard that now from a few people. I had an impression that was not true. I know ISTJs don‚Äôt talk a lot. Do you enjoyy talking?. But the truth is I don‚Äôt think I know many estjs.
14	YES!!!!!! i cannot keep my mouth shut if i'm with people i'm even half comfortable with bc i have to verbalize everything that goes through my head
7	Absolutely yes! And we have an opinion on every goddamn thing on the planet.  It used to be that if it was in my head then it's out of my mouth with very little filter. I'm old and it has taken me a life time to learn to stfu and focus on what others are saying. To this day I have to be careful with free form conversation and only truly let down my guard when I'm around friends that have experienced my mouth for the last 30 years and are still my friend.
11	I do. \n\nBut I also have had some negative experiences with people who claim I dominant conversations. And that honestly hurts me to a point where I simply won‚Äôt engage with you again. \n\nI had a friend who claimed I never asked questions about her personal life. So when we would talk it was mostly me. And I hated feeling like she never shared anything with me not knowing she just wanted me to sit and ask her questions the whole time. That ended up really hurting me because she made me feel like I needed all the attention. \n\nI love talking but I tend to notice when people make faces or don‚Äôt seem interested and the second I sense that I shut down. \n\nI‚Äôll sit and talk with you for hours but I need to feel like you are equally sharing and are engaged because otherwise I get self conscious and those horrible thoughts trickle in. \n\n\n\n\n
3	I always wanted to answer questions in school.\n\nOur questions tend to be very specific. I like using the Socratic Method and playing Devil's Advocate.\n\nI hate interrupting and talking over people, though I'm more willing to than some other types.\n\nIf someone disagrees with me and won't cede me any points, I'll just leave the discussion.\n\nOn the other hand, if someone listens to me, our conversation can last for hours.\n\nMy ideal conversation has each side stating their thoughts clearly and succinctly and returning control to the other person. We usually start talking about a new topic in order to better understand the previous topic and have the intention of eventually returning to it. Our conversations feel like a stack where new topics are added and removed in an attempt to empty it.
3	You guys got the best handwriting? I bet all of yours is super neat.	I'm an ENTP, and mine is THE WORST. 
13	Mine is garbage--but it's fast and efficient!
7	I have really neat handwriting, yeah! I‚Äôm kind of neurotic about it though. Like I‚Äôm inclined to pull out pages from a notebook and start again if I make a mistake. 
5	My handwriting is atrocious unless I put forth serious effort and that‚Äôs not always efficient lol
2	I thought we all just type now?
2	I might be bias haha, but I don‚Äôt think my handwriting is that bad lmao
2	Yup...won a superlative back at my college job for "best handwriting" hahah 
2	I barely even write anymore. I generally just move the pen in a general up and down motion after the first letter of a word. \n\nI‚Äôm so stuck on typing or TTS that using a pen feels like a serious burden. 
1	It's true, I don't hand-write many things, but when I do, it seems to be a toss up. Sometimes it's neat, sometimes it okay. It has never been god-awful, however. As for typing, I use the Dvorak keyboard layout so I can type faster and therefore be more efficient. 
1	I tend to get compliments on it! But my ISTJ Mum‚Äôs is even neater.
1	My handwriting looks like a grade schoolers, all of the letters link together with swirls and I usually can‚Äôt even read it myself.
3	Has anyone ever dated a female ENTJ? What are some of your thoughts on them?	I am currently seeing a male ESTJ. It seems as if we are very similar so far. I wanted to know of any of you had any experience with dating a female ENTJ. I was curious if our dominant Te and inferior Fi would clash. 
3	I‚Äôm an ESTJ female and I think the biggest difference between me and my ENTJ friends is that they‚Äôre more impulsive than us, and can cross social barriers without feeling bad due to their intuition. I think ENTJ‚Äôs are more insecure than ESTJ‚Äôs and that they lack control haha. ENTJ‚Äôs freak me out a bit.\n\nMy boyfriends a INTJ, and often because of his intuition, I feel that he really struggles with prioritising consistently. Might be the same with and ENTJ girl.  
1	Prepare for fireworks. 
1	My ENTJ friends can easily start talking and just not stop for hours. This makes me uncomfortable as I want a more balanced discussion. The friendship works better when it's organized more around activities like games or a movie.\n\nWe also generally ignore each other's life advice.\n\nOverall, there is enough good stuff to make up for that. They're very generous and willing to hang out for activities, which are important to us.
6	would it be a bad idea to tell an estj that i like her?	male infp. is there a viable way to approach an estj? what do they want?
11	Go for it. INFPs are dope. \n\nBut we usually have it decided whether we like someone or not. So if she sees you as a friend she might not see you as more. \n\nBut she probably wouldn‚Äôt end the relationship if you made a move. She would just say no and move on from it. Which can be weird to some people. \n
15	ENFP dating an ESTJ. I don't claim to have any expertise in this, but I would suggest you be direct and provide logical suggestions as to how you could initiate a relationship together. \n\nESTJ's value logic and things that "make sense". They don't like anything that prevents them from reaching their personal goals, so if she feels like you will threaten her personal goals she won't want to start anything. They don't like to show their feelings, and sometimes have a hard time accepting personal feelings as a motive for anything.\n\nGood news for you is, my ESTJ really likes INFP personalities, so you may have a decent chance. Just be yourself, be honest, and be realistic.\n\nAlso, don't let her run over you, because she can, and she won't feel safe in your relationship if she thinks she can control you.
8	ESTJ female here-- I would say the opposite, it's a good idea to tell her how you feel and where you're at. ESTJs like myself greatly appreciate straightforwardness and knowing where we stand. We also appreciate people opening up and making the first step in showing these kind of emotions. I don't mind discussing feelings, but I would never be the one to initiate, and be prepared to have kind of a practical "so what are we" or "where do you see this going" follow up question. It's not that us ESTJs aren't romantic, but we're also realists at heart. I recently had a guy straight up tell me he liked me and I appreciated the honesty/directness so much. Hell, I appreciate directness even if it's the other way too (tell me you don't like me, don't drag things on) haha!
2	Uhhhh, for me personally, it depends on your relationship. Are you friends? Acquaintances? \n\nIf someone straight up tells me that they like me and I haven‚Äôt had time to form on opinion on the person, the answer would be no. But it depends
1	Yeah, just ask her directly. Tell her how you feel and don‚Äôt go around in circles. She could say no.
3	Need help. ESTJ female dating ENTP guy	hey. \n\nIm new to all this but wanted to get some advice really. Im an estj female in my 30s and have been seeing a entp man for just over 6 months. although its fairly new, the relationship grew quickly and we are exclusive. Neither of us tend to just jump into relationships so i hope that helps understand how quickly we bonded. Like he will often talk about our future, having children, etc. Basically planning ahead for the future including meeting his mum in nyc and i've just spent xmas with his family who have never met a previous gf before as he has been single 10 years. However, on the other hand, was very weird at the start about even holding hands in public, going to his place, going on dates, etc although he spends like 3-4 days of the week at my house.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways, I mentioned to this entp that i really don't like lying and whatever happens always tell me the truth. I felt he was doing this at the very start which was great, then started to feel like he started telling me half-truths or not being fully honest about things. He is pretty secretive about thing too as he considers himself 'private'. I have noticed some holes in some of the stories he would tell me. I also noticed he was flirting and chatting to some girls over FB messenger but lying about it or saying that they have been friends for years (although i know for a fact they haven't). The last convo he has with one girl was asking her 'what her type is' to be her matchmaker but i dont feel he had any intensions of being a matchmaker and just wanted to get some sort of ego boost or know if he was her type.\n\nI feel pretty uncomfortable about all this as i'm very very honest and loyal. I have tried to discuss my boundaries in general and why these are important to me prior to all of this happening so i almost feel hurt by this behaviour as its overstepping my boundaries. I was just wondering if there where any ENTPS do similar things, should i be concerned, and if you have any advice for me?\n\nI really don't want to end up in a situation where I have invested in further to this relationship to find out a few years down the line i've been messed around. 
4	Yeah, I am 26 and ESTJ. Yeah, that relationship just doesn‚Äôt sound right. Just ditch him like a bad habit.
4	I'm 27 F ESTJ and this reads NOPE NOPE NOPE.\n\n>I also noticed he was flirting and chatting to some girls over FB messenger but lying about it or saying that they have been friends for years (although I know for a fact they haven't\n\nRED FLAG\n\nAsking if other ENTPs behave like this is just trying to find an excuse to write his behavior off when deep down you don't think it's okay.\n\nSit this man down and tell him he is either exclusive or he isn't. You are older, you are an adult whose time isn't going to be wasted by someone who isn't looking for the same things as you are. \n\nI get that there is this period of time where you haven't decided if you're exclusive, but at some point, it needs to be discussed. If someone was spending multiple nights a week at my house but still wanted to flirt with other girls over messenger, I would be pretty ticked off. \n\nAnd please don't let people try and convince you that because you didn't talk about exclusivity that it's still somehow okay for him to behave that way. Without having the conversation you knew you reached a point where you were going to be loyal and just talk to him. You chose to be exclusive with him. In my opinion, at 2-3 months of spending multiple nights at each other's places, you have reached that point of exclusiveness where talking to other girls/guys would be questionable behavior. \n\nHe sounds like he's afraid of commitment. So sit down and talk with him and say that his behavior is questionable and you aren't about to have your time wasted so he either needs to be more open with you or it's done. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n
1	Copy and paste this to r/ENTP \n\nI would like to answer this but im really bad at relationship advice. Being a ENTP myself I have FI trickster which makes me unaware of the good and bad in situations. Also being logical doesn't help to much here. The most I could say is just be truthful and confront him sutley he might be unaware of the situation like me or something else. If you present him with true or false questions he is likely to understand.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/4gj-khTW2Mg
1	Being an ENTP, would suggest you just talk to him about what being exclusive with you means. Let him know what he needs to do if he intends to keep you .  Tell him he needs to be truthful. Obviously you are important to him so he needs to know your limits.
1	{I saw you posted this twice and felt that if you ever delete the previous one I'd at least have my comment here too, excuse the extra notifications}\n\nAight I'm an ESTJ too who'd pretty much never cheat who's loyal and honest and blabla. \n\nYou're dating an ENTP, aka a person with superego Fi, the ENTP will unlikely care that what they're doing is wrong since they often do not have any values or rules thanks to NeFe, their dominant and tertiary function.\n\nNeFe: There's so much to do in this world! Everyone could do anything they want! As long as I'm seen nicely, that's all what matters!\n\n\nBut what the ENTP forgets is that they have inferior Si, aka a poor focus to details, they could get so caught up in their ideas and world of possibilities that they forget what they once were saying, they don't notice how inconsistent their lies get. And as long as the person they're talking to doesn't notice or doesn't call them out, the ENTP feels confident in what they're saying.\n\nIn order to avoid these types of moments, the ENTP might just try to make everything they say sound super vague. This way when they're stuck, they say that at least they didn't lie. This is a bubble easy to pop, just keep asking questions and force them to be as clear as possible. Then they got the chance to either own up or may end up lying like pussies. (I alwaus saw Fe as a pussy function)\n\n\nSuperego Fi is pretty damn annoying, you could read more about if here https://www.instagram.com/p/BlNWasng7vh/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=14qrtb5x8mlfx\n\nForce the ENTP to be more honest before the relationship gets meh, don't leave them space to be wishy washy, make them open up to you and learn more about their insecurities. Maybe if he opens up to you, he may be more honest. So yeah. Good luck.
1	I am ENTP and other ENTPs are known for their flexibility with all the other types. Why? Because we live and let live mostly and most of the time. We don‚Äôt have grand schemes or specific plans for specific people in our lives and we do NOT want to manage anyone or plan their days and weeks and months and years for them. ENTPs want to just drift in the river of life having only a destination (pillars in their life like education, job, marriage, kids, house, pool, etc). Other than that, ENTPs don‚Äôt like plans and don‚Äôt like to be controlled by someone else‚Äôs plans. \n\nENTPs do NOT flirt with others although it can appear so. They are actually making conversation and trying to be interesting. That‚Äôs it! ENTPs will come off to people who don‚Äôt know them as flirting, but they won‚Äôt even notice that. You can read about that in many articles online. \n\nI think that you know that about your ENTP already. Also, I think that you came here to the ESTJ forum to look for reassurance from other ESTJs to help give you a push for the decision you already made. \n\nYou and your ENTP will have some problems down the road about plans, management, taking control of your lives, and wanting the ENTP to follow your rules and guidelines. They wouldn‚Äôt. Even if they pretended and promised they would. They still wouldn‚Äôt. \n\nIf you love him enough and if he loves you enough then you two CAN make it work. Try to look the other way when he improvise things as he goes. And tell him to do some important things the way you want him to do it. I think it could work like that. 
0	As an ENTP, I would say that my primary gripe with ESTJ's is their rigidity and inflexibility.  They can often be oriented toward the black and white type of thinking - "It either happened or it didn't"...and as someone who can be fragmented and outside the box, I despise being interrogated or judged to be lying because it doesn't all flow in a neat straight line.  I would suggest gaining his trust in the way of being open to the way his mind works and making him not feel like you are going to interrogate and judge every thing he says with a need to make a judgement at the end.  Just as you express wanting to trust him, he needs to trust you.  He also needs to trust that you will be open to ideas and discussions without judgement or needing to do something actionable at the end.  If you can appreciate how his ways will challenge you to think outside the box, he will probably not lie to you.  ENTP's often lie as a means for survival, from childhood we find that coming out and saying everything that is going through our heads typically ends up in being misunderstood.  We don't want to be misunderstood and misjudged.

As long as I'm seen nicely, that's all what matters!\n\n\nBut what the ENTP forgets is that they have inferior Si, aka a poor focus to details, they could get so caught up in their ideas and world of possibilities that they forget what they once were saying, they don't notice how inconsistent their lies get. And as long as the person they're talking to doesn't notice or doesn't call them out, the ENTP feels confident in what they're saying.\n\nIn order to avoid these types of moments, the ENTP might just try to make everything they say sound super vague. This way when they're stuck, they say that at least they didn't lie. This is a bubble easy to pop, just keep asking questions and force them to be as clear as possible. Then they got the chance to either own up or may end up lying like pussies. (I alwaus saw Fe as a pussy function)\n\n\nSuperego Fi is pretty damn annoying, you could read more about if here https://www.instagram.com/p/BlNWasng7vh/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=14qrtb5x8mlfx\n\nForce the ENTP to be more honest before the relationship gets meh, don't leave them space to be wishy washy, make them open up to you and learn more about their insecurities. Maybe if he opens up to you, he may be more honest. So yeah. Good luck.\n\n

6	Female ESTJ: would you date an INFP? (read)	1. What things do you dislike about INFP?\n\n2. Is there any other type that best meets your requirements?\n\nI'm not looking for anything, I'm just curious.
4	1. The INFP would be too worried about how I'm feeling, as a result, I wouldn't date one, because who knows? They could just be saying something to me to make me feel better, which as a result, actually doesn't. I need the blunt truth, not 'you're a great person BS'. I don't know how to describe it, but some INFPs are very airy fairy-but my best friend is an INFP and we get along quite well. INFPs and ESTJs for friendships, but not relationships\n2. I'd say ISTJ, I want someone who is down to earth and stable, that will call me out when I'm being erratic etc.
6	This relationship has always looked great to me.
5	Female ESTJ dating a female INFP. We've been together for 12 going on 13 years. It's surprising, even though we are like polar opposites, we rarely fight.\n\nThe things I'm not so good at, she's great at and vice-versa. I feel like we compliment each other. She has tons of ideas and I have the drive to make them come to life. I keep things super organized, while she does the cooking. I tend to do all the maintaining. \n\nI have a tendency to get into those "gotta do all the things" moods and have a habit of forgetting about taking care of myself in the process. She helps me with that. \n\nHer support allows me to continue to push myself further and further while keeping me grounded at the same time. And I feel like I provide the support to get her to push herself into elements where she would normally feel uncomfortable.

1	I know a bunch of infp people. I don‚Äôt know if I want to date them for various reasons. I am not sure how long our relationship will last and how much push they can take. I have an older INFP guy telling me he wouldn‚Äôt mind dating me but meh, I don‚Äôt really know. Just not my type of person to date. Be friends with fine. I don‚Äôt know exactly but istj wouldn‚Äôt be bad another ESTJ would probably be fine. Maybe esfp but depends on who. Maybe entj?
1	I‚Äôm an ESTJ and definitely would have dated a INFP when I was in my teens. Two of my closest friends were INFP‚Äôs. But as I‚Äôve grown up and lived a little, I wouldn‚Äôt consider dating that personality type. After dating my current boyfriend who is an INTJ, I‚Äôd be focusing more on finding someone who isn‚Äôt intuitive (makes me feel like I have to control the situation as he doesn‚Äôt rely on fact) and I‚Äôd prefer someone whose also an extrovert. I think most ESTJ‚Äôs want to utilise life to its full potential, and don‚Äôt want to be ‚Äòslowed down‚Äô by someone who thinks in a completely different way. I think INFP‚Äôs make great and interesting friends though.
2	Who are your favorite fictional female ESTJs?	Labrys in Persona 4 Arena\n\nDianna Soreil / Kihel Heim in Turn A Gundam\n\nYang Xiao Long in RWBY\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOthers I know of include\n\nRangiku Matsumoto in Bleach\n\nTriela in Gunslinger Girl\n\nSochie Heim in Turn A Gundam
2	"Others I know of include..."\n\nNot trying to be an asshole but how do you know?
2	I‚Äôm pretty sure Hermione is an ESTJ. \n\nAnd I see Leslie Knope as one too. People say esfj but I think she‚Äôs just an extra positive ESTJ. But I could be wrong. I just don‚Äôt see esfj and I know it‚Äôs a character which they can make however they want. \n\nI also always saw Brennan from Bones as an ESTJ. \n\nWhich just leaves me with me with 3 fictional characters who are extremely different from each other but I somehow relate to stronger than anyone else. \n\nBut what brings them all together and makes me believe ESTJ is their work is always the most important thing to them. And that‚Äôs why I believe it‚Äôs ESTJ. Other than Leslie they aren‚Äôt as social but our extroversion allows us to work long hours without burnout and that‚Äôs why I think we are so hard to type. We will work 50-60 hours a week no problem but getting out to go out and be social and party just doesn‚Äôt interest us the same. Unless it‚Äôs work related in which case it makes Leslie even more likely. Everything she does is revolves around her job. \n\nIt‚Äôs not that we don‚Äôt enjoy being social and usually once I‚Äôm done with work I make sure to give those most important to me my utmost attention and leave work at work. But at the same time if work calls I can still show up and I usually will want to. \n\n\nHonestly I can see how they might be typed differently but I still believe they are all ESTJ. \n
2	Princess Leia! 
2	Yeah, mc‚Äôgonagall and hermione. There is also different type of ESTjs. I am estj but I am closer to percy. I am a 3 as well.
3	ENTP/ESTJ friendship	Hey y'all.  I'm an ENTP, and I recently moved back to my hometown.  A childhood acquaintance (ESTJ) ran into me, and has since decided that we are bff's.  She *seems* sincere, but she hardly knows me!  All of a sudden I know all of her life secrets (and family secrets), and she always wants me to come over, hang out, or chat.  Is this for real?  I'm usually a pretty good judge, but she genuinely seems to believe that we are close friends now.  I'm reeling a bit from the suddenness of it all, since I usually don't consider someone a friend until at least a year has passed.
5	Probably a sincere act, but also severely lacking in boundaries. Whenever anyone shares too much too soon, I become very careful in how I choose to interact with them. In my experience, over-sharing personal problems right off the bat is unhealthy behavior (think codependent Enneagram 2). Once intertwined,  it's hard to extricate yourself from the situation without drama. Trust your gut. Always. 
3	I also think it‚Äôs a boundary issue. My best friend is ENTP and it was nothing like that, haha
1	How soon are you talking about?\n\nI get on with ENTPs but at a distance I think I do but yeah. I know this guy who is and he use to stalk me all over twitter and debate absolutely everything. He‚Äôs a marxist or close to it and I use to be a libertarian center right but I am more along the GOP lines. But still haha! Interesting is all I can say. I liked my entp teachers but not a lot of entp friends.\n\nApparently the entp I am talking about shares musical tastes.
4	Crushing hard on an ESTJ guy	Hello, I am an ENTP guy and I m crushing very hard on an ESTJ guy and... I dont understand many things about him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile usually giving a real compliment to someone else should make them happier, the guy sometimes answers "cool, so what?".\n\nI am quite vocal and touchy-expressive when it comes to my emotions and while he says it doesnt bother him, he also says "it's just unusual".\n\nWhile cuddling, I always ask for a few more minutes of cuddling and at some point, he would get almost angry and just gets away saying that we should get ready.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI could interpret this as a lack of interest but it doesnt seem to be the case either. (his cuddles are the bests)\n\nLikewise, he keeps describing what he is (very unprecisely) and I am supposed to pick up the meanings in terms of likes or dislikes. He doesnt say everything, seeing many things as "obviously" true while I never assume so...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTruth be told, I really dont know how to view it. Whether he seems interested, what kind of behaviour he is expecting?\n\nAlso, what should I do specifically in order to make him happy?\n\nHe is one of the first non female ESTJ I ve met so there's plenty of things I dont know.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
7	1) Be yourself. (We sense and respect authenticity.)\n\n2) Set and adhere to personal boundaries, and do nothing just to "make him happy". (We don't typically respect people who don't respect themselves.)\n\n3) An inordinate amount of physical touch may feel clingy or suffocating to him early on in a relationship. Give him time and space to feel that comfortable with you.  If this doesn't evolve to your liking over time, he may not be for you. \n\n
7	I just want to make it clear I‚Äôm not a guy, so this may not resonate and these are just my opinions \n\nOk, so, compliments are nice, however actions mean more to us. Compliments are simply empty words if you say them all the time-it sounds harsh, but I‚Äôm saying it the way I see it. If we‚Äôre talking love languages, I‚Äôd say quality time and acts of service are more important.\n\nI don‚Äôt like hugs or much physical affection, unless it‚Äôs from a few very specific people. It makes me uncomfortable and irritates me, it feels somewhat clingy and like my personal space is being invaded. \n\nUm, he probably views cuddling as wasting time, as he could be using it for other things. It gets in the way of his ‚Äòplan‚Äô for the day.\n\nWhat was different about dating an ESTJ male and ESTJ female? 
2	I am an ENFP and I told my little brother, ESTJ that I missed him and he said, "Thanks." lol. Then again, an ESTJ friend I know loves cuddling with his wife and is very touchy feely, so I don't have a broad answer for you regarding ESTJs. But hope it helps to know some real life examples from my life of ESTJs and that they're not all the same. 
1	Well estjs we are matter of fact so complements are nice but they have to come naturally don‚Äôt try to go out of your way. I had a friend do this and I was like erm okay. Is that all or are there other motives? What‚Äôs up with this guy?\n\nEr. Be direct. Also the matter of factness is a thing and not wasting time.\n\nOtherwise it‚Äôs been pretty well covered. Also estjs have a few variants. I am a estj 3 some are estj 1 or 8 so it all depends.
5	Is it weird for an ESTJ have a hard time talking to girls? My ESTJ friend usually gives up quickly on people if he feels the relationship doesn't take off right away.	
6	I've grown tired of waiting for people to come around, so if I'm not able to determine interest fairly early, I don't really bother anymore. Doesn't stop me from crushing on them still. Been crushing on one girl for near three years now. Likely never going anywhere though. Never much of a problem talking to girls though. I can walk up and talk to them just fine. It's more of a "is it worth my time".
5	I‚Äôm female but honestly same. I can pretty quickly tell if a relationship is going anywhere and I‚Äôm not big on wasting my time. 
4	I don't give up quickly, but I have noticed that I get bored quickly with people. I had this pattern of talking to guys for a month before I was over it. It kept happening and I couldn't figure out why. Then I met my current partner and we've been going strong for 6 months. \n\nI personally think ESTJs have this ability to see things in people that others might not notice. We might see recklessness in someone and we'd know that isn't something we want. We see laziness or someone who isn't very motivated and we know that bothers us. ESTJs are one of the last types to want any of their time wasted so any indication of a potential relationship not working out and we won't even bother. \n\nI had so many of my girls say I was too picky and judgemental about relationships but I just kept watching their relationships fail and it all seemed pointless to me. Not to mention the one who would never shut up about me having too high of standards is already on her 2nd husband before 26.  \n\nFor me, there has to be a point to the relationship. I'm not just going to spend 3 months with a guy if I don't see a future with them. And I do hookups or fwb but none of those are ever with people I'm remotely serious about. \n\n
2	I‚Äôm a girl, I don‚Äôt have a problem talking to guys I like, but I do get discouraged if they‚Äôre not interested right away. The guys I‚Äôm usually into, take ages to make a move-that‚Äôs how I‚Äôve learnt patience haha
2	How to motivate an ESTJ?	My younger brother (17) is an ESTJ. How can I an ENTJ (22) motivate him to work harder and reach his goals?
11	This probably isn‚Äôt useful, but (in some cases) the more people try to make me do something (if I don‚Äôt want to do it), the less likely I will be to do whatever it is they want me to do (we‚Äôre stubborn).\n\nTo answer your question directly: idk
10	A list. Or make them in charge. 
3	If you're already trying to motivate an ESTJ to work harder I think there's a problem. Growing up I always had plans and goals. I was very future-oriented, so the thought that you (op)  are trying to get your younger brother to work harder to reach his goals might just be the problem. \n\nESTJs value their independence and like accomplishing things on their own and I'm sorta getting the feeling that you are trying to assert yourself in thinking it's your responsibility whether he does something or not.  \n\nThe second someone else tries to help me do anything I almost immediately give up. And I'm talking about goals and plans that I have. I like to keep a lot of that stuff to myself and just because you can't see it doesn't mean nothing is happening. \n\nCan I ask what goals we're talking about here? Has he told you them? Has he asked for help? Has he given you any indication that he needs help? 
2	INFPs (Socionics EII) are superb motivators for us. ISFPs too.\n\nOther good things are curiosity. Give us good problems to solve. Good probably means he has some ideas about how to solve them.\n\nWe often get told things and interpret them wrong because we took people literally. Make sure that he's got the right idea for the subjects he's having trouble on.
3	Tell them (that you believe) they can't do something. 
1	So it depends what type of estj I am a 3w2 so achievement is my thing some may be 1w2 and are different or 8w7.\n\nI want to ask what goals your goals or his goals? Maybe he‚Äôs working hard but you don‚Äôt know it? I‚Äôve had arguments as to who‚Äôs goals a lot. I don‚Äôt take interest in your goals sorry. I don‚Äôt want to do this. Yeah, this may be your priority but it isn‚Äôt mine, and here is why. Sometime they listen and sometime they won‚Äôt.\n\nFor example I am busy up to my eyeballs with other stuff and I left some paperwork to my father. I am also blind so filling stuff out is a tedious and b inaccessible. He‚Äôs found a bunch of scholarships but that‚Äôs not my top priority. Am I not driven? No. Absolutely not, but that‚Äôs just not my priority. I‚Äôve also been told I look like I do nothing. What cranking up my music and doing stuff is doing nothing? Okay? Haha! And then there are periods of burn out I am a 3 so that may make sense.

2	What do you guys tend to think of ENFPs?	As the two extroverted types within the Delta Quadrant, I'm very intrigued by how we would interact. I have a few INFPs and ISTJs in my life so they're not as a much of a mystery to me. \n\nI often wonder if I'm an ESTJ with a preference for Ne, but my Fi is quite strong, and my Si is definitely my weakest. I tend to force myself into Ne-Te quite a lot and sometimes wonder if I prefer Te to Fi, although I can find that if I stay in Ne-Te too long I can develop a bit of a Messiah complex, so after a heavy day of Te I deffo need to ethically recalibrate by pondering over my favourite philosophers. I definitely prefer Si-Fi to Si-Te. \n\nI've definitely learnt a lot by examining the ISTJs but as we both have an unbalanced perceiving axis, I feel like it would be more fruitful now to observe ESTJs, I feel like we can help each other as I have the balanced judgement axis, so I like to believe (although this is probably my ego) that I find a perfect equilibrium between efficiency and ethics. But my perceptions man, not only do I find living in my own body and experiences traumatic on a day to day basis, but my memory is the worst so most of what's in my head is just me filling in a lot of blanks, which makes everything very pretty, but not very grounded or down to earth. I feel like I would greatly benefit from understanding the ESTJ, with your balanced perceiving aixs, you can use your own experience to gather facts and details with Si and then draw the necessary conclusions with your Ne. I find that INFPs tend to bring out the worst in me, which is my laziness, and my sadness, but I feel like the ESTJ I would find empowering and motivating. \n\nSo here's a few questions that I have, that if you feel you have any specific insight that you may like to give, would be greatly appreciated:\n\n- what differences do you notice between those of you who prefer Ne to Si, and vice versa? \n\n- what is inferior Fi like? How does it affect you? What do you notice in your day to day lives that shows you have inferior Fi? \n\n- do you ever feel like you wish you could stop moving? When in Ne-Te I feel like a hummingbird that has to continuously move from flower to flower to get sugar in order to stay aflight. I feel like being in Te nearly all the time must be tiring, \n\n- how do you use Si to balance your Ne? \n\n- I feel like we would get on, because of that shared Ne-Te that we may like to use together and may take us on many adventures and I feel like ESTJ company would help me get things done. However, I feel like I could also be very annoying, either because I'm a total Politically Correct, philosophical, & ethical square. Or I can see us as being rivals, I know that I get a wee bit schemish, malevolent, and competitive when someone else who is also very unique and leader-ey is around, ( makes me insecure I guess) \n\n- do you have any other advice, feedback, anecdotes, tips, that you can offer? \n\nI feel at home in the Delta Quadrant, I feel like other quadrants have very different values, but interacting with types with the same functions as me is so refreshing and really helps me to ground my sense of self, and that I'm not a weird freak. Everyone around me seems to have Fe-Ti axis and it really gets me down because I feel like a black sheep. \n\n
5	I haven't got an answer for those questions at the bottom, but I am often annoyed by their unpunctuality and spontaneity.
4	Male ESTJ here.\n\nI love almost all INFP (Socionics EII) music I find, but tend to ignore ENFP. The same with most other stuff like novels and youtube video makers.\n\nI usually like ENFP characters a lot. Sometimes they compete with my favorite INFPs.\n\nIn conversation, they tend to bounce around topics a lot more while ESTJ / INFP conversations act more like a stack. We're constantly adding something new to talk about and figure out with the intent to make it easier to understand the topics before it. Eventually, we'll make it back to the original conversation.\n\nMy closest relationship with an ENFP is my female cousin. We hit it off like magic when we get together, but it's usually several years apart when we see each other in person. I don't have any ENFPs in close friend groups at the moment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Questions\n\n1. I'm a little confused by what you mean by prefer here. My Si greatly helps in my personality typing, even as a secondary trait, as I can feel my own reactions to people and distinguish between them. Ne with Fi seems to like to break the rules of logic in a way that is appealing to Deltas, and it's stronger with ENFP than INFP. I don't know much about using it myself. In the context of Gammas, it seems to be about gauging power / willpower and similar concepts. I find that pretty hard though.\n2. In terms of my own inferior Fi, it's difficult to feel empathy with a lot of people. I'm working on it with the help of INFPs and I've gotten a lot better. Also, it's really hard to distinguish the details in my emotions. Do I feel sad? Lonely? Resentful? I don't know, often.\n3. Mentally, being in our own function is easy. We also seem to have huge amounts of physical energy as long as we are being energized and our extroversion is satisfied.\n4. I'm a little confused here. Secondary Si use already feels situational and Ne even more so.\n5. This depends so much on how our functions interact. I'm not politically correct, but I can follow some of the rules presented to me by INFPs. They usually give an explanation which I need to follow them. As far as leadership goes, I tend to give it up easily and only take it when it is clear everyone wants me in that position. This might be tied to my brother and mother being INTJ.
2	I‚Äôve only known ONE ENFP that I‚Äôm 99% sure I‚Äôve typed correctly, so I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm allowed to judge ENFPs in general, but we didn‚Äôt get along - at all. \n\nShe would cry often about things I‚Äôd consider minor, she is very sensitive. She wasn‚Äôt a mean person, but she wanted affirmation/validation from her friends and attention constantly - that personally annoys me (my most hated question is: do you like me? NO, THE ANSWER IS NO~I‚Äôd remain silent). We just don‚Äôt understand each other. \n\nAnyway, it eventually blew up, after dropping so many hints about the fact I didn‚Äôt consider her a friend, I flat out told her and you can imagine how that went. The rest is history, we don‚Äôt speak, but she‚Äôs happier now and so am I :)\n\nI think it‚Äôs more a personal preference than an ESTJ thing, but idk 
2	Belated response, but perhaps I can provide some insight as an ESTJ female. I don't know all these inner workings of MBTI personalities, so I can't answer your specific questions directly, but I can speak to my opinion of ENFPs very well. My best friend of 5+ years is an ENFP male. I really enjoy spending time with him because he is so lively, open to new ideas/trying new things, and genuinely engaging with other people as this personality type. He is supportive and encouraging and can read people in under 30 seconds. In general I have a positive opinion of ENFPs as we can spend the whole day together and it's always great.\n\nHowever, the parts of his ENFP personality that do rather drive me up the wall sometimes is that he is completely okay living in the "grey area" so to speak. He def doesn't see life black and white like I do, so naturally we clash on things. Sometimes he is, what I view coming from an ESTJ, as flaky because he'll change plans kind of last minute or change the restaurant etc. We dated briefly and definitely experienced the typical challenges in an ESTJ-ENFP relationship. For example, I wanted to define what was going on, exclusivity, etc. or at least have that discussion. For him, he felt like he was being boxed in. I value tradition on things like Valentine's Day, he doesn't nearly as much. Hence, we are much better off as friends. \n\nWe can occasionally get annoyed at each about logistical things in our friendship which comes from our differences in personalities as I'm routine oriented and like to stick to a plan and he is much more spontaneous. But what friendship doesn't on occasion? That being said, he is one of the most fun people to spend time with and I enjoy his ability to just life life and his understanding of people pushes me to understand that feelings aren't so black and white/logical and to analyze my own emotions.\n\nHope this is somewhat helpful! In short, ENFPs make great friends and I love spending time with them but don't feel it's a particularly compatible dating partner.
2	Estj 3w2 here.\n\nSo what is inferior fi? The most unhealthy think about what our president is doing or does when he gets angry. I don‚Äôt go that far but i can have states of unhealthy fi, but it has to be very far out, and not very often, usually with family. Mostly snarky comments sometimes a few and I pretend you don‚Äôt exist until you agree with me. I am blind and I don‚Äôt mind questions, but sometimes people underestimate me. I usually regret it but I was standing there greeting one sunday at church and someone asked he was a fellow greter you‚Äôre blind how can you greet? I gave him this shrug of the shoulders and like watch me I am sure you can‚Äôt do any better and kind of did it showily. Haha! I usually am more stable and then I felt bad when he said oh well you‚Äôre actually a really good greeter. I held my tongue but I was going to say I knew as much. I tell people to think trump but I don‚Äôt get as bad. But snarky comments can be my thing. I also think trump is an 8 I am a 3.\n\nBut I can lose my cool completely as well, not as bad as trump but think percy weasley. I am a lot more like that too.\n\nI am also one to prefer ne a little for those estj who does it‚Äôs called looping I think. See do see do is the type of thing that happens. Too much on their plates. I think estj with a heavy ne is a big 3 thing. I am fairly intuitive, and have a good ne. I thought I may be entj. But probably not. But te ne loops happen and then I get exhausted because I have 3452671 tasks to do and wonder how I can do them all. They all sound great. I was on the newspaper for a bit, I was a journalism student for a bit, and I‚Äôd take on 6 articles and then I realized I had to interview, transcribe write down quotes and write my story for all these good ideas. Yikes!!! No thanks! Overload is my thing then I wonder why I need so much sleep like today. I‚Äôve gotten like 11 hours, I keep going back for more. And I am not a big fan of sleeping.\n\nSo I don‚Äôt know much enfp personally, the ones I know really seem happy go lucky. I had a notetaker she was a comm major we were on the newspaper together actually but she was the best at what she did. Really chirpy and really in to the werid. Haha!
4	Anyone else find it difficult to ‚Äòtell people off‚Äô?	I‚Äôve always assumed ESTJs have no difficulty ‚Äòtelling people off‚Äô (that‚Äôs what other MBTI types have said). I have no problem telling people what to do, but I can‚Äôt seem say things like ‚Äòyour behaviour is unacceptable yada yada yada‚Äô. \n\nAnyone else? Thoughts? Opinions? Or am I just an unhealthy ESTJ because I prefer to avoid conflict?

2	It depends on a few things, but in general, it's not too difficult for me to tell someone off. \n\nFor example, if I am confident that whoever is on the receiving end of my "wrath" is not going to cut all ties from me afterward, then I have no problems laying into them. \n\nIf I know that there is a sensitive person who would not take it well, then I'm not going to bother. That would put me in a counterproductive situation where nothing would be accomplished. That being said, for me "telling someone off" is less of a personal attack, and more of a "please listen to me, I'm trying to help you see how to be better" type of thing. \n\nI take care of my ISFP uncle by doing the tasks around the house that he cannot do anymore because he is getting older. Sometimes he will stubbornly go outside and lift a heavy piece of machinery and potentially hurt himself. I cannot stand this, so I tell him off. I don't take pride in it, and I don't like to tell him off because he can be overly sensitive sometimes, but I care more about his well being than his feelings. In this case, I don't find it difficult to tell him off because I know that he still loves and accepts me for who I am, and knows that I mean well. We have a... Black and White relationship. We can either get along really really well, or he just bugs me sometimes. \n\nI'm in college, and I study music in a place where there are a lot of my peers who think it's okay to slack off, not practice, skip class and prioritize debauchery over academics. I wouldn't feel comfortable telling my peers off in this instance because they would think I'm a stuck-up goodie two shoes and not want to be around me. \n\n
2	No, I can‚Äôt tell people off. ENTJ employee of mine is much better at it. They‚Äôre more quick-witted and enjoy arguments. 
4	In my experience, ESTJs with more developed Fi are more aware of, and considerate of, others' feelings; making "telling people off" more complicated.  I have seen this change in myself as I've gotten older and life experience has forced growth of my Fi.
1	It depends. And it also depends on what estj you are I am 3w2 so yes. But especially life choices. I know what‚Äôs right but I can‚Äôt tell others what‚Äôs right. Like I have no backbone even if I know that lifestyle choice is wrong to say so. I want to but yeah, I use to be better at it but had less friends. I know practically everyone these days. I‚Äôve had issues of saying no though.
12	Dealing with types that aren't very resilient	Consider myself a healthy ESTJ but my biggest struggle by far is dealing with other types that aren't very resilient or motivated. They go through struggles and don't recover, or they get jealous of other people's accomplishments and never consider how they could do the same. \n\nHad a friend tell me once that they wouldn't survive the things I have, but I cannot for the life of me figure out why. Seems to me we're all capable of growing, learning, and accomplishing things, but maybe not. \n\nAny tips on gaining a better understanding of people that don't bounce back or aren't as motivated?\n\n&#x200B;
13	ESTJ seems to be a type likely to still perform despite difficult circumstances, or even considering the challenges and adversity as exciting and thrilling.\n\nI think ESTJ can be exceptional among the types in that kind of resilience, and that can be a model by which the others learn how to perform better.\n\nStill, the things that motivate the types are likely to vary. Accurately noticing what the motivating factors are would be very important if you want to motivate people.\n\nMy observations: A lot of the time our motivation and reward systems in our brains are hijacked by things like drugs, food, etc. Helping people with those things first is pretty standard in trying to pull people out of their funks.\n\nAnother aspect of it is that sometimes people just value significantly differing things. One wants a lot of money, and another mainly just wants donuts. Which one is right? Both maybe? That kind of thing gets complicated.
11	My ESTJ boyfriend grew up in an abusive household, and he responded as you would expect. ESTJs never let anything affect them, and I‚Äôm in awe of his resilience every day. \n\nHis sister, a more emotional type, didn‚Äôt turn out as well. It completely broke her, and she has been a hot mess for her entire life. \n\nBoyfriend has serious resentment towards his sister because she can‚Äôt seem to get over it and get her act together. I mean they don‚Äôt speak at all, it‚Äôs pretty bad. \n\nI tried to tell my boyfriend that his response to abuse is really extraordinary and that he is an extraordinary person. His sister is an ordinary person, responding to childhood trauma the way an ordinary person would. She‚Äôs not a bad person, she‚Äôs just a regular person. Not a moron, just not an ESTJ. She has a different operating system and doesn‚Äôt measure her life by efficiency. \n\nWe‚Äôre still working on this together. I think the best thing to do is shift your mindset from ‚Äúother people are not resilient‚Äù to ‚ÄúI have much more resilience than the average person.‚Äù
7	I've learned that resilience has to do with your locus of control.  This is the degree to which you believe you are, or are not, in control of your own life.  Those with an internal locus of control can be quite resilient because we believe that we are able to change things.  Those with an external locus believe they are powerless or their efforts will be futile.  ESTJ's are basically the poster child for internal locus of control.  So when you are dealing with someone not as resilient as yourself, just remind yourself that their inborn temperament + their experiences have taught them that they aren't in control of their life to a large degree.  If you have influence over that person, you could help them to have a more internal locus of control.  Read pages like this one for ideas: https://themotivationmindset.com/internal-locus-of-control/
5	Well not everyone is for what we are for and not everyone‚Äôs big thing is achievement and work. I don‚Äôt usually have issues unless they are really just usually unmotivated and throws themselves a huge pity party.\n\nI am a blind ESTJ. And I‚Äôve accomplished quite a bit in life, more than a lot of blind people. In fact I was a representative at this organization because I was the model of achievement what blind people can be. I‚Äôve done everything from navigate a new city, to campaigning and running fliers for a congressman‚Äôs campaigns, being a journalist, attending a regular college. I am basically not blind. I am a normal person and more haha! So in the blind community I am often as seen as amazing and kind of a role model. I want to be like that, but no one really tries. My problem is when people just sit at home and throw themselves a pity party. I don‚Äôt usuallly bother to say too much unless it gets extreme. OH well they can do something sit at home and argue with each other. Hahaha! It‚Äôs really sad. But yeah, I know what you mean, but for most people I just see it as not their goal. I am the busy body blind person. I am also very well liked in my community and involved in it. But yeah,I can get the frustration, but at the same time I tell myself that‚Äôs just not the aim of most others who are not the estj or xstj types.
6	I‚Äôm the same, I find it challenging to empathise in these situations, because I struggle with different things and therefore can‚Äôt understand why others find it so difficult. What I do, if someone says they have anxiety (just an example), I think of it like getting nervous but multiplied by 1000 and uncontrollable. Then I‚Äôm like oh shit, if you need me to do anything, I‚Äôm here. Obviously anxiety and nerves aren‚Äôt the same, but that‚Äôs the only way I can kind of understand what they‚Äôre going through.
2	I have no tips. I don‚Äôt actually believe ‚Äòless resilient‚Äô is a good excuse. Everyone goes through crap, everyone breaks and falls apart. Everyone makes choices. Owning your choices, good or bad,and recognizing your own power is what makes a person capable of striving to pull their shit back together. \n
2	Okay so you have to ask these questions\n\nA: Do you care about this person\n\nB: Dose this persons failure make your life worse.\n\nIf the awnser  to both of these questions is no, then why do you care? If the awnser to\n\nA is yes: Then take them aside and explain how this is hurting you. If they don‚Äôt want to get better this is now there problem. \n\nB is yes: Explain to the person how there hurting you. Offer to help them. If they refuse to get better, try getting other people you think they‚Äôll listen to involved. If they still don‚Äôt listen move on with your life and due the best you can.\n
2	Also, if your going to hold yourself above abuse victims pleas go fuck yourself.

0	ENFP -\nIs the question about stagnation caused by emotion? Surely since you're not an emotional type, you could think that maybe you don't understand what it's like to have emotion running through your brain 24/7? For me, if something is not quite right emotionally, that shit needs to be sorted out, and as fully as possible if I plan to move on with my life most successfully. The stuff that I don't resolve stays with me, eating away at me when I'm alone.\nLooking at rational reasons to null introverted feeling isn't possible since it's my auxiliary function to feel what I'm feeling and find where the problem lies and then deal with it.\n
2	Need some advice with my ESTJ father...	INTJ female here.\n\nWARNING: Really Long! I'm not giving a short version because I actually want good advice. Sorry.\n\nHey ESTJs, I need some advice on how to calm this situation with my ESTJ father. To start out, I don't blame him for any of this, we are very different in the ways we think, so this completely went over my head until he brought up how much I disrespected him. Of course, being the INTJ that I am, I was just thinking logically as to what I should do or not, and I didn't think about how he would see what I did as disrespectful, even though I suppose it was. My mind was in a totally different thinking process than his was, so I just didn't consider it.\n\nMy father (ESTJ) was playing a board game with my friends and siblings. He had just got home after everyone had eaten dinner, so obviously everyone was full and content, except for him of course since he hadn't eaten yet. Everyone was playing the game except one of my friends and myself. \nHe requested that I make him some Venison steak and potatoes since that's what we ate. I know, simple request, I should have just made it and not overthought it.\nI thought that since it was just my friend and I, she'd be left out from everyone if I spent (roughly) 40 minutes making the venison steak the way he likes it, and it's 10:00pm so it'd be late and I wouldn't be able to entertain our guest. \nSo, I decided to give him just potatoes, extra so that he wouldn't still be hungry. This was quick, It was late, I could spend time with my friend so she wouldn't be left out, and I still gave him one of the things he wanted.\n\nMy friend brought up the potatoes to him, and then I went up about two minutes later.\nI didn't think it was a big deal that I just made him potatoes, but apparently it was. \nHe left the game and said he wanted to talk to be for 5 minutes. I got a huge lecture (won't go into detail with everything he said) on how I disrespected and embarrassed him. \nHe does a lot for me, so he brought that up, saying that I couldn't do this one simple thing so I must not care about him. I told him that I do care about him and then I explained to him why I didn't do it, he got angry, only saw it as disrespectful, and then told me he was going to make the venison himself. I blocked him and said I'd make it for him, he angrily barged past and told me that he would make it himself and that I could do whatever it was I wanted to do. \n\nI don't exactly know what to do from here. I ended up telling my friends that he decided not to play, and then I went to bed since my friend took his spot, so I didn't have to worry about her anymore.\n\nAlso I realized that I forgot to apologise during our discussion, but I'm not going to right now because I might accidentally cause a scene and probably embarras him more, as well as myself.\n\nTo me, this wasn't a big deal until he made it into one, and he ended up embarrassing both of us when I don't think anyone else was even paying attention before. I'm not saying I wasn't in the wrong, but to me this is pretty dumb and I feel childish even having to write this.\nAny advice? How would you feel if you were him and how would you want to be apologized to?\nWe just think so differently, I wasn't expecting him to be so mad. I wish it had, but it didn't even cross my mind that he'd see it that way.
2	INTJ (Socionics ILI) is a special case because they are the supervisor relationship to ESTJ (Socionics LSE) in Socionics. It's hard to see how it applies in this situation, but this issue of disrespect might have been building up over time where he feels disrespected through no fault of your own.\n\nI'm kind of similar in that I am an ESTJ with INTJ mother and brother. I don't know what it's like to have that as a child though. The easiest solution to healing these types of relationships is to get some physical or emotional distance. Try to avoid cooperating on things or teaching each other things. Alternatively, get someone else's help in handling a request when you think that there might be an issue.\n\nRespect and control are both important issues for ESTJs, with respect being even more important for guys.\n\n\nhttp://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=Supervision
1	It sounds like he was hangry and in retrospect should probably realize that he is a grown man capable of feeding himself and the world doesn‚Äôt stop and tend to him just because he walked into the room. And making you feel super lousy about that was pretty lousy on his part. \n\nI also have an estj father. I‚Äôve spent the better part of my life butting heads with him over stuff like this, so I‚Äôm not sure I can give particularly helpful advice. We are rough on each other and while we don‚Äôt have a horrible relationship, we don‚Äôt have a great one, either. I suspect you have your own unique family dynamic where you don‚Äôt kick him in the pants while he‚Äôs down, which is probably better.\n\nBut it will likely just blow over now that presumably he‚Äôs been fed. When I have an ugly toddler tantrum of an Fi moment, I prefer to leave it in the past and hope people forgive me for being a crabby spoiled baby.
1	To be honest, I feel resentful when my partner (ENTP) and i (ESTJ) get home from work and he heads straight for the computer or sits on the couch and leaves me with cleaning, getting dinner ready etc. \n\nWe do the same routine every day but he still needs me to ask him to do stuff only because he's not routine orientated. It could of been built up resentment or maybe your dad just had a really hard day.  He sees you having fun with your friends and thinks well i just worked all day, and shes been home with her friends, she can do this 1 thing for me. \n\nIt could be about control, but for me it would be resentment. And when you didnt do as he asked he saw it as being lazy and disrespectful.\n\nI would just let it go, you can apologise in the morning if you want, but he'll get over it. \n\nAs long as the person doesn't do it again, i don't need an apology. Actions speak louder than words.\n\nThats my opinion anyway.
1	Estj 3w2 here.\n\nI think I understand where this is going. I do a lot for others myself. I think it‚Äôs the mentality of I do much for you, can you just do one thing for me? It‚Äôs like that with my infp sister sometimes it‚Äôs slightly different and it‚Äôs more of a lack of appreciation. Maybe you could have invited your friend in to the kitchen to hang out? I would simply say sorry I was wrong and I appreciate what you do for me, I will never do it again and not do it. I would be fine with it if it‚Äôs never done again, but if it‚Äôs done over and over and over again, I‚Äôll get tired of it. I have a friend currently in that situation with me. I usually don‚Äôt get this angry but it‚Äôs pushed through quite a few barriers.
1	INTJ Here, I completely understand your situation. My dad is also ESTJ. Although, being in your shoes I would know this was completely my fault. Because I should know what rules my dad imposes and requires. In which case he would always get priority over friends. I would have invited my friend over to the kitchen to make the meal for him together or something. ESTJs on a basic level are easy to deal with, sometimes annoying or frustrating, but easy. They have rules, if you care about them, follow them. Especially if you‚Äôre below them like a case of a parent.
6	Do you actually LIKE to work or are you just good at it?	Please help me understand...who TF *likes* to work?? Why can my ESTJ friend go to work for months without taking breaks?
18	I LIKE to accomplish things. Also I like to be on top of the socio-economic hierarchy. \n\nI am not sure about your friend, but at least in socionics LSE's are (amongst other things) known to be the "Grinders".
8	Both. I like to complete things my way and I don't like when someone "helps" or covers for me while on vacation. Everyone knows ESTJ way is best ;)
7	I‚Äôm good at getting things done and I like the feeling of satisfaction when I check things off the list. I like my coworkers, so work is social for me.\n\nI don‚Äôt like taking vacations, partially because I hate the idea of making someone else‚Äôs week harder so I can sit home in my pajamas. I worry they‚Äôll find the added work overwhelming or screw it up. And I worry that I‚Äôll like doing nothing so much better and it‚Äôll make going back to work massively depressing. \n\nI‚Äôve taken singular days off throughout the year, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve taken consecutive days off since last October.
4	I love what I do for work, and the long hours don‚Äôt bother me. I put in 60-70 hours a week because I find my work stimulating, challenging, and exciting... and I‚Äôm good at it. Sales is a competitive line of work and I like putting in more work (and thus achieving better results) than my peers.
3	I like both, I love making people happy and smile - that makes me feel like I‚Äôve accomplished something. I also love people, so yeah, work is great 
5	I hate working. I would love to stay at home and potter around the house but i work because i have priorities and responsibilities also i get a kick out of knowing that if i didnt go to work, someone else would screw up and it would take me twice as long to get it back to order when i returned. \n\nI work from 8am to 4pm, and at around 430-5 sometimes 5.30-6 my boss is like "why are you still here belindaberry!, go home". I literally cannot leave without finishing what i started. The last holiday i took was sept last year and I always feel guilty when i call in sick.
1	Wow, for months! Lol. Do you realize normal person has like 2-3 weeks of vacation tipe depending on a  country and months without a break is nothing extraordinary.\n\nKnowning that months without a break sounds wow to you says a lot about your type (lazy millenial, lol)
1	I find work fun, it‚Äôs actually my favourite way to spend my time tbh
1	Love to work. Almost never take a whole day off. Had to take a cruise without WiFi to force myself to stop. 
1	late to the party but i fucking love my job.  ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT.\n\ni'd rather be working, or prepping something for work. I'm always thinking about work. CONSTANTLY. and i work for myself so there's "no reason" to stop except that taxing thing called a social life.  
1	Depends on what estj you are I am estj 3w2 and yes I love working on things. Accomplishment is good like other people said. I also like community service type work. The only time I don‚Äôt like work is burnout.
1	I‚Äôm an ESTJ and work hard because work is such a large chunk of my time that I may as well have a good time with it. This means being competent, valuable and a positive influence on my workplace. If I was to be crap at my job, I‚Äôd honestly have a hard time seeing the purpose of life (unless I tried something else). But ESTJ‚Äôs are long term thinkers, and I want a career. I want momentum and reliability. Also the thought of taking time off, and things changing (someone else learnt your role, social dynamics shift) also gives me a sense of lack of control. I wouldn‚Äôt want to come back and be behind either. \n\nI think ESTJ‚Äôs work hard because they big-picture care about the amount of time their working life will take up of their lives.
56	Your ESTJ Care and Handling User Guide and Manual	**Congratulations!**\n\nYou have just selected your very own ESTJ Executive unit! As our most popularly selected unit available you are sure to be pleased. In fact, satisfaction is guaranteed! If you are unsatisfied with your unit simply submit a complaint directly to your unit itself.\n\n## Your ESTJ will come with the following accessories:\n\n* One (1) Professionally Tailored Power Suit‚Ñ¢\n* One (1) Set of lounge clothes\n* One (1) formal outfit for religious and formal events\n* One (1) Laptop\n* Two (2) Cell phones\n* One (1) Gym Membership\n* One (1) Pair of smart gloves for texting\n* One (1) Bluetooth headset (for talking to people while talking to people)\n\n## Software\n\nYour ESTJ comes pre-programmed with the following traits;\n\n**Te:** As the dominant function, this provides your ESTJ unit with unmatched efficiency and a keen understanding of what works in a practical setting. This function provides your unit with high levels of organization and practicality as well as a blunt clarity in communication style that other units may find abrasive.\n\n**Si:** This function provides your unit with a mental database of previously established effective methods of handing situations it has encountered before that can be recalled quickly when needed.\n\n**Ne:**¬†This function provides your unit with a boost to creative problem solving when facing a new situation or when previously established methods are no longer effective.\n\n**Fi:**¬†This function provides your unit with moral indignation and superiority as well as curiously strong attachment bonds to carefully selected partners. As the inferior function your ESTJ will avoid accessing this software as much as possible as it directly interferes with their default mode.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nThere is no need for a quick-start procedure. Your ESTJ will be fully functional and activated right out of the box. In fact, there is no box because excess packaging is highly inefficient.\n\n## Modes\n\nGet Shit Done Mode (*default*)- When in this mode your ESTJ will complete any and all necessary tasks required for successful completion of the assigned goals. In order to activate this mode, your ESTJ will require suggestion(s) and/or idea(s) to be presented. If more than one suggestion or idea is presented your ESTJ will automatically select the most effective or efficient one and proceed to get that shit done. This mode can be intermittently active for however long is necessary to complete the project.\n\nDo Absolutely Nothing Mode - Automatically activated after completion of a major project deadline. Your ESTJ unit will cease all productive function and instead do absolutely nothing until it is sufficiently recharged.\n\nOh Hell No Mode - Activated whenever someone assumes your ESTJ unit will get shit done but neither asks nor directly informs your unit. When activated your ESTJ unit will express noticeable aggravation towards the assuming person and refuse to complete the task as a matter of principle.\n\nYou‚Äôre Doing It Wrong Mode - When activated this mode has two possible outcomes; 50% chance of activating the¬†‚Äúfine, give it to me‚Äù response. In such cases your ESTJ will assume responsibility for a task which they no longer can observe another unit fail to satisfactorily complete. If this response does not activate your ESTJ will simply watch in smug amusement considering it a fitting lesson. This mode will deactivate after your unit says¬†‚ÄúI told you so‚Äù\n\nTouchy-Feely Mode (*locked*) - Randomly activated by what is assumed to be fluctuating levels of hormones and emotions within your ESTJ unit. Also can usually be unlocked and activated by having your ESTJ unit watch an action movie with a strong emotional component (i.e. Big Hero 6)\n\n## Relationships with Other Units\n\n**NF:** Finds them confusing but likable. Good project partners that provide good energy to a group.\n\n**NT:** Generally very confused by them. Sometimes Infuriating, but your ESTJ is unable to walk away from what it perceives to be a mess. Often surprised that NTs do not walk away first. Confused by their seeming inability to accept statements at face value and instead to analyze everything.\n\n**SJ:** These units make sense to your ESTJ, who considers them to be good people provided they are willing to try something new when the old methods do not work.\n\n**SP:** Frequently cause eye rolling in your ESTJ. Finds them fun to have around but hard to take seriously or respect. When SP units feed your ESTJ it will probably like them, but may still not respect them.\n\n## Feeding\n\nFor optimal performance, provide your ESTJ with food on a regular basis. While it will cook for itself, cooking is seen as an interruption to getting shit done. Cooking is inefficient because you have to cook again at the next meal.\n\n## Grooming\n\nYour ESTJ will groom itself. No need to concern yourself there.\n\n## Sleeping\n\nYour ESTJ will automatically enter sleep mode when the body shuts down. Any attempt to induce sleep prior to shut down will be met with hostile resistance.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n*What is my ESTJ thinking?*  \nWhatever the last thing your ESTJ said was.\n\n*What is my ESTJ feeling?*  \nNeutral unless otherwise stated\n\n*How do I plan a date for my ESTJ?*  \nCome up with a detailed plan and submit it to your ESTJ. Wait for notes providing suggestions for improvement. Follow the notes.\n\n*Why does my ESTJ have so much criticism?*  \nYour ESTJ is not criticizing you - just your plans and ideas. Your ESTJ is simply trying to help you improve your ideas and plans as much as possible.\n\n*But have you considered‚Ä¶.*  \nYes. Your ESTJ unit has already considered that. Thank you for your input.\n\n**Again, Congratulations of your new ESTJ unit! Now go be productive!**

8	Why?!	
10	I feel victimized by this.
5	I think all the types got it pretty bad from google, except for ENFPs
4	Hahaha, I mean, I'm not going to deny the second suggestion
4	In my experience, people have limited experience with ESTJs and think anybody they don't like and tries to control them is one. I was shocked to find out a guy I know was an ESTJ after he took the test. He is very friendly, likes to joke around, minds his own business. Then again, I'm neither a coworker nor employee of his, and he works almost nonstop.
2	They're just jealous, yall are the best <3
2	My ESTJ isn't "manipulative"...she is just constantly optimizing the current and future events for maximum gain for herself and immediate circle, while simultaneously retroactively re-describing the past.
2	ü§î What is the sweetest thing someone has done for you?	AND what is her/his mbti type?
1	I‚Äôm not good at showing my emotions. Whenever someone does something for me, my only response is ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù If it came to a point that someone would offer their kidney for me, the best thing I can respond with is ‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù and I‚Äôll just leave it at that. \n\nI like to do grand gestures, and I suppose if someone tops those, I would express my gratitude more openly. But until then, a simple thank you will suffice. 
1	Yeah, I don‚Äôt know if I can remember. There are probably a lot of them. But nothing stands out.\n\n\nSometimes it‚Äôs other ESTJs. Like one of my favorite professor he‚Äôs EXTJ I think I think ESTJ was like are you taking another one of my classes? It‚Äôs like please tell me yes. Haha! I was like yes, I need to anyway. I am quite popular so many things. Honestly. There was a teacher in high school I think he‚Äôs estj or istj. But I didn‚Äôt have much friends in high school there are a number of reasons, but this teacher was like what are you doing out there? I told him waiting for my class. He was across the hall and he said well come in here, why don‚Äôt you, and I hung out ever since in his class. There are a lot.
1	I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶
8	ESTJ‚Äôs & Breakups?	What are some things y‚Äôall do during breakups or tough times that help you cope? \n\nMy roommate recently was dumped by her boyfriend of 3 years, I would really love to support & be there for her but don‚Äôt quite understand her thought process. I am an ISFJ & came here looking for ideas to help her out & to motivate her to go to class etc. I listen to her & try being there for her but is there anything more specific I can be doing?? \nThank you guys :)
9	ESTJs often go to their shadow, INFP, during break ups. I always became an introverted homebody.  Sad music. Cathartic movies. Order takeout. 
10	Do things to take her mind off the break up :)\n\nPersonally-idk whether it's an ESTJ thing or not- but I thoroughly dislike when people tell me everything is going to be ok and 'you're ok', if I'm sitting on the ground crying, I am probably not ok. 
7	All of these are on target, when in pain I tend to want to withdraw but that leads to awful effects for me personally. I agree with taking them out extra points if it‚Äôs something new so they can really get lost in the experience. I also agree I don‚Äôt want to hear patronizing little statements like ‚Äúit‚Äôll be ok‚Äù, I know that what I need is distraction from wallowing
4	Due to our extroverted nature, I think it would be good for her to go out! After my breakup, I went and did things I hadn‚Äôt done before like clubbing. Might help her! 
1	Distractions I usually use distractions.
6	How do you go about liking someone romantically?	Hello, ENTJ here \n\nQuestion: how do you go about in developing a romantic interest in someone? \n\nDetails: \nFor example, I analyze people constantly, subconsciously and consciously. Within the first meeting(s), I can determine what this person can mean to me and if I go towards a romantic path, I can determine if it can work longer term or not. Basically, from the start, I decide if I like this person romantically. \n\nAs an ESTJ, Do you take time to develop feelings for someone? If so, about how long? And what is your thought process behind it? Do you choose or feel that you like this person? \n\n\nThanks! 
12	Fucking it up. That‚Äôs how I go about it:)
5	It took me 8 months to realise I liked someone, the feelings kind of crept up on me. \n\nThen I assess everything. Do we have common interests? Do we have common values? Can I see myself being with them forever? As well as generally how they interact with people and what kind of ‚Äòvibe‚Äô I get.\n\nIf I can‚Äôt see myself with the person in the future, then I won‚Äôt do anything about it.
2	I am an ESTJ and my approach is the same as yours. I know it when I like someone in 1-2 meetings or not. I don‚Äôt take time to develop feelings for someone. Once I figure out I like someone, I plan how I‚Äôll go about asking them out on a date or something
1	I mean same as you I can analyze people very quickly and know where they‚Äôre at on their life path which is usually wins behind me so that goes no where. I think it depends what you want out of a relationship really. I‚Äôve been forcing myself out of my routine to meet people lately because I‚Äôm looking to change my lifestyle. I‚Äôve got one guy right now that after date one I can tell you just needs a female friend to boost his confidence but it‚Äôs probably not going anywhere long term. And I‚Äôve got another that‚Äôs it‚Äôs gonna be purely carnal with.
5	What does an ESTJ actually want?	I ask, "Hey, where do you want to go eat lunch?". They give me a blank stare.\n\nI say, "I want to go eat lunch outside." and they might ask, "Why do you want to each lunch outside?"\n\nOnce I explain it's because of the breeze and sunlight, they'll almost immediately be like, "All right, let's go."\n\nIt's like this for everything. Whenever I ask them what they want, they don't seem to have a clue. Once I tell them what *I* want, they go along with it. What do they really want? Do they actually know? If so, why won't they tell me directly?
16	ESTJ wants simplicity.
9	In my case about the blank stare, I am thinking about what have I eaten before, are certain more places better to diet) suggest for you to enjoy, do I want a drink, is it kid friendly, is it expensive, and is that ok?\nWith the picnic, that is more work, why do you want to make more work. You had a good reason for a picnic so go for it. 
6	ESTJ wants the best.
4	ESTJ wants to stay home.
4	It is characteristic to this type to not know what they want (inferior Fi). They like to serve others.
5	Too many people have told me I'm bossy, so in an effort to not be bossy, I try my best to let others make these decisions.
3	That could mean he does not care where to eat (it is too irrelevant to the quality of his life/day).\nOnce he has a preference (for example at a certain day he craves pizza, he would answer lets go for a pizza).
2	Well, being sensors, they understand your want for the breeze and sunlight, and so they agree as they too would probably like it.
2	Because they have zero anticipation for the future so act like everything in their lives is already perfect. Lol
1	Sometimes I say that but not often, and sometimes I‚Äôll just go with it. So yeah. Sometimes it‚Äôs a group decision. Sometimes the issue is not thought of as important but more than not I have an opinion. Especially where to eat haha!
5	ESTJ husband hates our INFJ daughters ENFP boyfriend	Im married to my husband since 28 years. Our only daughter is 18 (soon 19). She didn‚Äôt started to date until recently as she is very introverted and pretty shy. My husband and I both agreed that we would have allowed her to date far earlier, but she never had any interest in dating. My daughter is great and I am really proud of her. She is not only very smart and conscientious but also really sweet and nice to everyone. I just sometimes wish she would be less shy. \n\nFour months ago our daughter started to date a guy whom I will call Noah. He is really kind and caring and also very understanding of her insecurities. He is exactly what she needs. He is very extroverted and a bit careless but in my opinion he is good for her and totally unthreatening as he has clearly a good heart. Noah is very polite towards my husband and me. And I think he really wants us to like him. \n\nMy daughter is clearly in love with him and he loves her as much as she loves him. They are really cute together.\n\nBut my husband hates Noah. In theory he is comfortable with her dating, but in practice he just doesn‚Äôt wants her to date at all. He is really mean to Noah and basically bullies him. He also often jokes that he could hurt/kill Noah. Noah stays respectful, but its clear that Noah is not too sad when my husband is away.\n\nOur daughter is really offended by my husbands behaviour. She thinks that he should trust her more. And I feel that my husbands behaviour pushes her away from us. (Noahs Parents are both really nice to her.) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat should I do?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR My husband bullies our daughters nice and caring boyfriend.\n\n&#x200B;
2	Oh dear! This sounds like a frustrating situation for all people involved. Hopefully I can provide some insight, as my mom is an ESTJ and I am an INFJ. It seems that the issue involves loss of control. Your husband is used to being the predominant male figure in your daughter‚Äôs life, so the thought of your daughter placing her trust into another male might be daunting to him. This might be the root of his unreasonable contempt for what you describe as a kind and caring boyfriend. I know that my mom perceives most young people as irresponsible and is highly critical of the people my sister and I have dated. She truly believes she knows best when it comes to dating, even if her assessment of our partners isn‚Äôt actually correct. I think it would be worth having a conversation with him. Let him know that you understand that letting your daughter date someone for the first time might seem like letting go and losing control, but your daughter must be granted a certain degree of autonomy as she grows older. Explain that while her boyfriend is young and lacks the maturity that will come with age, he is still a caring person and has brought out the best in your daughter. Perhaps you should let him know that his comments make her boyfriend feel unwelcome and might alienate your daughter. Although I don‚Äôt know the perfect solution, I empathize with your situation and wish you the best. 
1	ESTJ mom here. Adore my daughter‚Äôs ENFP fianc√©. He brings a whole other dynamic to the family. Just have to get used to a more flighty way of living. 
1	Have you tried explaining why it is both practical and efficient for him to show politeness and respect to the boyfriend?  Analyze it as if all players were robots, and certain inputs (death threats) will have certain results (need to choose between dad and boyfriend).  When I have had ESTJ relationship problems I word it like that and stress the efficiency of cooperation.  Also, since he's a guy, if you can make it seem like his idea it'll always go over better.  I love my ESTJ's but sometimes they need to remember that going around feelings is more efficient in the long run than going through them.  Going through feelings of family members means you'll have to deal with tears and emotions later and it's SUCH a pain.
1	Have you asked him why he doesn‚Äôt like the boyfriend? Is it a personality clash? Is there something he doesn‚Äôt like about the boyfriend?

7	ESTJ under powerful spell of narcissistic but charismatic ENFJ?	INFP here. Can someone explain what's going on? I have a friend who's an ESTJ, who's friends with an obvious narcissist. The N can act friendly and personable, but his real personality is nothing like that. If you slightly get on his bad side, he'll turn other people against you. He openly threatens to destroy people's reputation. Uses moral language to manipulate people and bolster his image, bullies the weak, etc. The ESTJ knows all of that and I've talked to him about it, and he agrees with me...then he goes right back to associating with him. Obviously it's his business, I'm just trying to understand why this is happening. I know my friend isn't shitty himself, he's genuinely well-intentioned so for now I'm assuming he doesn't actually believe that the ENFJ is a complete asshat due to weakness in the presence of Fe and Ni. 
4	ESTJ with a close n-ish friend. We have a great relationship, we stay in our lanes. As for other people, well, I don‚Äôt know how they manage him, but it‚Äôs not my problem. 
5	I like being with outcasts and weirdos a bunch of the time. I'm also pretty good with barriers and think troublesome people need friends too. That said, I don't think that I've ever been friends with a narcissist and I wouldn't be surprised if this stayed as a distant friendship.
2	Loyalty.
2	ENFJ's are very manipulative and clever with it.  Narcissists are very manipulative and clever about it.  That combo is dangerous, and can suck unsuspecting people in like a vortex.  Good luck to your friend, and to you, because he likely won't come out until he has gotten hurt by it.
1	I knew and ENFJ like that. He wanted to be a double of malcom x and called himself blinky x haha! I never like the guy. If nothing bad happens leave it, not sure how you can persuade him to stop liking him, hopefully if the enfj does something realy bad he will see it.
3	Personality types and underwear types? (x-post /r/mbti)	Hello there.\n\nI did a bit of research on that topic, but didn't find anything meaningful (searched through google scholar).\n\nI was wondering if I could find correlation (and perhaps causation) from psychological types to the type of underwear worn.\n\nHere's the [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Q0O9FFHmOZKay1ztg9g39iEsP9gjGIYwejsnFrjGZ9Y/edit).\n\nFeel  free to comment on those questions aswell (with your MBTI type  identified) if you want. I figured this sort of survey would be okay  since there was a fetish survey a week ago on [/r/MBTI](https://www.reddit.com/r/MBTI). Hope it's alright!
2	ESTJ generally prefer any practical covering for their genitalia and other gonads as long as it is lightweight, durable, reasonably priced, and manufactered with chocolate.
1	You probably should change 'commando' to 'none'. Usually surveys should have no idioms to be as foolproof as possible.\n\nAlso I would abstract the choices to 'sexy', 'comfortable', 'traditional', etc. Some of the choices seem rather redundant ('Bikini' and 'G-String'). 
2	Whatsapp Group for Extroverts	Hi Everyone, it's a very active group and it's super fun! Everyone is hilarious and very friendly. It's equal number Thinkers and Feelers but mostly females so it would be nice to have some variety!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://chat.whatsapp.com/Ey15CEhWJag1Q1sstl8IrA](https://chat.whatsapp.com/Ey15CEhWJag1Q1sstl8IrA)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS:  If you're unable to add yourself (Apple users?), PM me your number and I will add you :)\n\n\-----\n\nPPS: Of course Introverts are welcome to join too! (But keep in mind majority are extroverts)
1	Sure, I will join.  Then I will spawn and there will be 2 of me.  We shall cycle and when the time comes we will hear the irresistable calls again and soon, we shall become 4, then 8, then 45, then 173, ad. Nauseum?  We're going to get you, my pretties, and your little dog too!!! *cackles in glee*
1	Er. Okay sounds interesting. Don‚Äôt know if I have time for it though.
25	Wow I'm an infp and I came here to see how the opposite personality thinks, and whattya know this page is just infps trying to figure out estjs	
10	The acronym and metrics are opposites.\n\n|Metric \\ Type|ENFJ|INFP|ESTJ|ISTP|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Introvert / Extrovert|Extrovert|Introvert|Extrovert|Introvert|\n|Intuition / Sense|Intuition|Intuition|Sense|Sense|\n|Feel / Think|Feel|Feel|Think|Think|\n|Judge / Perceive|Judge|Perceive|Judge|Perceive|\n\nFunctions are not.\n\n|Function \\ Type|ENFJ|INFP|ESTJ|ISTP|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Hero|Fi|Fe|Te|Ti|\n|Parent (Aux)|Ne|Ni|Si|Se|\n|Child|Si|Se|Ne|Ni|\n|Inferior|Te|Ti|Fi|Fe|\n|\----|\----|\----|\----|\----|\n|Nemesis|Fe|Fi|Ti|Te|\n|Critic|Ni|Ne|Se|Si|\n|Trickster|Se|Si|Ni|Ne|\n|Demon|Ti|Te|Fe|Fi|\n\nIt's the functions that dictate behavior, among other things.\n\n~~INFP is functionally opposite of ENFJ.~~\n\n~~ESTJ is functionally opposite of ISTP.~~\n\nDepends on which "axis".
7	Nope.  This is sacred territory.  You need to learn more respect for your shadow!
3	Not *just* INFPs here trying to figure that out...
1	Ha ha...and ENFPs too! Us NF types are trying to analyse everyone. Tend to WAY over think things..
1	Lmao that‚Äôs exactly why I came here, I‚Äôm an INFP who is curious about who the ESTJ‚Äôs are
1	Oh my god, I'm so glad I'm not the only INFP trying to figure out these uncanny valley types.
1	There are a few of us lone rangers roaming around haha!
2	Supposed ESTJ took humanmetrics test and came out ENFP	Hi, I have a male friend (33) who was on an acid trip. I have always assumed him to be estj because of how hard he works, and how he barks at me but even though I have a sensitive nature, I have always felt he was trustworthy and does not mean any malicious intent. Anyway I have convinced him to take the human metrics test while he was on an acid trip and it came out enfp. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy question is, is there a possibility that he felt and thought differently when he took the test cause of his trip? I had assumed mbti was failsafe even if you were a little bit stoned. I would've expected istj or estp to come out, but definitely he is far from enfp. I am infp and no way in hell the guy is enfp.\n\nThanks!
2	Wow. Enfp here with an ESTJ gf... This would be an interesting experiment üòÇ
1	Yeah, when you are on substances your personality isn‚Äôt accurate. So we usually tell people do not try to be typed when on something.
9	How do ESTJs show love?	I'm an INFP (How I show love is self explanatory).\n\nMy best friend is an ESTJ. I'm just curious of how y'all usually show love. 
12	My ESTJ provides for me materially. Small gifts, food, etc. She's covered my costs for random things, expecting nothing in return. Bigger things too, like plane tickets for a trip together. She doesn't make more than me, and I have money (most of the time!). It took a while for me to realize the extent, and that it was a way she showed her love. 
7	ESTJ here. \n\nActs of service. (i.e. Taking care of dreaded tasks so you don't have to.)  Monetary generosity. Quality time.\n\nOf the "5 Love Languages", physical touch and words of affirmation are my least preferred.
7	Physical touch, acts of service, quality time.\n\nNot so much verbal shit
6	Acts of service
2	I feel like I show it a lot of ways that I honesty didn't even realize till I saw this post and thought about it... I am not nearly as patient or forgiving with others as I am with my husband. I'll explain things or keep my cool wayyy better and longer with him than anybody because I care for him more than anybody,,, \n\nI like to provide and take care of him, maybe it will be saying I'll go the g very store so you don't have to or you should go play your game while I clean up from dinner... I like to make things special for him or be the sanctuary for him in those ways... sex is one area I'm like that big time. I believe that's part of loving someone, I also try to be very clear and honest with him because I feel a life partner deserves your best in those ways.
1	For me, I show some I appreciate them by praise and by showing interest in their lives. 
1	Service, if that person is needy things, and sometimes even tough love especially in the disabled communities.
5	Does unusual shit freak you out?	I could spend an entire day watching Dark 5 videos on Youtube. Is that the sort of thing you'd want shared with you? Asking for the sake of my ESTJ.
2	No response required. It's not like you're watching ISIS execution videos or anything. \n\n\n
1	Don't read too much into your personality type. It doesn't really mean much.
1	It does freak them out
3	Do ESTJs ever notice INFPs in public?	If so, what is their impression of them?
15	I always think, huh, I wonder how miserable I'd make them after a few months... 
5	How does someone notice a stranger's myers briggs type?
3	I notice them all the time. I don't say anything because I figure that they don't know anything about Socionics. Flirting or talking is usually very easy with them. The girls are usually very cute.
7	ESTJ Gf likes to assert power over me	Girlfriend who got results as an ESTJ, but sometimes I feel like she is an ESFJ.\n\nAnyways, while dating her, she has this common saying where she says:\n\n"I have so much power over you(my feelings, my actions), I like it."\n\n1)Are ESTJs girls normally like this?\n\n2) Is this unhealthy for me?/ Is this tolerable action? \n\nIn addition, throughout this relationship, I've never really set boundaries with her and she is clingy. \n\n3) What is an effective method to keep my stand and set my boundaries as I need to focus on my life?\n\nI wouldn't say this relationship has been the most healthiest relationships. Need an outsider's opinion. Thanks\n\nEdit: Not talking about submissivness is bed but in terms of my emotions. She enjoys being able to control my emotions.
9	    "I have so much power over you(my feelings, my actions), I like it."\n\nThat's super duper fucked up and unhealthy. If she's serious when she says that and that's legitimately what she's saying, you need to get out of there, that's a *huge* red flag if I've ever seen one. It's not normal in any sense of the word, she sounds like she's emotionally abusive. It's very common for the power dynamics to be a bit out of whack in  abusive relationships/relationships which may become abusive. Do you think it's possible to get out of there?
3	Hi, I‚Äôm ESTJ and sexually Dominant - that is to say that I absolutely get off on power exchange. There‚Äôs a possibility that your gf is like me and hasn‚Äôt quite figured it out yet. That happens and is, frankly, not your problem. \n\nSo, here‚Äôs the deal. Crystal clear boundaries and consent are where it‚Äôs at. It is absolutely not healthy for you gf to wield power over you for sexual kicks if you are not fully informed and completely okay with that, it is abuse (abuse does not have to be physical, it can be verbal, emotional, social, fiscal) and if you‚Äôre wondering out loud ‚Äúis this really okay?‚Äù the odds are good that it‚Äôs not. \n\n1) Nah, I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs an ESTJ thing and as a kink we‚Äôre fairly unusual. I mean, she might just be an asshole. Assholes are ubiquitous. \n\n2) Consent should be continuous, informed and enthusiastic. If you‚Äôre not all ‚ÄúFUCK YEAH SIT ON MY FACE AND MAKE ME YOUR GOOD BOY‚Äù the answer is probably no. Sometimes, we respond to fear and hurt with confusion - because it‚Äôs easier for us to process, and when you‚Äôre in survival mode, that can be the safest  option. It‚Äôs also very common for people in situations that are in violation of their consent to ‚Äúcheck out‚Äù and mentally remove themselves from the situation. \n\n3) ESTJs respect directness, so be forthright with her. If you think it‚Äôs true that she does have too much power over you, then tell her - and tell her that you‚Äôre not down with it. Make time for yourself and your friends, go do what you like doing. Have fun. A healthy response to that is ‚Äúsure thing, babe! Have fun and I‚Äôll see you next time‚Äù. Unhealthy responses include ‚Äúoh sure, fine, go be with your friends and try not to cheat on me‚Äù/‚ÄúIf you spend time with your friends I‚Äôll hurt myself or someone else‚Äù/ ‚Äúyou‚Äôre overreacting‚Äù etc.  \n\nAs an aside, again because you‚Äôve asked a really basic question, I suspect you are very uncomfortable asking for space - which is another sign that you‚Äôre in a toxic relationship. In healthy relationships, it‚Äôs always okay to ask for space and you‚Äôll always get it - no questions asked. \n
1	dude...RUN
1	"She is clingy" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nRun away.
1	psycho.  Run.
-5	ESTJs are definitely like that. Being alpha & domineering to the point of being manipulative assholes. But as I have said in the past we need assholes like these in our societies. We mostly got rid of them nowadays then a real asshole like Trump showed up and no one knew how to handle him. It got so bad the system sent over reeling granny Billary to teach him manners and we all saw what happened. This is what society gets when it lacks balance.
2	im trying to understand extroverted thinking?	as an infp i have inferor te.so i want to better myself by tapping into it so i can be more focused on my goals.....anyways what is extroverted thinking from a te dom like yourselfs.is te dropping away personal feelings and emotions to get the jov done?,is it getting to the outcome as fast as possible,is it,accomplishing goals,is it logical or more seeing the best steps to accomplish a goa......how would you describe te as a te dom?
3	The easiest part to explain is that it's about understanding what other people are thinking. For LSEs, this means that I am constantly processing what other people say for proper grammar, coherent logic, ambiguity, and potential jokes. If they break one of those rules, I probably need to have them clarify.\n\nIn contrast, I often need to talk to someone else to figure out what I think about something. Without that, I don't know what things I know are important enough to talk about and they mix together.
3	Te is, at its most basic, making decisions on the currently available data. The background of reddit is either white or some dark gray, doesn't matter how I or anyone feels about it or whether it needs changing. It is very result oriented almost always asking "does this fulfill its desired goal?". In this way they can manipulate rules and such, but they are really averse to breaking them outright. "I want x and y will get me to x ; I use y ; as long as its legal" would be the way of thinking for Te types.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt least that's what Socionics told me. :) 
3	Strengthening your Fi? INFP here!	Hello! I‚Äôm curious, what are some Fi problems that you folks have sometimes? Lately I want to strengthen my Te, so I‚Äôm curious, is there anyone out there who would want to talk about your Te and my Fi? I think we could learn a lot from each other! It would be especially cool if this turned into having an accountability parter for our Fi & Te goals! 
3	I'm an ENTJ so my relevant functions in this conversation are the same.  I find myself best able to access my deeper functions when my mind is "quiet".  It's almost as if each function has a voice of its own.  I can hear my Fi when I have all others shut up.
3	How do you experience and use Si-Fi interaction in your daily lives?	
11	I've always had the ability to remember very small details about someone, it's usually unintentionally. So I've always used it in a way to show others I care. \n\nI think Most ESTJs would agree that they show they care by doing, more than any other love language, so an ESTJ is going to remember your favorite drink/food and your birthday, or a favorite activity, and they are going to use that in a way that shows others they care. \n\nI also really like tradition, and not for dumb shit like religion or politics, but more for little things. \n\nEvery year for xmas my family does the same dinner and then I purchase a game for the whole family to play for that night. It started with my mom doing it for all the kids but one year she stopped buying games and that was always my favorite thing so I brought it back. The rest of the family enjoys it, my mom just didn't realize how much I loved it and wanted to keep doing it. \n\nI personally like creating little traditions for a lot of things. My roommate and I started doing Karaoke every Thursday night. I also had a tradition with an old roommate where we would make homemade french fries and watch netflix at least once a week. \n\nThose little things are always my absolute favorite and it has more to do with the other person than actually liking french fries or karaoke.  My day could be shitty but I always have something to look forward too.  \n\nI order the same drinks at the same coffee shops because I like what I drink but I also love seeing the baristas and building relationships with those people. Same with restaurants, ordering the same thing. \n\nI'm someone who knows that every person I interact with on a regular basis is someone worth getting to know. I'm not just networking for my own advantage, I'm doing it because I like people and if I'm going to want to use you as a recommendation or a way to get a promotion or something else, I want it to feel authentic. So I listen. I listen and I watch. And I pick up on your habits, and when you mention a like or a dislike, I'm going to remember it. I want to make sure I have people to reach out to if I need help, but I also will always help others when they need it. Networking isn't just about making sure I have people, but also making sure these are people I can go to to help others. \n\nHonestly, the simplest way you could describe Si Fi in my life is that I am a very intentional person. I'm not a random person, 99% of the time there is a reason behind what I am doing. The little details in an ESTJs life, are actually big details, it's just not as obvious.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n 
6	MBTI and Wholeheartedness	Hi Everyone,\n\nThis survey is entirely anonymous. Please answer as honestly as possible, even if you don't like your answers.\n\n[CLICK HERE FOR SURVEY](https://goo.gl/forms/jbXVEyrSwhedbK3C3)\n\nI'm really interested in Brene Brown's work on shame, vulnerability and wholeheartedness. I've noticed that, while MBTI focuses on highlighting our strengths, the discussions in many MBTI communities seem to focus on the struggle to overcome flaws or struggles with vulnerability. It seems that we're all drawn here to tinker around inside our behaviors, understand something important about ourselves, or understand the way we interact with the world. I'm wondering (informally, this is just for fun) if there's a pattern to MBTI personality types, and ease of wholeheartedness/living with courage.\n\nSo, I made this quick survey. Enjoy!(?)\n\nBonus Question: What socially or emotionally vulnerable experience has done the most to define your identity?
23	Thanks for being awesome!	Hi guys, I just want to say that ESTJs are amazing. You definitely don‚Äôt get enough credit for being the caring, principled, consistent, and loyal type you are. And yes, this is gushy but I don‚Äôt care. Just want to show appreciation.
5	They don't get the credit 'cause they are stubborn about their point of view.\n\nAlso they show lack of emotions when it comes to things like discussing things and details.\n\nOthers easily get mad for these reasons and they feel like the ExTJ does not deserve the credit even when they are truly awesome.
1	ESTJs are incredible!!!
1	Agreed.  I love my ESTJ friends.  The efficiency and refusal to get caught up in stupid emotions is beautiful.
4	A sub for relationship advice specific to MBTI!	
2	Maybe the mods can sticky this for a bit so we get some users over there!
5	How to remove yourself from an unhealthy estj?	So, I‚Äôm an infp and I‚Äôve been pretty close friends with an estj for almost 10 years now. She used to be so much fun when we were younger, as long as I didn‚Äôt bring up any topic that wasn‚Äôt purely fluffy/surfacey.  But of course, you can‚Äôt continue that way in a friendship for 10 years. She‚Äôs never been willing to listen to anyone with values or feelings different from her own. Her extreme unwillingness to listen and need to be right and in charge has lead to some really rough treatment of... a lot of people, including myself. She‚Äôs grown some in the past year, but she‚Äôs still very very mean to me. She thinks that she‚Äôs a very nice person. She always says that she‚Äôs a good problem solver in arguments and that she‚Äôs kind, but she‚Äôs neither of those things because of her stubbornness and need for power/being right. I also have finally accepted the fact that she does and says things to tear me down and hurt me on purpose. The relationship has honestly been toxic for years now, but I‚Äôve just been too afraid to end the friendship. I really don‚Äôt even know how to go about it. But I honestly just can‚Äôt stand it anymore and for the sake of my mental health, I just really need her out of my life. As stated above, she won‚Äôt listen to anything. So there‚Äôs no point in more attempts at gentle/civil conversation about how she‚Äôs hurting me. Please help me. I‚Äôm tired of being her doormat. \n\nAlso, I just want to say that I know that not all estjs are terrible toxic people, so please don‚Äôt take offense to anything I‚Äôve said about her! I‚Äôm aware that she‚Äôs an unhealthy person that‚Äôs just completely unwilling to grow. 
8	Just stop talking to/hanging out with her. Make other plans with or without other friends. You don‚Äôt have to have a formal ‚Äúbreak up‚Äù or anything. Just drift apart. 
3	Or you could pick out three statements to honestly and kindly explain that you do not wish to be friends. You've grown as a person by knowing her, but see that you two are growing apart. Express that you are adamant about your decision and that it's final. \n\nBe kind and firm in ending it. If she ignores your demand, then close off communication.\n\nThis ghosting thing is so childish. Adult this one out and be honest. You'd want the same in any type of relationship. 
2	Yikes. \n\nAlright, eradicate your one on one time. If you do hang out with her, do it as part of a larger group. Stop making plans with her. \n\nBe as boring as possible. No opinions. No thoughts. Don‚Äôt tell her about your life or your plans. If she‚Äôs got nothing to use to pick on you, she‚Äôll get bored and move on. It‚Äôs called grey rock - google it for more information. \n\nUse your introversion to your advantage! She‚Äôs a confrontational person and she wants that confrontation with you. Don‚Äôt do it. Say nothing and walk away. Bonus points will be awarded if you do it while she‚Äôs mid-sentence. If there‚Äôs no escape to be had - wield the mighty power of the awkward silence, don‚Äôt respond, don‚Äôt say anything, keep your poker face and embrace the awkwardness. \n\nYou can do it!
1	im infp and you cant do anything about it. Just let it happen. Get busy. 
1	For an ESTJ time is the most precious asset in life. Just tell her you don't have it. She will eventually respect it and you will slowly drift apart if you keep being consistently busy.\nIf not, there's another way to use time to solve your problem, although you're a "feeler" so it might make you a bit anxious. The easiest was to get rid of an ESTJ by using time is to waste theirs. Make plans with them and be late. Cancel last minute. And the worse thing ever? Don't show up, don't pick up your phone, call them two hours later with apology and tell them you simply forgot. That would make her fall out with you instantly 
5	What Are Some Good Affrimations To Use?	*I posted this in r/INTP too if anyone asks. ESTJs have practical views so I ask here as well.*\n\nI saw one affrimation that went like this:\n\n"I always have the power to choose to let go of any emotion."\n\nAnd I'm like "lul I already do dat bruh".\n\nAnyone here have their one positive or rational sayings that help direct your mindset and mentality? Logic is objective but thoughts are subjective so I'm working to make them, at least, more rational and as objective as possible.
6	This might sound more negative, but hear me out. My soothing affirmation is: I‚Äôm a fuck up and I have no idea what I‚Äôm doing.  \n\nI feel like it takes the pressure off, reminds me that I don‚Äôt have to get everything right all the time. It allows me to focus on doing my best in the context of being a fallible human instead of constantly kicking myself for not being better. I don‚Äôt have to do everything perfectly; I can just do things and it will be what it is.\n\nAnd it reminds me that I don‚Äôt actually know all the answers, so I don‚Äôt have to be a raging bossy pants. Plus it‚Äôs kinda dark, so it makes me laugh.
3	I like to remind myself that no one is really actually paying attention (I mean, not really) and that helps me to relax a bit and not get obsessive about being the absolute best at everything. 
2	My affirmation is ‚ÄúIt is what it is‚Äù
8	Is it normal for ESTJs to have a lot of double standards?	Examples: \n-Hates being interrupted but will interrupt you to get his/her point across\n-Insists that you answer his/her questions directly (eg., Yes/No) without explaining yourself to give context. But if you ask him/her a question, the answer you get will have lots of explanation.\n-Tells you that you can't always have everything your own way if you make one suggestion/recommendation. Expects you to follow his/her exact blueprint his/her own way. If you stray from it at all, you're being "selfish" and "think your way is the only way."\n\nIs this typical ESTJ behavior or is something else going on here?
7	Even if it is frequent with ESTJ, it doesn't mean it should be tolerated as behaviors.\n\n
2	To answer if it is a typical ESTJ thing, I would say maybe.\n\nThe function stack is TE, SI, NE, FI.\n\nTo start with , their focus is not on being open to others ideas. It can be if they develop NE when growing older, but it is not their natural focus. TE and FI form an axis so unconsciously their main motivation is themselves and how they feel. Their main tool to achieve it is a function that is good at making their own way work. They grab information from the external world to make their own system work. They are not very interested in what goes on within you (or within other people feelings and thoughts). SI makes them a bit nostalgic sometimes (sometimes they idealize the past). SI-NE is the other axis and NE (intuition extroverted) is where you can get some curiosity from them. Mixed with SI, if they remember something positive about you, they will start listening more and being more open to you.\n\nI guess ESTJ is not the easiest type to deal with sometimes. But each person is different and full of nuances.
7	ESTJ Cognitive functions and four sides of the mind EXPLAINED	
1	You know, this guy is the first to educate me about the 4 sides of the mind, i always understood the concept of ego and shadow, but subconscious and superego? It makes sense if you consider the potential for maturing the weaker functions, you would behave like you inverted your function stack if you focused on using them.
12	Fellow ESTJ's, do you believe the main goal in life is to have as much experiences and pleasure as possible?	I tested ESTJ on every test I could find online. I was wondering if hedonism is a common trait among us. The only thing I care about in life is making lots of money and having as much pleasure as possible, eating the best tasting foods, owning luxury cars and new homes, experiencing new sports and activities, going to as many countries in the world as possible, spending everyday happy..etc.\n\nI'm also extremely materialistic, I don't care much about having a family or having family values or contributing to society at all, I just want to live life for myself and doing everything so I have zero regrets when I die, that's all
4	My main goal in life is to take care of my tribe. 
3	Interesting. I'm not sure if these are necessarily traits of a typical ESTJ. What you're describing reminds me a bit of an enneagram 7, actually. Do you feel like you can relate to any aspect of the description below?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>As an ESTJ, your primary mode of living is focused externally, where you deal with things rationally and logically. Your secondary mode is internal, where you take things in via your five senses in a literal, concrete fashion.  \n>  \n>ESTJs live in a world of facts and concrete needs. They live in the present, with their eye constantly scanning their personal environment to make sure that everything is running smoothly and systematically. They honor traditions and laws, and have a clear set of standards and beliefs. They expect the same of others, and have no patience or understanding of individuals who do not value these systems. They value competence and efficiency, and like to see quick results for their efforts.  \n>  \n>ESTJs are take-charge people. They have such a clear vision of the way that things should be, that they naturally step into leadership roles. They are self-confident and aggressive. They are extremely talented at devising systems and plans for action, and at being able to see what steps need to be taken to complete a specific task. They can sometimes be very demanding and critical, because they have such strongly held beliefs, and are likely to express themselves without reserve if they feel someone isn't meeting their standards. But at least their expressions can be taken at face-value, because the ESTJ is extremely straight-forward and honest.  \n>  \n>The ESTJ is usually a model citizen, and pillar of the community. He or she takes their commitments seriously, and follows their own standards of "good citizenship" to the letter. ESTJ enjoys interacting with people, and likes to have fun. ESTJs can be very boisterous and fun at social events, especially activities which are focused on the family, community, or work.  \n>  \n>The ESTJ needs to watch out for the tendency to be too rigid, and to become overly detail-oriented. Since they put a lot of weight in their own beliefs, it's important that they remember to value other people's input and opinions. If they neglect their Feeling side, they may have a problem with fulfilling other's needs for intimacy, and may unknowingly hurt people's feelings by applying logic and reason to situations which demand more emotional sensitivity.  \n>  \n>When bogged down by stress, an ESTJ often feels isolated from others. They feel as if they are misunderstood and undervalued, and that their efforts are taken for granted. Although normally the ESTJ is very verbal and doesn't have any problem expressing themself, when under stress they have a hard time putting their feelings into words and communicating them to others.  \n>  \n>ESTJs value security and social order above all else, and feel obligated to do all that they can to enhance and promote these goals. They will mow the lawn, vote, join the PTA, attend home owners association meetings, and generally do anything that they can to promote personal and social security.  \n>  \n>The ESTJ puts forth a lot of effort in almost everything that they do. They will do everything that they think should be done in their job, marriage, and community with a good amount of energy. He or she is conscientious, practical, realistic, and dependable. While the ESTJ will dutifully do everything that is important to work towards a particular cause or goal, they might not naturally see or value the importance of goals which are outside of their practical scope. However, if the ESTJ is able to see the relevance of such goals to practical concerns, you can bet that they'll put every effort into understanding them and incorporating them into their quest for clarity and security.

3	I tend to prefer optimizing a chosen experience - quality over quantity. I try to find the best way to do A thing rather than trying all the things. \n\nIf anything, I probably need more hedonism in my life. My idea of a regret is a mistake made out of impulsivity rather than missing out on something because I‚Äôve made a ‚Äòsafer‚Äô choice.\n\nBut I have no idea how typical that might be.
3	Possibly look into ESTP and ESFP profiles too. Not that ESTJs can't be hedonistic. I just hear about them being workaholics just as often if not more.
3	Absolutely not. However I am religious so that may have something to do with it. 
6	ENTP and ESTJ sexual tension?	Sister in law is estj f and I am ENTP m and am trying to understand the funk between us that‚Äôs been going on for over 13 years.  She‚Äôs very judgmental and controlling, she‚Äôs into Utah Mormon social norms and culture and I‚Äôm from Portland and very artistic and intellectual and confusing to social norm types and am uncontrollable.  I find myself just as confused by her, confused by her sexuality and subtleties....so....do any of you have any ENTP connections?  Wtf??!
10	Tell her that her arguments are bullshit, she's not seeing the bigger picture, and she improperly formatted the structure of her everything. She'll freak out, and the problems will be magically resolved.
7	My wife is estj and I'm entp. I think it all started because I didn't understand her and took it as a challenge. Still working on it! :D\n\nShe says she likes me because I'm sexy. 
4	Hey y'all o/	I've seen a lot of the folks talk about music and MBTI and its quite tough to type Musicians as such.\n\nYou ESTJs fill me with hatred and admiration for your dogged persistence. I type Steve Vai as an ESTJ,  He is possibly one of the most talented guitarists there is. \n\nMetallica's James Hetfield, ESTJ again ! \n\nI would love to discover new artists of your type. I definitely think each type is drawn to its own Musicians. \n\nSo I invite y'all to come over to  -> https://www.reddit.com/r/MBTIRadioStation/ <- Post your favorite tunes. I find ESTJs particularly drawn to old school melodies or metal. \n\n
1	I think Steve Vai is technically great, but he kinda sucks in the way that his music doesn't mean anything to me. I think he fakes emotion too much. Like, his music isn't even that emotional, yet he overacts on stage as if it is. Lol.\n\nI prefer anything by Slash over Vai. 
1	ESTJ son with ENFJ mom	I‚Äôm wondering if any of you ESTJs had an ENFJ mom. What are the particular challenges, issues and characteristics of this combination? Any tips? Thanks.
3	[deleted]
3	When an ENFJ thinks they know what's best for you if you choose otherwise they will be very hurt by it. \n\nDo not let them manipulate you into doing something you don't want to do. \n\nI had 2 ENFJ mentors so not necessarily parents, but still older and important to me. \n\nI hate how ENFJ act like they know what's best for others because if you take a look at their own lives, they usually don't have a lot that could even back them up. The two that I know one was a druggie and severely messed up until she got pregnant, that somehow changed her and she made sure her daughter had the best life possible. She is a good mom but has been divorced twice now.  I love her but I don't really think she makes the most logical decisions. \n\nI remember when her daughter who is also a really good friend of mine (INFP) and her weren't on speaking terms and she saw her daughter as bratty and misbehaving and closed off and she was really upset about the whole thing. And because I'm best friends with the INFP I knew what had happened.  One of the mom's friends saw a photo quote on facebook about "being a good daughter to your mom" or some other bullshit and she tagged her in it. So it made the INFP feel like her mom was talking a bunch of shit about her behind her back. When the mom and I had been talking I had mentioned that and she was livid. She knew exactly who had sent the photo and couldn't believe they would do that. So she ended up standing up for her daughter and deleting that friend of Facebook, which was good, but it took her a while to understand that there might be a bigger issue. They have big hearts and care for their loved ones, but INFPs aren't as confrontational and for as empathetic as they are, they can really struggle to take a step back and understand that there's a lot more to most situations than they think.  \n\nThe other one also almost got divorced until God saved her...\nShe was extremely manipulative though and would pressure my mom into doing things and used God as the reason why. When her and my mom stopped being friends she cut me off without even giving me a reason. I've been abandoned in the past and it hurt me a lot. She never really apologized for it or understand how much damage she did to me. \n\nNobody is perfect, but ENFJs could really take a step back before they decide to judge others. And that's really the only complaint I have with them. They love people and helping people and working with others, but they struggle to walk the talk.  \n\n\n

1	MBTI & Music Survey (Redesign) - Need respondents!	 I created an initial version of this survey a few days ago, but after receiving feedback and reviewing many of the responses, I restructured it to increase accuracy, depth, and easier data analysis. Even if you've already taken the previously posted survey, please take this new one as well.\n\nThis is a survey searching for correlation between MBTI and musical interests such as genres, instruments, singing, dance, and composition/production. Once I get a descent amount of responses, I will post the results in r/mbti (unless r/estj would like me to post them here as well). I've created individual surveys for each of the 16 personality types, and the one below is SPECIFICALLY for ESTJs.\n\nThe ESTJ survey link: \n\n[https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JRRFN36](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JRRFN36) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you are not an ESTJ please find the correct link for your type here:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/9a6hbw/mbti\_music\_survey\_redesign\_need\_respondents/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/9a6hbw/mbti_music_survey_redesign_need_respondents/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n Thanks for your responses! As I said previously, I will post the results and analysis in r/mbti once the survey is completed. 
5	INFP dating ESTJ; relationship trouble?	I‚Äôm an INFP dating my boyfriend of 7 years who is an ESTJ.  We‚Äôve been together since we were 17/18 years old so we‚Äôve really grown together. But now that we‚Äôre older, I‚Äôve realized how different we really are and it‚Äôs making me worried if we are truly compatible and capable of having a future together.\nThe other day we had an argument because I told him I believed that kindness is everything and the world would be a better place if everyone just learned to be kind to one another. He disagreed and said he‚Äôs not obligated to be kind to everyone (strangers, people not in his ‚Äúcircle‚Äù).\nAlso throughout our whole relationship he has struggled with being able to comfort me when I cry or have a panic attack. He will usually just say and do nothing or he will get mad and say I‚Äôm overreacting.\nIt‚Äôs hard for him to show emotion (I‚Äôve noticed his whole family is like that as well). I‚Äôve noticed he actually tries to avoid anything that could possibly make him ‚Äúfeel‚Äù anything. For example, he refuses to talk about death, tragic events, even our relationship when i try to tell him when I‚Äôm unhappy, etc.\nIt‚Äôs tough because we are literally complete opposites. Any insight? Any way of helping me understand his way of thinking/feeling? I really want to make this work.
20	I definitely don't agree that Kindness is what this world needs more of. I believe in being respectful, but kindness seems a little much. \n\nAlso, ESTJs imo are better than any other type at taking care of their people. They see it as their duty and will work overtime just to make sure their loved ones have a roof over their heads and food on their plate. So they might not have that same heart for strangers, but that isn't always a bad thing. I personally believe in taking care of my people before strangers. \n\nInstead of looking at what your ESTJ hasn't been able to do for you, take a step back and try to see what he's done. \n\nESTJs love through actions. Taking care of basic needs, doing what's practical. They might not be the most romantic, but that doesn't mean they don't care. \n\nAlso, not wanting to talk about death or tragedy is more likely because we ARE sensitive to those kinds of things and don't want to talk about it because it's actually uncomfortable and something we aren't really interested in. \n\nMy mom and dad are INFP and ESTJ and have been married for 30 years and have a rock solid marriage. My mom has shared a lot with me about what it's been like for them. I personally think their differences complement each other. Because I have had friends who seemed to be dating people who were too similar and they seemed to have unexciting relationships that end because there is no gain from being with someone who adds nothing new. \n\nMy dad does appreciate my mom's feels and emotions but doesn't always agree with them. But my mom will stand behind what she feels 100% and that's why my dad loves her. ESTJs don't like people who crumble under pressure or change their minds because we don't agree with you. I like that you're so passionate about what you believe in that you're willing to fight about it. Sometimes ESTJs disagree not because we actually disagree but we wanna see how much you actually care and how much of a fight you're willing to put up. Half of the political arguments I have are simply because I wanna see if you actually know what the hell you're talking about. I wanna see you push back. I do it because I feel like I am surrounded by a bunch of people who only believe what they believe because that's what everyone else believes. And it's pathetic.  \n\nI bet you anything, you're ESTJ loves you for who you are. He might think your kindness argument was dumb, but he knows how big your heart is. \n\nYou aren't going to get that emotional gushiness from an ESTJ, but I'm willing to bet, you actually don't want it as much as you think you do. I think the stuff you want from your ESTJ boyfriend are actually things a girlfriend would be better with dealing with. Do you have girlfriends you can share that stuff with? Is there a reason you want it from him? Do you want it from him because you can't get it from anyone else? \n\n
10	It's not doomed because of your personality types, if that's what you think.\n\nI'm an INFP and I've been struggling silently with similar concerns regarding an ESTJ in my life, who's my good friend but we'd be in a relationship if it weren't for specific circumstances preventing it right now. But I have a message to any INFP going through this...your greatest strength is looking inwards. We are extremely emotional and idealistic people, and it's very rare to find anyone who can understand us, which feeds our sense of loneliness. In reality, the reason we are continually disappointed in relationships is because we hold unrealistic expectations for our partners. What we need, we already have within us and no amount of external search can alleviate our longing to be understood. When you are at peace with yourself, your thoughts, feelings, and opinions...then you can love someone for who they are and not who you want them to be. And once you can love someone for who they are, you are completely free. You hold no expectations. You are able to love people unconditionally. It's a wonderful gift. So, you have a dedicated partner of 7 years but you disagree on certain things, and he's bad at providing emotional support. None of that is truly terrible unless you *choose* to see it that way. I say, cherish your differences. He wouldn't be him otherwise.
4	Lol you two dorks are just made for each other. You keep going on with all the security theater and him cringingly going along the whole nine yards like nope nope nope! Its like trying to give my two dogs a bath. One likes the water so much it won't stop playing with the damn toilet and the other one has already run off locked itself in its carrying cage.\n\nOne question though is there like a significant height difference between you two? Because I've heard and theorized a bit that INFP are probably kind of short and youthful looking. Which reminds me of this funny video I saw online this tall fellow buys his gal a little happy meal. She rages so hard beating him with an ice cream cone. And there ain't no dodging an ice cream cone that mess gets everywhere. Maybe you two should stick to going out for coffee and avoid the ice cream... \^\_\^
6	Are you materialist, shallow, bossy, controlling, rude, manipulative, stric, lack of respect/regard for others...?! Am I blind in love?	\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n\nHe said he is ESTJ but I don't know him well. we are dating for about one week. He said I was his crush for 6 months! My ESTJ is very caring about me and his family but to others... A bit Less than I expect. He loves me, I love him And I see the low potential to be the harsh person that people saying about ESTJs . Are you change during long-term relationships? What's your opinion about volunteering in critical fields? Since you guys are T do u prefer F or T-girl for relationships? Because I have a great feeling about him but I'm not comfortable to reveal entire my love for him. 
9	\> My ESTJ is very caring about me and his family but to others... A bit Less than I expect.\n\nINTJ here. Just thought to drop by and comment on this particular aspect:\n\nESTJs either men or women are natural born leaders. And you'd better get used to it because you are going to stumble upon this aspect of theirs A.L.O.T.\n\nI'm saying this based on the way you phrase his lack of empathy for anyone outside his "team" and/or his "territory".\n\nESTJs might be bullies indeed but believe it or not I've come to the realisation that this is not necessarily bad. In the words of Chris Rock:\n\n"We need bullies. This is how Trump came to power. We got rid of bullies ... Then a REAL bully showed up AND NOBODY KNEW HOW TO HANDLE HIM!"\n\nESTJs have the ability to be the bullies you like in situations such as the above. They are survivors that are tough AF - you have to give them that. They know how to get their hands dirty and come off clean while staying on top of things in the end too.\n\nIf I were you I would promptly state all of the above to that guy, recognise him for what he is and appreciate his psyche with all its pros and cons, hoping he's going to turn on the light side of the force.\n\nJust my 2c.
6	Like what the other INTJ said here, ESTJs are the worst when it comes them evaluating your work. That's as bad as it gets. As long as you protect the structure they create and what they value, you can pretty much do anything else and it won't get on their nerves.\n\nPersonally, I find ESTJs to be pretty sensitive and want acceptance, especially from people on their "team". That's why they're so nice to their team and so able to be harsh on everyone else. They get their support from where they need it or where they can get it so they don't need it in other situations. These other situations tend to be the ones they have to be tough in and what they consider to be productive (Te-dom), like work. It's pretty cute.
5	As an ESTJ I personally think most of those are stereotypes. I can't speak for all, but I'm genuinely nice, caring person and value personal relationships a lot more than I do being successful.\n\nHowever, when it cost to empathy I do lack in that department. It's not that I don't care, I just don't know how to express it and when it comes to being honest or sparing someones feelings I'm more likely to he honest and straightforward with that person.
4	ESTJ are assholes with hearts of stone. Also they say really mean things and they don't give a shit about your feelings. Actually to them your feelings don't even exist and should never be considered. But they care about their own feelings and want you to care about their feelings. ESTJ are quasi-psychopaths. And they don't like people in their family to spend any money or time on their own hobbies and interests or having any fun. To them it's just a waste of time and money and they don't care about your mental health. Basically they are shitty people you should stay away from. And yes they are bullies. They can never admit they did anything wrong or were wrong about anything. And they don't give a shit about the quality of their work. They just want to get things done quickly, with the minimum effort. You can't get any emotional nurturing from an ESTJ, just as you can't squeeze blood from a stone. Like EVERRRRRRR. You can know an ESTJ your whole life and they will never give you one tiny drop of  nurturing and kindness. If all you want is someone who works hard and takes care of responsibilities but is a mentally abusive asshole that will make you depressed and miserable, then choose ESTJ. And the same goes for ISTJ's. They are the two worst & most hated types as parents. They  will be mean, cold, and abusive to your future children. And they will also deny toys, games, and hobby supplies and basically anything fun to their kids. Another thing I hate about ESTJ's is that they are ignorant people who think they are always right. They think they are right about everything without ever having done the slightest bit of research. They frequently have the wrong idea about something and then they are stubborn jackasses about it and you can't change their mind. This is because (1) stupid people don't like to learn, and (2) stupid people think they know a lot more than they actually do. They're too stupid to realize that they lack knowledge about something. Extroverted Sensors are the 4 most stupid & ignorant personality types. ESTJ's only learn the absolute bare minimum that they need to do their job and get through life. ESTJ's are a constant pain in the ass. \n\n&#x200B;
2	Really? Let‚Äôs say I have a friend that sick but won‚Äôt see a doctor even though they cannot recover from this illness. I will start out nice and suggest going, then it will go to dark foreshadowing of how much worse it will become, then if they‚Äôre far away it will become guilt tripping about how poor everyone will be without them, then it becomes straight up I will come over and straight up drag you to a doctor kicking and screaming.  
7	ESTJs, how do you react to *being controlled*?	Could be a nitpicky coworker, an overly critical partner...how do you typically respond? Has anyone ever "outcontrolled" you?\n\nLet's you think their concerns are legitimate, they're just being a little too over-the-top, even for your tastes.
8	Ignore. Deflect. I usually just go ‚Äúok‚Äù and don‚Äôt do what they want. However, my partner is really good about not being too nitpicky. He‚Äôs really the only one that I would submit to 
5	There is a difference between being given direction, and being controlled. If it‚Äôs genuine and I understand why it needs to be done I have no problem being told what to do. I‚Äôll even go above and beyond if I can think of ways to improve it. On the other hand, if it‚Äôs power tripping bull shit with no purpose I will either openly disagree or agree and find ways to get out of doing it/improve it so it‚Äôs worth my time. \n\nI don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm being stubborn. Just realistic. 
2	I had a job once and had someone who wasn‚Äôt a manager but had extra duties and would go on massive power trips. \n\nShe started micromanaging me to extremes. Get on me for things while practically ignoring it when others did it. Would follow me around constantly asking me what I was doing and then say I should be doing something else. \n\nI wasn‚Äôt sleeping and every thought of working with her  made me sick. \n\nI also got her in trouble before it got worse for texting others behind my back and encouraging others to boss me around. No one had that kind of authority over me. \n\nIt was at a Starbucks in a Target and I basically pointed out to them that they made drinks wrong. I was trained in a real Starbucks. They were making huge mistakes and I just pointed it out. They didn‚Äôt like that. That‚Äôs what led her to micromanaging me. \n\nI fought back a little bit. Sometimes I would just walk off the floor since she made me feel like I was in the way. And honestly I just worked as hard as I could. \n\nI didn‚Äôt really do anything though and it just led up to me quitting. When my boss went on vacation I miraculously got an approved LOA for the same time. I knew it would be hell on earth with her there as the manager when he was gone. \n\nI don‚Äôt really care about being controlled. As long as I‚Äôm still given freedom. When my freedom is taken away that‚Äôs when I realize I need to either find a new job or find a way to fight back. \n\nUnrelated to work. I do NOT respond well to being controlled in relationships. \n\nWhen I was 18 my parents said I had to go to a certain school and do what they wanted or they would take my car keys and stop paying for me. I handed everything over. It lasted less than 24 hours before my dad (ESTJ) changed his mind. The more you try to control me the harder I push back. \n\nI just don‚Äôt like the thought of others making decisions for me. Let me fuck up on my own. Let me just learn on my own without you trying to decide what is best for me. \n\nEven if you are right I still just wanna do it on my own. \n\n
1	I‚Äôve never been ‚Äúcontrolled‚Äù
1	Not well. My stubborn side kicks in. Sometimes, I get snarky.
1	If I get the sense that my spouse is trying to "control" me (this could just be having a really strong opinion on what they think I should do about something - my spouse doesn't ACTUALLY control me), I immediately want to do what I want to do even more than before. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf it's at work, depending on the person's hierarchy in the company, I react in different ways. Above me: I'll do as I'm told and do it even better than they were asking. My equal (or possibly below me): fuck off. I'll take the time to hear them out but if I ultimately end up disagreeing then I'm doing what I want. 
3	Who are some ESTJ YouTubers, if there are any?	
3	An estj and a youtuber is kinda contradictory. Too unpredictable for a career don‚Äôt you think?Aren‚Äôt they all in business schools or some shit? Or even if they aren‚Äôt they are probably busy doing chores around their or someone else‚Äôs house
1	Haven't gotten all the way into it yet, but I've been dabbling here and there. Mostly streaming. But planning to ramp up some when I move out in a few weeks.

8	Is it typical to have zero empathy for strangers?	The only people I care about if they get hurt is my immediate family, aside from that my emotions don't sway along with my friends or strangers. I felt nothing when my friend got dumped, I feel nothing when hearing tragedies on news ..etc
9	I think this is probably fairly typical for the ESTJ. In socionics, both Feeling/Ethical functions are weak in the ESTJ, and I think a case can be made that empathy (as well as sympathy) primarily stems from these functions.\n\nInterestingly, however, there seem to be slight differences between the two two kinds of "empathy", namely the type that stems from Fi as opposed to the type that stems from Fe.\n\nFe's brand of empathy is closer to what people often call "sympathy". It is a very direct and visceral "mirroring" of another person's experiences in the self. When you witness another person's suffering, you experience a sort of "shadow" of it yourself. A variant of the same phenomenon is when a person starts experiencing a visceral discomfort because the collective mood in the immediate surroundings is tense or sour. For the ESTJ, Fe is the role function and therefore rather weak. This suggests that while the average ESTJ can sense and respond to other's emotions in this way, it is going to require conscious effort and is likely to be rather draining. In socionics, Fe is also one of the ESTJs unvalued functions, so the average ESTJ might often not be inclined to bother, because the collective mood might seem like a pointless triviality to them. An exception is when a new acquintance is made, and it is typical that a strong conscious effort is made toward displaying aptitude in one's role function, which happens to be Fe for the ESTJ.\n\nFi's brand of empathy is more concerned with abstract phenomena like the human condition and suffering in and of itself. Fi empathy is closer to what the Dalai Lama talks about when he speaks about "unconditional love". It has a tendency to be directed toward whoever suffers the *most*, irrespective of how *visible* their suffering is. Because of this, it kind of has its own built-in sense of justice. Fi can empathize with a person or other creature they have never even met, simply by hearing about something horrible said person or animal was subjected to. Being Fi-dominant, I know from personal experience that this response can be every bit as strong and visceral in a Fi-dom as the Fe-dom's direct empathic response to *seeing* suffering.\n\nHere's where it gets particularly interesting for the ESTJ, though: according to socionics, Fi is an extremely weak *but extremely highly valued* function for the ESTJ. This implies that the average ESTJ has virtually no intrinsic negative emotional response to seeing or hearing about injustice, but the*y value justic*e *itself* as a moral ideal as well as people who *do* demonstrate this emotional attenuation towards it, like the INFP, the ESTJs "dual" in socionics.\n\nIn summary, I would argue that your experience in this may be fairly typical for the ESTJ. What seems more important to me, though, is that, in the case of Fi-brand empathy, this is a deficit that the average ESTJ may be keenly aware of and not entirely comfortable with, which is supported by the fact that you asked this question to begin with. In short, while you may not feel like a very empathetic person, if you did not *value* empathy, this would probably not have bothered you enough to ask if it is normal. And I personally think valuing Fi is every bit as important, if not more so, than actually demonstrating aptitude in it, because the valuing of functions is what allows them to spread and flourish on a collective, cultural level.
8	Some people were having a roadside memorial. I was irritated that they would put on such a distracting display at a busy intersection that literally just killed someone, increasing the chances of another accident. \n\nSo yeah, I‚Äôm not good at empathizing with strangers. 
4	AFAIK this is normal. I feel ‚Äúsorry‚Äù for people when bad things happen but it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm real torn up inside or anything 
6	I‚Äôm a ESTJ and I feel the same way.
1	That's weird, I heard ESTJs are supportive in friendship and relationships. U have the same feelings for your gf or your wife? 
1	Am I the only empathetic ESTJ alive? I'm not a psychopath, of course I feel empathy for strangers. I guess it just depends on what it is? 
1	Is it typical to confuse empathy for sympathy?
0	I'm an INFP and I'm rarely emotionally invested in strangers but I know their suffering is wrong and unjust

5	I love my ESTJ brother.(a lot)	but he doesn't love me back. We hit off in the form of episodes. Every once and a while we turn into luis and clark, but most of the time he's just yelln' at me. Like, it's the typical sibling rivalry, but one sided. \n\n\* Attempt to hug \*\n\n"stop it."\n\n"Why are you soooooo mean"?\n\n"shut up. That's gay stop it. STOP IT."
5	Hugging your brother is not gay, unless you‚Äôre hugging his penis. I‚Äôm assuming that you‚Äôre not hugging his penis in this instance, so the conclusion here is that he‚Äôs just not a cuddly person. \n\nAnd that‚Äôs totally cool, but you‚Äôve got to meet him where he is on this. There are loads of ways to show him that you love him without hugging. 
5	He loves you. 
5	I‚Äôm ESTJ and I‚Äôm not physically affectionate with my brother I‚Äôm female if that makes any difference. My favorite thing is when we hang out and talk and lately that‚Äôs when we run around town playing Pok√©mon Go. 
14	ESTJs and extroverts	As an ESTJ most of my close relationships are with introverts, other than my previous relationship that was with an extrovert I've never just been to fond of other extroverts. It's not that I don't like them, but most extraverts tend to push me away and turn me off (not in a sexual way).\n\n I'm curious if this is just an individual trait that I have developed because I primarily hangout with introverts, or if other ESTJs feel the same way.
10	I‚Äôve only dated introverts, so I suppose that I share that preference. When I‚Äôm with another extrovert, there‚Äôs a constant building of energy, like every topic is met with ‚Äòyes, and...‚Äô so it‚Äôs just more more more, revving each other up until one person cracks. Which can be fun, but also exhausting. With introverts, things feel steadier, and I can make a bunch of noise or just be chill. There‚Äôs more room to breathe. 
7	Yeah I like Introverts a lot. Dating an INTJ and adore him. Also really good friends with INFPs and they are some of my favorites. \n\nI put my energy into work. So I don‚Äôt want my friends to be huge into parties and bars and stuff like that. It‚Äôs fun on occasion but not every weekend\n I like coming home and doing nothing or just chilling. And I like one on one interactions A LOT more than groups. Which is why I prefer to date introverts. 
5	Hm that‚Äôs a good observation. I suppose you‚Äôre right. I do have a couple very good friends that are extroverts. But I think two ESTJs especially would butt heads. And ESTJs typically like to be leaders, so perhaps with introverts they feel more in charge or the outward leader/speaker of the group. And other extroverts could be seen as competition or something. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm explaining that well. 
2	I wonder how EJs tend to feel about other EJs
2	I generally get along well with other extroverts but less so with ENFPs in particular. Everyone else is pretty much equal, provided they're not a caricature of their type.
1	Estj metal musicians	Anyone know of any estj metal/rock/punk musicians?
4	Would you rather see your child grow up smart or kind?	
28	If you‚Äôre smart enough you‚Äôll be kind. Smart and rude people aren‚Äôt truly smart. 
9	Smart.
8	Kind. Being a good person can sometimes bring you more opportunities.
2	So what this question is implying is that if my kid is kind they‚Äôll be stupid or if my kid is smart they‚Äôll be an asshole. And I have to pick one or the other. And if I pick kind I‚Äôm more inclined to test as a feeler and if I pick smart I‚Äôll be a thinker. \n\nThis is why 16 personalities is the worst test, which is where this question came from. And why most people think mbti is a joke. \n\n
2	Smart, although a trade off between the two traits can potentially yield disturbing extremes. Smart + totally unkind can yield an intelligent sociopath; a kind + totally not smart person will likely fall for a lot of scams, etc. Then, you'd have smart + neutral in kindness, and kind + average intelligence... hmm. Maybe kind but of average intelligence isn't so bad, but being smart and just not an asshole isn't really bad, either.
1	Smart. If s/he‚Äôs kind the world would take advantage of him/her. If s/he is smart s/he will take advantage of the world.
9	The ESTJ / INTJ social chemistry	INTJ here. Just wanted to ask your opinion about a pattern I've noticed:\n\n\- My father is ESTJ. The man which he holds in the highest esteem -among everyone he's ever known- is an INTJ colleague of his. He used to talk to me all the time, about the conversations they where having and the opinions he has formed through them. In one way or the other I guess he unconsciously did everything he could to shape me, his son, in his friend's image.\n\n\- Some of my best friends are ESTJs. I get the same kind of vibes from them.\n\nI've noticed that ESTJs open up to me so naturally even though for some of them I'm barely an acquaintance. I guess they see something in me that I don't quite readily grasp. Is this common? What's the deal here?
6	Because ESTJs are naturally compelled by the thought of an INTJ's approval. Well, that's basically what a Relation of Supervision boils down to.\n\nYour dominant Ni is their blindspot. You're both making decisions in the same way (Te), but the knowledge you are accessing to make that decision, the ESTJ is unable to access. It could be the powerful foresight associated with Ni. It ends up looking like the INTJ has the upper hand.\n\n
6	I‚Äôm currently with an INTJ and have pretty much loved every one I‚Äôve ever met. \n\nEvery one I‚Äôve met has been brilliant in my opinion and none of them give themselves enough credit. \n\nI had a lab partner who was one too and I always wanted his opinions on things because he could explain things to me without making me feel like an idiot. And he would do it in a way that made me even more interested in the topic. I don‚Äôt like talking to people about politics or social issues because it always gets out of hand but with an intj I can ask questions without them making assumptions about me. I like playing devils advocate and getting as much info but some people automatically jump on you when you want to understand something from both sides. \n\nI‚Äôm not asking because I disagree with you I‚Äôm asking to better understand. And when you assume it just shuts me down and makes me less likely to wanna ever open up again. \n\nThat‚Äôs why I‚Äôm so attracted to INTJs. \n\nOn my first date with my INTJ I opened up quite a bit. We had some of the best conversations. And I was able to open up about something that is a pretty big secret to most people and not something I wanna share on a first date. To me INTJs are very open minded and not as judge mental as others are. \n\n
4	INTJ  Here, popping in to see how you all think and respond.\n\nSince you asked a question about  ESTJ / INTJ Social Chemistry, I could not resist answering this question and I wanted to weigh in with my two cents. \n\nMy husband of 38 years is an ESTJ.\n\nI still think he may be the smartest man, that I have met.\n\nI was smart enough to recognize his/your fascinating  qualities and hang on for the ride.\n\nWhat a ride!  You guys may be d\*\*k's sometimes but geez, I could not have chosen better and had a more intellectually stimulating ride.\n\nMy answer to your question is a bit simple.\n\n In my experience, when an ESTJ notices someone with talent or smarts, an ESTJ will seek to utilize him or her. \n\n They,  or in my case, my husband will recognize that talent, treat the person as an equal and expect that person to be on the exact same page as the ESTJ is.\n\nThey will not nurture talent because why, and that is not a question.\n\n They  don't need someone to nurture them,  and why should you. Again, not a question.\n\nIn other words, an ESTJ can be funny and smart and a big time A\*,  who is very very bossy.\n\nThe moral of my story is to be flattered if ESTJ 's are drawn to you. They recognize you and include you.
3	As an ESTJ, One of my old best friends is an INTJ. He's very good at brainstorming and having abstract thoughts. He knows I tend to be self-centered at times, but we both respected each other. While I was more authoritative and rigid, he was more relaxed and had a big imagination. Granted he was suffering through depression and I cared about him deeply. Love INTJ's because they are good at planning just as much as I do.
6	Music and personality data gathering (5 minute survey)	Hello all, if you are interested, I created a survey regarding Mbti type and music preferences. It's just for fun, but I am curious to see the results. I personally don't expect to see a huge difference between types, but who knows! It'll only take a few minutes, so please check it out.\n\nI will be posting results after all the data has been compiled.\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScS5h6KfDSrc5C1gEBh4mNb56HvXeUWBuYoRfAFOUC-LVyBZg/viewform?usp=sf_link\n\n***Edit: I will be closing the test to do data stuff at 2pm CT on Sunday, August 5. Sorry if you didn't get it a chance to take the test. Look for the results post in a day or two.***
6	convincing an ESTJ	How do we convince an ESTJ of 100% trusting you? I am an ENTP and need to convince an ESTJ business owner that I am right and am the right person for the subject. But I am always full of ideas and all over the place and I certainly don't follow many rules. I'm afraid that the way I am make him hesitant. There are also a lot of nuances in what I have to present and it could play against me that nothing is black or white.\n\nedit : I posted this in r/mbti also.
16	Deeds. Not words. \n\nMeet your deadlines. Show that you are organised and efficient. Honour your commitments. Own your fuckups. 
5	I tend to only believe what I see. So if I see you acting shady or being unclear I will not trust you. I already dont really trust anyone but if they burn me, that's it. I feel we all show who and what we are. So my thing is, show me. Once you've shown me, ok now I see. Estjs can be judgy but are also as fair as they can be usually. Just be real and then the realness will show. They are already skeptical so dont give a reason to be and you'll be fine. 
5	How do I (INFP) improve my relationship with an ESTJ? He sucks with emotional stuff & his blunt directness is often rude & offensive. I've told him this & he doesn't care because he thinks it's a good quality & I should change to be more like him. How do I improve my relationship with him?	I'm INFP, he's ESTP/J. Leaning more towards ESTJ, but he could be either one. As you can tell, we're basically polar opposites. I'm super conflict avoidant, he's extremely confrontational and loves picking fights with people. He genuinely enjoys pushing people's buttons and trying to get under their skin. To him, he says what he feels and views it as "telling it like it is." He views this blunt directness as a positive trait, and to him people who aren't like this need to change. Problem is, he genuinely doesn't care if what he says is hurtful, and it often is. Yesterday he thought it was funny to say "wouldn't it be funny if I could give you an eating disorder" then spent the rest of the day calling me fat. I'm actually super thin and not remotely fat. He doesn't know this, but I've actually had some issues with disordered eating. That's just one in a million examples of him being super mean & confrontational. I'm sure I'm on the more sensitive side, but in the majority of these conflicts it's just him starting crap for no reason. He seems to want me to change my personality to be "less weird" and more like him, but why can't he just accept me for how I am? INFPs normally feel like weird outsiders anyway, but combined with an ESTJ/P who frequently says I'm weird, I'm really feeling frustrated and hurt.\n\nI never pick fights with anyone, I always try to diffuse these conflicts ASAP. I'm sure my fellow INFPs are the same way. I've told him I hate when he starts fights & intentionally starts drama/conflicts, but to him he thinks it's funny and genuinely gets a sadistic kick out of it. He's said I'm super quiet (I am) and the only way to get me to talk to him is if he picks fights & tries to get me riled up. Idk why tf he thinks this, cuz I'm happy to talk if he's nice. But a lot of the time I just want to be left alone, and we don't even have any common interests to talk about. We literally have nothing in common, and our personalities are polar opposites. I really do want a good relationship with him, but he makes it so difficult even though I've told him countless times that I'm always happy to talk to him as long as he's nice and doesn't start fights or deliberately tries to be mean/annoy me. \n\nHow do I (an INFP) improve my relationship with him (ESTJ/P)?
12	Wow, there's a lot to unpack here.\n\nFirst off, just because ESTJs look at things from a logical perspective, doesn't mean that we're assholes about it. Frankly, it sounds like he's an asshole. Especially if you've talked with him about it before, he should really be able to see the errors in his ways if he really cares about you.\n\nI'll admit, there was a time in my life when I was a lot like that. I enjoyed challenging people's beliefs and getting under people's skin. It took a girlfriends breaking up with me over my "exhausting" personality before I realized how intolerable I could be.\n\nSecondly, he wants you to change to be "less weird"? You don't have similar personalities or common interests? He isn't nice to you? These are basic fundamentals of a relationship, and honestly, it sounds like he might be taking advantage of your passive personality. I hate to be so cold, but you might want to seriously consider your future with him. No one who gets a kick out of hurting someone else's feelings, much less their SO, should be in a serious relationship imo.
7	You‚Äôre not ‚Äúweird‚Äù, you‚Äôre not like him and that‚Äôs a good thing. He sounds like such a prick. Why would you want to improve your relationship with this absolute cumstain of a person? \n\nIt is entirely possible to be honest and forthright with grace and tact. Our directness and honesty comes from a place of valuing integrity very highly. It‚Äôs not an excuse to bully or harass - and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs going on here. \n\nI doubt that he is behaving in the same way to people who are more at ease with calling out his bullshit, he targets you and other less confrontational people because he knows he can get away with it. \n\nYou absolutely do not owe it to this fuckwit to entertain his nonsense. If every interaction with him is a roll of the dice as to whether he‚Äôs going to behave with a modicum of decency and respect, then it‚Äôs not a relationship - it‚Äôs a social mine field. No one has time for that. You have confronted his antics by telling him you‚Äôre happy to chat if he‚Äôs respectful and he‚Äôs repeatedly elected to ignore that. So, fuck it. No need to make any more effort on his behalf. \n\nWe become like our friends, OP. Surround yourself with people who value who you are and who raise you up - not this repellent fuckstick. 
10	Um yeah hi, I would never treat a stranger much less anyone I cared about in the manner you are describing. You cannot improve a relationship by yourself it takes two and it doesn‚Äôt seem he‚Äôs mature enough to care for another person. 
5	He is being emotionally abusive. You are not being too sensitive. You are reacting completely appropriately to someone being mean to you. The "getting a sadistic kick" out of starting fights and finding them funny is a sign of narcissism. Narcissists are not going to change without therapy and most narcissists will never accept that they have a problem - like your partner they think their ways are positive and better than others - so don't count on him going to therapy to be a better person. If anything he'll act as thought *you* are the one with the problem who needs to change: "Stop being so sensitive! I'm just telling it like it is and you need to handle that! Get a thicker skin! You need to be less quiet, then I won't have to treat you like this! It's for your own good!" VOMIT. \n\nIf you have told your partner their behaviour upsets you, and they refuse to change they are making it very clear they don't care about you or your happiness. What do you think is going to happen? You've brought up the issues and he doesn't give a shit about you enough to work on them. He is showing you his true colours and it is a red flag for sure - it's only going to get worse, not better. If he does show kindness this will only be for a while to get you to stay, then the cycle will continue and he will go back to being an asshole. \n\nIn a healthy relationship both partners care about each other's happiness and make an effort to listen to each other and stop any hurtful behaviours and work on unhealthy ones. \n\nIn a healthy relationship your partner will not see you as "weird" and want to change the core of who you are. They will love and appreciate your quirks. \n\nTrust me when I tell you there is someone 100% better for you out there.\n\nThis is *not* an ESTJ thing. I am an ENFP (definitely a bit "weird" myself) and my most recent relationship was with an ESTJ who loved me and admired me exactly as I am and treated me with kindness and respect always. \n\nDUMP THIS FUCKER. You can and will do better. \n\n
3	Being blunt can be a good trait. But he is confusing bluntness with rudeness.

6	ENFP + ESTJ relationship assistance?	Hi, I‚Äôm a ENFP dude, currently pursuing an ESTJ for a romantic relationship. To start off, I know relationships and compatability aren‚Äôt defined by personality types, but they do give a good baseline for how people think and behave. However, I felt it would be really helpful in consulting other ESTJs in how I carry conversations with an ESTJ. Despite having a really good first date where talked for about 4 hours, I find that many times it is difficult to talk to her about more big-picture things and emotions, which is fine. But I‚Äôm  having a hard time finding topics we can easily talk about, and running into roadblocks in conversations... thankfully, I‚Äôm quick enough on my feet to have fun conversations. I‚Äôm curious to what is interesting to talk about and why.\n\nTL;DR: Me ENFP, her ESTJ. What do ESTJ‚Äôs like to talk about? Why?\n\n
11	So happy to find someone else like me! I am an ENFP (25m) and have been dating an ESTJ (20f) for about 6 months now. The internet has so little information on ESTJ-ENFP relationships (actually ESTJ relationships in general).\n\nIm definitely no expert, but here  are a couple of things I've learned:\n\n1 - ENFP's have an amazing talent of saying things in the nicest way possible. Often this means saying something in an indirect way. This is almost perfectly opposite of ESTJ's, who like to bluntly say it how it is and they don't care who they offend. They simply don't understand why you would want to "beat around the bush". When telling your ESTJ how you feel about something, use your Te instead of Fi to say it as directly and openly as possible. Tell her what you actually actually feel instead of how you think she thinks you should feel. This may seem disrespectful to you (at first), but perfectly normal to her.\n\n2 - don't let her (or other people) run over you. ESTJ women get really bothered by men who just let themselves get pushed around. She will try to test you by manipulating you with her natural intimidating nature. She will say things just to be contrary. When you let her run over you and do what she wants (even if you don't really care), she will see that as weakness and won't be able to trust your judgement and leadership where it counts. Along with this, don't let her convince you to do things that don't line up with who you want to be. This will be hard at first because you are tolerant about most things and pushing back at her seems intolerant and offensive, but in reality this will help her be able to trust that you are being honest with her and taking a stand about the things that matter to you. ESTJ's have deep-rooted convictions and don't feel comfortable trusting someone who doesn't stick to their own convictions.\n\n3 - don't act like you agree with something that she says unless you actually do agree. ENFP's have a weakness where they just agree with someone to be nice. ESTJ's pick up on "fakeness" really really fast, and dislike when people don't agree but just say they do to be nice. Also, never lie about any past experience to build rapport with someone.\n\n4 - educate yourself on cognitive types, functional stacks, and the strengths and weaknesses of each type. The "Personality Hacker" podcast is a great way to start. Look especially for the episodes about ENFP types, including \n-ENFP personality advice\n-Ne-Te cognigive loop\n-developing Feeling (Fi) as an auxiliary function\nOne warning - never assume that you know her just because you know her type. Knowing each other's types and functional stacks is helpful in identifying causes of behavioral differences, but won't help you predict exactly how the other person will respond about something. It's really easy to assume that "well, since she's an ESTJ she probably thinks this". Your personalities are so different that you won't be able to identify what she likes and dislikes unless you ask her.
7	I‚Äôm an ESTJ and my best friend is ENFP, we‚Äôre both female, she can drive me nuts because I feel like she lives on another planet sometimes... I would say in your dealings with her, be 100% transparent, be a straight shooter, don‚Äôt be evasive or she will view you as shifty and untrustworthy. You don‚Äôt have to avoid certain topics or anything ...be natural and be yourself just apply the things I mentioned up there and it will be great. Personalities I find don‚Äôt necessarily affect interests...but she will be passionate about things she‚Äôs into and will most likely take them seriously, not lightly. Just be a stand up dude and be honest about everything. Once you lose our trust it can be hard to get it back. 
6	I guess I can give the perspective of an ESTJ who does not pair well with quite a few ENFPs. And I will share what went wrong. \n\nThe first ENFP friend I had was also one of the first real friends I ever had. We met in homeroom in the 6th grade. Right off the bat some of the main problems that started arising was that she was all about groups of people and making sure no one felt left out, but I wasn't. I wanted to only be with friends I liked and felt like she was always just leaving me behind in order to include everyone else. Fast forward to 13 years later and I can honestly say that was one of the biggest issues we dealt with which constantly hurt me.  \n\nENFPs are huge group people always wanting to hang with everyone and make everyone feel special and included. I am literally the exact opposite of that. I don't want to be friends with everyone, I want a select few and I want them to be the most important people to me. \n\nI am a social (networking) butterfly and can connect with just about anyone, but at the end of the day, I have my few friends and they are the ones I want to spend the most time with. And I'd prefer if I wasn't constantly fighting for their time and attention. \n\nI also met another ENFP in high school and we were besties, it was a group of 4 (ENTJ, INTP, and ENFP and then me) I was probably closest to the ENTJ but had a lot of time after school with the ENFP and we were total goofs together. After we graduated and moved on she pretty much did with every ENFP tends to do and just leaves you in the dust. We have the hardest time catching up, and she's always "busy" but is constantly posting pictures on social media with other people (we also live in the same city). And I'm just convinced that if you are apart of an ENFPs life by a class, a club, a job, church.... or something similar, you'll be spending plenty of them with them, but if your lives are different and you have to catch up with them, it's nearly impossible to get with them. \n\nI had an ENFP mentor who I was in a small womens group with her and she was amazing, and again, when I was in the group we always were able to go out to coffee or lunch and hang and she made me feel so special and then I moved and she never responds to me on facebook or anywhere else and it just sucks. \n\nWhy do ENFPs just leave you once you are no longer apart of their social circles? Why can't they simply answer a fucking text or message asking how they are doing? How come if I don't see you regularly I become non-existent? \n\n3 times it's happened to the point where when I meet another ENFP I keep them as far away as possible and don't even bother getting close or personal to them because I know it won't last. \n\nI work with one now and she drives me insane and I know I'm not easy to work with either, but she's 6 years younger than I am so it's a very distant relationship anyways, but I love her creativity and really appreciate working with her.  \n\nI have an INFP best friend who lives 1500 miles away and we talk almost every single day and have for the past 4 years, either facetime, memes or just messaging. She makes a point to keep me in her life, and that's why I have such a problem with ENFPs. I am not holding them to unattainable standards or expecting too much from them. \n\n
7	I am an ENFP female who is totally in love with an ESTJ man.  It's really hard sometimes and fair communication and space is HUGE.  It's really important to try to understand the differences in our personalities.  ESTJs will show love through actions - helping you do things that need to be done.  You need to appreciate that, it is important.  We hit roadblocks because I tend to approach conversations in a way that says you are doing x and it is making me feel y.  This is not a good approach for the enfp / estj pairing.  It is better to say I am feeling this thing and sometimes things you do make me feel this way and I am not blaming you but could you work with me on it.  ENFPs will also struggle believing ESTJs because sometimes they will come off as uncaring because they are direct and relying a lot less on emotion than we are, so when I feel like he should be apologetic about something and he does not believe he did anything wrong - we hit a wall.   However, honest talks that allow both people to honestly evaluate their own roles in the roadblocks are hugely helpful in my experience.  My ESTJ is the best.  It is not easy but no relationship is and we really bring out the best in each other and in good times, admire and appreciate the other person for embodying the things we struggle with.  I also find that when you try to consider the ESTJs actions and let them know how much you appreciate them for the things they do and are good at, they are MUCH more willing to discuss all our crazy theories.  My longest best friend is an ESTJ too and it's crazy how similar the issues and wonders are in those relationships and I do anything I can to nurture the connection with them, I hate the hate ESTJs get - they are awesome people.
1	My husband (ESTJ) and I (ENFP) typically don't talk a ton about deep emotional stuff, I mean, we do when we need to or if one of us is feeling particularly like we need that connection, but we do goof around a lot and have inside jokes. We really don't worry about the lighthearted nature of our  conversations. Ithink it's more of the fact that I can't rely on him completely for my emotional support. I really need a lot of connection from friends and family so I don't overwhelm him.
0	An assessment and missive for the supervisor, by the inferior INFP	Hello Boss.  There are a lot of things about you I can respect.  Your efficiency, your ability to push on that tender area to get people to react and do your will, your absolute adherence to the logical, to the numbered list.  Your passion and your absolute devotion to be the best you surely are.\n\nI have one message to deliver to you, boss, and I know you have the wit to understand.  \n\nBasically, you are obsolete.\n\nYour model has been the sexiest of the sexy, the fit guaranteeing the fittest, the sharpest amongst the pointedly stabbing.\n\nBut you deserve to be informed, that your model has had it's time and is deserving your glorious time off you generally won't consider you deserve.\n\nI am faster than you, I am more efficient than you, I actually have a utilization of logic that isn't self-cannibalizing.  I can lead other men without making them want to deservedly stab me in the throat, I can speak to someone without being patronizing, I do not have time for your sadism or your disregard.  In the same vein you look at a person and can quickly sum up their value and their worth to you, I am saying to you now, there is no use for you in a world that never asked you to teach it a fucking lesson.  The lesson you have to teach is that of cruelty, of disregard, or of lack of even the understanding of what you cannot understand or possibly comprehend due to your configuration.\n\nBasically, it comes down to this.  The next time you decide to flex your superficial power to hurt either myself or my compatriot, it's over.  I'm not only ripping out your jugular, I am taking out that which you love.  I am grabbing your wife by her pussy, and giving your mother a throat transplant.  I will speak the language you understand, you mother fucking masochistic piece of shit, and I will take you to that place you are too much of a fucking pussy to ever venture at any time due to lack of guts or anything resembling endurance, or basic tolerance.  I am your doppelganger and your nemesis, and you have taught me well.  You will scream like an utter bitch in absolute disbelief as I give you that which you have begged from me since my inception, and I will assure you, you will be satisfied with my performance.\n\nHope you have found god, you worthless cocksucking waste of any fucking resource with absolutely any fucking worth whatsoever.\n\nSo take it easy, enjoy the day, spend a few minutes sniffing the rose bush, but know that there is absolutely no animosity here.  You will not suffer, nor will those you love.\n\nIt's time for payback, mother fucker.  Open up and say ah :)  Daddy is coming home.
12	This is a weird sub.\n\nNever knew infps had such hatred inside them. 
10	Oh for goodness sake, grow up. I hope this was cathartic for you because nobody in this sub cares. 
8	Seek professional help. Really, this is bizarre, and I highly doubt that you're exclusively having this reaction due to "ESTJs". Not trying to sound "patronizing", but I hardly think this post deserves a long, eloquent reply detailing a bunch of resources. Hope you get better.
4	Kinda harsh to point directly at ESTJs with this. My bro is an ESTJ while I'm an INFP and he is legit one of the nicest people out there, actually nicer than me.\n\nThere are many assholes out there. Just learn to stand up for yourself  and you will be rewarded in the end. Hierarchies of power never worked and never will, these people will go down soon enough.
4	Whoaaaa... I guess you do become what you hate.

3	Should ESTJ‚Äôs become parents?	Everywhere online i‚Äôm always seeing people complaining about how their ESTJ dad or mom has ruined their life in some way or how they have a terrible relationship with them. As an ESTJ who would like to be a mom one day, reading all this has really made me wonder if I should just not be a mom at all. I would never want to have a child if my type is just generally not made to be a loving parent. Does anyone out there actually have a positive experience with an ESTJ parent or is it hopeless? 
7	Omg do not ever let that stuff make you second guess if you're going to love your kids.\n\nI say take a look at all of it as excellent anecdotal tools to help you prepare for any conflicts in case your children turn out to be really sensitive feelers (NFs). I have an Estj stepfather and lemme tell you, I'd be some spirally dreamy depression biscuit if he didn't bring some semblance of order and discipline into my and my ESTP mother's life üòÇüòÇüòÇ\n\nThe common thread I see for gripes with ESTJ parents are those who lean HARD on Si and close off any Ne. If you listen, communicate, and compromise with your children where necessary, while still keeping your head level about what boundaries NEED to be asserted, I have great faith in you. 
4	I've actually seen quite a few posts on the main mbti sub where members actually had really good things to say about their parents.  It surprised me too. \n\nMy dad is an ESTJ and the funny thing is, although he was man of the house, he was no where near what people claim ESTJ parents to be. \n\nHe was amazing and is my role model now. He was very involved with our lives, he got us in sports at a younger age and that was something we all stayed with until we graduated high school.  He coached all of us and went to as many games as possible and would even take off work so he didn't miss us. \n\nAs far as being those controlling parents, he wasn't even close to it.  My dad was a strong believer in letting people fuck up and suffer the consequences. Because we all played sports we had a lot going for us and my dad said we could party and drink all we wanted to, but if we got caught and in trouble, that was our own problem.  He wasn't constantly hounding us wanting to know where we were or what we were doing. And all 4 of us stayed the hell away from those crazy parties, and never really did anything horrible. He gave us the freedom to do whatever we wanted, and none of us did. My ESTP brother was the oldest and pushed the most boundaries, but he also had the most to lose and my dad would always remind him of that.  \n\nThe only thing I wish my dad did differently, was to help us out a little bit more financially.  He sorta threw us out into the world and wanted us to learn how to be adults, but quickly learned that it's not the same as when he was younger. He also didn't want to contribute to our educations at all which set us all back further than we wanted. \n\nMy mom is INFP and we had an awful relationship for at least 10 years. We never got along and she always assumed she knew me when in reality she had no clue. It's much better now, but I still have a lot of trust issues. \n\nAs far as my mom and my dad parenting together, my mom was a lot more open to allowing us to try new things and was good at convincing my dad that it was okay. They made sure every Sunday we had a family dinner and did a family vacation once a year but other than that they weren't too involved in our lives. I think they did a really good job. 
3	Also, keep in mind that because of the overlaps between the common ESTJ stereotypes and the actual job of parenting, it‚Äôs hard to know how many people actually have ESTJ parents and who just has parents.  If you think anyone who enforces a rule is an ESTJ and you‚Äôre a kid whose gross experience with rules has been with parents... Not everyone is an expert at typing.\n\nPlus, people rarely go on rants about the things they like, so you hear more negative than positive.\n\nAll parents screw up. It doesn‚Äôt matter what type you are, you‚Äôll mess it up one way or another.
1	My sister is an ESTJ mom and she absolutely loves her son.  She works grueling hours to provide for him.  (Of course she's a boss) hahaha
2	I Need Help Understanding my ESTJ Girlfriend	Hi, I'm a 25M ENFP who is dating a 20F ESTJ. She has been gone for about 4 weeks at a summer training program, and I am planning to drive out to visit her this weekend. \n\nSome background - we are both from a fairly conservative Christan setting, and have individually committed to be celibate until marriage. We have been dating for about 6 months now.\n\nI just got a nice card in the mail today (we snail mail each other on occasion) that just said that she feels nervous that I am coming to visit and she is afraid she won't be a good host for me, in basically so many words. I thought it was very sweet, but I'm a little confused as to what she is trying to accomplish by sending this - obviously it was important enough to her to go to the bother of going to the store, buying a card, and mailing it to me.\n\nWhat are some things that would motivate an ESTJ to go to so much effort just to share something like this?
5	She is explicitly telling you her feelings. That's pretty nice of her. Believe her, don't look for subterfuge. Reassure her that you are sure you'll have a great time because all you care about is seeing her and being with her. Like you said, it was effort for her to do this, reciprocate with some emotions. 
1	The ESTJ does not know how to optimize towards a goal, for not everything is optimizable yet it is the ESTJ's instinct to try to optimize with Te.\n\nThis is really a Fi thing, but Fi often finds an outlet via Te, (they are each other partner after all), but the normal Te outlets will not work for there is nothing to optimize.\n\nThus your girl has to find an outlet in another way and that is sharing her Fi feelings, and she wants you to acknowledge her Fi feelings and for her to feel seen, but at the same time do not rub her nose into it too much for she is feeling vulnerable and nervous.  Instead just hug her and say she is great / grand and then list a reason or two that she cares so much.  Let her know that she is seen both that you see her nervous feelings but you also see her in other things where she is less nervous, all her optimization, but sometimes ESTJs feel no one ever see them and all their caring and i tis this caring that drives them to optimize.
3	Took official test but...	Looking for some help. I dont like asking for help normally but sometimes its needed.\n\nI have taken the actual mbti test and scored ESTJ.

2	Out of those options, it sounds like you could be: ESFP, ESTP, or ENTJ (leaning towards the first two)
3	INFP in need of ESTJs for character study.	If anybody is willing to answer a whole bunch of questions, that'd be awesome! 
5	We are nothing if not reliable subjects.
1	I'll bite!
1	I‚Äòll answer questions!
1	I'm willing to answer questions but not the questions someone with a name like "fuckwad9000" has. 
1	I‚Äôm game for it if you‚Äôre still up to this.
1	I‚Äôm curious to know the results of whatever answers come from this study :)
