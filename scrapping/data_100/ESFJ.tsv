5	What do you guys think of us? - INTP	I'm just curious as to what ESFJ's think of INTP's. I've often wondered about this and I personally think of ESFJ's as kind of an enigma. I do admire your desire to help others and how gregarious you guys are. Seems like it comes so easy to you.\n\nAnyway, let me know what you think!
8	TBH, I think everyone is great until they prove otherwise
6	Personally, I think y’all great. Would like to make more INTP friends if you have discord (:\n\nI’ve gushed about INTPs so much I didn’t want to do it again because I’ll just seem creepy. 
3	i tend to get on very well with introverts, more than extroverts at least. i know it’s cliche but the quieter people are often more interesting and have more to say\n\ni’ve heard that INTP’s can be insensitive, which can be a downer for me. but if i know it’s not malicious or deliberate then that’s fine with me :)
3	ENTP here.\n\nI dated an ESFJ for along time and I will agree with the general consensus regarding xNTP needing to develop better interpretation and execution on emotional availability and empathy. The ESFJ on the other hand I believe benefits most from making decisions based on their own convictions and relying less on the approval of the people around them.
2	Yeah as ForeverJay wrote, many INTPs I've met aren't the most tactful people and can come off as insensitive, but I've learned that you rarely mean actual harm. Same with the ENTPs. \n\nI've also learned that INTPs have a tendency to over-generalize about things, and I've had to force myself not to take it personally. \n\nI've met a couple of INTPs who really developed their Fe and they were fantastic, some of the best people I've ever met. They were like super-INFJs, able to connect with a person and provide insight on their character as well as practical advice for how they can improve their lives. 
1	What's so exciting about small talk-INTP	seriously, that stuff drives me crazy, looking for different perspectives right now
3	I think it's cuz of Fe and Si. We enjoy sharing emotions with others. Small talk = pleasant, simple, and non-controversial, very easy going interaction. Furthermore, Si is detail oriented and "small" talk is how we learn about another person and possibly be able to deepen the friendship. People get really surprised when I can remember something they mentioned to me in passing, and they usually seem to appreciate it. 
3	Small talk is fun. I enjoy talking to people so it’s a way to fulfil that need of mine when there is not enough time or you don’t know them well enough to delve into deeper topics - like say when you first meet someone and you don’t know if they’re into the same wacky things you like.\n\nSmall talk may lack ‘depth’ but it has the potential to go deeper. I enjoy getting to know people, even if it’s in a shallower capacity. Small talk can evolve into more, it establishes a friendly rapport with the other person if you see them regularly enough. Small talk can bring you anything, it’s more like going with the flow and potentially you’ll make a great friend out of it!\n\nI also work in healthcare so sometimes being friendly is all it takes to make someone’s day. People enjoy talking about themselves so I let them do that. Small talk to me is less about the actual conversation topics and more about the atmosphere and connections you make along the way.
3	This shit's hilarious bro. \n\nINTPs have an ESFJ way of forcing shit down people's throats. This is too funny. I'm sure you mean to incite a reaction, but still, it comes off forceful and a bit offensive. Lmao.\n\nMy god, you guys crack me up sometimes.\n\n-ESFJ.
1	INTP from Argentina here (sorry if I make any mistake) It just feels like the needing to feel the void with "I agree with everyone" topics and postures. You can't see how really is the other.
9	Any other ESFJs have a turning point in life regarding how you see your friends/acquaintances?	In hindsight, when I was younger I spent lots of time with people who were not so great to me. A lot of my "friends" saw me as an option when I saw them as a priority. I kept making excuses for them and kept reaching out to plan things with them even though they never reached out to me. I guess I tried to see the good in them because I felt that's what I should do as their friend. I had the mindset that friendships should be long-term so I kept trying to breathe life into friendships I should have let die.  \n\n\nIn the past I've had "friends" who made false promises to me, bailed on commitments frequently, and even one choice friend who went behind my back to romantically pursue a girl I had been seeing for two months.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince cutting those people out of my life, I've noticed all my current friends are caring individuals who seem to value me as much as I value them. I now see that sometimes friendships are temporary, and that's okay. It's okay to cut people out of your life and sometimes friendships can start out good but then go bad. There's no reason to hold onto people if the friendship has gone bad.  \n\n\nAnyone else had a similar revelation?
3	Pretty similar experience for me. I hung out with pretty bad influences in high school who were shitty friends. At one point I stopped drinking and smoking pot with them and that’s when they stopped inviting me for hang outs; that’s when I realized they were shitty and immature. I would say I was also pretty disingenuous when I was with them and wasn’t being my true self. I felt like deep down, I was a really kind and caring guy, but with them, I was this apathetic asshole who pretended like I didn’t care about anything.  \n  \nI went through some pretty drastic changes after high school and made new friends pretty fast. I’ve changed friends a lot over the past decade, but I would say all the friends I’ve made since then are much better people who bring out the best in me and allow me to be authentic.  \n  \nI still see friends as temporary for the most part today. I’ve gone through so many different friend groups, and while I’m not on bad terms with any of them, we just all drifted apart. I’m not as attached as I used to be, but that doesn’t mean I hold back in my investment towards my friendships or that I doubt people. I just know better than to unrealistically think all my friends are going to be in my life forever. There’s nothing wrong with people having a temporary place in your life and that took me a long time to accept, and that is definitely still difficult to accept with some of my current friends. 
1	I agree! Us ESFJ like to give these people chances after chances, we always give give give but the friends we choose to give priority too, don’t give the same I return. I’m an overall very happy, positive, active female ESFJ! I noticed that I was attracting female friends that were total opposite of me. Draining me with their problems, self absorbed, never asking me about me or my life.. I’m in a new relationship and my eyes have totally opened.  It’s hard to face the fact the people you admire or “look up” too aren’t as great as we’ve made them out to be...but seeing how these friends treat me has been total eye opening! I don’t need ppl to steal my happiness, my positivity! I need to give that to people who give the same thing to me! I’ve recently “ghosted” lol (very immature lol I’m sorry) these friends and I’ve never felt better.  Sad thing is they didn’t really care for a while and guess what they have a bad week and who do they contact? Me lol... I completely agree w you! I think maybe I realized my worth and how much these friends were taking from me emotionally! 
1	My friends always saw me as an option. Nobody ever wanted to pair up with me among our friends, I was always picked last, and then they turn around and made me feel bad? If they were treated shitty too, why do it to me? We cut ties in high school and I was pretty much a loner, I wanted to do my own thing and just survive those years; and I did. Without them.
1	It would be ideal to be friends with people for life but it’s not reality. People change and outgrow each other all the time. You shouldn’t allow obligation to hold you back or them back.  Only keep people around that reciprocate in a positive fun way. \n\nThe main ESFJ problem is we allow ourselves to be tools too easily. Surround yourself with like minded people that reciprocate. It’s okay to try out friendships and people, it makes us feel naked or weird when we let go of any friends, period, but you will be less stressed and happier later. Don’t feel bad, don’t sugar coat your relationships, if they aren’t adding to your life, why let them take away from your life?\n\nLife is like a tree, your roots are the few great people in your life that are always there for you whether it’s family or friends. Your tree grows branches everyday and these branches are new relationships or new experiences. Sometimes branches die and fall off of your tree making room for new fresh branches to grow, this is okay. Overall, make sure your tree is healthy, beautiful, and prospering.   Make sure you have roots to fallback on while you create new relationships and experiences. 
1	Yes, so far it’s happened twice.\n1)I developed anxiety and depression, my friends couldn’t handle it. So I foraged friendships with mature adults.\n2) I discovered I do not have to shoulder everyone’s emotional burdens. I was able to keep my friends, but I adjusted my attitude toward them. I have been much healthier and happier since.
1	I’ve had to relearn this lesson so many times... I can’t help but believe everyone has my best interests at heart so I’ve been shat on a few times.\n\nOh well. 
7	Male ESFJs. You Guys Find Yourself Single for Long Periods of Time?	I haven't had a girlfriend in a year, but I also haven't been with a girl I really really liked in what feels like a hundred years (my INFP ex-it felt great to be with her; so cerebrally engaged, and adorable). Big sigh coming over me. \n\nI kind of feel like I have high expectations after a few run ins with non compatible chicks, and I have zero intentions on bringing them down.\n\nNo women has ever turned my eye or made my heart jump out my chest. I'm starting to wonder if there are long time single ESFJ males, and if so, how have you guys lived your lives?\n\nI mean we always have a hand if we need a hand if you know what I mean, but goddamn... casual flings are a possibility, but I don't feel confident in myself to do them-so I just toss that option out.\n\nAnyways, I'm into driving... extremely fast on the mountain passes. It's therapeutic in a sense. I wonder how you guys cope.
3	Yeah, I'm not very compatible with a lot of women even if almost everyone likes me or is drawn to me. I've even been told that a lot of women consider me to be out of their league, which is ridiculous because I was the quiet, skinny loner with only a few friends in high school lol\n\nAlso, I was reading through your comments about your charisma and how you hate to over use it. I totally relate to that sentiment. I wish it I could be book smart, but I'm not, so I often rely on my charisma and manipulating people's emotions. Speaking of charisma, I really hope I can talk my way into qualifying for this one private university's admissions requirement on Wednesday
5	INFP female, 46 here...who has been co-habitating with ESFJ male, 46 for the last 17 months.  Can I tell you that for him to be single for a long-term (as in say, over 6 months) would probably be his undoing.  Before we got together, he was dating multiple women casually and hadn't been in an "intimate" relationship for about a year.  He's got VERY high standards (and I have posted to this group before that I always feel so humbled by that because he is very much into the "best of everything" which on some level I apparently represent).  The thing with my particular ESFJ SO is that he really doesn't know what to do with himself without an "other".  He will improvise as much as he can, but ultimately will give in to the nagging feeling of being disconnected and will try to fill that with a temporary person.  But, since he doesn't really \*do\* temporary, these supposed flings end up being drawn out and lasting much too long, resulting in feelings of frustration (with settling for what he doesn't really want) and delusion (maybe if he hangs on it will somehow, some way get better and magically become all he wants it to be). \n\nWhen I met him, this is exactly where he was-with a woman who was 20 years his junior and frustrated as hell because she was a lot of fun, but out of control most of the time.  Her lack of self-discipline and the fact that she was reckless and irresponsible were making him crazy.  He's a lot of fun and very adventurous, but he's also very conscientious and for lack of a better way to put it-dutiful.  He knows when to "power down" so to speak.  She did not.  He knew that she was never going to be able to harness the things he wanted her to without becoming miserable, so when he met me, I was refreshing in a way.  \n\nWe started dating in May, and by October he had convinced me to move in with him.  And we've been together almost 2 years now, and it's been tough in some ways (I'm nowhere near as rigid in some aspects as he is and sometimes that causes the occasional rift) but I will tell you, it's hands-down the most committed, delightful, respectful, understanding and solid relationship I've ever been in...and I've been married before!  He is a person who needs to have That One Person.  And that woman can't just be any woman...so I benefit from his dedication and his attention and affection.  He's pretty damn amazing.\n\nMy advice to you is this:  Don't settle.  (I don't think you intend to)  Don't question your ability to wait (you have amazing friends and family who can fill-in for you and want to see you happy and satisfied in your relationships-we love our ESFJ's...we want them to max out their happiness quotient) because you can wait for the person you're looking for.  Just be content to work on your inner life and polish the gem that you already are-ESFJ's can sometimes have rough edges...polish them til they sparkle.  She'll see you and she'll be completely unable to resist you.  (I know-mine had me from jump!  LOL)
3	No comments yet, so I'll contribute best I can: \n\nMy ESFJ girlfriend also has extremely high standards. It's quite the confidence boost for me of course.\n\nShe did flings before meeting me in 2018, but at least according to her, they were only with the intention of a LTR. She would never do them with someone she wasn't interested in exploring something with. She spent about 7 months single.\n\n> but I don't feel confident in myself to do them\n\nIf you are an ESFJ, I think you have the charisma to easily do this.
3	Hm, I've been single for about 2.5 years now. Few reasons though:  my ex-wife cheated on me, so I'm going to be a little pickier this time around because of that (did have a temporary rebound flick after that); religions reasons--I don't date, a bit similar to arranged marriage or a traditional marriage of the old times, i.e. courting phase, engagement, then marriage, all within a year usually; I've really been focusing on personal growth during this time because now I have a better idea of what I did wrong in my marriage.  \n  \nCoping with single life hasn't really been that difficult for me, though. I've really enjoyed being able to connect with my friends again that I kind of put off while I was married. I get to focus more on my studies since I'm an undergrad student and attending graduate school this summer. I get to focus on my hobbies--I competed in powerlifting for the first time 2 years ago despite lifting for 12 years; also picked up photography. Also used my failed experiences to help my friends in relationships from making the same mistakes I made, which gave meaning to my pain.  \n  \nMarriage took up a huge proportion of my emotional energy and now that I am single, it means I get to spread that energy to other facets of my life. These other facets of my life make me feel fulfilled, so I think it makes being single easy. 
2	Out of 16 types, 8 are light and 8 are dark. ESFJs are one of the 8 light types:	
1	im willing to bet this has been posted on at least 5 mbti subreddits
6	ESFJ breakup	First post so plz be patient!\n\nJust got out of a long term very serious relationship with an INTJ and having hard time coping/moving on/being happy. \n\nHow would other ESFJs handle situations like this? 
9	don't over-romanticise your ex and the relationship. it wasn't  as great as you're making it out to be in your head, otherwise you would still be together\n\nyou will find someone to bond with as well as the previous person if not, better. but DON'T RUSH because these things will take time. and time is a great healer, so hang out with your best friends and family and before you know it, you'll feel a lot more strong\n\nkeep yourself busy. don't go back to him/her. spend time with other people. and most of all, good luck!
2	I’m an ESFJ who has been dating an INTJ for 4 years. I almost broke up with him last weekend. Here to talk if you ever wanna just discuss their personality type and how they mesh with ours, and also can lend an ear as a friend too. Best of luck getting through this!
1	1 minute of silence.
1	I'm an ESFJ. I kill all my feelings. Find things that I like, and do those things. You keep yourself occupied because shit hits the fan the moment you think. \n\nHowever, if you do want to think, look at your life in a detached manner. Remove "you" from the situation and see what can be improved, how you can be improved, and what can be done next time to be in a better relationship.\n\nOtherwise, stay busy, or you'll start self-loathing.
0	Who broke up with who? In any relationship usually the one being broken up with feels worse because they feel powerless.\n\nI had a gf I wanted to break up with once, but when she tried breaking up with me first I was devastated. It was so weird. \n\nI'm INTJ so I can't help with your ESFJ question.
7	How can I get closer to an ESFJ?(my mom)	My mom is an ESFJ and she always says that I'm not close enough to her and she gets sad when I don't talk to her much( at least as much as my sister).\n\n\nAnyways I like her and I don't want her to think that I don't like to talk to her; but as an INTJ I really don't like the subjects they choose to talk about and I don't want to end everything with an argument...\n\nWhat should I do? How can I make her sure that I like her? What kind of subjects can I choose to talk?!\n\n
1	Why dont you start the conversation and talk about something that interests you? Im an intj and my wife is an esfj and we have no problem having conversations. Just tell her something interesting you learned recently, or something strange or funny that happened to you, etc. \n\nOr find a tv show that both of you like and watch it together. 
1	Well then you tell her that when you try to talk to her, she shuts you down and says ‘why is that important to know?’
1	I feel bad for spinning it this way, but based on your response to Miyagi...\n\nI think your mom might want you to be what she ideally wants and you're not that. So because of that, she doesn't "feel" close to you. \n\nThat, or she wants you to share emotional shit. I am hoping it is the latter.
1	Find what she likes to do and do it alongside her. Card games? Board games? Working out? Watching old shows? Volunteering? Spring cleaning? Literally anything that she enjoys try to engage in that with her. She will feel loved that you are taking time to learn her interests, and slowly but surely that will grown into an emotional and respectful bond. \n\nAlso, ask her questions about life. Ask her what she was like growing up, or how she got through (insert whatever) when she was your age. It sounds like she loves you and wants you to be your best, this might encourage her that you are really trying to better yourself by seeking her advice
1	Make her something thoughtful, frame a picture or make a scrapbook page with you and her in it. Buy her something she's been needing and mentioned, esfj's mention everything. Tell her that you appreciate her and love her.
2	just wondering how ESFJs would respond to this	[u/throwaway3n1p](https://www.reddit.com/u/throwaway3n1p) and I are currently working on gathering answers for how thought processes work in different MBTI types. This is just out of curiosity, not an attempt to stalk you according to how you think of grave crimes. All replies are appreciated!\n\n If we count judgments of *moral obligation* out of the equation, \n\nQuestion 1: How is murder logically fine?\n\nQuestion 2: How is murder logically wrong?\n\nNOTE: Feel free to write down whatever thought you have, whether it is emotional or just plain retarded.
2	Question 1: I would say murder is logically fine if it is in self-defense or accidental. Such as if is was late at night and you accidentally hit someone with your car.\n\nQuestion 2: I would say murder is logically wrong if it is pre-determined or if it was a gruesome act. \n\nI don't know if that's what you're looking for, but that's all I got.
1	I’d have trouble thinking of murder as fine— I inherently think of murder as the amoral killing of someone... IE if a killing were in self defense, it wouldn’t be murder; and if a killing were a murder... I don’t think it could be moral.  I’m coming up with a blank when I try to think of a scenario where murder is logically fine. Maybe if murdering the one allows 10,000 to live? Or something.  The question is (borderline) oxymoronic to me— removing moral obligations from an inherently amoral act is sort of asking what ice feels like if you remove the water, sort of. \n\nMurder is logically wrong in that it is the most extreme possible form of forcing one’s will onto another separate, sovereign being. If someone forces you to attend some event you don’t want to go to— they are forcing their will on you for a couple hours. Killing someone is exerting your will over another person permanently— to the degree that they can’t even ever operate under their own volition again, it just ends their personhood/life. It takes their autonomy/self determination/freedom away permanently— but a million times more extreme than that. \n\nDoes that give you any helpful info?
1	personally speaking, i would have problems answering the question because there's no way murder is okay if moral obligations are discounted
1	1) Self-Defense, Accidental (but harboring that guilt would suck for anyone, and Vengence.\n\n2) When you or anyone weren't harmed in the first place. Essentially, the person must do wrong first for you to do wrong on that person. Yeah, the logic is off-ish, but the idea is that it ends with the person who started it-if that makes sense.
1	If I am correct murder is always intentional. If you kill somebody by accident there is another word for it. Accidents happen.\n \nBased on that no murder (except self defense) is okay in my eyes.
2	How does your Ne work?	ISFP gang\n\nAs the title said. How do you react to people stating their intentions and stuff like that. 
2	I like it
1	Do you not like it, OP? How does it appear to others? (-asking as an ENFP noticing people’s microexpressions lately, when I do this. Unsure of what it means) 
1	To your first:\nWit (sarcasm), finding ways to deliver a message, similies & metaphors, problem solving, thinking of possibilities, irrational romantic dreaming, etc.\n\nTo your second question:\nI try to determine their angle, and think of possibilities. I try to figure out what it can be and can't be. Then, I pretty much estimate where they're going with it-I'm usually wrong, but I'm usually right haha.\n\nI wouldn't say I'm a healthy ESFJ. I'm not one to eat others' dust because I was "happy-go lucky."
6	Young ESFJ would love to hear advice of older ESFJs	Title says it all. I am 23 and have changed so much in the last 4 years since living on my own. I’d like to hear how life has changed for you as you aged and what lessons you wish you learned earlier. Or just anything that you wish you knew younger. 
12	Probably the main thing I learned in my 20s as an ESFJ is that friendships can be quick and intense but they don't have to be forever. (As an ESFJ, i feel all friendships ought to be forever!) \n\nI've realised my strength is friendship, its like my super power, its natural to me and one of my strengths, but other people don't see friendship that way and can be quite defensive if you try to enter their circle, or some logical types just think 'I don't need another friend'\n\nWhen I was in my early 20s, when someone would reject my friendship I would be devastated, I'd really take it personally. But I've eventually realised, just take that friendship offer and move it onto the next person, if one person doesn't accept its not personal, they just don't need your friendship right now.\n\nI currently have 2 intense 'new' friendships in my life, 2 separate people in my life who've popped up in my life in the past year, they don't know each other and have never met, but they have both taken to calling me their best friend.\n\nWhich is lovely, I'm delighted! But after many years of 'best friends' popping up and then disappearing from my life, I realise now (and have come to terms with) that just because I think a friendship should last forever, most people don't, and more than likely, when my two new friends have moved through the difficult times in their lives, they'll message me less and less and move on.\n\nAnd I'm ok with that, because I'll meet more new and interesting people to make friends with and go through the same process all over again.\n\nI'm not sure any of this makes sense! My advice would be, to a younger ESFJ: just because you see the offer of friendship as something personal and long term, doesn't mean others do. And you'll hurt whilst you learn that, but also become wiser for it. 
1	when it comes to professional jobs, be prepared for how goal-orientated the world of work is\n\nyou'll get people who are ruthless and only care about putting people down in front of others to show how much of an aggressive worker they are. and sometimes, people don't take into consideration emotions when making decisions, but achieving whatever they need to achieve to get a a great grade from their manager or a promotion\n\nalso you can put in the most effort at work, always show up on time, do whatever your manager tells you to do and be nice to your colleagues. but that doesn't mean that you're the best worker. if anything, you're average. you need to go beyond your expectations and be extremely proactive while making the best (not nicest) decisions\n\nto ESFJs, this is brutal. my advice would be not to take it personally, especially if you're receiving feedback from your manager. don't think of it as feedback against your character, but things you can honestly do better and what you're capable of. and being an ESFJ, there's something unique that you'll be able to offer the team. there's a reason why you've been hired, so bring your own strengths and use them well :) \n\ni'm 26 so still fairly young, but in the last 2 years i felt that i've really started to grow up (which sounds weird but eh)
1	I'm 25.\n\nAlways aim to improve. If someone says you're shortsighted, ignore Fe and tap into Si Ti and Ne ASAP. Do not get confrontational, OR defensive. Think of times you were and find ways to improve your Ti.\n\nRead a lot of things that don't interest you to open your mind a little.\n\nAlso, whatever it is, just do it. You hate it, don't fuck about. Do it. If you hate accounting, but it's going to make you money so you can do your own thing, DO IT. Fuck how it feels. You're feelings will drag you down.\n\nYou can thank me later you lucky young bastard.
2	Survey on Flirting behaviors and personality	Hey I am a doctoral Student at a University in the South. I am studying flirtation behaviors, specifically trying to catalog specific flirting behaviors taken from several experimental studies. I was wondering if I could post to this community as it seems relevant to my topic. Thank you in advance for taking the time to take the survey there is an opportunity to win a gift card if the entire survey is completed. You can back out at any time.\n\nHere is the link to the survey\n\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JMQP5PJ

6	Favorite thing about ESFJ?	ESFJs spend most their time telling others what they like about them. And don’t get to hear much themselves, that’s why they try to hard to be the perfect person for each individual. What’s your favorite thing about ESFJs?
6	We actually talked before, but to recap I (ENTP) dated an ESFJ for close to three years.\n\nThe things that I loved about her personality are...:\n\n* Projected the most positive and energetic natural energy of any person I ever met.\n* Gave a LOT of attention (also wanted a lot of attention and affirmation which I like doing.)\n* Very affectionate and sincere. She was overwhelmingly the most authentic person I have ever been involved with for almost all of the relationship.\n* The reactions she would have to the things I did for her were the absolute best. For example I would write her notes before I saw her, then I would hide them in her room or in her car and then there would be this little game she would have to play after I left where she would have to find it. Was always the cutest thing when she found it and read it. Secondly she would damn near cry tears of joy when I got her flowers. \n* When we went out on dates she would go above and beyond with making herself look really pretty. I'm talking the kind of pretty that radiates. From my perspective she always made an effort to capture a high class look when going out on dates (Akin to going to an opera or fancy restaurant. She absolutely nailed it.\n* When it came to work and school, she displayed the greatest dedication and work ethic of anyone I have ever met. When I first was getting involved with her this was something that I saw as a tremendous plus. The caveat on this point is she would tend to prioritize her entire day around either being in work, or cramming her schedule with school (She would work weeks ahead of everyone else in the courses and not be satisfied with anything but near perfection.) at the expense of maintaining her own mental well-being. It was sort of my influence on her to try and make sure she had time to do what she wanted to do. That was very difficult. That being said later on in life where ever she ends up she will be stellar at what she does and applies herself to.\n* Her sense of organization is naturally dead-opposite of mine. Throughout the relationship her influence on organization was bleeding through into how I lived. Definitely one thing that I sorely miss haha. \n* Her sense of planning, while meticulous and almost down to the minute, was also something that did translate. She made me have a greater emphasis about the near-term rather than my natural tendency to prioritize future circumstances over today's needs. There were times that it was a little overbearing (Like visiting her extended family on a schedule akin to a political excursion.) but it was a part of the package that was who she is.\n\nThere are a LOT more than these but maybe something I said some of you ESFJ's can relate to. 
2	i'm an ESFJ and i'm self-consciously trying hard not to base how i feel on the compliments (or lack of) that others give me. it's hard since i've naturally grown up judging myself on what other people say and do. and i need to be more confident in the way i carry myself
2	(INFP) -\n\nCan't say for sure, but I'm almost positive my coworker is this type. She gets shit done way faster than me and makes the most amazing cupcakes I've ever had. She brings cupcakes to work all the time and it makes everyone happy. She also always finds a way to be super positive and energetic, even though she has a lot of her plate with a day job and being a ministers wife/mom. Solidly warm person. Oh, she also has an appreciation for the aesthetic of her immediate surroundings that I envy. She set up a coffee bar and all kinds of pictures/motivational quotes are her desk on her first day and I was amazed.

8	seeing the red flags/becoming an emotional doormat	Hello my fellow ESFJ's. I've been on numerous breakup sites, toxic relationship sites etc. I just wanted a different perspective. As ESFJs we tend to form ourselves to be what people need/want us to be, to make them happy?\n\nI recently got out of a relationship which was so incredibly toxic. I ignored all the red flags (which is pretty normal I think) but the thing is, even after I got my heart broken, I idolized my ex. I still harbor love for my ex, and pain for the fact that my ex is so broken and that's why I was put through the things that happened in the relationship. Now, almost done with grief, I never even really hated my ex. I still don't. I don't secretly still love my ex or anything, but I still hope she's happy. I forgive her for the things I was put through because I KNOW I turned myself into an easily manipulated person because that's who my ex needed me to be. I went into the relationship with a backbone and while I was in it, turned into the helpless person my ex was obsessed with "saving".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI guess my question is, have you dealt with turning into a stranger during a relationship just to make your partner happy? How did you avoid this later on? And how did you move on? I feel like because I feel mostly sadness for my ex and her circumstances that made her the way she is, I would have stayed and helped her be the person she wanted to be by using me as an emotional doormat. I just never want to loose myself again, but at the same time, would do it all over again because my relationship with my ex was so special. 
2	I've had a very similar experience. At first, I was depressed about losing myself and scared that I'll repeat my mistakes. Recently, after spending time with friends who are patient and not judgemental, I've realized that all I can do for the future is to not make the same mistakes. I try my best not to rush head first into pleasing someone. However, I realized that I can still care about other without emotionally over committing myself. Best of luck on your journey through life :)
2	OP, I had to break this up into two different posts. I will follow this one up with another post with my quotations... but hopefully you will find something valuable based on my (ENTP) relationship with an ESFJ. Dated for close to three years so I like to think i know what I am talking about with chiming in here. Below are three comments where I chimed into other posts under r/ESFJ in the last few weeks which cover different points... Before I get started with directly quoting prior contributions I do want to add a couple of short points based on your post specifically. \n\n" I idolized my ex. I still harbor love for my ex, and pain for the fact that my ex is so broken and that's why I was put through the things that happened in the relationship."\n\n* I can only speak from experience on how I was dumped by my ex, who claimed the relationship was toxic. She stopped communicating with me and chose to bottle up issues instead of talking to me. We were long term so I would have greatly appreciated having a legitimate discussion rather than her not saying anything. Contrary to belief as an ENTP we are not only very capable of handling conflict but we are also relatively receptive. Had she actually worked on the relationship I would have done what I needed to do for the sake of the relationships integrity. \n\n" I forgive her for the things I was put through because I KNOW I turned myself into an easily manipulated person because that's who my ex needed me to be. I went into the relationship with a backbone and while I was in it, turned into the helpless person my ex was obsessed with "saving". "\n\n* I think this happens more than you realize. We will bend our own convictions (Did the same) in order to make somebody else happy. Later on we realize what we had done to ourselves. This is part of the healing process to my understanding. You should not be someones pet project. You should never be looking for that metaphorical white knight to save you. **If you take nothing else out of my novel of a comment. You are valuable and you have value as a person.** \n\n"  I would have stayed and helped her be the person she wanted to be by using me as an emotional doormat. I just never want to loose myself again, but at the same time, would do it all over again because my relationship with my ex was so special. "\n\n* You won't say it so I will. There is still regret in your heart about the relationship and you wish things happened much differently. Again this is normal. I am going to assume by how you wrote your post that you were the one who got dumped? Regardless you should never lose yourself in someone else. Remember that your needs are important and you are an individual who should make your own decisions independent of what other people want or believe. That doesn't matter if you're ENTP (easy for us) or if you are ESFJ (Harder to understand that concept naturally.)
2	OP, See my first post since I exceeded to 10,000 character limit haha!\n\n\-----------------\n\n**Comment #1 from:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/ESFJ/comments/aspi5b/clingy\_needy\_just\_miss\_people/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ESFJ/comments/aspi5b/clingy_needy_just_miss_people/)\n\n*"I (ENTP (close to being an INTP) dated an ESFJ and I will say a couple of important things about my analysis of her that may help some of you.*\n\n1. *From her behavior she put way too much emphasis on what other people believed she should do rather than her own agency. I could never get her to do what SHE wanted to do.*\n2. *She would become "friends" with anyone but could never see what I already know. Most people are not your friends because there is a difference between acting cordial, friendly, and actually being friends with you.*\n3. *She was ALWAYS very clingy toward me. I never saw this as a problem because I liked the attention she gave me. She had days where it was overwhelmingly clingy and the way I got through it was to simply gloss over the clingy periods as if it is like her having a bad day. A clingy day doesn't have the weight to change my relationship with her because I find something she did too clingy.*\n4. *SHE pushed me away from her life. Not because of her neediness. She had problems with her father and I firmly believe she took out her frustrations with her father on me when it finally reached a point she could no longer handle it. Also bonus points for replacing me with the gym trainer almost immediately, because "I don't know whether I want to be with you or explore the possibility with this guy.". was a lovely touch for the long term boyfriend who treated her very well to receive on his way out the door. Haha.*\n\n*Long story short not to label all ESFJ under one roof. But I believe there is a possibility that many ESFJ are far too emotionally driven to understand when they are not making the best of decisions. The strongest development any ESFJ can make in my opinion has to do with maintaining an emotional grounding when in more adverse scenarios. The second most important development point in my opinion related to ESFJ is a stronger sense of acting based on what YOU believe and what YOU want. Not based on outside influences and biases within your friends, family, co-workers, acquaintances, etc."*\n\n\------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Comment #2 (A reply to another comment in the above post)**\n\n*" And my angle on it comes from someone who had nothing but love for an ESFJ whom I actually thought was pretty developed all things considered. Sadly since I am ENTP I can immediately see exactly what you realized with friendships. Not only could I not....get her to see reality, but since she is on the younger side of the spectrum, I learned how incredibly easy it is someone to maliciously influence an ESFJ. I have no doubt the "friends" I suggested she keep at an arms length were the ones she wanted to win approval of and they at least attempted to sabotage the relationship her and I had lol... The friends she had who were actually very good people who cared about her as well were of sorts, cast away as well.*\n\n*If nothing else the guy who replaced me immediately was the one who vultured the relationship and she bought into it for likely the same reason. New person whom she wanted to win the approval of.*\n\n*Sadly I think ESFJ are incredibly susceptible to being used and unlike some other types I am familiar with, I don't even believe they can understand that they are being used until way too late."*\n\n\------\n\n**Comment #3:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/ESFJ/comments/a6jlxs/how\_do\_i\_manage\_esfj\_subtle\_silent\_treatment/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ESFJ/comments/a6jlxs/how_do_i_manage_esfj_subtle_silent_treatment/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*" Very interesting take on this. My (23/m ENTP (borderline INTP) Ex girlfriend is ESFJ and rather than addressing the problems she was having in the relationship (almost 3 years in) she ended up dumping me, going the rebound route almost immediately and claimed I was making the relationship toxic (believe me I picked apart the whole relationship because I was taken aback by that statement and wanted to make sure that I was not subconsciously doing something wrong.). I have spent the last two months diving into human psychology, psychotherapy, attachment styles and anything else I could possibly find to get the answers I needed for closure at the least.*\n\n*Looking back she was capable of communicating but only up to a certain point. By the point the relationship ended it was long overdue for some kinds of discussions to work on the relationship and move it to the next step.*\n\n*It doesn't help that I could see right through her bubbly nature to see how hard she was trying to hide how her past was hurting her and I asked her to face it so she could get past it in time and be happy. (ENTP live and breath self improvement and INTP break shit down to a molecular level like its nothing.)*\n\n*Word on the street is she is acting a lot different now and not characteristic to who she is. Basically I'm betting on house money that she is trying to bury me and she will not be successful because she will not be able to replace how compatible we were at the end of the day (not looking at it with rose colored glasses btw). She will be hard pressed as an early 20's girl to find another guy who will be both long term and check off all the boxes I was doing.*\n\n*I think she is affected by her decision to end the relationship more than she leads on. I definitely think ESFJ cant handle personal development, conflict, or stressful situations at all. I remember having to talk my ex off of basically the edge of tears because of something that was almost mundane to me, but it was very important in her eyes."*
1	Oh, absolutely. I was like the amazing morphing girlfriend, turning into whatever a guy wanted.\n\nWhat helped: \n\nNot dating for a good long while. Spending a lot of time learning what -I- like to do.\n\nHaving good friends to keep me grounded -- like the kind who remind you that you hate being cold and your sudden desire to learn to ski may not be your own idea entirely, or that your newfound passion for cowboy boots is at odds with your sense of style since forever.\n\nSeeing a therapist to help keep me on the right track.\n\nWorking on loving myself and realizing that there are plenty of people who love me exactly the way I am. One of my girlfriends actually pointed that out once… That there are many people care for me very much, and just because none of them were (at the time) in a romantic way, did not mean I was unlovable or needed to change. \n\nLooking at other people who are single, particularly later in life, and realizing that many of them have a very happy, active, fulfilling lives, and that I don’t need to warp myself into someone else to be happy and fulfilled
4	Interested in me...or ESFJ's just like everyone?	Hi there! I'm quite smitten with an ESFJ. As you delightful extroverts tend to be, he's just nice and loves all people. \n\nHe is also humble, perhaps leaning to the point of density😆 So I have tried to be very intentional about making my feelings clear. He seems to be responding well, giving encouraging feedback. \n\nBut what's the difference between an ESFJ who's interested and one who's just being their normal, bubbly selves? Even if you do get interested, is it maybe just because the person put the idea in your head? Not because you independently admire them? \n\nThanks! 
7	I think that an ESFJ that likes someone will definitely ask him/her out or find opportunities to get to know you better and have alone time. If he shows up more often and asks questions about your family/friends/personal life and has long drawn out conversations - I would say there's a good chance he's interested.\n\nWhile I am a ESFJ girl, I like to be bubbly around people but I will always try to find an opportunity to be around the person I like... to make them a priority in a way. 
4	My ESFJ boyfriend was pretty straightforward about his feelings for me from the beginning. He makes friends with everyone, and is a bit flirty with everyone by nature. He was was more upfront with me though, saying his intentions, really showing a vulnerable side of himself. I feel like if you get talking and he opens up a bit it could be a good sign.
3	i'm an ESFJ and tbh, when talking to people i'm interested in then i'm very forward and upfront about it (even though in my head i think i'm playing it very cool and taking it slowly)\n\ni saw in one of your comments that he's passed a few opportunities to hang out together - which makes me think that he could like you but not in that way yet - and is very aware not to lead you on. then again, i'm very dense when people are attracted to me. \n\nthere's still time though, so i wouldn't give up yet!
2	ESFJ (gay woman) here, and I can only speak for myself. I hate conflict and I am pretty good at feigning ignorance when someone I’m not interested in is clearly into me. I’ll be nice and friendly but I’ll avoid one on one situations for sure if I think they want something to go down. At the same time, I’ll usually talk openly about crushes on other people, etc, to make it obvious I’m not on the same page. Men tend to mistake my friendliness for interest. Not saying this dude isn’t into you, I don’t know the situation at all, just giving the negative perspective. If I like someone I make a deliberate effort to be with them
1	Recently been dealing with a guy at work liking me and not taking a hint that I don’t want to go out with him. He asked me out once and because I’m nice I said yes and took my roommate in hopes it would be clear im not interested. Not sure if he got the idea but he’s backed off for sure. Also ESFJs gossip a lot so if this guy asked some of my co-workers he’d find out, maybe. Another thing is people are pretty darn loyal to the ESFJ even though they gossip with everyone so you’d have to find a person in your office who the ESFJ talks to that doesn’t realize it’s gossip they need to keep to themselves. For me if this guy asked the right person I’m sure they’d tell him without realizing it would hurt his feelings. 
7	Clingy? Needy? Just miss people?	Do you ever accidentally turn people off/push them away by your seeming neediness? I can't tell if I'm overwhelming my friend by constant texting. I really miss her and just want her to know I'm here and would love to listen/hangout/talk. I feel like my emotions can lead me to be too  clingy. Advice?
3	Yes, I'm an ESFJ and it's taken me many years to realise, not all people see friendship the same way I do; I used to be almost offended if someone didn't want to reciprocate the intense friendship I can offer.\n\nBut I've mellowed since I turned 30 a few years ago, and can see now that I was certainly intense and why it put people off.\n\nI think one thing I learned is, if somebody wants to be your friend, they just will be! It doesn't matter how much you text or see them, or don't - if someone wants you in their life, they make themselves available, and will accept you for the crazy intense friend that you are!\n\nMy advice would be try and distract yourself, if you think 'I want to text my friend' open up a game on your phone or something, and distract yourself for a few minutes. Or some other app. 
2	I (ENTP (close to being an INTP) dated an ESFJ and I will say a couple of important things about my analysis of her that may help some of you.\n\n1.

3	Check out my new (android) dating app for MBTI and Enneagram communities!	
1	How do you deal with matching people?
2	Relationship with drugs and alcohol.	Curious about other ESFJs relationship with drugs and alcohol. 
2	Practically none. have about one drink per month or less, no drugs at all
2	I drink a glass of wine or two 0-4 times a month. I’ve never been drunk. I’ve never done drugs.
2	i like social drinking but avoid drinking alone or if there's no occasion 
1	I‘m 18 and I don’t drink nor do drugs\n\nEDIT: I forgot to add. It’s legal for people of my country to drink low-alc drinks (beer, ... etc) at the age of 16 and all the other beverages at 18.\n\nStill, no interest.
1	Never done drugs, have literally no interest. Drink mostly socially, unless I'm in the mood for a bath and a G&T/beer/wine at home. Never been drunk.
1	My (ENTP) ESFJ ex-girlfriend would best be described as a social drinker. I was told of stuff in her late teens that may alter my answer. However the past is not relevant to me and only what I personally knew. 
1	Never have tried any drugs. Waited till I was almost 21 to drink - only drink socially now.
2	How to get over breakups as an ESFJ	How do you all get over a breakup even if the relationship was not right and torture the entire time? I find myself having to make myself hate the person by thinking about the worst parts of them. But with a relationship it’s hard to do that because you’ll think about the good, even if it’s few. I loose so much sleep over thinking and thinking what could have been. 
7	It's so ESFJ of you to only remember the good things about your ex.  LOL...this is something you guys just naturally do.  I've talked to my ESFJ SO about how he coped after his marriage ended (long before I came along) and for him finding people he could confide in who gave him a different perspective on the relationship was really helpful to him.  He HAS TO talk things out-another ESFJ trait that is just innate.  It's how you guys tend to problem-solve.  \n\nHe first went to his pastor, and then when he came to the conclusion that maybe he was the issue, he went to counseling.  He didn't go for a long time, but he did go and it did help him to see that there were some things he contributed to the relationship that bogged it down and made it very hard for his ex-wife.  He also had amazing friends who finally felt that they were able to tell him the truth about his ex-wife and how mis-matched they were from the beginning.  And at that point, because he had prepared himself by doing some serious soul-searching he was able to hear these people  and accept the truth about his ex.  She wasn't a bad person, she just wasn't the type of person he needed to be with-they were so very, very different.  \n\nESFJ's need sounding boards, people whose opinions they trust and who know them well.  These friends have known him his whole life, and because he worked so hard to hold the relationship together for so many years, they rooted for him and the marriage.  When it ended, they weren't surprised and in some cases they were actually relieved because he had become so unhappy, even though he put on a good front about it.  \n\nInventory your people.  You know who your go-to, got-your-back-no-matter-what people are and just be candid with them.  Tell them you're having trouble reconciling the finality of all this and you want to know their take on it.  The insight these people have will help you tremendously.  Your people LOVE you, absolutely think the world of you because ESFJ's are inherently lovable, dear people.  I also recommend maybe 3-4 sessions with a good relationship therapist.  Let him or her dredge the depths with you.  They don't judge and they are fantastic listeners and as an ESFJ you will talk yourself to the conclusion you've been seeking.  And that therapist will cheer for you once you do because seeing you guys get your equilibrium back just strengthens everyone else around you.  You're our rock, and we hate seeing you flounder (and often times don't know how to help you feel better...)\n\nGood luck to you-you're going to be okay.  I promise!
2	I just broke up with my bf and I feel your pain and I'm sorry :( \n\nI have found that the best way to cope is not to dwell on his faults, but instead to think about why he and I didn't work well together. We are still great friends and I really care about and respect him, but for various reasons we would not make a good married couple. Try to focus on why you broke up and how both of you will be better off as friends. It will take time and maybe even some distance to really recover and detach emotionally. I hope you two can be good friends eventually and spur each other on to be better people! \n\nHugs and understanding ❤️
1	I’m not sure if this applies to other ESFJs but this video was my holy grail when I thought I was broken for good. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/k0GQSJrpVhM
18	Advice for my fellow ESFJs	
2	We cancelled a romantic trip this weekend because there was, "too many other things that need my attention right now".  Ah, an ESFJ man who needs to keep everyone happy.  At least I had the guts to tell him I was disappointed and though his logic was spot on (because yeah, we do have a lot of things we need to finish up and have some closure on, business-wise) I would like to be considered someone who needs his attention, too.  He agreed, and yet the trip was still cancelled.  Such is the life of living with an ESFJ man.
1	I tell myself this all the time. 
1	So I have a few questions	I have determined I am probably an ESFJ but I just want to check.\n\nAre esfj enneagram 1s common? 126 probably.\n\nAlso I peaked in to a thread and everyone seems to be a big reader of fiction on here. I find that I am actually much more interested in non-fiction. Is that not a common esfj thing?\n\nI am also fairly ambitious hopeing to work for my political party. Perhaps not being a person who runs for elections but some sort of person that works with others in either campaign or with a congressman. Is this rare for esfj or is this normal?\n\n\nI also read widely like stuff like word and trivia games and read widely to know a bunch of stuff, mostly if not entirely non-fiction. it may not be books but stuff like this on websites like this just researching stuff.\n\n\n\nThat’s all I have for now maybe I’ll come up with more.
1	I can only speak for myself and my observations. I read almost exclusively nonfiction. My enneagram type is 2w1 and my tritype is 2-6-1. ESFJs can be very ambitious. \nHere’s some information on enneagram and mbti correlations.\nhttp://www.goconscious.com/home/articles/tom-flautt.html\nhttps://personalityjunkie.com/07/myers-briggs-enneagram-mbti-types-correlations-relationship/
1	http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=LSE_subtypes\nhttp://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=ESE_subtypes\nMaybe the subtype descriptions will help? There are two for each type.
6	your biggest weakness?	I consider mine to be inflexibility and struggle with improvisation.  Has anyone been able to improve upon these traits? 
6	Yeah I'm shit at improvising. I've kinda learned to improve by "fake it till you make it" in the moment. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy biggest issue is that I depend on other people for my emotional well-being too much, and end up becoming a doormat.
5	I notice that if I have a problem involving the ESFJ they take it really personally and beat themselves up about it, even if they did nothing wrong.
2	probably the fact that i can't take criticism well (end up taking it personally and ruining my whole day + sleep), or that i have low self-esteem so i tend to blame myself for a lot of things that happen which are out of my control\n\ni'm actively aware of both of these weaknesses but it's so hard to snap your mind out of it when you get into the rut
2	Being liked. \n\nA double edged sword if you will. It's stressful to try to make people like you-it's why I avoid all forms of people (oh wait, I have a sales job-fuck).
1	Can you explain more? Flexibility in what way? And what do you mean improvisation. 
1	Yes, please expound more on what you mean. Give an example.
1	 Are you frustrated with circumstances in which you have to be flexible or improvise? Or are you avoiding them?
1	Inflexibility is a common SJ concern. We may have to expose ourselves to uncomfortable situations, in order to improve. \nI work as a substitute teacher, which requires a lot of flexibility and improvising.\nCan you involve yourself in hobbies that require improvitization? Personally, I play games with people that you have to think on your feet. One of them is called Snake Oil. You have to try to sell a ludacris invention to other players. There are also some Jackbox party games you play using cell phone and a console of some sort.\n\nSide note- some people may struggle with anxiety, which makes adapting to change and trying new things even more challenging.
1	haha im an intp\n\nthis is mildly amusing to me ;)\n\nand from my experience you have to make it before you can fake it (because to fake it and survive you have to know what the hell youre doing)\n\nmy biggest weakness is going along with traditions without questioning them, cant do it (wait, thats not a weakness. hmmmmmmmmmmm)
1	Look through my user history, please?	I don’t think I see fe in myself. But does someone efj here preferably want to look through my user history and tell me if they think I am one of you?\n\nThanks.\n\nAnd please please explain. I don’t think I have fe but I could be wrong.\n\nPeople say my posts don’t read like estj and I don’t seem like one.
1	We can chat to see if I can see any Fe in you (: 
1	Have you ever asked friends and family? They get to interact with you in person.
2	Take my MBTI Survey	[Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1WMhQAkegNdJ-A3xJcFrW-nFWrr7GmA0hZas0JV9VNgo/edit#response=ACYDBNhQ0PU1TZRvnGkP7PGc90QBwl3lFCfIB3vZtgcv085JbaqmtEYnxBTSVuifSUBK2rE)
1	This survey is impossible, because people don’t know the descriptions of all of the personalities!
3	Opinions on Conservatism/Right-Wing Politics	I've seen a hypothesis that SJs, more than any other type, is prone to take conservative/right-wing views in various degrees of intensity more than any other political world view, and I want to test it out in the real world of ESFJs (i.e. all of you). What do all of you think about the usefulness/validity/desirability of any of the varieties of conservative thought out there?
5	i tend to hate right wing politics as it's very uncaring towards people. especially when it comes to issues like welfare, health care and attitudes towards minorities (women, racial minorities, LGBT)\n\nleft wing policies care about people who have hit rock bottom or faced injustices through no fault of their own. and ultimately that's what I value as an ESFJ
4	I think it's interesting being an ESFJ. The SJ stereotype is that we lean toward tradition and order, which is associated more with conservative politics. On the other hand, as an ESFJ, we're also really caring towards people, which I think falls more inline with liberal politics. Personally, I don't consider myself either one but find myself to be more balanced between the two. I primarily dislike far right and far left politics, though. I don't think extremes are good. It's very gray for me. I try to stay away from politics for the most part. 
3	I have heard we are more likely to be susceptible to media manipulation.  And I think I had that issue at the last election but with the left. So I could see it at older ages but all the young ESFJs seem to very liberal. I have learned a lot from the last election. 
1	Well... not exactly.\n\nESFJs, just like all SJs, base their decisions on their past experiences. If growing up most folks around me are conservative, then I will be too. If I feel rejected by most of the people around me, I'm going to end up trying to find a different route.
1	I'm a textbook ESFJ, and I'm very politically liberal. then again, so are my parents, so that may be part of the tradition thing for me! I have three generations of union workers in my family, so maybe being liberal IS my tradition....\n
10	Can an ESFJ learn to become more independent?	To ensure that I don't accidentally offend anyone, I am using "I" statements this entire time. So this isn't about all Esfj, but me and anyone else who can relate.\n\nI have trouble essentially being my own person. I have a tendency to focus on getting another person to like me, and molding myself into the "right" person. I have difficulty forming opinions and sticking to them. I also can have difficulty judging the merits of others.\n\nThe times I am the most independent is when, essentially, I am upset or feeling blue. At those points, I feel quite distant from the world around me, and I spend my time secretly judging others and deciding what's wrong with them.\n\nConstantly second guessing myself and feeling stuck making decisions is, quite frankly, exhausting. It also doesn't help that I don't have very reliable people around me to aid in this process.\n\nIs there anything in MBTI theory/our functions we should focus on to become a tad more self-reliant?
7	I'm an ESFJ and have the exact same issue - I rely on others so much for just everyday mundane actions, not just big decisions...\n\nI'm 34 this year and still struggle with it, but in the past 6 months I really feel like I've become stronger. I bought a flat, in an area I was unfamiliar with, and have slowly (I mean really slowly - still going!) started to realise I can do stuff on my own, when I want, and that my own company is lovely and I'm not selfish for it.\n\nAs an example, the area I moved to, I don't know anyone but visited as a child. I had the desire to go to a certain wildlife park and see how it was 20yrs later, as an adult.\nAnd for ages, I thought 'I will ask xyz if they want to come with me' and stuff like 'oh I'll suggest it as something to do when I see friend abc'...\n\nAnd then the revelation hit me, like a ton of bricks. Why don't I just get the bus and go... On my own!?!\n\nHonestly, sounds so stupid, but it genuinely blew my mind realising I could just take myself off, have a wander, do something that *I* wanted, and no one else needed to be involved.\n\nI had that revelation about 3 months ago and I've really blossomed, I know I don't have to rely on having someone with me all the time...\n\nBut don't get me wrong, I'm an ESFJ through and through, so if I can have adventures with a friend I always would prefer that!\n\nYou'll get better at it, I promise x
3	Get an INTP and learn the good from it and teach it your good side!\n\nPd: as an INTP myself don't think that he just doesn't like you. We just struggle to communicate it
3	You can reach your desired outcome of being independent through poor logic as well. Be careful how you get there. I know an ESFJ who reached a measure of independence from the hive so to speak by becoming jaded after being hurt and by assuming everything they did deserved reciprocity and that their self worth and level of love from others was correlated to how much others celebrated this friend of mine. \n\nTo get to the heart, you must first go through the head. You cannot feel for the things you don’t know. Spend sometime fleshing out a worldview involving an ethic to have something internal to compare to the external. This will help with judging the merit of others. It’s not perfect, but it helps.  
2	Yeah I think you can learn it. I’m one also and I understand everything your saying. Exactly me also. \n\nInteresting you said you can’t keep your own opinions. I’m kinda the opposite where I have strong ones and are very black and white about people if they don’t think the same thing as me. \n\nI absolutely mold myself though to be the right person, mirroring them in anyway I can. \n\nI get told all the time I can’t tell when someone is bad news. I think that has to do with my extreme love of people and wanting acceptance. \n\nWhat age are you? I’m interested. \n\nI’m 23 and have grown a little out of certain things. I’m finally getting closer to the I don’t give a fuck attitude and that helps a lot. \n\nAs an ESFJ the best thing you can do is surround yourself with people who really like you since we take so much self worth from others. And surround yourself with people who will tell you that and not leave you guessing. No closure is our WORST enemy!\n\nAfter sleeping around, luckily I don’t think I’m ugly so I get a self esteem boost from all the people on the apps telling me I’m handsome. Do I think I am? Eh, I don’t know. I never know what I look like to people and what they think of me. We’re really bad at that and always assume the worst. And when people say the best you think they’re lying. Actions speak loudest for us. \n\nThe 2nd guessing will go away with self esteem boost you get from the right people. \n\nOh learn how to fake it till you make it. ESFJs best friend. 
2	I struggle with this too! I am usually placid and agreeable because I want people to like me, and I tend to absorb other people’s energies very easily. This is nice in the short run because it’s sociable and you might have lots of friends, but after awhile you may feel depleted and lack an inner sense of independence. \n\nDeveloping my own voice has been important for creating healthy boundaries between myself and other people. Instead of mindlessly agreeing to everything, I now take careful stock of what is being said before I respond. I might listen to a friend’s opinion, and ask myself: “do I really agree with what is being said? Or am I just inclined to agree because I want approval? If I don’t agree, why don’t I agree?” This mental exercise has been helpful in developing my inner voice, because other people’s opinions are first put through an internal filter before I decide whether to accept or challenge them. 
2	Would you like a buddy? I struggle too and we can totally help each other!
2	I too, was going to ask your age. I think it comes with time. After people disappoint you and let you down, you start to get sick of taking their crap. It kind of happens on its own.
1	Look up to ENTJs and model your life after them. You can't be them, but you can at least see what they do and how they do. Apply what you learn from them. Just don't fall into the trap of mistaking your Fe for Te.
1	Well, to be honest, you just have to let that weakness inside you fade. It's like a crack addict itching for crack. The more you let those feelings go, the weaker they become. Nothing's overnight and the feeling may be strong, but if you want it, nothing's unattainable. You just have to be able to see farther than your eyes can, or just jump and hope you land the way you like.\n\nThink about it.
15	Love you ESFJs	You guys are the most caring, genuine, and loving types I've ever had the pleasure to get to know. Honestly, I have no idea where I'd be without my ESFJ best friend. One depressing text and the next day she's at my place with homemade chocolates!\nAnd fuck that stereotype about not being as smart or intuitive, when she's her best self she can be the most intelligent, and cautious person in the group and so, so hardworking. gods, you guys are so giving and yet so independent I can't help but admire that! Stay the same, the world needs more people like you💜\n-An INFJ\n
11	It’s always nice to hear something nice about yourself. ESFJs go around usually telling others how much they like other people but never hear it themselves, like ever. Make sure to tell your friend it’ll make her life, I’m serious. 
4	I feel like ESFJs are like flowers. If you give them a little TLC they will give back so much more in return. 
4	I follow this sub because you guys are such role models for me. So kind, caring, responsible, understanding and generally got your shit together. Truly admirable people. -INTP
2	Love you too INFJ!
2	So much love ❤️❤️
2	I've experienced both sides of the ESFJ coin, unfortunately. On the one hand, loving, caring, sensitive and sweet. On the other, manipulative, ostracising, condescending, controlling, jealous, and victim playing. I prefer to keep my distance. ~infp
3	What am I?	I've been obsessed with MBTI for quite awhile now. It's been really hard for me to type myself. I believe it's due to my family of STPs and INFPs. I also struggled with depression and anxiety for many years. I finally feel like my true self. I'm either an ENFJ or ESFJ. I've tested as ESFJ ENFJ INFJ ENFP INFP. I currently think I'm an ESFJ with good use of Ne. I posted on a thread intended for typing, but I didn't get any responses. I'll post a link. I know it's a little long :D Thank you!\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/am3vx2/february\_type\_me\_thread/efpbwby](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/am3vx2/february_type_me_thread/efpbwby)
1	I talked to several friends to get their perspective. I’ve decided I’m an ESFJ that uses intuition regularly. 
1	OK, there's a lot to unpack here and I don't think many of those questions are well designed. so I'll just focus on what I think is telltale.\n\n> What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses? I enjoy many types of learning styles. I prefer when a teacher starts at the beginning (like in math, explaining how a theorem was created). My least favorite types of classes are memorization. That is very stressful for me. \n\nMemorization should be a cinch for ESFJs as long as its deliberate. Si- is based on memory, parsing information, remembering obscure, interesting details and facts is one of our strengths, we remember a lot of things, and memorizing things with intent and consciousness is very easy for us. We're known to be information powerhouses only second to ISXJs. Memorizing boring facts is a chore but isn't generally difficult/stressful. What is generally stressful for ESFJs is material that are based on understanding that isn't either self evident or ultimately a practical mode of thought. So things like Physics, Organic Chemistry, lateral thinking, Mathematics tend to be more difficult to learn for ESFJs. But then again, when there is a chain of events linking things together, like you said "learning how a theorem was created." learning becomes a simpler endeavor. Doesn't sound like an ESFJ on this level of analysis. I think your description best describes an \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go? I strategize halfway, get bored with it, and then improvise. \n\nThis sounds very ESFJ, especially if half the time things tend to go bad if you rely on improvisation and there's no one else to help you out. As an ESFJ myself, I get over this sort of thing by forcing myself into a schedule and a plan because we have Ni-Trickster in the seventh Slot. Meaning we are completely blind as gauging a means for ourselves to get from point A to B. We even have a lot of trouble figuring out if point B is something worth  pursuing, If you ever had trouble figuring out what you want or how to get it. That's could be a marker of poor introverted intuition (Ni) meaning that that is a good marker for ESFJ-ness. We are notorious for this. \*By the way, you have to be exceptionally matured for your age or intelligent to use intuition regularly if you are indeed an ESFJ ( time practicing meditation/prayer/self-reflection  in isolation is  generally how ESFJs can develop intuition). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> • Do you need logical consistency in your life? Yes. \n\nObjective logical consistency or your own brand of systematic thinking based on a subjective value metric where you prioritize certain things that others may not immediately rational. Like, in your post you said you are religious, which is good. But, religion is not objectively logical. It makes sense to you, and everyone in the congregation, but to most people it might not, because religion is based on faith and not objective fact. Basically what I'm saying here is that are you logically consistent or are you just .....consistent. If its the latter, that's a point for ESFJ. (Part of maturing for an ESFJ getting over this hurdle.) \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> • If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed? I am happy to be alone for 6-8 hours a day, but a full weekend would be maddening! I would probably become very lethargic.\n\n100% Extroverted.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> • How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate? I’m very curious, hence the researching. I’m curious about how other cultures work and how other groups of people think and feel. I try to figure out the why behind behaviors, and what it means about societies as a whole. I’m also very curious about health and medical information. I think I tend to have one idea that must be executed. However, I research in a frenzied unfocused fashion.\n\nBad extroverted intuition and completely lost unconscious introverted intuition, sounds like ESFJ. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOK here's the easiest test for ESFJ: \n\n  \nWhen you think someone doesn't like you or isn't friendly do you consciously or unconsciously resent them for it? Also, do you care if people like you or not? And most importantly, when someone gives you props or encouragement, does it give you fuel and leave you elated and filled with pleasure and a desire to repeat whatever you did?
6	ESFJ mom, ENFP daughter relationship advice	Hey guys! So I'm an ENFP and recently I had my mom take the test too. turns out she is an ESFJ! \n\nUnfortunately I feel like our relationship is strained. She says she trusts me but she behaves like she doesn't and has therefore been very strict (even controlling) with me for most of my life. I have tried to talk about this whole thing with her but it I can't tell if she just doesn't want to or doesn't even think we HAVE a weird relationship. I think it's the first one because she used to say "I feel like I don't even know you" when I was in trouble as a teenager. But, obviously our mindsets/personality types are different, so I want your perspective before I just assume. \n\nWhat can I do? Do you think she doesn't wanna talk about it, or do you think it's more that she doesn't even notice it? \n\nps-I have gone to therapy but I have only gone in-depth abt our relationship during one session, so I'll likely do that too as soon as I can. But that won't be for another year and half, starting March. What can I do in the meantime? \n\nThank you so much, hope that was readable. 
1	My sister and mother have the same issues. My sister, ENFP, was very rebellious against the tradionalist rules my mom enforced. It led to her leaving and living on her own.\n\nI'll tell you this, know how your mom operates and just give her what she wants. Unless it's severely abusive, I doubt it'll actually end up affecting you. For example, let the fly buzz around your face, what's the harm? \n\nDon't forget, your mom, "thinks" she knows what's best for you. She's a sensor with a present minded way of viewing things and a future-worrying oriented way of foreseeing things. So maybe she just cares in her own illogical way.
1	ESFJ aren't great at NeTi, or understanding new perspectives. They will stick with what they know/experienced. \n\nYou've got to expose her to whatever you are in small doses. You don't want to be controlled, well, don't be. Just do it small doses, not slamming the door at once. Give explanation here and here and let it accumulate.\n\nOf course, whatever you're in therapy for (is it actually important?) will impact that.
5	Hey y'all!	I took a Myers-Briggs personality test today in a class of mine and I'm ESFJ! Y'all seem like really cool people so I thought I'd pop in and say hi.
5	Welcome!  We're not a super busy sub, but we care.  :)
3	Hi, it's friday night so all the other ESFJs are out. i'm tired so i'm home drinking wine with my dog. Welcome! :)
2	Ayyyyyyyyyy!
2	Welcome! I hope you get a lot out of the MBTI! It’s great for self growth (:
5	I’m INTP (literally your exact opposite), and I need help.	ESFJs are supposedly super social (correct me if i’m wrong), something i’ve never even dreamed of being. I dunno if it’s like a commitment issue or what but how do you build up confidence in social situations? I try to be more outgoing but I always end up backing away whenever I get any actual attention. I have friends, though, that’s not the issue, I just can’t talk for shit sometimes.
6	The trick is you have to fake it till you make it. Even if I feel nervous I sure as hell dont show it. I also take a lot of happiness from being the social one in a situation but it definitely depends on the group size. Sometimes if I drink a lot the next day I am super anti social and its like pulling teeth to talk so I understand what you mean for sure. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso other people can tell when your nervous and backing out of conversation and the right people will help you. ESFJs love getting the shy person to take and make them feel really comfortable in the group because I really value the intelligence of most introverts.
1	Definitely fake it till you make it. If you’re feeling super self conscious, just have a few lines prepackaged to shoot out if you’re caught out and so you’re not fumbling for words. \n\nOnce you’ve built up your confidence, you can let your personality seep out. INTPs are hilarious and I’m sure your humour would be appreciated in normal conversation (: If you want to chat, I can give you some pointers! Discord?
1	Well, no, not our exact opposite, only order opposite. Which means we are actually more similar than we are different.  We have all the same functions so we "speak the same language" but our priorities and and interests are extremely different.\n\nOur true opposite would be ENTJ opposite in order as well as type. We "speak totally different languages" and our interests are extremely different.\n\nESFJ-INTP-ENTJ \n\nFe-Ti -Te\n\nSi-Ne-Ni\n\nNe-Si-Se\n\nTi-Fe -Fi\n\nOK, so anyhow. Your issues are likely not because you are INTP but just in case they are, I'll give you a tip: \n\nThis is how an INTP becomes social. You need to develop your auxiliary function, which is Ne. Extroverted intuition. So speed everything up, go get at it. Go Go Go. It is extremely easy for an INTP to become nihilistic and lazy. Go out for walks and hikes, in nature if you can. Gear your thought process externally, get out of your head. Instead of "how does this work" think: "what are WE/THEY/THIS/IT/HE/SHE going to do next?" Exercise.\n\nOK, here's what I think your actual problem is: \n\nYou are Narcissistic and Solipsistic, but not in a bad way, just in a perceptual way. You're too concerned with what is going on in your head and what others perceive you as that you are too scared to make a move in life, so you unconsciously cower away. What you need to be doing is too stop letting what people think of you be as important as what they are saying or doing. Ask yourself: how can I help this person? What can I do to to help this person do what they want. Focus on them. Not you. You  aren't important enough for people to judge you enough for you to fear social situations. Get into the conversation topic and offer up that INTP genius.
0	Lol!! I'm INTP too and have been on the Intp subreddit ALOT lately after I discovered it like a month ago. Just thought to myself.. hmm I wonder if the other subreddits are as active as ours and I wonder if they are all complaining and asking for help on every post like ours. Randomly chose ESFJ (interesting tho if I may have just subconsciously chose the exact opposite of mine) to see for myself. And then I immediately find an INTP asking for help hahah. No offense or anything, do you- just thought it was funny. 
2	More questions for understanding.	Here is a few questions. I have figured out I am probably not esfj but I still don’t understand fe that well.\n\nDo you esfjs usually consider yourselfs pretty emotional?? Sometimes it is seen as you are and sometimes not that much.\n\n\nAlso there is this thing about ESFJ and fe being very linked to empathy. And that you can just feel other people’s feelings. Is this actually true or is it a horrible stereotype?\n\nOne person already have given a response to this question and I don’t mean to not listen but I want more answers. But fe people including ESFJ is known as social chamaeleons. What do you think of this? Is blending in to your background intentional or just more natural and you just do it without knowing? What do you think of the whole social chamaeleon concept do you agree with it?
2	Yeah as a male ESFJ I am emotional for a guy I guess. I definitely feel peoples emotions and will get choked up with them. We can be very matter of fact if need be, and that is probably the non emotions you see. But I think our emotions are practical. Not the kind of people who will emote to just anything. It has to have real meaning. I am very empathetic for sure. You'd need to explain social chameleon more, I dont think I personally blend into the background unless the group size is really large. If its a 3-5 person group I'm the one taking control usually.
2	I am decently chill most of the time, but sometimes I get in moods and then my emotions will control me. Usually as far as empathy goes, I can deeply understand how most people feel naturally, and I will do everything in my power to understand if I do not. I guess the empathy is a natural thing.\nA few years back my mom told me a story about me when I was two. I was at an Easter event and had a bag full of eggs. She said that I looked over and saw a kid with none, and that I gave all of my eggs to the kid. That makes me think that my empathy started at a young age. As far as the chameleon and blending in. I actually greatly struggle fitting in. Mainly because most of the people I naturally gravitate towards are INTP or INFP who have a completely different thinking process. 
2	YES on all those things.  \n\nSocial Chameleon here for sure.  I sense deeply and find it easy to size up a social situation upon entering.  This allows me to cater to the needs of the crowd without any struggles.  I actually quite enjoy it and look forward to meeting new people or going to events where I'm a newbie.  Much to the delight of my husband who is quite the opposite and whose profession requires lots of hobnobbing.  :)
1	I used to not be emotional, but I was being abused at the time so I shut myself off. Once I started working on fighting that abuse, the emotions just came pouring out. And yes, I can literally feel what others feel. That's part of why I cry so easily, if someone is in pain and they're crying, I'm also crying because I put myself in their shoes. The most dramatic time this happened to me, was when a friend of mine was "retiring" from nannying for this family. The kids had just grown up and didn't need a nanny anymore. But she had nannied them since they were babies, she had been with them their entire lives. When she told me she was starting to look for a new job, I literally burst into tears just thinking about how painful it would be leaving the kids. She wasn't even crying about it. 
4	Its official, I love this subreddit.	Okay so I only browse reddit for the news and, I use flipboard for the news besides that I barely touch my phone except to make plans with people and chat a little over text for people I don't see often. But I found this subreddit and its so damn interesting to hear what people think about ESFJs, Im usually too busy hopping from being with one person to another and then sleeping and repeating that I dont have any time to hear what people think about me. Enlighten me, I am down to hear good and bad stuff, it'll only help me grow.
0	🙄
2	I am looking for answers am I one of you? Don’t know.	I am either a really friendlY ESTJ or a ESFJ that doesn’t like to think about her emotions or consider herself emotional or don’t admit it to herself. I don’t know if there is such a thing Or don’t tell people I care about their emotions or don’t admit that to myself that I actually care about them? I find that I care and worry about others. I know everyone, and find that I can be really super friendly.\n\n\nSo I want you to tell me about yourselfs. How your ESFJness works and what differences you have with ESTJs?  
1	Hey if you want to pick my brain a bit feel free to dm me. Sadly I don't know too much about all the differences between the personality types but if you had any specific questions about how I'd process situations or anything specific about personality I'd be willing to answer some questions! Sorry if this doesn't help much but wanted to offer what I can! 
1	Hello again! We talked on my thread a couple days ago (: Will be more than happy to help type you. But ESTJs can be super sociable and friendly too. Do you have discord?
7	I’m an elusive ESFJ AMA 😂	So I can’t believe I’m doing this but apparently ESFJs don’t frequent their own forums. Too busy  being with people I guess.. anyway I’ve had lots of questions about us and how we work and even got a few PMs from just saying I am one. So if you got a question this is the place to share it so everyone can see! \n\nIf there are any other ESFJs out there feel free to answer the questions also I would be interested to hear others take on similar topics to me. 
5	Lol, we all just show up to say Hi, and no one asks any questions 
3	I am too!! Hi!
2	This should be interesting \*grabs popcorn\* except the stars of the show didn't show up...which is right on for ESFJ's as they have more important things to do than hang out on Reddit.\n\nI've lived with an ESFJ boyfriend for awhile now (INFP, here) and they're the most interesting creatures, ever.  I love learning about them.  (He varies from J/P, on occasion...just as I vary J/P on occasion).  Makes for a fun time, though.  I'd go anywhere with him.  He's a blast.
2	He’s an incredibly stable and reliable person. I can count on him to come through whenever I need him. He’s quite selfless when it comes to helping others. He’s practical,most of the time but if he’s really wanted something or wanted to go somewhere he will work hard to make it happen.\n\nOne of the things we disagree on isn’t really a disagreement but seeing things from a very different perspective.  He’s all about the basics. He would consider say, buying Charmin toilet paper totally unnecessary when he could pay 30% less for cheaper toilet paper....because he’d rather spend his money on a concert ticket that costs $85.  To me $85 on something like that is crazy, but having comfy toilet paper is something I would prefer. \n\nHe’s cheap....unless he’s spending on entertaining, fun stuff. I am not quite the opposite, but my take is more conservative on entertainment and more on creature comforts.  Same with groceries. That’s why I buy the groceries. I can’t do baked beans and store brand Mac and cheese three times a week. 😖\n\nI would travel the world with him because he’s probably one of the most curious, adventurous people I have ever known.  He loves his family deeply and is dedicated to making their lives easy if he can. He’s the baby of the family, but he’s their go to person for anything they need help with.  He’s very sensitive to others feelings most of the time unless he’s frustrated or they’re just not listening to him. When he’s angry he’s really angry but then he’s over it. I’ve had to remind him that I’m pretty easy to hurt, emotionally so he’s patient to no end with me most of the time.  He tries very hard to communicate with me in the way I need him to.\n\nHe tries hard at whatever he has committed himself to. I think that’s what I love most about him.  He’s extremely hard on himself. His standards are incredibly high so I guess if he’s with me it’s because I passed the tests he gave.\n\nI love him dearly.\n\n
1	I am too - where are we all hiding?? Hello from California!
1	Hey! I'm an ISFP. I always see you being happy, but how are you when you're sad? How can I tell and how can I help?
1	Yes! My husband's an intj and his feed is always full of intj tidbits and comments.  Meanwhile I am an esfj and very content just reading questions others ask about esfjs and never commenting back. Why is that? I appreciate all the comments made above, because you are all describing me perfectly!
9	ESFJ Inner Wild	We ESFJs tend to be strict and like to abide by the rules, but every now and then a very uncharacteristic wave comes over me and I just want to do something crazy! \n\nWhat’s the craziest thing you rule-following ESFJs have done?
3	Oh man, on my 21st birthday (just a few weeks ago) I got super drunk for the first time to celebrate but then also made the drunk decision to get cross faded. And I did just that and I don’t know why but I felt like getting crazy that night. It was fun though!
7	I wanna see some more posts from ESFJs	I am an ESFJ and feel lonely in here all you other ESFJs love upvoting but not many comments 😂. 
1	Hey 👋🏼👋🏼😂
1	Hello 😘
1	Hi
1	😁 I'd love to learn a lot more about you guys
1	ENTP, I need to talk to more ESFJ's lol. I need to understand them more than I currently do. 
1	I seriously just thought there were no ESFJs on this sub!! This makes me so happy!
1	Me too, you're lovely :(
1	INFP here...  \n\n\njust got interested how empty some Subreddits of sensors will look like.  \ni feel sorry for you guys :/  \nbut you welcome to join ours :D....
11	ESFJs social media users?	Any other ESFJs out there that kinda hate social media and much prefer face to face contact. I personally just don’t see the use for it at all. The only thing I use is reddit and that’s mostly the news section. 
7	I’m the same way, just reddit and Snapchat. Everything else feels like too much of other people’s business taking up my time and not enough of my own.
3	Duuuude. I thought I was alone. People love to put us in the "ESFJ's love gossip therefore they're obsessed with all forms of social media" box, and that couldn't be further from the truth. I got off Facebook in 2010, I was only on Instagram for about a year and a half, ditto Snapchat. I'm only on Reddit (and I'm not friends with anyone from my real life on here) and Pinterest, which I think you could make the argument that neither of those really fall into the "social media" category because they're largely impersonal. People complain to me on a regular basis about how inconvenient it is that I didn't see their post on whatever whatever . . . Ever since I got off Facebook my philosophy had been this, "If they're really my friend, we'll be friends offline." If they really care about you and want you as part of their life, they'll send you cute pictures. They'll tell you the mundane parts of their day. They'll invite to such and such's party. I found it a really easy way to cut out fake people.
2	Always prefer face to face contact, but I also have many friends in almost every state in the US, some of which I consider close friends, so social media is really nice to see a glimpse into their lives, superficial as that may be. 
3	What type is most compatible with ESFJ?	
3	My grandma and two of my best friends are INFP's. My other BFF is ISFP. I would say I'm definitely drawn to a certain type 😊
3	[ "ESFJ's natural partner is the ISFP, or the INFP."](https://www.personalitypage.com/html/ESFJ_rel.html)
2	Isfp :D from what i have read at least
2	I am ENTP (A bit more on the introverted side) and while it's not one of the posterchild relationships, I did last almost 3-years with an ESFJ girl. Don't count us out haha. 
3	Most my friends are INTJs
2	Multiple theories:\n\n1. You want someone who is your opposite via dichotomies (letters) for balance and learning each other's opposite sides for better growth. So, INTP.\n\n2. You want someone who is your functional opposite for the same reasons. So, ENTJ.\n\n3. You want someone who leads with your weakest function or is different from you in all dichotomies aspects except for N/S which can be left alone. So, INTP or ISTP.\n\n4. You want someone who is the "mirror" of you functionally. So, ISFP.\n\nI personally subscribe to the first and third ones, but you do you. I'm an ISTP and I currently have a wonderful ESFJ best friend.
1	I'm an ISFP and I think our type gets on really well with ESFJs. My former childhood friend was an ESFJ and it was great. 
1	I like introverts but they usually aren't that into me. I'm best with other extroverts. 
1	I loved banging my INFP ex gf. Super hot in bed and sweet as hell until it all unraveled and fell apart.
4	How would an ESFJ react if they were dumped?	*(The question implies that you still have feelings for said person)*
11	We get a lot of our self worth from what others think. So it depends how it happens. Saying it’s not you its me is the worst way to dump us. We will blame ourselves. You gotta pin point the actual reason and be honest. 
2	Depends on their attachment style, how the breakup occurred, etc.  Big triggers would be shared social network where the Fe function would focus on how the change in group dynamic will effect all the friendships. 
1	No one likes being dumped. Just do it an let them deal with it with people that care about them. There is nothing you can do to make it painless. Just be direct and final and give them space.
2	Looking for advice to attract an esfj (as an isfp type)?	So from what i have read isfp's match well romanticly with esfj's :). \n\nSource: https://youtu.be/vZCDSX50vT8\n\nI would love to get some insight into attracting and finding an female esfj to date. I have simple questions like:\n\n- what are some good places to meet with you?\n- what are some big don'ts, especially during first contact? \n\nAny tips in general are welcome!:)
1	I am an ESFJ, what’s the ISFP like?
1	I’m an ESFJ, ESFJs usually like to be around people all the time. They often take you wanting freedom as you not wanting to be around them and they’ll decide quickly your not worth it. They can tell easily where your comfort level is with being outgoing and being around people and appreciate when you go go out of it and takes that as a compliment. 
7	Esfj's what's your go to breakup song?	
4	If I really had to pick: Palace by Sam Smith\n\nIt reminds me that real love is never a waste of time, now matter how much it hurts. \n\nI like songs that really mirror my current feelings and circumstance. They each have a line that resonates with my entire being. \n\nA bit overkill but this is all that is currently in my break up playlist:\n\nBaby, You Make me Crazy - Sam Smith\n\nLove You Anymore - Michael Bublé\n\nTruthfully - DNCE\n\nHotel Ceiling - Rixton\n\nOne Day at a Time - Sam Smith\n\nI’ve Told You Now - Sam Smith\n\nStill on Your Mind - Ethan DeRose\n\nImpossible - James Arthur\n\nWithout the Love - Demi Lovato\n\nTears Dry on Their Own - Amy Winehouse\n\nSorry not Sorry - Demi Lovato\n\nI Won’t Cry - Jay Ollero\n\nAll the Stars - Kendrick Lamar ft. SZA\n\nI Like Me Better - Lauv\n\nNearness is to Love - Urban Zakapa\n\nI Will Never Let You Down - Rita Ora\n\nPalace - Sam Smith\n\nWhy Don’t You Love Me - Hot Chelle Rae\n\nIn the Silence - JP Cooper\n\nCan I be Him? - James Arthur\n\nOnly Love Can Hurt Like This - Faith Paloma\n\nHurt Somebody - Noah Kahan\n\nAll We Know - The Chainsmokers\n\nTell Me You Love Me - Galantis and Throttle\n\nLet it Go - James Bay\n
4	Silver Lining by Garfunkel and Oates.
3	Actually have a whole playlist of songs I listened to after my ex broke up with me: [https://open.spotify.com/user/1243496029/playlist/6IDkOD70fpnhQpQ7IetYUr?si=nrrfAU8cQuWIraUbkcle5A](https://open.spotify.com/user/1243496029/playlist/6IDkOD70fpnhQpQ7IetYUr?si=nrrfAU8cQuWIraUbkcle5A)  \n\n\n  \nIf i had to pick one though, it'd be "thank you for being a friend" by Andrew Gold ([https://open.spotify.com/track/5yNUgA66PbcPIJPOU2eBwR?si=IQaAl2yWQ0ChGo\_OxoYyxA](https://open.spotify.com/track/5yNUgA66PbcPIJPOU2eBwR?si=IQaAl2yWQ0ChGo_OxoYyxA))  \nIt has a nice message to me and is a good send off in my mind. To me i viewed it as "Thanks for being a friend, but now it's over"  \n\n\nSimilarly the song "Stole the Show" by Kygo is along the same lines. The lyrics   \n\n\n" [No heroes, villains, one to blame](https://genius.com/Kygo-stole-the-show-lyrics#note-5091727)  \n[While wilted roses fill the stage](https://genius.com/Kygo-stole-the-show-lyrics#note-5091727)  \n[And the thrill, the thrill is gone](https://genius.com/Kygo-stole-the-show-lyrics#note-5091727)  \n[Our debut was a masterpiece](https://genius.com/Kygo-stole-the-show-lyrics#note-5091727)  \n[But in the end, for you and me](https://genius.com/Kygo-stole-the-show-lyrics#note-5091727)  \n[Oh, the show, it can't go on](https://genius.com/Kygo-stole-the-show-lyrics#note-5091727)  \n\n\n\[Chorus: Parson James\]  \n[We used to have it all, but now's our curtain call](https://genius.com/Kygo-stole-the-show-lyrics#note-5079283)  \n[So hold for the applause, oh](https://genius.com/Kygo-stole-the-show-lyrics#note-5079283)  \n[And wave out to the crowd, and take our final bow](https://genius.com/Kygo-stole-the-show-lyrics#note-5079283)  \n['Cause it's our time to go, but at least we stole the show](https://genius.com/Kygo-stole-the-show-lyrics#note-5079283)  \n[Least we stole the show](https://genius.com/Kygo-stole-the-show-lyrics#note-5079283) " (Source: [https://genius.com/Kygo-stole-the-show-lyrics](https://genius.com/Kygo-stole-the-show-lyrics))  \n\n\nreally resonated with me personally because  \n\n\n>"No heroes, villains, one to blame" \n\nTo me stood out as like, it's no ones fault this didn't work out, it's just ending  \n\n\n>"Our debut was a masterpiece  \nbut in the end for you and me  \nOh, the show, it can't go on"\n\nFor me the start of the relationship was kind of amazing. It was my first and a lot of people were happy for me and so it seemed like a big thing. Both me and my gf at the time would post quotes from each other that seemed like cute couple things but as time went on those became less and less, so even though the beginning was great, it's not so great anymore  \n\n\n>"We used to have it all, but now's our curtain call  \nso hold for the applause, oh  \nand wave out to the crowd, and take our final bow  \n'cause it's our time to go, but at least we stole the show"\n\nWe used to be great, but now it's time for this to end. Give one final wave/ bow, but now this is ending, and me and my friends won't be seeing you again. Or at least that's what it meant to me with my situation  \n\n\n"Flowers On The Wall" by Eric Heatherly was another song I listened to a lot after the breakup. It's about a guy who's depressed about the breakup but is trying to come off like he's not.   \n\n\nSorry this comment was super long wasn't sure if you were asking for advice on songs to listen to after a breakup or just curious in general\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;

1	Is it faux pas to comment a week and a half late? How does this whole commenting business work? I was excited to find this subreddit then disappointed when I saw it wasn't very active then realized I had no reason to feel disappointed when all I ever do is lurk and only get on reddit every couple weeks!\n\nHere's my list, I got a little carried away!

4	Struggles with ESFJ mom	I am here looking for advice on how to deal with my super curious mom. We have very different levels of what we're willing to share and she makes an awful lot of questions. She just asks about everything and then sometimes I have to lie, a thing I don't want to do.\n\nThings got more complicated lately as I got in a homosexual relationship with another girl, a thing I'm sure my parents would be against if they found out. She already suspects and she would probably want to say "I knew it", but not want it to be true at the same time. I asked my mom to give me space and not find it necessary to know every detail of my life, but even though she said I can do whatever I want, I still sensed resentment in the way she talked.\n\nI want to have a healthy relationship with her, where we have a more understanding communication.
3	I dug around your profile a bit to see if I could find your type... I'm sorry... but I saw that you're istp.  I'm isfp with an esfj mom and hooooo boy, do I feel your relationship conundrum.  Everyone's relationship is different regardless but first and foremost you're going to have to set some boundaries for yourself and you're going to have to enforce them.  I think you might also have to decide what's worth more to you-- a more open relationship with your mom, with the knowledge that your sharing might not lead to a deeper understanding on her part, or a closer watch on your own heart and mind.  And if you're feeling that for all her curiosity, she doesn't really know you, well, it might just be something you need to make peace with and appreciate the easy connections and know she loves you, regardless.  
2	Hmmm...have you tried initiating the conversation so you can choose the topic and steer it in the way you want?  I think she's looking for ways to connect with you and learn about who you are and how to best support you (very wild guess, sorry).  So if you reach out to her about safe topics, you can help her feel connected but in a way that doesn't feel prying?  Talk about work, or school, hobbies and friendships, but be in control?  Does that make sense?
8	How to Get Along With ESFJ Mom?	Hey so I'm a 19yo Male who happens to be an INTJ. I have always been very introverted and spend lots of time in my own thoughts. My mom is an ESFJ who is constantly wanting to have conversations and share her opinions even though I prefer not to talk unless necessary. Of course I am open to having meaningful conversations but only if my mind isn't on something else that I'm trying to solve.\n\n As you can see our personalities clash and we tend to not get along when I'm at home. I'll be living at home until I graduate College and I would love some tips on how to get along with an ESFJ and make sure she understands my needs. Thanks!
1	My best advice would be to just be honest. When you aren't open to having conversations just say, "I'm not really in the mood for a big conversation right now." She might be a little bummed but honesty is the best policy. I'm not really sure I can think of any "tips" 
1	I’m an istp. I’ll get along with your mom. :)
11	What do you think about us INTPs since we are basically opposite of you?	
8	I wouldn’t say INTPs are the opposites of ESFJs. After all, we do share all the same cognitive functions but in reverse. I have commented on INTPs before but I’ll say it again. \n\nPersonally, I find INTPs fascinating. The way your Ti works is mesmerising to me. I like to listen to the way INTPs constantly question ideas to fully understand concepts and trace them back to their individual axioms. This is something I really struggle with and I have posted in your sub to help develop my own Ti. I was expecting to be completely ousted from the sub but apart from a couple of trolls, they were mostly very inviting and accepting. I have made a couple of INTP friends in this process and found to my pleasant surprise, that we get along very well.\n\nINTPs have a very rich inner world that I think they have trouble expressing. Most INTPs that reached out to me after my thread was active, mostly either communicated to me either solely through memes or responded in essays to comments of a couple sentences. But once they have overcome that communication barrier (by that, I mean subjectively in a conventional way so that an ESFJ understands :D), I find INTPs fascinating to chat to and debate with. I like the way INTPs challenge the way I think and I think such a pairing promotes a lot of growth.\n\nBasically, y’all great.
3	ESFJ here, I'd trade for your left brain. I, unfortunately, need more of that in my life.
2	INTPs and ESFJs speak the same language but have different goals. I'm an ESFJ and my best friend of \~9 years is an INTP, we are really great at helping each other develop our fourth functions. When we look to accomplish a goal, I'm great at mapping, organizing, and maintaining, while he's great at theorizing, developing, and sort of hole-poking. I like his casual ease at using Ti. The best thing about INTPs is that they don't give the slightest sliver of a fuck about "who" you are, and moreso "what" you are. He only cares about truth. I care about authenticity. Which isn't the same thing. 
2	I am an ESFJ, and I seem to be an INTP/INFP magnet. 3 out of my 7 closest friends are INTPs. So here is my thought on them. Personally I really enjoy spending time with them, and learning about how different types of people think. My favorite thing about INTPs is their ideas and thoughts, they are very thought invoking. Their worst trait however is that they cannot realize their own flaws, and that sometimes that have difficulty understanding feelings. 
1	Based on my experience:\n\nThey gave great advice. Interesting insight on the world. I also see that the mature ones attempt polite small talk with me, and I really appreciate that. Some discussions with them were quite delightful\n\nOtherwise communication was exceedingly difficult. I found that they had misinterpreted things I said and vice versa. It's the Fe-dom Ti-dom clash. 
2	Youtuber C.S. Joseph Concludes That Oprah Winfrey Is ESFJ	
2	He doesn't regret it	My bf (INTP) and I (ESFJ) are Christian and I don't think we should have sex before marriage, but my bf has. I asked him if he could go back and change losing his virginity, and if he regretted it.\n\nHe said, "I mean I guess? Yeah?" And it was so careless like he didn't care. Even if it's not a Christian thing, shouldn't he want me to be his only one, so he should regret having sex with someone else? Is he losing interest? What do I do? I'm shaking.\n\nMy friend says he shouldn't regret his past just to show he loves me and I have to accept that he isn't a virgin. But I did! It was a deal breaker but because I love him, I am still dating him! Shouldn't he at least regret not saving himself for me? 
7	Hey, I come from a religion where abstinence/purity is the most important thing we learned about growing up, so I assure you I know what the sacrifice is like and how hurtful it may be that you saved your purity for your partner while they were unable to provide that for you. It's a very touchy topic in my church and I know it can be a very difficult obstacle to overcome, for both parties. However, if he didn't grow up with that same value and intention as you did, I do not think it's fair for you to hold that against him. Heck, even if he did, I still do not think it would be fair. I don't think he should have to regret losing his purity in order to prove his love to you. His love to you is what he gives you now, it's not about what he wishes he could take back from his past.  \nI'm also of the belief that people should not have regrets, but rather learn to accept whatever choices they made in the past, even if they were bad choices. If you want your relationship to work, you need to forgive him. Making him try to regret something he doesn't regret, or just saying those words, will not make the relationship better because that just means you are avoiding taking the responsibility of forgiving him. "Forgiveness is letting go of the hope that the past can be changed." If you love him, you'll forgive him.  \n
8	Why would you want him to regret it? He obviously loves you if he's willing to wait for you to have sex again. I think it's really shitty to expect someone to feel guilty for something in their past that they did before they knew you. It changes nothing. I'm honestly not even sure if this is a troll post or not.
2	A life full of regret is not an abundant life. I understand where you're coming from, I am saving my virginity until after marriage as well. But to expect a man to go through past events in his minds and be regretful isn't helping. It lowers your frequency and hinders you to grow into a loving, high-chakred person.\n\nJesus, for example, had a very high frequency - the highest possible, he was one with god. Guilt is one of the lowest frequencies one could have, along with self hatred and the like. It attracts other negative things that are of the same frequency. So wishing your boyfriend to experience guilt is not a good thing, though I understand the disappointment.
2	Hi intp here, I just wanted to let the esfjs here know that this was also posted in the intp channel as well. It’s saying something when both esfj and intp both agree with each other on the major points. I’m glad the responses match up. 
1	Here's the thing:\n\nYou strongly value sex only after marriage. There's nothing wrong with that, and I don't care what others think.\n\nLet's put it a different way- Let's say your partner was not Christian. Let's say he was an Atheist. Or he becomes an Atheist. Something you are dead against.\n\nWould you be able to stay with him? Would, and I quote, "because I love him" still be enough?\n\nI am asking these because you have EVERY right to have certain values in a relationship. However, other people may not necessarily comply, and I want you to consider whether this- him having no regrets- is a deal breaker or something you can work through and get over?
1	lol, i hope this is not representative of esfjs
1	Hi, you sound like marriage is your biggest dream. Please remember, do not rather hear lies since it's building a castle on the sand. He was honest with you but you are not wrong to feel hurt for receiving a careless reaction. What I want to tell is that you must decide wether or not it's bearable to carry during the lifelong of it. I mean, if after both of you decide to get together, forgiving it and going for it, you throw once in a while he did not save himself for you, that had be mining the relationship since one cannot change past. Maybe he had relationship with someone he thought was the one, maybe not. But if it happened, and he told you, he is being vulnerable to you knowing it's really important to you. He could hide it but he rather keep things transparent. That is the right thing to do. If he lied, you would be entering an illusion and it would hurt way more afterwards, with his discomfort knowing he has done it and it's important to you. If he wants to marry you, that means he finds you are the one. [Edit]  Maybe, try to find counselling from experienced people on church and christian pages on internet too?
1	Not to be a dick, but OP is ESFJ and female. She just wants you to agree with her. If you look at how she poses questions to your answers, she's leading you to agree with her. Inert Ti doing it's thang. Open up your mind young ESFJ. Only then will you find the true answers not your answers. -ESFJ male here.
1	What happened had happened and nothing he says will change it. But he's not going to sugar coat it for you. I'd think INTPs want to tell the truth as it is most of the time. They're not prone to people pleasing...\n\nI've met INTPs that did tell me they wished they could have done things differently but I think they also appreciate that their past allows them to arrive to the present. \n\nI know that it hurts to think he doesn't care as much as you want him to care, but maybe he does and just can't find the right words and actions to make you feel better. Have you spoken to him about it? I think it's alright to tell him how you feel and how you want your feelings to be reciprocated. But it's also important to hear him out too if you're going to have that kind of talk. 
1	Ridiculous. Forced abstinence is dumb. Believe me, you want to make sure that your sexually compatible with another person before you commit the rest of your life to them. It just seems like you want to control him and are very jealous. Also, regret is for the birds. The now is all we have!!
1	This is a prime example of the kinds of misunderstandings that an INTP and an ESFJ in a relationship will have. An INTP is very unlikely to see any value to regret except to foster resolve in order to prevent repeating the action again.\n\nFor example, I'm an INTP and a few years ago I rear-ended a vehicle because I was following too close under icy conditions. Now when I drive I give more space, to the point that when more aggressive drivers are riding with me they comment that I'm letting too many people space to merge into my lane! I don't regret the accident because it made me a safer driver in the long run.\n\nIf I were to try to put myself in your boyfriend's shoes I would probably be at a loss for words when asked a question like you asked him. It's not logical and we value logical consistency in most cases.\n\nThat being said, I was raised in a traditional Christian home and I heard many times to "Save yourself for marriage" and anecdotes from people that told teens how having sex before marriage would spoil the experience of the first time. It's easy to see how those things are to internalize. With a few decades of reflection I've concluded that these methods of discouraging pre-maritial sex are not healthy and, in my opinion, not Biblical either.\n\nIn conclusion, I think your need here is to have your feelings acknowledged by your boyfriend. If that's the case then say something like "I know my feelings are illogical, but I would appreciate if you listened to what I have to say. I'm not asking you to regret previous actions but I'm looking forward to growing our relationship together from a position of understanding."
3	Do ESFJ's not like being helped themselves?	So I'm an E/I-STJ (I've typed as both) and in an on and off relation ship with an ESFJ girl. I know ESFJ's are know for being one of the most helpful personality types, but do they hate being helped themselves?\n\n Let me explain: When we first started our relationship, she was the one always doing things for me. She would make me food almost everyday, frequent sex, good morning texts and everything in between. I wanted to start reciprocating more, but at the same time figured what I was doing was clearly working and I should just keep this up. Maybe she likes the "hard to get" type. We weren't official at the time but it started to feel like it. Fast forward a few months and I started to feel guilty like I was using her so I wanted to tell her what a wonderful woman she was and how happy I was to have her in my life.  Us  XSTJ's aren't exactly know for our warm fuzzy feelings so to say the least, it took a huge effort. I started buying her food as well, started to tell her things I admired about her, and just generally opening up to her. I was doing this for about a month and a half. One day I noticed she was really upset about car trouble she was having, her new job, and her kid. She started taking her anger out on me over a trivial argument and I got a bit mad myself. Eventually my good side within me won and I told her it's ok for her to feel stressed under all of that load. I brought her to my place, let her sleep while I took care of her kid, gave her a massage, bought her food, and took her to work after. It was then the weekend and she said she was a bit tired, and would be busy doing family stuff. Come Monday, I try to give her a kiss and she pulled away. And I was like "what's going on?" and she said she thought she wasn't ready to be in a relationship now. Which came as a shock considering I've recently started being nicer to her. I did a little experiment and decided to not give a shit, banter with her, and only worry about my needs. Lo and behold, she starts flirting back, we kiss, and get back together. Then as soon as I started trying to reciprocate all the stuff she gives, she pulls away again. So after that, I started being less available and being emotionally cold again, she posts all these sad facebook posts and now recently saw her and she is touching, flirting with me again. \n\n\nSo what's the deal here? I would like to know if some ESFJs (notice I said some, not all) suffer from an insecurity and feel the need to be the more helpful one so they can feel "in control" so their partner will never leave? Does it feel uncomfortable when their partner feels the need to match their level of helpfulness at least some of the time? I don't seek to criticize or judge, only to understand. Any insight is much appreciated. 
9	ESFJ here. I love serving, but get uncomfortable when people serve me. It takes real effort to allow people to do things for me. \n\nThe way I get around this faulty wiring is to realize that when I don’t graciously allow others to do things for me, I’m denying them the same joy I get from helping others. That usually leads to an upward spiral of two people being great to each other and a really solid relationship. \n\nEdit: notice my unintentional use of words “allow people to do things for me”, as if I’m still in control, lol
2	Based on my experience, it seems you've hit the nail on the head. 
1	Boyfriend is ESFJ and he doesn't like accepting  help, but he does like positive affirmation and being called sweet names. When reading your post I kind of feel like she's on the extreme end of the spectrum.
1	I am an ESFJ, I am in a relationship with an INTP. I try to be as affectionate as possible and he tries to do the same. A lot of times I think that their happiness is more important than my own and will try extra hard to make them feel appreciated. I sometimes feel like making them bring me happiness is a burden to them and try not to let them. (After all INTPs are not know for supporting emotions) \n\nSo maybe your situation is similar where she thinks that your happiness should be placed above all, and she feels guilty when she feels like a burden. Truthfully you should just talk it out with her. 
1	this is not esfj, this is more of an attachment style thing. is that your kid or hers?
4	Do you prefer comfort or quickness when dealing with menial tasks?	I'm pretty sure this person I know is ESFJ and I've always noted a major difference in the way we approach small problems or chores - I prefer to do it as quickly as possible and the ESFJ really likes to take his time with stuff like that. For example, if I have to do a lot of dishes I'll just get to it asap to get it over with. If he has to do dishes, he's gonna turn on a podcast, lay some towels around, make himself a cup of coffee, do some stretches etc And it's the same thing in any similar situation\n\nFunction wise, I think this is an Si comfort vs Se impatience sort of thing. What do you think?
3	Yeah, that is interesting... I'm ENTP and always want to get things done quickly as well so I'm not sure it's a Si vs Se thing
3	I do prefer doing chores in a way that is fun for me! So comfort all the way
1	My ESFJ boyfriend might put on some music but he's very get-up-and-go with chores for the most part.
1	I think it depends. If I'm stressed, it's a "get this over with". If I'm in a good mood, it's the second :)
1	Lol, I'm an ESFJ, and I say fuck doing chores. I'll put my clothes in a stack, fold them in half, and toss that shit in my drawer. Waste 30 hours doing that? You kidding me?

7	INFP needs advice dating ESFJ	I (INFP) just started dating an ESFJ at the beginning of December and it has been wonderful. For the first in my 14 months of singledom, I've finally met a guy who I could see in the long run. He is thoughtful, sweet, generous, chivalrous, open-minded, funny, and we share similar interests - it's amazing. And although we only had 4 wonderful dates together in a span of 2 weeks (I had to keep the distance between the dates), the dates were full experiences, lasting nearly 40 hours total. The best part about these dates was that we never needed technology to steer conversation, we were always fully present in the moment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I had to go home (to a different continent) for 10 days following our last date. While I was away, we would text often and FaceTime, and he even gave me Christmas gifts which he insisted that I open in front of my family (which made it seem like he wanted his presence in my life known by my family). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe's such a good planner, he would always plan dates ahead of time, and showed his "both feet in" interest following our first date. But it feels that something has changed since I got back (yesterday). Since he's such a good planner and was so keen to see me, I expected that he would want to see me right away! But it hasn't been that way. He seemed quite distracted yesterday when I returned. I sent him a picture of his x-mas gift that I brought back (which is a perishable item) and asked when he wants me to give it to him, and his response was "I'm trying to find some time before I go snowboarding x" which I think is Jan 3 or 5th. He did reach out again to me today, and his messages have been sweet and full of xx, but he still hasn't made any motion to try and see me. My initial reaction is to close up and send very dry responses, because I just don't understand this change in behavior. I really like this guy and I want it to work out, but my now fragile heart is scared of being hurt again. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've read that ESFJs are very loyal, and although we weren't officially together, he told me that I'm the first person (in a year) that he wanted to go on a second date with. He also planted many seeds in my head that he would be sticking it out for the long run. I've also read that ESFJs need a lot of positive affirmation, and perhaps my dry responses are pushing him away? He told me a few times how honest he is, so I'm thinking of messaging him saying, "You've always said how honest you are, and I really respect that. I've noticed you been a bit distant lately, is everything okay?" or something along those lines. I don't want to push him away, but at the same time, I don't want to play games and I need authenticity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR; How should I communicate with an ESFJ if I feel they are going distant? What pushes them away, and what brings them closer? If an ESFJ is super into someone for a few weeks, how likely is that feeling to disappear?
6	Yes dear they need affirmation but there are other factors to consider. Did you say something that might made him upset? Fes dont want to know that you offended them because they dont want unnecessary confrontation. Fes can be honest but most of the time they dont want unwanted confrontation ( in my own experience with fe dominants)\n\nAffirmation is what brings them closer to you and if they see you are paying attention to them, they will be drawn towards you (imo experience). \n\nTry to message him like hi how are you and maybe he might strike up a conversation. Maybe he has other personal priorities? \n\nIf it has been weeks and hes still not responding then dont wait anymore. If he's really honest then he will tell you right away. He is not your responsibility anyways and that is his problem not yours.
2	Yeah I'd be as straight forward as you can. Just asking straight up "hey I feel like we've been growing distant recently. Do you feel the same way?" or something and go from there. See if maybe they're just not interested. Idk, personally I like it when someone is straight forward with how they're feeling
1	Boy oh boy, do I have an answer for you.\n\nI am an INFP,\nMy mother, friend, and ex are ESFJs.\n\n\nDISCLAIMER: ESFJs can be great as friends to rant to, because when you rant to them, they will be angry with you. They don't see the need to understand the other side, so you can feed off each other's anger and vent it all out. Same goes for any other emotion, I guess. As an INFP myself, it is nice to have someone support my side and encourage me to be selfish every now and then and just let my anger roar. \n\nMy advice from personal experience: ESFJs question everything as "you must not love me anymore". They do not have the intuition to understand that love comes in many different ways, so it is hard for them to appreciate love shown in ways they aren't "programmed" to receive. It is hard for INFPs, because we have our own moral code that we uphold, and we take huge offense to someone believing we are less than moral.\n\nFrom a girl's perspective of another ESFJ girl: Maybe through my friend's patterns, you can understand your guy a little better? To be honest, an ESFJ's thought process and insecurities can give me a headache. I love my friend, but when I hear her love problems, I can't really understand, despite being quite empathetic most of the time. She will freak out about things as small as not receiving a reply from her boyfriend for a few hours while he is at work, and will automatically think he must have met someone new. I usually calm her down and very firmly tell her: "Either you trust him and stay with him, or you believe he's a horrible person and you dump him. It's not that hard." For me, it's kind of a no-brainer. If you are so scared of him cheating, then he's either a serial cheater that you should dump, or you have to learn to trust he isn't. Instead of taking my advice of dumping him or changing her perspective, she usually starts putting him through tests, because she allegedly loves him and doesn't want to lose him. "Let's see if he texts first," is her go-to test. To this day, I still have not failed in receiving an upset phone call even if he does text first, because he texted too late, or the text isn't apologizing, or sweet enough. Maybe by going on a trip, you didn't give him enough affirmation and love, and now he's in his scared-mode, testing the waters, trying to figure out if you still like him, and if you will apologize for not talking as much as you "should have".\n\nAs an INFP girl who dated an ESFJ guy:\nI had a really hard time coping with trying to please the ESFJ. As an introvert, I was ok with "together time" being working on things or watching movies within the same room. I was ok with playing with our phones whipe eating together, because to me, we didn't need to chat about useless stuff. (Obviously not on a first date. I'm talking about once we got comfortable with each other) But for him, it was me losing interest and he couldn't understand that sending him encouraging notes randomly, booking a trip to Japan together, helping him in finding a new job, and other things were my ways of showing love. \n\nAnother thing that struck me as really odd and trying -- I was going through a really tough time at home because of some family issues. He met my parents around that time, and apparently the fact that my parents didn't like him offended him. (I stuck up for him, I didn't let them bash on him) He didn't even talk to me or tell me that something was wrong when I asked. He just randomly decided one day to stop saying "I love you", and if I told him so, he'd say "Okay." I was already going through a lot, and I was still mustering up the energy and courage to stick up for him AND spend time with him. Turns out he wanted me to APOLOGIZE for the situation, because it made HIM feel awkward! All I needed was for HIM to give me some affirmation, but he was so insecure about my parents not liking him that he decided to "punish me" (his words, not mine). I asked him honestly then where he felt like our relationship was at, and he said "Better than ever" (not sarcastic). For him, he forgave me already, but needed me to apologize before he could tell me that he loves me.\n\nWe obviously didn't work out very well as a couple. But we are fine as friends now. \n\nIf your guy is anything like the guy I dated, I don't think anything is particularly "wrong" persay. He might think you guys are better than ever, except he's waiting for you to apologize for leaving him alone while you were with family for 10 whole days.\n\nIf your guy is like my friend, then maybe he is just putting up his guards, and wants to be sure you like him. Which you can probably prove you do by apologizing for leaving him all by his lonesome for 10 days and not telling him how much you missed him every few seconds. 
1	So... I can speak on this. I'm ESFJ, and I've encountered this many times before with my exes. I feel horrible because I realize now I've wasted their time. Tbh, I think the honeymoon phase is over, and he's more or less over it. He probably just wants to do him, and was trying to live up to what your expectations were-maybe his too. Now, he's probably exhausted because he put a lot of effort in, and he wants to call it quits. He did this because he thought he was doing it for you/to get you to like him. He probably thinks that he has to keep doing this stuff to make you like him. He's young, and trying to figure himself out. He also probably feels bad because you liked that version of him, but he knows he can't keep it up. He needs to learn to like himself. I guarantee this guy loathes himself.\n\nI don't mean to be a jerk by divulging this information, but I know it'll help. You can test this if you want. Give him an ultimatum, he'll feel bad and give you effort. Then, it'll die out. You'll notice a trend too. It'll be 2 months perfect, then slowly dies off. You do another ultimatum, it'll be 1 month perfect and dies off. And eventually, it'll just be hell. It'll be a push and pull/pulling of teeth. Pure emotional rollercoaster you definitely don't want to be in. It's up to you though. We all make decisions; some of us have to learn from them the hard way.
1	INFJ male needs Advise from ESFJ female [bedroom advise]	Hi guys I’m an INFJ male, my wife is an ESFJ, we have a quite strong relationship and love each other very much.\n\nIt’s hard for her at the moment as she suffers CFS and PTSD so I’m picking up most of the slack and working full time and I’m ok with it, but it do see it makes her feel guilty at times but I think she copes the best way she can.\n\nThe question I have is i suck with expressing myself in the bedroom, she says I’m hopeless telling stories to turn her on (that I always use a similar one) she says she likes hardcore male in control type fantasies, but not very clear.\n\nI would love to ask the ESFJ community what turns you on and can you offer me any advise on what I need to be learning/researching to make my beautiful wife feel more relaxed than make things uncomfortable, as I care about her enjoyment so much.
1	Not an ESFJ but tell her a story about how you would overpower her and do what you wanted with her. Cherry on top would be that you wanted to pleasure her "against her will" before doing anything for yourself. It sounds like she might be into some level of domination, which is not uncommon. 
1	She doesn't sound esfj at all. Are you sure? They are usually traditional. 
1	Read the book "Sex God Method"\n\nIt's no longer in production but there is a PDF on scribd.
9	Anyone actually a shy/quiet type?	I think the stereotype is that ESFJs are loud mouths who blabber to anyone in sight. \n\nHowever, I'm pretty shy most of the time, especially around strangers. I get terrified at the thought of accidentally bothering someone. Just that I believe I'm an extrovert as I get "recharged" by positive interactions with people rather than by being by myself.
5	Yeah, I'm definitely a reserved person when I'm first meeting people. Warm, but slow to talk. It seems like I have a need to figure that person out before I put myself out there. I have a tendency to want to know how to present myself -- not in the sense that I'm being fake, but I'm wanting to know how (style of speaking, level of energy, subject matter, sense of humor, etc) I should engage them.\n\nOnce I'm completely comfortable, that's when I start to look a little more like the ESFJ stereotype
4	I’m mostly the same. In fact, I’m outright awkward if I’m in an unfamiliar situation with people I don’t know. I do enjoy being around people but loud parties and too many people can really drain me unless I actually know and like everyone there. I prefer small, intimate settings where I can really talk to people. I have been told that I am good at listening and talking (I do sometimes hog the conversation, purely because my Ne goes at a million miles an hour if you get it going) but that only comes out when I feel comfortable.\n\nI thought I was an introvert for the longest time until I realised that being on my own for too long makes me sad. I need people!
4	I'm not shy/quiet, but I'm definitely more reserved and consider myself a listener more than a talker. 
1	Yes and No. I can put on a facade, but I truly want most people to fuck off most of the time. 
18	ESFJ and INTP couple	
5	How do I manage ESFJ subtle silent treatment?	Living with esfj male for yrs, as entp female.  
8	My ESFJ does this as a defense mechanism when he doesn't want to acknowledge how hurt he is about something. If it's me who hurt him he will be cold to me but normal around everyone else. If I ask what is wrong he might say nothing is wrong. It's only happened a couple of times but basically what I did was I forced the conversation by repeatedly saying "I know something is wrong so please talk to me." At this point I notice he might lash out and say hurtful things, but usually they don't make sense and I don't get offended. After a bit of back and forth he was able to express what was wrong and things got better. He always apologizes way too much for acting childish but it shows he understands it's unacceptable. In my case it almost seemed like he didn't 100% know why he was upset but just that he was, so that's why it was so hard to get him to talk about it. He was probably just very stressed about everything and it all built up. ESFJs aren't used to focusing on their own feelings, and just like us they try to avoid them.

4	ESFJs! Do you think Ralph from Wreck-it Ralph is an ESFJ? (probably Spoiler alert)	So, I've watched Wreck-it Ralph 2 or Ralph breaks the internet if you want to call it that, aaaand I think he is an ESFJ, based on his actions and behaviour and desires in both movies, in the first movie he seeks to change his life because he felt like he wasn't loved, he went to try and get a medal and you know how the rest goes, and in the second movie the plot gets kickstarted when Ralph builds a new track for Vanellope since she wants something new and he wants her to be happy, but when Vanellope fights for control with the player they have to go to the internet to save Sugar Rush  aaaand I would go on with the movie's whole plot, but I feel like it could be resumed, everything Ralph does in the movie is for Vanellope's  sake, and one of the reasons Ralph doesn't like Vanellope going to Slaughter Race is that he feels is not appropriate for her because it's too violent, too scary, etc, despite Vanellope loving the game, long story short he's clingy  and overprotective and learns not to be that, letting Vanellope grow up and pursue her dreams, I feel like his Si was very strong with his desire to leave things as they were... and, what do YOU  think about Ralph? do you think he's an ESFJ? why? 
1	I disagree but I think you're very close! I think Ralph is INFP. I don't disagree with anything you said about him, but I disagree that those things imply Fe. Ralph, in the first movie, is trying to define his role and, to a greater extent, his identity. He isn't satisfied by what he was born into and feels conflicted about his internal belief in right vs wrong. The movie is about him accepting that his role is one of good and that he isn't limited by his title. I haven't seen the second movie yet, but from your description and from what I've heard, it seems to be Ralph coming into another conflict of right and wrong. On the one side, he believes children her age shouldn't be exposed to violence of a certain degree. But on the other, he recognizes why this makes her feel good and why it's important to her, and believes that she should have what she wants. And I imagine the ending is about him accepting that the second one is more important than the first. Am I right?\n\nFe tends to be quite relativistic, in that it assesses right and wrong based on the contents of the situation at hand, rather than by forming universal rules that it tries to apply in every situation. I think if Ralph was an Fe user, then the conflict of the movie would never have taken place. He'd have seen plainly that Vanellope was competent and that the game was making her happy, and simply accepted this.\n\nWhat do you think?
2	Ever wonder if you are actually sentient?	 I do this often. Kind of a habit of mine. Lol dishes. 
5	Thought I would check out this subreddit. A tumbleweed just crossed my path
2	If you do you're sure as hell not an ESFJ, sounds like INTP to me 
1	If you have to ask, you don't know.
3	Gift giving ESFJ's	ENTP here...\nGal I dated then realized she's a hot mess.\nRegardless as friends she keeps bringing me gifts.... What will make it stop????
2	Tried that and she was devastated
2	She sounds immature/desperate. Don’t think this has to do with her MBTI.
2	Tell her it makes you feel uncomfortable
2	Dude I am ENTP and dated an ESFJ.\nGift giving might be her love language. Not sure if she has feelings for you still or not but that's what it sounds like to me. 
1	Reconnected end of April.. She's been to my place 25 times since.. 20 of them she brought something.. A candle, wine, good and other presents \nIt creates a feeling of "owing" in some people.
1	Honesty.
2	ESFJ enneagram 4	Is anyone here an ESFJ enneagram 4 or know of one and would to share their experiences living as one or dealing with one? I did a bit of research on the enneagram 4 and it seems that INTJ and INTP would most likely fall under this category. It’s strange, but I’ve had friends that initially typed me as an INTJ when I am actually an ESFJ. Because of this, I wonder if it has to do with my enneagram.
3	Hi there! (: I’m an ESFJ and I’ve been typed as a 2w3 but as of five days ago, I wonder if I am actually a disintegrated 4! \n\nI was very in tune with my identity when I was younger but since starting my adult life on the wrong foot, I’ve become a bit of a people pleaser. I’ve never been someone to change who I am just to be liked. Although I do enjoy getting on with everyone. \n\nI identify with some of the tortured romanticism that goes on in the unhealthy aspects of 4s but I’m still trying to better understand it myself. What are your thoughts/experiences?
1	Hello!\n\nGrowing up, I felt socially awkward and different from all the other kids. I was envious that other kids seemed to be so at ease with their lives and everyone else and a part me wanted that for myself. The people pleasing aspect of myself came into play when I wanted to befriend these kids that I was so envious of. Ofc, through trial/error and simply growing up, I found purpose through work and school. What saved me wasn’t a “who”, but the realization that I had a purpose in this world.\n\nI found my confidence and happiness through meeting new people and experiences. Working in a restaurant and being on a team; a team of coworkers, sports or even classmates, made me realize that wasn’t so different from everyone else. \n\nFast forward to the future, I’ve left the restaurant industry, but I’m still continuing to work with people in the hospital while going to school full time to be a nurse! I guess I started life on the wrong foot until I realized that my one wrong foot wasn’t alone. It’s silly, but I was born with two feet and I’ve learned to stand on my own through the good and bad days! 
2	I (ENFP) need help with my ESFJ sister, i was hoping you guys could provide some clarity.	I love my ESFJ sister, even though we’re super different. She’s my best friend. \n\nWe’ve have long, long term issues in our relationship that cause me a lot of distress and I was hoping you guys could shed some light on what’s going on with her and how I can help make our relationship smoother. \n\nSo basically like, my sister is awesome at small talk, organizing, planning etc....When she gets stressed out or worried she lashes out at me badly. She’ll criticize everything I do in a social situation really obnoxiously, call me autistic/stupid/inept. She’ll try to control everything-then yell at me for not helping enough but I can’t read her mind! \n\nIt seems like when she needs help the most, she becomes the most hostile! \n\nMaybe it’s my auxiliary FI but even if I intellectually know that she doesn’t mean what she says, it does a number on my self esteem. Part of me will always take what she says to heart. It’s not fair that she makes me cry before a party or a holiday because she insisted on driving and then got lost. \n\nThis is the most problematic dynamic in our relationship, which is for the most part incredible! My mom is an ESFJ and also lashes out at me like this. I guess what I’m curious about from you guys is: \n\n- is lashing out at people close to you a common  ESFJ trait when under stress? \n\n-Maybe providing some insight into why this happens (for you) might help me understand where she’s coming from. I’d like a little more understanding of what’s going through \n\n-Any advice on how to communicate with her that: \n\nim willing to help and hear advice from her, she’s way better at this polite company stuff than me. \n\nIts 100% unacceptable to call me inept, a waste of space or a child either during or right before social events. It damages my self esteem, it’s not deserved at all and it’s something that will bother me for days to come. \n\nThank you guys so much for taking the time to read! Im just hoping to get inside her head a bit so I can see where she’s coming from! 
4	Hello! \nI’m an ESFJ and when you mentioned  that your sister lashes out at you under stress... I totally get that and am guilty of it myself! Maybe it’s the fact that Ti is the least used and weakest function, but whenever I’m placed in a highly stressful situation, I automatically assume the worst of everything. As a result, I become highly critical and whatever comes out my mouth has no filter. As you mentioned, your sister lashes out after trying to take the wheel and getting lost. Honestly, it seems like your sister does it with good intentions as you’ve said, but when it doesn’t turn out the way she thought it would, she becomes frustrated at herself, NOT you. You just happened to be the wrong person with her at the wrong time. \n\nThe best way to handle these situations would be to let her vent her steam, she’s probably nervous and ready to break down at this point. Pull off to the side of the road actually. At this point, ASSURE her that she’s got this and 1)help her collect her thoughts and find the right route or 2) offer to drive, but don’t come off as if you’ve been right the whole time. The point is to help her understand and process the situation, not show how incompetent she is.\n\nAfter you guys have made it safely to your destination and before entering the party, take a moment to talk to her and let her know that you’ve been hurt by her words. Let her know although you appreciate her efforts in planning, organizing and driving, that doesn’t make it alright to be lashing out at you. And finally, let your sister talk it out with you. ESFJs seem to gather their thoughts better by communicating their stressors, needs, etc. We’re a people person and the best to tackle our problems is to talk it out! \nHope this helps!!!
1	Yes! Suggesting realistic and practical solutions alleviates a lot our stress because that shows you care plus it’s one less burden we have to handle! ESFJs are known to have pretty strong emotional intelligence due to Fe being our primary function, so you probably don’t have to address her feelings as I’m sure she’s aware of them.  Just be make sure to be consistent with any advice/solution you offer because we do notice when people switch up on their words! \n\nOn a side note, I believe that words of affirmation and quality time are ranked as our number one way of receiving/showing affection so assurance along with spending time with people in our lives is a really big deal to us!
1	Hey there! Im so happy you posted this. Im INFP and my sister is ESFJ and I came to this subreddit for the same reason you posted this. My sister tends to be extremely judgmental and lash out at me in front of other people. It has caused a serious strain on our relationship. She embarrasses me and since I’m so incredibly sensitive it cuts me to the core. I don’t have any advice, just here for moral support I guess lol

1	Based on this, look up the ENFJ too. They're both similar.
4	Dating an ESFJ and loyalty	I'm currently dating an ESFJ, and I have a point of anxiety I'm dealing with.\n\nI understand that ESFJs value loyalty, but also that they love to get to know new people. A sort of social butterfly?\n\nI, being an INTJ, have no interest in meeting new people unless I hold some sort of prior interest in them. Romantically or via shared interests. I only go out partying when I'm looking for new romance or people to share a hobby.\n\nI'm wondering how likely is it that while going out and meeting new people, a female ESFJ might find themselves falling for someone other than their current SO. What is the motivation for an ESFJ to seek out new people?
7	Myer Briggs aside I think first off if you’re in a relationship you have to trust the other person! Also if you feel this way you should talk w your ESFJ bc we’re very understanding and you’re in a relationship! Does she tell you she’s going out? Does she call or text you after she’s hanging out w friends? Does she tell you about her night? I’m an ESFJ dating an introvert. I’ve explained to my bf that I get excitement from going out and meeting new people, it makes us feel good and that’s how we get our energy! the new ppl I go out to meet are other girls. For ex if I go out w gfs it’s bc I’m Social, I need girl time! I’m w my gfs meeting their gfs, I don’t go out on a mission to met other guys. I let my bf know what I’m doing and I’ll text him occasionally through the night (again I’m there w my gfs so don’t want to be in my phone the whole time) and when the night is over I’ll text or call him! I think if you’re feeling this way you should try and communicate your feelings. Is this a new relationship? Have you guys had trust issues? I’m just throwing all these out there bc a relationship to me is more than just someone’s MB :) 
5	Lifelong ESFJ here! It sounds like you’re feeling insecure about your relationship. Yes, we are social butterflies. We are easy to get along with because we show genuine interest in people. We love meeting people, deeply and superficially. I am relatively physically attractive and get hit on somewhat regularly. My personality can make men feel comfortable approaching me (men have this weird thing where they think if a woman is friendly or smiles at them, they’re interested) and because I love people I may not push them away immediately... but I am a very loyal person! I would not do anything I wouldn’t want my partner doing! I don’t flirt, I don’t go seeking romantic attention, I certainly don’t cheat... but my partners can get a little insecure because I can be seen as charming to men. When I ask them to stop and consider the type of woman I am, they know the truth is I would never run off with someone. In fact, if someone started to get too friendly, I would shut it down immediately.\n\nAll this to say, I understand your concern. It’s valid in any relationship, perhaps particularly with ESFJ. This is a struggle you might have to contend with in yourself. \n\nUltimately, if she’s a good woman and happy with you, no one can take her away. If she’s not, she can easily find someone else... but you didn’t need her anyway! Don’t worry too much and focus on your own value! You’re worth being loyal to!

2	I totally understand! If you flip it around it’s hard for us extroverts to understand why you introverts don’t want to go out and meet other ppl 🤣🙈. \n
2	But in all seriousness if you read about us in relationships and our loyalty we take our commitments very seriously and want to have a life long partner :) \n\nhttp://www.personalitypage.com/html/ESFJ_rel.html\n\nI love my bf and I would never do anything to jeopardize our relationship. I love spending time with him! He doesn’t need to go out and meet other ppl. He’s quite content with being at home, keeping w his hobbies or going out for drinks with ONE of his friends. I am too, to some extent but if I didn’t have that time to go out w my gfs and meet other girls (bars, girls night outs) I would be unhappy and depressed.  Not bc I don’t love him it’s bc I’m a social person and I need to get out make friends,talk to ppl! whereas social settings make him uncomfortable and he doesnt enjoy them! I think just keeping in mind you both need a balance esp her! You get your quality time together and she needs her space to go out w her gfs meet other girls and brag about you! :)

1	I recognize I might not get an honest answer, but the loyalty that is so strong when an ESFJ is out with friends without there partner, what if everyone is drinking? Science has proven the restraint part of the brain becomes inhibited. I guess i can see being ok with non-drinking centered activities but if it's a party i would have a lot more difficulty being so understanding
1	ESFJ are interested in new people and excitement in the same sense as a high. She will naturally spread out to interact with many people. 
3	ESFJ compatibility with ESFP?	esfp girl crushing on an esfj boy.  \n\nis it a good pairing?? \n\ndo you have any personal experience, or any valuable insight? anything and everything will be appreciated
5	As friends I find it frustrating, annoying and so different. But then a relationship might be different. As an ESFJ, I find ESFP too fluffy, not having a plan or being organised, just do whatever their heart tells them at any point without any kind of logic. They get hurt because they want to be loved even worse than ESFJs. Yeah, maybe it's just because I'm over the stories of my friend but again as I said, a relationship may be different.
4	CS Joseph on YouTube thinks it's either the single best or second best pairing out there. Look up his compatibility series if you want to know more.
2	It's called "quasi-identical" relationship by socionics. It's one of the easiest relationships to start and can be attractive and inspire crushes, but over time it turns annoying. The more you talk, the more a certain sense of irritation arises, yet it is also very easy to talk and you'll often have some common interests: [**MBTI type matches for ESFJs**](https://www.personalitycafe.com/esfj-articles/286-love-types-esfj-5.html#post2410804)
1	It's terrible. 
3	A sub for relationship advice specific to MBTI!	
3	How do you all feel about ENFP’s? Secondary Q: how do you do with long distance relationships?	I am in a weird relationship with an esfj guy. I am crazy about him and I know he likes me too. But it’s a ldr and we really only have texting for communication which doesn’t lend itself well for conveying tone. We get to see each other once a month-ish. It’s always intense but I wonder how much of that is my natural tendency to be intense and the time between seeing each other. He has said “I want to continue to see you as long as you will let me.”  Are you guys really this committed?
4	We are totally committed. I (ESFJ/f) had a long distance relationship with an ENFP (m) for 2 years and it was hard at times but it's important that you trust us, don't be too clingy but shows us that you do care and want us. It helped me to see that my partner really wanted to be with me no matter what and was happy to understand who I am. Don't treat us mean because that doesn't keep us keen but show us the possibility we have with you in the future, that you are committed and want to be closer together at some point. 
3	Are ESFJ particularly anxious?	Hello lovely people!\n\nENFP here. The three ESFJ I know are all in their teens or early 20s and they struggle a lot with anxiety.\n\nI know a lot of types struggle with anxiety (I myself have all the major symptoms and it’s very frustrating) but ESFJs seem to have a particular kind of loop, somehow their anxiety is different from mine and they struggle much more to find good coping mechanisms. \n\nI was wondering if this is an ESFJ thing, and if it is, what is your experience? Was there something that made you click and made your anxiety better? What are some good resources I can recommend to the people I love?\n\nThanks in advance!
8	I was 21 when I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. I went to counseling, which did help some, and I learned a mechanism to help me organize my priorities (and subsequently my anxiety and self worth). But honestly the life changer was medication. I take a low dose anxiety/depression pill, and looking back I truly don't know how I functioned before then.\n\nYears later, after graduating from nursing school, getting engaged and married, and moving multiple times, I tried to quit the meds, thinking that after growing up and having less stressors in my life I'd be ok without them. Unfortunately I reverted to having the crippling anxiety I'd had before the meds. I decided to go back on them because that kind of life is no kind of life- even if I have to be on meds to live THIS life. 
3	Look into the enneagram. This may have more to do with what enneagram type your friends are. I think gender also plays a huge role as well. My husband is an ESFJ, and he doesn’t have any mental health issues at all, which is weird! He is also in his 30s so I bet that helps too. But hopefully looking into the enneagram can help you and your loved ones! Best of luck 
2	I'm shy and anxious. Best thing to do is throw yourself out there and fight the wolves. Better to be brave even when you dont want to then to die a coward. - Male ESFJ aka pussy asss bitch lmao.
1	I don't have anxiety, ESFJ mid twenties female. I struggled with being shy when I was young or low confidence but not anxiety. 
6	is an ESFJ compatible with an ISFj?	well what the title says but i wanna learn the flaws\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(i did something wrong in my old post srry so i deleted it and made a new one)
6	I'm an ISFJ, been with an ESFJ for 2 years now.\n\nI'm extremely happy with him, I think we're super compatible. He's very emotionally healthy, so other people may have different experiences depending on their partner.\n\n\nHes very good at communicating, and he pulls me out of my shell a lot. \nI'm not naturally verbally expressive, but he is, so it helped me to develop that more in myself. Any conflict is settled with a short, polite conversation, he's extremely kind and considerate of my feelings. He's a super easygoing person, and it's rare for him to get upset over anything.\n\n\nHe's super affectionate and caring, he's always trying to take care of me, and making sure I'm fed, warm, comfortable and generally content. \nIt's a nice change for me, as I'm usually trying to take care of everyone else and sometimes put myself on the back burner. \n\n\nI love seeing him in group settings, he brings out the best in people and everyone seems to love him. He's introduced me to a lot of people, and while he still respects my need for quiet time to be an introvert by myself, he's also been really good at pushing me out of my comfort zone just a little bit, and I always have a ton of fun tagging along with him for social events.\n\n\nHe's incredibly encouraging and supportive of me, whatever the circumstances. He's been here for me through some rough life changes, health problems, anxiety, unemployment, etc. He's been an unwavering support system whenever I've needed him, and we make a really good team. \n\n\nI honestly can't think of any real problems we have, apart from the fact that neither of us likes to be in charge of making decisions.\nChoosing where to eat, what movie to watch, what activity to do that day, etc. \nWe have to force each other to take turns choosing, because I think we both tend to be more submissive in that area of our lives, and prefer someone else to make the decision.\n\n\nOtherwise, it's awesome. It's the best relationship I've ever had, and I wouldn't change anything about him.\nI love how kind he is, he makes me laugh like crazy, and I feel like we understand each other. \nWe're super compatible, and our whole relationship has been very easy.
4	Married an ESFJ. She tends to overbook a lot of what I would like to be downtime but is starting to understand this now. They bottle up thoughts just as much as we do. Don’t let that happen. Makes for a better relationship. I’ll come back to this. Gotta run.
2	ESFJ Cognitive functions and four sides of the mind EXPLAINED	
2	Ah, good ole CSJ, i found his videos to be a bit meaty, but his recent typing videos are pretty dope.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nfairly thorough analysis of Fe, i wish he could be a bit more concise, but nonetheless, dope vid.
3	Hello !	I've seen a few folks talk about music here and I have seen this as a common topic across many MBTI subreddits. So I made a subreddit -> https://www.reddit.com/r/MBTIRadioStation/ <- to see if others are interested in having more conversations on these two topics.\n\nI envy you ESFJs. You are talented in ways I can't even dream of being. Take [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HnLRrQ3RS4) guy for example. \n\nSure there are terrible examples ... but also awesome ones. Here's few of my favorites\n\n1. [Blue - One love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFGPSx6cPN0)\n2. [Hoobastank - The Reason](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV4DiAyExN0)\n3. [Justin Timberlake - Rock Your Body](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSVHoHyErBQ)\n4. [Dua Lipa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2qgadSvNyU)\n\nWhat can I say Hot ! Hot !\n\nI think each type is instinctively drawn to listen to its own type's music but I could be wrong. Feel free to post tunes here -> https://www.reddit.com/r/MBTIRadioStation/ <- 
9	INTJ's and ESFJ's are the Most Common Marriage Pairing (Apparently.)	I am a big MBTI nerd (INTJ, what can you expect?) and apparently we are incredibly compatible with all of you ESFJs. My source comes from [CS Jospeh and his series on social compatibility](https://youtu.be/DLPQOoASnec).  \n\n\nThing is, where do ESFJs go for fun? INTJs don't really go out and I've been trying to match with an ESFJ via online dating... it's not going well. :/  \n\n\n&#x200B;
15	Hmm I disagree. I think ESFJs are the worst match for INTJs. INTJs go well with ENFP or ENTP. ESFJs have Fe, which is your polr function in socionics, and will drive you up the wall. INTJ/ESFJ are conflicting relationships in socionics, each knowing how to hurt the other to the max. 
5	This is me and my husband!! We make it work. In a lot of ways we push each other to overcome our weaker areas - he helps me imagine scenarios beyond what I can see (his N vs my S), I remind him to connect with his family (my E vs his I). We explain ourselves and forgive a lot
3	27/M/INTJ been with my 28/F/ESFJ SO for 8years, getting married soon. 
2	I'm not too into Meyers Briggs anymore, but I don't know if I could get along with someone so opposite of me, for life.  My husband is an ISFJ and we drive each other bonkers, but I think that's normal in any relationship.    
1	[deleted]
1	I'm INTJ and my wife is ESFJ. We will be celebrating our 40th Wedding Anniversary this year and I will take as many more anniversaries as I can get.  We work hard at our marriage because we both want to make it work.  All of the previously discussed annoyances have happened and continue to happen in our marriage, but the positives of the relationship are incredible.  There are aspects of our marriage in which there will never be a meeting of the minds - we've be down that "solution" road already and from my point of view there will never be a resolution to my satisfaction but I've moved on because having "us" is worth it.  Maybe a different kind of personality matchup would have been an easier relationship for me, but I wasn't looking for easy; I was looking for someone to bring things to my life that I could not do for myself.  She was exactly who I was looking for and waited for and it's been worth it.
3	MBTI & Music Survey (Redesign) - Need respondents!	 \n\nI created an initial version of this survey a few days ago, but after receiving feedback and reviewing many of the responses, I restructured it to increase accuracy, depth, and easier data analysis. Even if you've already taken the previously posted survey, please take this new one as well.\n\nThis is a survey searching for correlation between MBTI and musical interests such as genres, instruments, singing, dance, and composition/production. Once I get a descent amount of responses, I will post the results in [r/mbti](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti) (unless [r/esfj](https://www.reddit.com/r/estj) would like me to post them here as well). I've created individual surveys for each of the 16 personality types, and the one below is SPECIFICALLY for ESFJs.\n\nThe ESFJ survey link:\n\n[https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JRDPRTN](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JRDPRTN) \n\n​\n\nIf you are not an ESFJ please find the correct link for your type here:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/9a6hbw/mbti\_music\_survey\_redesign\_need\_respondents/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/9a6hbw/mbti_music_survey_redesign_need_respondents/)\n\n​\n\nThanks for your responses! As I said previously, I will post the results and analysis in [r/mbti](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti) once the survey is completed.
5	INTP’s and ESFJ’s	Hello, fellow INTPs, would you say that ESFJs are your rivals. I’m just curious why there are a lot of INTP invaders here.
8	All us INTPs like ESFJs but don’t understand them.  *shrugs
5	I married and ESFJ and it's absolutely exhausting for both of us.\n\nShe whines and nags about me not being emotional enough and I grit my teeth in silence as she goes on yet another emotional tantrum/rant about literally anything and everything.\n\nWe cannot have deep conversations because I come at it from logic, facts and open-mindedness and she comes at it from feelings and a sense of moral high-ground and neither of us literally give a flying f\*\*\* about those things, respectively.\n\nOpposites do attract though.\n\nWe admire our hero and parent functions. I admire that she's so comfortable around people and can make friends with anyone and she admires that I can solve literally anything and can see through obstacles. I admire her hard work ethic and dedication and she admires that I can stay so calm and collected all the time, even in crisis.\n\nIt's a cluster-fuck to say the least and it's extremely difficult to manage but more so lately. But when we're both chilled out and laid-back, being lazy, it's a joy to be together. All in all, possibly the worst match I can imagine for a deep relationship. I'd say ESFJs are fucking amazing friends though.
2	the dating site says I like ESFJ...so I looked it up and it doesn't sound anything like the women I've been dating *shrug*\n\n-INTP
1	Tbh I'd say if anything, your "rivals" are INFPs. Not that I don't like you guys (it's dumb to dislike someone based on type) but I sure don't understand you 
1	I have a close friend who is INTP and he is definitely my rival!!! I joke with him of how he is my mortal enemy and archnemesis, but it is just my endearment to him. But we are definitely rivals!!! It's like we are the same but reversed!!! I am actually ExFJ but I think when it comes to cognitive functions, it explains why we are that way, because our cognitive functions are the same, but reversed (ESFJ and INTP). I think we can never understand each other. I'm not sure with him, but I still appreciate him even though I cannot comprehend him (He is a mystery to me)!
1	Ok, INTP here. How in the world does everyone know everyone else’s personality type. How do people learn such information about other people?
1	I lurk all the subs here and then except for the Gamma quadra. 
1	Hmmm...it would be challenging. Run...\n
1	I'm here because I'm typing people that I know, and I got to my step-dad, who I like to refer to as The Step-Dictator®. He is my sworn enemy and I wanted to know if I would hate all ESFJs or if it's just him.\n
4	What does your favorites/bookmarks bar look like? (I'm INTP)	 Mine; just to name a few:\n\n\-Sir Issac newton vs. Bill Nye (epic rap battles)\n\n\-Are humans OP? (teir Zoo)\n\n\-Books: "what is this thing called science?"\n\nand "an introduction to the philosophy of science"\n\n\-Ifunny(meme app)\n\n\- [Technocrat's Critiques of the Capitalist Economy - Artificial Scarcity and Imperialism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uOOb6Wqlh4)(politics)\n\n\-"the living wake"(free indie movie on on youtube, about existentialism.)\n\n\-Lemongrab "UNACCEPTIABLE" in 18 languages.\n\n\-Crunchyroll: Watch Free Anime & Mange Online\n\n​\n\nYour list doesn't have to as extensive.
3	I don't use bookmarks at all. I just type in the website and it autocompletes. I feel like that's faster than using the bookmarks anyway
2	Mine mainly consist of:\n\nold movies and anime I plan to watch\n\nbooks I plan to read\n\nobscure online stores that I could never remember the names of\n\nand various MBTI/Enneagram related websites
1	Mine are full of folders so I can organize the sites I want to save. I am between my laptop and my phone so it helps!
4	ESFJs and friends, could you please take my MBTI Romantic Relationship Survey?	[https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/2QSNJPP](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/2QSNJPP)\n\nI don't have any ESFJ samples :(\n\nIf you know your and your current or ex partner's mbti, please fill out as many times as you've had partners!\n\nIt's simple and I would love to expand on it in the future but these are all the variables I need to complete my Multivariate Statistics Analysis class.\n\nThank you!
3	Wooow this is so interesting and I want to take it and know the results! :D too bad I have never been in a relationship haha :))
3	Took it! I would love to know the results as well.
1	ESFJ here with an ESTJ. Four years down the line, best relationship ever! 
8	NOTES ON MY INFJ (M) x ESFJ (F) RELATIONSHIP	I have had five and a half years with a beautiful soul. We have lived together for three of those so we are well into the part of the relationship we can't hide our true selves from each other anymore. I figure we are currently in a funk because we both have not matured, specifically, in regard to our types. \n\nI've reseached ESFJ's. They always need to know that you want/desire them. If an ESFJ doesn't get this constant recognition/appreciation then she gets worried that you no longer want them around and of for a while I have felt she has been loyal to somebody else. I  am not her naturally compatible type so she is "cheating" on me, please note; not in the literal sense of the word because I crave DIE HARD loyalty. She is getting her needs met by a friend (F) who's type probably compliments hers.\n\nI remember in the beginning thinking how lucky I was because she was so low maintenance. Well apparently not. I figure everyone quicky discovers in relationships so nothing new there. This could be [confirmation bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias) but I have noticed that\n\n* She never knows what she wants. \n* Because of **Ne**, ESFJ's take the value judgements of those that influence them but they are also easily sold or taken advantage of so you can imagine the result if you are in the wrong circle. \n\nThese two (actually three) elements are the fuel to my fear of our future together.\n\nThe INFJ **Te** blindspot demands I am not aware of what others are thinking and this is a terrible thing when she does not communicate. I fully understand that I should ignore the self harming thoughts running around in my head during such episodes.\n\nI bet no ESFJ would want to be told what I've written above, especially by an INFJ in person, because when it's truth time I always come off as commanding which I avoid in fear of pushing people away. I am a perfectionist with terribly high standards that I don't adhere to half of the time and I am struggling to grasp that **everyone isn't like me**. But I am trying to improve myself every (other) day, something I never see in my ESFJ. Will a divide grow between us or is maturity a naturally occuring process? Only time will tell.\n\nPS: Everything I have written above is attached to personal experiences.
5	I really hope you guys work things out. \n\nI'm a female ESFJ and all my boyfriends have been INFJ.. I have a little theory that the INFJ and ESFJ are actually the best match.\n\nAlthough a lot of what you said is true.. maybe my theory will help you feel confident in your relationship.\n\nINFJ typically are known for being a very deep type who are misunderstood, and take a while to get to know, but once they fully trust someone they stick by them (sometimes to an unhealthy degree). Now, ESFJ, although we appear open and warm, we usually have a hidden intelligence from our Ti.\n\nWe're actually self conscious of it and only share it with people we're very comfortable with. So with that allows time for the ESFJ and INFJ to warm up to each other and get to know the hidden intelligence they both have. \n\nMeanwhile.. the ESFJ often have issues with letting people in-in fear they will leave.. and INFJ stick with people often to a fault, remember?.. so they become an attached pair.\n\n\-They both share Fe, and all of their other functions (Ne, Ni, Se, Si) don't typically cause conflict- actually they add interest.. (Example: Ni being the INFJ dominant function, and Ne being our 3rd.. allows our Ne to be presant but not strong enough to conflict.. Giving us an ability to see eye to eye better.) \n\nWell.. I hope this helped in some way, and that you guys can work things out! 
2	Esfj are simple yet complicated people. If she feels not appreciated she would act as if she is fine. Passive aggressive. Challenging match. 
1	Wow. This very accurately describes my last relationship, now ended. I’m INFJ and my ex is ESFJ. There was an initial very strong chemistry.  The problems lay with both of us and I could copy and paste the above comments which elucidate the problems.   I understand that my ex ESFJ is still very frustratedly angry with me for ending the relationship, which is ironic and sad as it was the repeated frustrated anger when things didn’t go perfectly that soured my view in the first place.  I would say my ESFJ was a very anxious attacher, where as I was more a distant attacher.  ESFJ seemed to need constant reassurance that we were attached and this seemed to be a HUGE vulnerability. Whereas I would confidently say that I could very easily maintain a loyal and devoted attachment with someone even if they lived on the other side of the planet.  ESFJ wanted engagement and marriage super fast (wanted to be engaged within a few months) where as I would be very happy with that sort of formality to evolve after several years of devotion and loyalty.  Not sure if that is relatable, but those are my insights from what transpired. Happy to delve further if required. \nIn summary: I feel my ex-ESFJ just wanted to be loved in a very secure way, unconditionally.  Whereas I, an INFJ, just wanted to be understood, respected and trusted, unconditionally, without any of the drama.

It'll only take a few minutes, so please check it out.\n\nI will be posting results after all the data has been compiled.\nhttps://goo.gl/forms/wgMY0z9LvWmN0NY23\n\n***Edit: I will be closing the test to do data stuff at 2pm CT on Sunday, August 5. Sorry if you didn't get it a chance to take the test. Look for the results post in a day or two.***
1	I tend to love all genres across the board. However, what normally bothers me the most musically is yelling or screaming. I haven’t been able to appreciate edm yet either. I tend to find myself loving chill, relaxed, calmer music across all genres. I love songs that make me feel sentimental.
3	INFP in need of an ESFJ friend.	Hello \n\n So i quit my job and I'm ready to tackle the whole 'working for yourself'. I'm really good at making plans , except those plans are constantly reworked every minute of the day. \nI've learnt early on that Im not a natural self starter when it comes to tackling down tasks. I did notice that when friends tell me to get  on with it , I actually do. \n\nSo since I'm starting a new chapter , and I know what I know thought I'd ask . \n\nI can create my schedule and what I want to achieve daily or weekly basis , think where you'd come in handy is kind of checking on me couple of minutes , daily or every other day. You know some positive vibes and some orders. \n\nEdit: M25London

I'm beginning to to question the myers-brigg test and it looks very tenuous at best to indicate whether a person is who they are?\n\nCan a persons personality results change?\n\nWhat are the accuracy levels to myers-briggs?\n\nCan someone add some insight into this?\n\nI'm doing some self-discovery and find out that i'm also a 'Highly-sensitiveness person?'\n\nMaybe you see yourself here too?\n\n[link\n](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/communication-success/201711/24-signs-highly-sensitive-person)\n\nALSO the validity of Myers-brigs test\n[Link](https://www.vox.com/2014/7/15/5881947/myers-briggs-personality-test-meaningless)\n\nI think Dr. Oldhams 14 personality types is better insight than myers-brigs.\n\nThoughts / comments?\n\n
1	Yeah, totally legit. If you really want to get into it, Reckful wrote an extensive post a while ago on Personality Cafe, debunking all the common criticisms against MBTI. He’s a long-time poster who’s more into the dichotomies than the functions, but whatevs. Don’t ask me what that means, cos I dont know, lol.\n\nhttps://www.personalitycafe.com/myers-briggs-forum/283457-another-mbti-debunking.html#/topics/283457?page=1
1	> Can a persons personality results change?\n\nYES\n\nConstantly, hormones play a huge role in your current personality. Stress and circumstances also can change your personality. 
1	What's Dr. Oldhams 14 personality types? Can you give me please a link with this theory? I don't know it at all. 
1	MBTI is pretty innacurate and shallow. Fun, and can give you a general idea (assuming it got it right, which it often doesn't), but if you really want to understand yourself and others, you need to dive into Cognitive Functions. But first, here's this;  \n[http://cognitivetype.com/2018/05/06/why-mbti-mistypes-everyone/](http://cognitivetype.com/2018/05/06/why-mbti-mistypes-everyone/)  \nIn summary, MBTI tests are looking for an "A or B" answer to each of the four letters. But each of those questions is loaded, and also extremely subjective. And it does nothing to address the cognitive functions, which are also well explained on the above website.  \nFurthermore, there are actually four sides to the mind you could say: The Ego (Conscious), The Shadow (Unconscious), The Subconscious, and The Super Ego. Depending on your maturity level, as well as your behavior under stress and your confidence, people often test on MBTI aspects of their subconscious or unconscious, further confounding the results. All of the above is why people can often take the MBTI tests and wind up with different results over time, or even taken back to back.  \n\n\nIn short, you have four functions of which can be introverted or extroverted, making eight total. Everyone has all eight cognitive functions, but four are in your ego/conscious, while four are in your shadow/unconscious. The order of your MBTI letters can completely screw with your cognitive function stack, and the stack is what you actually care about.  \nFor example, if you can't decide between ESFJ and ESFP, you might think "what's the difference between J/P? It's not much" but that is incorrect.  \nESFJ:  (ego) Fe - Si - Ne - Ti / (shadow) Fi - Se - Ni - Te  \nESFP: (ego) Se - Fi - Te - Ni / (shadow) Si - Fe - Ti - Ne  \nThe order of the functions determines strength, preference, and how the function manifests in it's "role" in your psyche. So not only do these two personality types operate on different functions entirely, they also operate with different strengths and such. These two personalities, seemingly similar on MBTI, are miles apart in the real world.  \n\n\nI could go on and on and on (I love this stuff), but I'll stop there for now. I can elaborate if you want, I'm happy to talk more about it or answer questions.  \nIf you'd be interested to learn more on your own, my favorite youtuber is C.S. Joseph, he does a fantastic job, including explaining the problems with MBTI, what the functions mean, what each type looks like, their interactions, and so on.  \nThe version of personality typing I'm referring to here is called Jungian Analytical Psychology, or Cognitive Typing (these are similar and parallel, just slightly separate). Many of these schools of thought originated from the works of Carl Jung, including MBTI, but MBTI is sadly very limited in its approach.  \n\n\nCheers.

2	I can't communicate with my ESFJ anymore. Facts are disregarded for feelings. Help.	Please help, this is super important to me :(\n\nI have an ESFJ in my life, someone I care for deeply but as an ISTP my mode of operation is analysis and facts based.\n\nIf something is wrong, I want you to tell me with proof so that I can grow. My ESFJ is all about feeling and group think, she disregards proof, facts, analysis and even what is right in-front of her in favor of her feelings.I take huge issue with this because feelings are subjective, your feelings can be wrong and when presented with documented proof, how can you disregard that in favor of "It feels wrong" and then justify it with "These guys also say it feels wrong so I'm right.". It baffles me. I understand that criticism and growing is very difficult for an ESFJ and it's even more difficult when challenging peoples beliefs and making them grow is my fucking love language :P\n\nI have a friend whom I dearly love and he challenges my beliefs ALL THE TIME and I LOVE him for it. I feel like I grow every time we speak. But I really don't know how to communicate with my ESFJ who I can see is hurting herself and making her life much more difficult than it should be and it's seriously affecting her, but when I try to tell her she's gets furious and extremely hurt. I don't get it. Why wouldn't you want to improve your life based on documented truths in favor of subject emotional delusions...\n\nYou're clearly upset, why hold so tightly to what is clearly upsetting you... even when presented with facts.
2	I understand that challenging a person's beliefs may be an ISTP's love language, but this may come across to feelers as purposely hurting them and challenging the whole person. I know it must not be taken personally, but feelers really tend to see it that way because we see our values and beliefs as part of who we are, so it may come across in a different way for the person. Rejecting our values, principles, beliefs, may be rejecting us as people, too. I have an ENFP friend in a relationship with an ISTP and this is almost always the root of their misunderstandings. Maybe you can just explain it in a nice way? You need to meet halfway. Perhaps you can explain your side in a way that will not hurt her feelings, and she needs to listen to what you have to say, too, with an open and understanding heart.

2	ESFJ-t	Hi Friends,\n\nI just took a myers-briggs test which indicated that i am ESFJ-t. \n\nI took the test at 16personalities.com\n\nI know this means, my personality is inclined toward\nExtrovert, Sensing, Feeling, Judgement \n**but 'what does the T' Stand for?**\n\nALSO, does anyone know of a site that can explain what each personality trait means in detail?\n\nThanks very much!
3	The T stands for "Turbulent." It's based on how you handle stress. Turbulent people don't handle stress as well as A or Assertives. (I'm about 99% sure on that)\n\nAnd I don't have any speciffic website for you other than the one you already took the test on. But I can assure you that after a while, all the different letters start making sense. Just remember there's oposited for each. \n\nExtrovert-Introvert\n\nSensing-iNtuitive\n\nFeeling-Thinking\n\nJudging-Perceiving\n\nAnd not all of those mean exactly what you may think they do. So a quick search like "What does Judging in Meyer's Briggs mean?" Will provide lots of interesting info for you. 
2	You might want to try looking into the cognitive functions. i personally find 16personalities to be a bit unreliable, since they use the dichotomies (i.e. scales for e/i, s/n, etc.) to type people, which can skew the results based on your mood or feeling (note: i'm not trying to say that you aren't an ESFJ, but just letting you know that you could possibly be mistyped). Two other popular tests that I'd find to be pretty accurate (and some others in the mbti community) are [here](http://similarminds.com/classic_jung.html) and [here](http://www.keys2cognition.com/explore.htm). (The first test's about 60 questions long, the second one's around 50)\n\nI'll leave a few other links below in case if you want to dig a bit deeper:\n\n[https://www.typeinmind.com/](https://www.typeinmind.com/)\n\n[http://cognitiveprocesses.com/](http://cognitiveprocesses.com/)\n\n[https://www.psychologyjunkie.com/2018/02/23/introduction-cognitive-functions-myers-briggs-theory/](https://www.psychologyjunkie.com/2018/02/23/introduction-cognitive-functions-myers-briggs-theory/)\n\n[https://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2015/06/if-youre-confused-about-your-myers-briggs-personality-type-read-this-an-intro-to-cognitive-functions/](https://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2015/06/if-youre-confused-about-your-myers-briggs-personality-type-read-this-an-intro-to-cognitive-functions/)\n\nOther than that, welcome to the mbti community!! have fun & hope you enjoy your stay ;D\n\n\~a friendly infp
1	The -T/A thing [16personalities.com](https://16personalities.com) does is pretty much a gimmick they use to get people to buy their information. It isn't standard MBTI.\n\nAlso, if you are into personality stuff checkout the Big 5 traits. That might give you a better idea of how you tend to deal with stress.
5	Love and loyalty	So I thought there was something going on between me (INFP) and an ESFJ. Anyway, it lead me to a question about your personality.\n\nDo you often notice a contradiction between your feelings and your decisions?\n\nSuppose that you find yourself in a situation where you fall in love with someone else while already in a relationship? Would you choose to go with your feelings or loyalty?\n\n\nThank you :)\n
2	Loyalty but if I had real feelings and I am unhappy in the relationship then I would follow my feelings however it would take a while as I would live in denial and clutch onto the current relationship. 
2	For a committed relationship, loyalty every time but that’s still based on feelings including prioritizing the lifelong feelings of regret I know I would have if I acted disloyally over a new feeling that’s likely transitory.
1	ESFJ here. I find that people often think they are closer to me than they really are or maybe misinterpret the relationship. ESFJs are normally very warm people and are good at connecting with people. I know that there were multiple women prior to my getting married that thought I liked them, but from my perspective they were just good friends and I was just being my friendly warm ESFJ self. It hasn't been as much of an issue since getting married, since people know I'm married and there's less chance of misinterpretation. 
1	Loyalty. I actually think that I'm a kind of person who will stay in the relationship even if I'm unhappy, rather than hurting the other person. I will do my best to work the relationship out. And I will never forget of course the bond that I have formed with my partner for so long and still work in strenghteming. I think exceptions would be an abusive relationship and cheating. These are dealbreakers for me. Although I guess having feelings for someone else is very very very unlikely for me because I am very loyal, and I know the difference between love (which is longlasting, deep, intense) with infatuation (which is fleeting, shallow, not true love).

2	Is it normal for ENTPs to mis-type themselves as ESFJ-A?	
2	MBTI isn't particularly accurate, for a number of reasons. Here's a quick and interesting read on the matter.  \n[http://cognitivetype.com/2018/05/06/why-mbti-mistypes-everyone/](http://cognitivetype.com/2018/05/06/why-mbti-mistypes-everyone/)  \n\n\nIf you really want to understand yourself and others, you have to understand the cognitive functions. There are Eight in total (T/F and S/N, but either with either an introverted or extroverted charge). There are four sides to the mind, but for now I'll mention two. The Ego (Conscious) holds the four cognitive functions that a person most prefers and uses, and is generally where an individual resides, most of the time. The Shadow (Unconscious) holds the remaining four cognitive functions, which are reluctantly used and less often, but they are important at times and integrating the Shadow into part of your psyche is the path to maturity, to make yourself whole (with all eight functions in balance). ESFJ and ENTP are fairly similar as it so happens:  \nESFJ: ego Fe - Si - Ne - Ti |shadow Fi - Se - Ni - Te  \nENTP: ego Ne - Ti - Fe - Si | shadow Ni - Te - Fi - Se  \nSo they share the same functions within the ego, creating similar traits. But the order greatly affects strength of functions, preference, and "role" (how they manifest).  \nIf you want to know more on the topic, I could explain it. But if you're up for more learning, check out youtuber C.S. Joseph, his work is fantastic and he breaks it down beautifully.  \n\n\nIf you just want a quick glimpse of a difference between the two types, without too much background, it's something like this... (context can be found in C.S. Joseph's lectures) both types share the same interaction style of "Starters", which are;   \n\-Informative (explain in more detail, context always matters. opposite of Direct)  \n\-Initiating (mark of an extroverted type, initiates experience/interactions. opposite of Responding)  \n\-Movement (makes progress in/despite chaos, prefers novelty and frequent change/variables. opposite of Control)  \nSo the difference comes down to the Temperament;  \n\-Guardian (SJ): aka 'Past Protectors' are all about the past, duty/tradition, protecting loved ones (via past knowledge), are more interested relationships etc  \n\-Intellectual (NT): aka 'Future Thinkers' prefer to think somewhat abstractly, form their own conclusions, are more interested in ideas/concepts/mechanics etc  \n\n\nFrom your little descriptions, your Friend 1 sounds more ENTP, Friend 2 sounds like an ESFJ. Don't let the MBTI "48:52" ratios fool you, MBTI doesn't take into account cognitive functions, is horribly subjective, and uses loaded/leading dichotomies (as explained in the link above). Your friend isn't "48% ENTP 52% ESFJ" or anything to that effect, it's just difficult to type people when your tools aren't very sharp. :)  \n\n\nHope that helps, happy to answer questions. Cheers.
2	As an ENTP I could never imagine that I was a ESFJ of any sort.\n\n
1	I'm not sure how accurate this personality test is. \n\nI would check out the personality self-portrait for more on personality styles. \n\nptypes.com
3	How Does It Make You Feel When A Former Close Friend No Longer Wants You In Their Life?	How does this make you feel? Do you get over it quickly, after a few months? Does it linger in the back of your head for awhile and bother you when you think about it? Does it crush you and you feel helpless?
5	Yes, I would feel really really bad and sad. I never want to cut ties with anyone, most especially if I love the person so much. I will do my best to make up with the person. However, if the person has already made the decision and it's final, I can do nothing about it, and just hope that the person will be happy in the future. I will try to move on with all the good memories, but without the person in my life already. I do not like it, but it has been the choice of the person, so I can only respect that and move on. It would torture me for so long though, blaming myself,  before finally being able to move on. It would however be a lifetime scar for me, bringing out all my insecurities and doubs within myself.
6	ESFJ who can't take a hint and talks nonstop despite no answer?	Literally talks and talks and talks and talks to no end with no idea that we're getting bored an exhausted of listening despite one-word responses and grunts... too sensitive to just be like "dude please stop talking". She always looks like someone's about to punch her and is more concerned about being everyone's friend than about what is actually good for them... tells the same stories over and over in the exact same way and will just talk at you and trap you even if you're hardly responding or not responding at all. Seems to feel the need to tell people every single detail her brain can possibly rack up and makes that shitty face so nobody gets the cojones to ask her to be excused.  \n\nHow on earth do I deal with this person who won't stop talking? I even had a conversation with her telling her, "hey, I get pretty exhausted from talking quickly so I just wanted to let you know because I don't know how to tell you". She just defended herself the whole time saying, "sometimes I get carried away". You think I don't know??? At this point people avoid her just to keep from getting trapped. Is there any way to go about this or am I just going to have to deal with it forever? I'm stuck being around her most of the time so it's not like I can just leave. 
2	Sounds like insecurity. ESFJs tend to have trouble with introspection. Try using your Fe and get deep into her (gross dude...). Do this: https://www.wikihow.com/Practice-Compassion-Meditation Be her "introspection guru". Notice her function usage and try to see the reasons behind it. It's like Ne psychoanalysis. Then, take the function she's using into account, her type into account, and work from there.\n\nA lot of people in society need therapists, and they don't know it. This is one of the reasons we see people like that. You may not legally be qualified to be her therapist, but there are things you can do to help.\n\nI'm an INTP who has grown up with a narc and had a low EQ. It warped my sense of self and sense of the world around me. Eventually, I stopped believing anything my parents said. Neither knew what they were talking about, and my mom just tried manipulating. This is why I was so awkward and sucked at socializing. The low EQ caused emotions to seep out in various ways. I'd talk a ton and make way too many jokes, because I wanted attention and validation which I was deprived of.\n\nPerhaps this ESFJ is experiencing something similar.
1	I think ESFJs have a hard time taking a hint. I don't know with other ESFJs but I appreciate honest and straightforward people. I prefer them being straight to the point with their feelings because it is harder for me to read their true feelings. I appreciate that because it shows that people still want to compromise with me and still make it work somehow with me, by stating the things that I do that they do not like. So that we can make it work in the future. However, I have already trained myself for this. Others may be too sensitive, depending on the person. Maybe you can tell the person in a more straightforward but nice way. We really have a hard time picking up hints, so I do not recommend that.
1	> She just defended herself the whole time saying, "sometimes I get carried away". You think I don't know??? \n\nloool\n\nDoesn't sound like an healthy person. These are the people that scare the shit out of me, an adult ESFJ I know is nearly like that and, man, she wants you to **feel** her anxiety... Even if you're clearly uncomfortable, she'll keep pushing until she's got it all out.\n\nSet boundaries, be clear, offer a compromise. You don't have to be uncomfortable with her, it's not good to neither of you. Assert yourself, remind her that you already told her that you get uncomfortable: "sometimes" she gets carried away, "sometimes" you get exhausted (regardless of who is speaking, it's the format itself). I'd suggest not to just dismiss her, to rather involve her so she can make a choice and have a chance to improve her behavior. Don't be manipulative, don't be ambiguous, don't be rude. My 2 cents.
5	What Do ESFJs Think/Feel about INFJs?	What are your thoughts/feels about INFJs ?? Just wondering :)
6	Personally, I really really love and am fond of INFJs!!! My first love, my bestfriend, and many more close friends are INFJs!!! :D They are very complex and mysterious, but I love that about them. Their presence is also very comforting. They are very caring amd sensitive, to the point that they forget their own well-being. For me, I think they are great mindreaders!!! They always know how I truly feel without me having to say it, which I appreciate a lot! :)
5	My sister (ESFJ) has answered for you. "They make me curious." In other words, one of the few types ESFJs cannot pick up on immediately. 
1	How do you react to someone you care about never wanting to speak to you again?	lets say you were once really close to a person of the opposite gender ( like bff close) and they had feelings for you but you simply didnt reciprocate those feelings, so they were hurt and distanced themselves from you (deleted you from social media, never text you anymore). They hold a grudge against you for not reciprocating those feelings and you feel as if they hate you or have a strong disliking because you rejected them. How would that make you feel? How would you view that person who pushed you away?
3	They stopped talking to you not because they hate you for rejecting them. They did it to save themselves from shame. You feel like someone hates you when they don’t talk to you anymore because you are very tuned to other people’s emotions and it had often been the case in the past. But in this case, I can tell you that this person stopped communicating because interacting with you made them feel ashamed for being rejected. They certainly did not stop communicating deliberately to make you feel bad. \n\nAs to what to do, just communicate your feelings. If they blocked you everywhere, write a letter to their place. Tell them you want to stay as good friends and you didn’t mean to make them feel ashamed. That you have your life and have to make your choices sometimes. That’s all you can do. \n\nPersonally I feel like this person is immature. A mature person will not end a good friendship just because their advance was rejected. But that is for you to find out. I do not know neither you nor that person. My judgement is irrelevant. 
3	I would feel really really sad and that a good friendship is wasted. I do not mind if the person needs space first to move on. I will understand that and give the person space and time. However, if the person wants to cut ties with me permanently, I would feel that maybe we do not have that strong of a friendship for this to happen just like that.
1	How do ESFJs deal with people?	I'm an INTP. Trying to figure out how to use my Extroverted Feeling function. Tell me how you all like to handle people!
11	Handle people? We want to be liked and want those around us to feel listened to and cared for. We are/I am warm and perhaps too quick to please others. I always “want” to do what others want to do. I genuinely cannot think of preferences when asked. If someone else has one, I’d rather go along with theirs so they are happy because I will be satisfied anyway. I have a long history/problem with caring for others more than myself. I am very generous. What I have, I will give away or at least share 50/50 without regard for if it’s appreciated, respected, or if I might be taken advantage of. I think this is a characteristic of ESFJ. Personally, I have a lot of tastes and cannot be pinned to one thing. I am easy to please and entertain. The extrovert in me is bubbly and will speak to anyone. That doesn’t mean I like small talk. I don’t. I desire deep connections with people... because there is nothing more that I love than people. I briefly dated an INTP and we had very different expectations in the relationship. It was too much to handle. He was a giver upper. I’m a fighter. He was way too casual for my taste. ESFJ can be a little more traditional, to my understanding. I know I am. I need to be asked out on proper dates and have doors held and sweet comments i  the beginning of a relationship. He didn’t feel the need. We liked each other: that’s all there was to it for him. I kind of went on a tangent here... but I hope this helped a little!
2	I think we just want everyone to be happy!!! :D most espcially our loved ones!!! :) So we will do all that we can just for them to be happy! :)
5	ESFJs, it is true that types change into you when they become a mom?	I've read somewhere in a forum that you become an ESFJ when you become a mom.\n\n  \n\[Don't take it seriously, it's a joke.\]
2	Can confirm. 
2	I mean, how would I know, already being an ESFJ? That being said, makes total sense. I am the mom friend. I just want everyone to be happy and feel included and cared about. Also, we need to schedule some free time together.
2	My yawn was interrupted with a small laugh, your title made my night ;) 
1	I've been likened to a mom my whole life!! Too bad I've never had any. 
1	It certainly helps to be an ESFJ as a mom.\n\nSource: I have twin 5 month olds 
1	Until you female ESFJ hit menopause and the kids move off.\n\nIf other parts of their life have not helped her create a separate identity away from motherhood... Whew.. It's a hot mess...
3	ESFJ joy	
6	Burning Love for Everybody?	I was looking at an "ESFJ Brain" diagram in Google Images, and one of the sections said "burning love for everybody." Could you explain that in detail? ESFJ's have a burning love for everybody? How does that work?
6	I'm not that sure about it as well but when I think about it, I looooooove people!!!! All people!!! I often just look at a person, and no matter what random thing that person is doing (eating, laughing, talking, etc.), I often just think about and feel how much I love that person!!! I have a special place in my heart for my loved ones who are special to me, but I think I love strangers, too. I think I was born to love and serve the people. I think its my life purpose. :)
2	I think it also has to do with our desire for everyone to be taken care of, and be doing well.  We're happy, we want everyone to be happy, because how much better would everything be if we were all happy?  
2	Nah I dislike most people...\n\n\nAnd at the same time, crave attention from them. :(
