7	What musicians are ESTPs?	Name as many as you can
2	Axl Rose. Debbie Harry. Eazy E (some people will say ISTP, but he's definitely a tertiary Fe user.) Joan Jett is an ISTP.
2	Madonna
2	James Hetfield maybe? (robs chin... hmmm) \n\nI'm pretty sure Bon Jovi is an ESTP. 
1	Kelli Ali
1	ASAP Rocky
11	story from an INFP	Hey guys, INFP girl here.\n\nEveryone seems to say that INFP/ESTP is the least compatible relationship. I can understand why they say that; we perceive the world in completely different ways. And our communication styles are different.\n\nI dated an ESTP dude for two years and it was turbulent because of the differences in how we saw the world. He was blunt, I was sensitive. We were both private in the wrong ways: I never told him what he did wrong to hurt me, while he was less forthcoming with his emotions, which I need to connect to people.\n\nThere were great things too. He was amazing at listening to my emotional rants and straightening me out, making me think clearly. Also, the sex was *fantastic* (this is where ESTPs/INFPs are *hella* compatible in my experience, fyi). Things eventually went south and we broke up, but I learned so much from our relationship.\n\nA year after the breakup and now we're friends. We've changed each other in subtle ways, I think. He's become more aware of my feelings and will accommodate them without just saying they're stupid. I've learned how to communicate directly and stand up for myself. It's easy to see his growth and how he's started to really try and see things from other emotional perspectives.\n\nI'm just writing this to let you guys know that although we're "supposed" to clash, we can learn a lot from each other. And I always, *always* appreciate you trying to accomodate our annoying sensitive feelings, because I realize it's not super natural. so thx <3
3	Interesting, I’m also dating an INFP right now after being really good friends for a year, and we’re doing pretty well for ourselves. I love that she’s more the blue to my red, giving me her more measured perspective of a problem without sounding like she disrespects or doesn’t understand my own. On her end, she loves how rapidly I can swing from curious and hyperactive to genuinely comforting and concerned.\n\nI think the crux of our relationship dynamic is that we’re able to think with the same wry cynicism, but what we make of our similar perspective is different, which allows us to foster similar understanding.\n\nThe only problem I see is that we can both be very outwardly stressed at times, which weakens our ability to communicate, but I’ve been training myself to at least be honest when I’m in a bad mood as well as being patient when she’s in a bad mood.
2	Were you amazed by his ability to straighten you up? \n\nSe Ti should help Fi Ne in staying grounded to reality . I have an infp friend and he expects me to straighten his thinking out all the time when he’s in some mind fuck or all caught up in his feelings not able to decide anything clearly. 
1	This was nice to read, i am glad you shared it.\n\nIt’s been days since i left my ex ESTP bf, i have started to learn quite a bit from it (after my feelings have died down a bit). Our relationship at the start especially was super toxic. He would never tell me he is in a bad mood and choose to ghost while also asking me to wait for his call. I used to really think he did that on purpose but after learning about his personality type i think they just dont realise where they go wrong. \n\nWe both learnt quite a bit from each other and even when we talk now he tells me he thinks i am ‘whole’ but i still dont see us happy together in the future despite my feelings.\n\nI am scared that i will always have to be at my best and i cant go back to him feeling like that. I may be wrong but he has made comments to make me feel like that. \n\nBut yeah he definitely made my rely less on my feelings and being more upfront with issues. \n\n
1	thats where perceptive types are better than judging types, as we generally tend to take more external input
2	anyone stuck in inferior Ni trying to self develop? how to get out of it ?	ive been stuck in inferior ni for the past few years on and off when  i tried too hard to self develop using NI.
1	Can you explain more about how you're using ni or the situations you're in? \n\nIt's not our strong point so it's not supposed to be used too often. 
3	ENTP trying to access sensory functions	I’m not always sure my type is a perfect fit, sometimes J and occasionally I, but what I know I can’t access is the sensory aspect.  For anything I do from acting to drawing and even just speaking, I realize I’m looking for meaning, or expressing deeper ideas.  But I know full well I can’t progress if I can’t shorten the time between seeing a stimulus and executing an impulse to that.  \n\nSo how can I exercise my sensory function?
2	Try skydiving or something. I guarantee you won’t be able to think about hidden meanings when your brain is overloaded with adrenaline. \n\nThere’s a reason we like doing crazy outdoorsy things, you won’t work your Se by reading a book.
1	Wanna know as well, ENFP
7	Out of 16 types, 8 are light and 8 are dark. ESTPs are one of the 8 light types:	
4	>\*Triggered*\n\n\- every dark type
3	>public sector  \n>  \n>good\n\nI don't think those go together...\n\n&#x200B;
2	You’re right btw. I quite like this. 
2	I think we have a moral compass to do good in the world. You can follow this through most careers. 
1	Then why are there so many estps in jail
5	ESTP typing as ENFJ?	Can/willl ESTPs type as ENTJs on these goofy online MTBI assays.   (Not ENFJ as title says)
4	Yes, shares all 4 functions, both extroverts. Really consider the last function to decide. Are you inferior Ti or inferior Ni.
3	I’ve actually thought I was both at different times since I’m a fairly motivating and effective leader, but I think the main difference is that while I realize my goals, I focus on what’s directly in front of me to find the path of least resistance, while an ENXJ will have a solid, objective plan on reaching that goal.
2	More likely the other way around, Estps typing as Entj/Enfj. Could happen if say a younger Estp spends times with older entj/enfj and picks up their mannerisms and such. Wears off quickly though. Entj/enfj don't really type as Estp unless they're unhealthy or something
1	Yes, some ESTP's will type as ENTJ's (is that what you meant?) Shared Se-Ni can make an ENTJ and ESTP look very similar if you don't know them that well, and Ti can look more similar to Te than typing descriptions will tell you.
1	Yes that's what I mean ESTP vs ENTJ
7	Two ESTPS.	Hi ; I recently learned I am an ESTP and it suits me well besides the emotion part I am pretty emotional when I want to be.\n\nI'm like a mix personally. I can be emotional and laid back but I am full of energy around others.\n\nI made my girlfriend take the ESTP test and she is an ESTP as well and we work well together? Is that right? Should this theoretically work? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - My gf is a ESTP and so am I? Is it suppose to work? I thought we where suppose to like Introverts. 
18	why do you care what a dumb ass test says\n\n\nif you guys get along then so be it\n\n\n
3	Just because you are an ESTP does not mean that this defines your life... not even close.\nThere’s so many different kinds of ESTP’s in this world. if you get along then GREAT. \nJust let it be :)
2	Theory:\n\nIt is supposed to be J types with P types + objective types with objective types (and vice versa for the subjective types).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, ESTP's best matches are:\n\nENTJ, ESFJ, ISTJ, INFJ.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's the theory, and it happens to match all my observations. But then who knows, maybe types can be paired with themselves too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn reality:\n\nIf you feel in love, and you feel loved, then it's a good match! Don't question the match. Maybe dig more into your type and hers, and let us curious individuals know what you find! Especially for ESTP, look for those four types I mentioned, it may help you find out.\n\n&#x200B;
2	It's totally okay to be a more feeling ESTP. I relate to you as well. For the most part energetic and down to earth but I can be emotional and relate to feelings when I need to be. The 16 personalities tests (assuming that's the test you took) only focuses on your traits so it won't be 100 percent accurate (still very close!!!) but you also have your functions. And my functions as an ESTP might be different than another ESTP's function. Also its always a good thing to remember there are more than 16 different types of people on earth. We all have our different upbringings which may determine how we think. I wouldn't exclusively look for a certain personality type in a partner. As long as you feel loved and they feel loved then I think that's all that matters. At least that's my best advice. 
1	We don't care what the test says :P\n\nIt's just rather interesting to me personally how personally types are sectored infact. Our sense of humor and ability to cheer each other up and see our body languages is phenomenal we get each other so well. Yet I am very good at persuading even her parents (especially her). I just found it interesting is all. 
5	just wondering how ESTPs would respond to this	[u/throwaway3n1p](https://www.reddit.com/u/throwaway3n1p) and I are currently working on gathering answers for how thought processes work in different MBTI types. This is just out of curiosity, not an attempt to stalk you according to how you think of grave crimes. All replies are appreciated!\n\nIf we count judgments of *moral obligation* out of the equation,\n\nQuestion 1: How is murder logically fine?\n\nQuestion 2: How is murder logically wrong?\n\nNOTE: Feel free to write down whatever thought you have, whether it is emotional or just plain retarded.
7	Murder is fine if the victim has resigned to their rights by committing a crime of the same level (rape, murder, treason, etc.) or when it's a crime of passion.\n\nit's not fine when it's nothing like the above id say\n\n\n\nalso wtf is a moral obligation\n\n\n
4	Answer 1) it is not\n\nAnswer 2) it is
2	Strange question.... you want to leave moral judgment out of the equation, yet ask a moral question?\n\nMurder is never fine. I cannot name a moment when murder is fine. 
2	“the unlawful premeditated killing of one human being by another”\n\n> In the United States, the law regarding murder varies by jurisdiction. In most U.S. jurisdictions there is a hierarchy of acts, known collectively as homicide, of which first degree murder and felony murder are the most serious, followed by second degree murder, followed by voluntary manslaughter and involuntary manslaughter which are not as serious, and ending finally in justifiable homicide, which is not a crime at all. \n\n\n> A non-criminal homicide ruling, usually committed in self-defense or in defense of another, exists under United States law. A homicide may be considered justified if it is done to prevent a very serious crime, such as rape, armed robbery, manslaughter or murder. The victim must reasonably believe, under the totality of the circumstances, that the assailant intended to commit a serious crime. A homicide performed out of vengeance, or retribution for action in the past, would not be considered justifiable.\n\n\nSo essentially, logically it’s justifiable and legal if it’s in self defense.\n\nLogically if it’s not in self defense then, it’s illegal and unlawful.\n\nMorality, is a whole separate topic that doesn’t belong with logic and doesn’t align with being an estp 
2	NAP. Non-Aggression Principle.
1	> If we count judgments of moral obligation out of the equation,\n\nThis is impossible to answer. Without reference to a set of moral obligation (ie. the framework by which right and wrong is defined) these questions make no real sense. \n\nLogic does not decide right and wrong, given a set of information logic can only decide between three options: (1) it follows, (2) it does not follow, or (3) there is not enough information to decide.\n\nlets drop that sentence...\n\n> Question 1: How is murder ~~logically~~ fine?\n\n> Question 2: How is murder ~~logically~~ wrong?\n\nMurder is **morally** fine, in my opinion, only when one believes there is no other option in the set of all possible actions and inactions. To decide this is the burden of the individual.
1	1. Murder would be logically 'fine' if for example how I would feel about the massacres that occurred during the Crusades to which I would say it's fine whatever.\n2. Murder would be logically 'wrong' if for example I was asked to murder an innocent civilian to which I would say no since it would be wrong.
1	murder is logically fine when its efforts aid you or your tribe's survival or your own reproduction by fighting off another competitor.\n\nexample: youre a caveman and some fuckface comes strolling through your village trying to take some of your stuff. kill him to help you better survive by keeping your resources.  Or you see a pretty tribal girl in the forest and so does your enemy. you both fight and you kill him in order to ensure you mate with the tribal girl. In both cases, you don't necessarily have to kill him but it could be reasonably sound so they don't remain a threat.\n\nIt's logically wrong when it serves no purpose to better your survival or reproductive purposes, or that of the tribes.  Innocent killing - a random bystander, a child with no defense, a woman you kill because of a sudden rage, the mother of your child, etc.. Killing someone with no inherent reason is logically wrong as it serves no evolutionary purpose.\n\nedit: I've switched between ESTP, isfp, istp.. not sure how but wassup
3	Survey on personality and Flirting behaviors	Hey I am a doctoral Student at a University in the South. I am studying flirtation behaviors, specifically trying to catalog specific flirting behaviors taken from several experimental studies. I was wondering if I could post to this community as it seems relevant to my topic. Thank you in advance for taking the time to take the survey there is an opportunity to win a gift card if the entire survey is completed. You can back out at any time.\n\nHere is the link to the survey\n\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JMQP5PJ
15	Anyone else wish they didn't know? Or think it's bs?	I took the MB test today and this time I'm ESTP. I am definitely a doer. No question that I do a lot of stuff. I'm outgoing, problem solving, a project person- not a long term job person. There's some stuff that's me. But not loving theoretical discussions? Or being poorly suited to higher ed?  I'm on my 15th year of full time college education, on scholarships all the way and will be called Doctor very soon. I hate that there is someone deciding I'm anonymously not good at this (I see now that my hatred for that is very ESTP).  And we're not good at long term relationships because we crave excitement?  I've been with my husband for 20 years and could not *imagine* wanting anything else.  Is this bullshit? I hate that I took this test. 
14	yeah lots of ESTP stuff is bullshit cause people dont really understand how we can be such powerhouses at pretty much everything. its them rolling out the old trope where you cant be cool and smart at the same time. just ignore it.
3	Well, the test result apply more to the younger people, you get more well rounded with age.\n\nThere's also an N-bias of sort, since we are the majority online. See how this sub isn't very frequented ? Now, compare it r/INTP. in terms of subscribers.\n\nAnother thing is the shallowness of the descriptions. ESTP aren't against theoretical discussion, they just like solid, observable, verifiable facts more. The theory behind is is based on the 8 cognitive functions (www.cognitiveprocesses.com) So, facts and observation would be your Se. And if they say you dislike the theorical, it's because of your low Ni. Some types that appreciate it like INFJs or INTJs could consider you shallow, since you read between the lines too much, or you don't project yourself in the future too much. What they miss, however, is that you don:'t precisely because you saw the chaos out here, the possible stuff, all the variable to consider, so you don't like summarizing it abstractly ? (Most descriptions also ignores your Ne, which is considering multiples possibilities)\n\nAnyway, it kinda makes sense when you dig it out a bit, and the bias isn't going to get fixed if you never give your perspective. \n
2	Hm, why would it say not liking theoretical discussions? The T is right there.  \n\nBut anyway, the descriptions either come from studies involving a lot of people or straight out of someone's ass, depending on where you took the test. Inaccuracies happen. You don't even have to accept the label if you don't want to. No one will link you to those traits if you don't tell them about it ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
2	Most of  the stereotype is Te and Fe ideas being circle jerked. 
2	Theoretical discussions are fact based, not feelings based. Talking about feelings is “useless” to solve s problem. That’s how you should consider it.\n\nExcitement is also very subjective. It could mean you’re craving the wildest sex with everyone and nobody, or that you like to do sonething spontaneous with your husband. Maybe try that restaurant you’ve always wanted or go on a holiday to a place people may not say right away.\n\nThe test is basically so you have an idea what you are. But that’s not the only thing that shapes you. There’s so much more. But it’s especially good to know if you want to know what stresses you out, or what causes you to move etc.
2	There are a lot of younger folks that take this test and it shows. I'm also in a long term relationship and have 3 degrees. As an older estp,  some things I read are so cringworthy. It's probably cuz I'm female and most of the descriptions of estps are male-focused. Then I realize the person writing it probably isn't an estp and try to brush it off. It baffles me how we can be labeled as go-getters and complete failures at the same time.\n\nAs I've gotten older, I've found it harder to find people who are excited for life (i.e fun) and have stability. Most of my friends from college have not progressed as much as I have and I'm not about to hang with fuddy duddys. What a life.
11	ESTP college student rant	Sorry guys, I really need to vent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just visited my transfer university and damn, haha! Is it **boring**...\n\nSo is this it, is this the college experience ™  that I pay 35k a year for? Just study, walk hecka, go to class, walk back, dorm, repeat?  Man, I’m not about that fucking life, **fuck that** for real I don’t want to spend 2 years of my life being a lonely, broke ass nerd in a diploma mill / adult daycare. \n\nI want to work, make money, do something big, travel to places, camp outside, make deals, build things, shake hands with important people, just do **REAL** things. All these classes are PREVENTING me from doing it all and they're stressing me out. I'm really fucking tired of all this complacency of the people around me. All I'm seeing is just a bunch of fucking nerds that don't share the same soul or pure anger I have with how everyone is just FORCED to be OKAY with all of this shit. I honestly don't give a fuck about you knowing the cross vector product of some random ass particle, like who gives a shit dude. What a fucking waste of time that you have to spend, knowing all those useless things, when the job is *COMPLETELY DIFFERENT!!!* than the education you pay for. \n\nDamn just hire me already am I right? Hahahaha. There's a reason why on the JOB TRAINING exists. I'll tell you straight up, I'm not a fucking dumbass, I can easily learn the ropes of any job and I don't need to go in debt and waste years of my life and hard earned cash for learning useless, unnecessary shit. Like I'll definitely learn what I NEED to know. Don't force feed me things that I don't need on the job dude. Just stop.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm really about to lose it. It's getting to the point where I want to experience "**REAL"** things to replace this emptiness I have inside being forced into all this bullshit. I'm getting the urge to drink and smoke again, and I know that's not good. I tried exercising, hanging out, playing games, but it all just seems like a temporary distraction and it just makes me more angry. The only reason why I'm still in college is because my parents are paying for it, but I'm an adult now and I can do what I want. \n\nI don't want to be forced to do things I don't want to do, and that I know that I don't absolutely need to do. That's not living dude. I just want to enjoy my life. Fuck this.
9	Yeah school sucks but college is like an extrovert's wet dream. Everyone is so down to hangout... so many activities and events going on. 
4	School is an ends to a mean. The people were cool and my major classes were fun, so that helped. But the 'fun' didn't start til junior year when the Gen Ed's were out of the way. Your parents are paying for it so please don't  throw this opportunity  away. \n\nI find estps to be lifelong learners. so find a major/something that's always changing so you can't get bored.
2	Im only in school for the paper and credits. That crap is required for a lot of jobs. If it weren't for that, I doubt Id bother with any kind of schooling outside of trade or specialization(its a lot more practical).\n\nAlso, prerequisite classes friggin suck. Why do I need to take Humanities as a Fire Science Technology major? It serves no purpose. As if I didn't hate school enough, now Ive gotta waste my time with useless courses. \n\n
1	That's why I dropped out.\n\nfuck that shit. you don't need a paper to make money
1	Get a side hustle, start a business, take advantage of the resources and connections your university can offer you 
1	I feel you man
9	How do I tell my ESTP boyfriend I’m not ready to move in with him?	Me: ENTJ (25f) Him: ESTP (28m)\n\nThings happened very fast, and we both want to move away from the area.\n\nI think if we move, he implied it would make sense to move in together, and his logic is that we already practically live together.\n\nI am unsure because he typically does things very fast and often times it can be hard to be part of it or watch it etc.\n\nI really do care about him and I NEVER want to hold him back from an experience but I’m not ready and I’m worried if I explain he will only understand “she doesn’t want to be with me.”\n\nThanks for any advice, FYI his idea if it matters.\n\nThanks 
11	ESTP, out of all types, should be able to understand not being ready for that kind of commitment. Just make it clear that you still want to be with him.
6	By telling him you’re not ready to move in with him 
2	One of my best friends from high school is also a 28m ESTP. He’s been half-pressuring me to move in with him since forever, I think in part because he knows I’m more responsible than he is and have more money than he does. That, and titties. \n\nI don’t judge him for wanting to be somewhat carried in life, I’m just not going to be the one to do it. As much as he thinks he wants someone to put their foot down and see through his BS, I don’t actually see any evidence he genuinely wants that. He prefers the safety of having the mental/emotional upper hand in relationships. I hope your bf is a healthier ESTP than my bff is. \n\nESTPs are resilient. Just tell him the truth in a way that isn’t crushing. If he is mature, he’ll accept it and try again later. If not, well then you have bigger problems to worry about in this relationship. 
2	If he’s a healthy ESTP it won’t be a problem. Opening up the conversation on how you still want to move, and thinking logistically how you could both make it work financially would be helpful.\n\nAs an ESTP maintaining some of my individuality and personal space doesn’t seem like that much to ask- just don’t make it about him. \n\nJust have to be honest, direct and open about why you feel the way you do- and that it’s not something you’re quite ready for in this stage of life for whatever reason (you don’t necessarily even need to have one)\nI feel like he should be able to understand/appreciate you living true to you and not take it personally 
2	ESTP-ENTJ is a great pairing! :D Kudos! 
2	Just tell him ur nervous of all that change at once (moving to a new city And moving in together).  Say you wanna do one thing at a time....move to the city first and then see what happens. \n\nThat assumes that maybe u would want to live with him at some point in the future. If thats not the case, dont make him believe he has a chance in the future. Just say you prefer to live alone. 
1	Just go for it
1	Be blunt and honest. You're probably taking this harder than he will.
4	estps you guys just amaze me!	estps you guys just amaze me!, im talking about the unhealthy ones that is lol\n\n\nunhealthy estps are sooo hardcore, fearless and doers!, most crimanals are istps and estps by statistics. and when i was visiting the hospital one time, i saw this estp women, walking, with 9 policement behind her, she was in chains, but the way she walked just amazed me! the fearlessness\n\n\ni know alexander the great was an estp and he also had that charisma, that confidence and being a doer without fear!\n\n\nopinions?
16	I can’t read this, Jesus 
7	Delete this please, for your own sake 
2	Gee...  Thanks?? o_O
2	Thanks, now go fuck yourself
2	It's messed up that you single the unhealthy ones, so many great athletes are estp. It's also messed up that you say "most criminals," where are your sources? 
2	Lol thanks I guess. Were the companion cavalry!
1	Healthy ones are generally confident too. Give 'em some luuuuve. \nYou admiring criminals worries me a bit to be honest.
7	Jet's MBTI - Cast Podcast	Hey Reddit, my name is jetplane48 (ESTP 7w8 sx/sp) and I am starting up a podcast in relation to MBTI. Fundamentally, the goal of the podcast is to educate the viewers of several Typology systems through a series of one-on-one's with others who are interested in the same topics. I have been conducting interviews for many years (MBTI related) and this is just an extension of that, however, I want to discuss topics that the audience wants me to cover. Naturally, I'll come up with my own material but I would love to explore topics that others have in mind. I am busy with school for the next few months but when I finish, the goal is to eventually be more consistent with these podcast uploads if this turns out to be popular enough. I'm very excited to get this started, and let's see some questions!\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAR20eDTSOg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAR20eDTSOg)
7	any advice from other ESTP’s?	
9	Embrace your personality.\n\nActions speak louder than words
3	Ahhhh yep, welcome to the struggle. Biggest thing I've done successfully to improve this has been really working hard on my listening skills, also on responding with things like "that sounds awful" instead of "well you could fix that by doing x". That's the best I've got. It is definitely very hard and I completely feel you on caring a ton about people and then getting feedback that they don't realize you care about them because somehow it all got lost in translation. 
2	Commented on the other topic. I could copy and paste... but all I can  add here for now is is that I’ve been called a insensitive and a dick as well. xD
1	I am an INFP and my ex was ESTP. There were sooo many conversations where i felt like i was never actually being heard, he was a pretty unhealthy ESTP tbh. He would constantly interrupt me and would dominate the conversation. It had started getting so difficult for me, it took me a while to realise why i think he doesnt care. So when i started confronting him, he would usually get defensive but also tried to put an effort to listen more after a while. But it didnt really come naturally to him. And it makes more sense now because he would always say he cares for me and he loves me but his actions never really showed that. I also think he was narcissistic. There were days where he would make me feel good and then there were days where i felt so not valued. \n\nI think being aware of another person’s feelings is a good start. And yeah just definitely try and listen. Maybe if you practice enough, it will start coming naturally? 
0	I’ve been told I’m actually an ESTP.	I’m now locking myself up and throwing away the key....
3	I think you're more of an ENTP because you care to instigate back. Looking back at the average comment history posts in this subreddit, this post struck me as odd because it falls way outside that parameter. Just embrace who you are.
2	Bro, you are entp af. The girl who typed you is some kind of passive aggressive Fi dom. Can smell that shit a mile away.
2	Yeah, ENTP all the way. I've never seen an ESTP who likes to be as random as you
3	What type did you think you were before?
11	Are you less mature than your peers?	Do you ever find that you are intellectually far ahead of your peers but emotionally you are very reactive and underdeveloped?   Ti aux and Fe Tertiary maybe?
13	Outwardly, yeah. Inwardly, I can’t make that assumption since I logically wouldn’t be able to tell, but I feel well-rounded for my age.
8	I think my maturity to handle situations far outranks most people my age, but I am a goof. I get called silly a lot in my day to day, yet I don't think that makes me any less mature. 
6	Depends on which social circle I'm with. Some friends think I'm mature and others know I'm not. 
5	Yes.
3	My peers don't think so, but my family does. 
3	I agree for the emotional maturity. Not sure if it's because of ESTP or other experiences.
2	More mature, but oftentimes people mistake having fun for immaturity. 
1	I'm on the older side of life, so not any more, but definitely for a while in some ways. In other ways I was ahead. For me it is because of an abusive childhood. Is that a common childhood for ESTPs?
12	Does working out give you guys energy while sitting idle makes you dull and tired ?	Noticed Ni doms get energy by sitting at home and doing minimal tasks while Se doms tend to get energy by doing a lot of stuff like working out and cycling ? 
7	Yes I get a huge buzz from weightlifting. And then I get to school and have to sit in a desk for 8 hours
6	no\n\nIt sounds cheesy but I get insane energy as soon as the sun sets \n
6	I'm more of a cycling person than lifting, but yeah, about 20 mins in I can start to feel the buzz and I'm always in a better mood once I'm done.
3	It’s a gamble, honestly. It usually gives me energy for the time I’m working out when I’m tired. I recently stayed up for 31 hours straight and decided to go for a workout to get my energy up, but it completely drained me, and walking home was difficult because it felt like my soul was leaving my body.
1	Sort of.  If I don't work out, I've got energy to burn at the end of the day and have a less satisfying sleep.  And yes, I can't just sit and watch tv.  I have to be doing something unless it's a rare show or movie holding me rapt.  Otherwise, I'm drawing, painting, playing my bass, messing around on here, looking for memes on insta, lol.  Sometimes I'll even do laundry.\n\nPoint being, I can't just sit still unless that's the point of an activity, like yoga, meditation, and prayer, and certainly not idle.  It drives my infj husband a little crazy sometimes.
4	How to give you some bad news	I have to tell an ESTP some likely bad news. I am worried he will not take it well because he is kind of a ranty person and finds it hard to let things go.  How can I break this to you in the best way? Text? FaceTime? \n\nEdit: in person not possible bc of long distance. Can’t do it in person bc long distance. Options are to say something “like we need to talk” over text and ask to FaceTime or ask to FaceTime and just say it straight out or to text all the details out immediately.
12	It’s always best if it’s in person. Easy to process everything that way. \n\nAnd be very direct and clear about whatever it is. 
9	be straight as fuck, its the only way to get the message across  \n\n\n&#x200B;
1	Just be straightforward and honest 
1	“Hey you need to get yourself checked.” \nPretty easy really.
1	Express the bad news the same way to him you think he would react to the news itself.\n\nThat could work.
10	Problems with writing papers in school.	Did anyone else have a tough time writing papers in highschool? I can articulate myself perfectly when just talking, but as soon as it comes to writing a structured paper I get insane writer's block. 
5	I either barely passed or failed english classes cause of having to do papers or book reports
3	Same problem here, the Teachers comment is always like “great points but too anecdotal. Tone is way too informal” well my essay score still turns out better than half the class. I think maybe the teacher was bored of reading normal essays anyways 
2	Write in your speaking voice then leave the (heavy) editing for later.\n\nI could never plan out that I wanted to write in outlines, so I just free-thought it, jotting down ideas of what I wanted to write during the writing process. I'm more likely to use different color font to organize my writing (then switch it back to black before submitting it) than an actual outline. \n\nI did this though grad school and graduated. I even had a few teachers comment how easy the paper was to read because she could 'hear my voice' behind the words. 
1	Structure is always a problem, especially for ESTP. What works for me is to plan it beforehand. It feels real stupid to do, and usually I just do whatever and it looks good. But especially when structure is vital I basically make a draft first, where structure can lack and have a plan (Introduction - First part - Second part etc) next to it. After that I sort of pick and choose.
1	I'm a research scientist and I write papers all day every day. I rock this. I don't believe that personality limits anyone. You can do it. You probably were not taught well.  I started writing research papers in middle school, so by high school I was confident (yea for public ed!). If you learn how to organize your information, thoroughly research and know what you want to write, then stick to the intro paragraph, three main points (or whatever the assignment calls for), and conclusion, you're golden. Also, here are the steps: 1. Understand what is being asked of you. 2. do research 3. Write your main idea, 4. Write an outline 5. Write first and last paragraphs, 6, write main ideas for each paragraph (insert them into the outline) then write your paper and conclusion. 
7	Created a subreddit for SPS	I think there about 20-30 of us SPs who regularly comment on mbti related subs, so I created a new sub for us.  \n\nPlease subscribe to  https://www.reddit.com/r/TheArtisans/ \n

8	estps how do you finding dating?	estps how do you find dating?\n\n\nhow do you guys find picking up women,and women men?\n\nor same sex pickups?
13	Pretty easy.  Use a bunch of dating apps. Line up a bunch of dates. Go on them. Find someone that clicks, make a move, get into a relationship.
10	I find it to be boring, I've done the pump and dump kind of dates and after a while it got dull for me.\n\nI prefer long term relationships and I usually do dates around noon so we have plenty of time to drink and talk
4	Go do stuff, join a class, play a sport, anything that's an activity in a group. Meet people, make friends, see if you're interested in anyone you meet, ask them out. Keep asking them out if it's going well.
2	Dm other local highschoolers that have a friend or two in common
2	Im a ISTP and was wondering if theres a huge difference in Se with ISTPs and ESTPs	I know that obviously ESTPs have stronger Se than ISTPs, but since thats a ISTPs first perception function would ISTPs see the world as vivid and be as in the moment as ESTPs? Or would it be toned down and kinda foggy if thats the right word like how a INTJ or ENTJs Se would be? 
10	ESTPs have a lot more sex we're rubbish at flirting that's probably the biggest difference
3	ISTPs are the inferior versions of ESTPs
2	Suddenly I became ESTP from ISTP this year.\n\nThis is so fucking good.
2	ISTPs and ESTPs have pretty similar views of the world. Biggest difference is that ISTPs are somewhat more independent, while ESTPs will do anything to share their spontaneity.
2	There is a big difference between dominant and auxiliary function (and no, they don't ever switch places and an ISTP doesn't go to being an ESTP or vice versa). The auxiliary function is much more flexible and can be turned on and off at person's wish. It's applied to the specific situation at hand. The dominant function is always there. It never turns off and you cannot make it turn off (not even in your sleep). It's static, it doesn't have much flexibility, and all it does is observe and make conclusions. So one is observing and concluding, the other is actively influencing situations around you. [Dominant function](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=Functions#Leading_function) vs [Auxiliary function](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=Functions#Creative_function) - just insert Se into these descriptions.
6	Sense of Purpose?	For all older ESTP's, (I'm 18 male) have you guys felt like you've found your purpose? What gets you up in the morning. What's your daily Motivator? Is it super stimulating? or more soothing.
13	Yeah\n\nMy main purpose is just to have fun, do things I want to do, feel balanced with myself, and share my experiences with others. I realize that once you pay off the house and car, the rest of life is really up to you. You can get married if you want, make a business, travel, work out, or all of this with a balanced work schedule up to retirement. \n\nWhat gets me up in the morning is that there are so many things to do that I'm possibly missing out on. I don't want to die knowing I missed out skiing or experiencing Jamaica or some shit. It's not only physically going places but mentally. I like to see how I can solve the world's problems and try to help humanity as a whole. I want to leave a legacy somehow, but if I don't, that's okay. As long as I'm satisfied with my life and no one forced me to do anything, I don't care if I die.\n\nI'd say it's soothing and stimulating at the same time. Actually, I get soothed as I get stimulated because I'm finally doing something I enjoy and I'm not missing out. Like I'm actually doing something I want to do and that makes me happy.\n\nEdit: I just wanna get this out there but I know some people make their whole lives serving a God or trying to get to heaven. I used to be like that and I’m not saying that’s bad I’m just saying that the mindset it forced me in secluded me from a lot of experiences until I had to think outside the box and explore. I’ve seen religious people discriminate innocent people’s life choices, fight each other, and so forth. Bro, stop doing this please. Don’t shove your personal life choice to other people and threaten them with eternal hellfire. If God was really fair he wouldn’t do such a thing even for people with their own conscious choose to reject him. Also atheists are guilty of this too. Life is not about materialistic stuff, it’s about being happy and striving for something to be honest that’s all I’m gonna say here peace
6	Yo......you're 18.  I know us ESTP's seem to juggle 20 plates at once on life.  On one hand we're like wtf am I going to do with my life.  On the other we're like no worries I'll figure it out.  All the while not wanting to miss out on opportunities.  My advice as a 43 year old ESTP.  Don't sweat it.  Really there are few things in your life you can control.  Those few are you and your character and motivations.  All the rest are small details.  At 18 you may be saying wtf are you talking about?????\n\nWhat I'm saying is that in life very few things are going to keep you down long.  No matter what you go through.  A break up.  A loss of a job.  Hard times financially.  You won't be down for long before you're back up on your feet.  So my advice is to ride the waves and not stress out about everything.  Why?  Because like the stock market as long as you are progressing it's always going to be going up.  \n\nAll the best my friend.  You WILL figure this out.
2	This gave a ton of insight really needed to hear this. Thanks.  It reassures what I’ve always known to be true about myself; regardless of what the parents/peers say. 
2	knowing that no one but you cares about your own success
4	Bad Santa(2003) a whole lotta Se	Willie(Bad Santa) - ESTP\n\nMarcus - ESFP\n\nThe kid - INTP\n\nGin(Bernie Mac) - ESTP\n\nSue - ENTJ\n\nLois(Marcus's wife) - ENFJ
8	Se and Suffering	Do Se doms experience higher degrees of physical pain or suffering compared to other types? Either by lifestyle or pain sensitivity
16	Estps experience more physical pain because we(stereotypically) do stupid stunts and skydive without parachutes.
6	I find I have an unnaturally high pain tolerance but that's probably just me and not an ESTP thing.\n\nedit: i can't speak english lmao
1	Well ESTPs have Si as an ignored function. So while they should easily connect to their bodily sensations, it's usually subconsciously ignored for the sake Se or external stimuli. That said ESTPs are often very active and will be very brutal with their body without realizing it.\n\nBe careful because you might pay for it when you're older.

10	What types of conversation excite you most?	My dad is an ESTP.\n\nI go to the bar with him after work on Fridays, sometimes with co-workers, other times just the two of us.\n\nIf it's just us, there tends to be quite a few moments where I have no clue what the fuck to talk about.\n\n\~\n\nHis go-to topic is work, and we do talk about it quite a bit, but sometimes it feels more like a crutch than genuine bonding conversation.\n\nAlso, I try to ask questions, but they don't seem to engage much, like I'm not pushing the right buttons.\n\nSoooo I just want a better idea of what *types* of conversations are most fulfilling for ESTP, maybe from there I can gather some new topics to bring up, or some new approaches towards our chats.
10	talk about urself 
7	I like hearing about how someone's day or week went. Was anything out of the ordinary? 
3	I like talking about some unconventional stuff. I like arguing with people. Not like fighting. More like convince the other one about my opinion. I'm not sure, if it's good strategy for your father, but that's up to you. 
13	It’s good to find stuff I can recognise	I think this will be a long story... but it’s mostly a rant. Throwaway account. The beginning is introductory. I’m sure I can make my story shorter, but still.\n\nI’m 28, and about 7 months I had to do a mandatory professional personality test for work. They wanted to see what my strengths and weaknesses for the company were. At the time I was sliding towards a bore-out(burn out symptoms, but that’s because I was bored and stressed). I was working from home and moved to a completely different city on the other side of the country with no real close friends here.\n\nI learned I had an ESTP personality. Before this I considered those tests bullshit. Funny internet gimmicks to get my money. But with the professional we went more into: “What work would suit you? What gives you energy” and I started to recognise more and more.\n\nAll those talks were work-related, but I started to recognise more and more traits in my personal life. I am social, open, enthusiastic and.. let’s call it intense. I can imagine I am the type certain introverts find draining. However, everything developed into a complete bore-out, lost my job because of it... and now I find myself wanting to say yes to all my impulses.\n\nThere are certain problems I do find with my personality. Sexually I am basically up for anything, as long as I am not the sub. However, that part also got me in trouble a couple of times. I need to experience it all. Met a cute girl on the other side of the world... LDR wouldn’t work out, but I still wanted to visit her to stay in her bed and leave... It’s so stupid, but I am -that- impulsive and have this hang for adventure.\n\nI need people around me, but mostly people I can do real stupid shit with. I regret it every morning, but I have trouble saying no. I should learn how to, but every time I say: “That’s a problem for tomorrow”.\n\nI feel I have no good way of releasing all my energy... so I turn to love, lust and booze. The whole selfdestructive shenanigans. How do you all channel the whole extraverted need for adventure?(I was told this fits the personality).\n\nTL;DR: I recently got sick of stress and boredom and now find myself needing more adventure than I know is good for me.
5	I think we, too, are all drowning in love, lust, and booze. 
4	You write too much to be one lol\n\nJk join the club of alcoholic sex freaks, and say hi to the enfps who will probably go down in flames with you\n\nSource: my crazy bfs

17	Confused whether to make more friends or not	IDK if it's just me, but do you guys relate? \n\nIt seems like I'm on the edge whether I want to make more friends or not. At some point, I would love to have more friends because I enjoy having more company and knowing more people. But at the same time, I don't want to have more friends because I'd have too much attachments to keep track of.\n\nLike I get a bunch of messages from friends I have sometimes, but I can't type / message back all the time and I don't want to appear rude that I don't want to talk to them and stuff. I don't know, I mean I know I can just leave them and say I'm busy but to me that just feels cold, even colder if I just leave them in the dust, so I feel obligated to message them back and the cycle continues you know. Sometimes I just appear friendly to people that they naturally just want to talk to me and be friends/hang out but sometimes I just want to be alone. IDK\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo you guys relate and how do you figure it out? Thanks guys\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
6	I like making more friends but I just tell them I don't like texting.If I wanted to talk to them I initiate it
3	I can completely relate. There’s a certain charm to meeting someone, talk for a long time and after that no more obligations. I want to make lots of friends but it’s hard to... stay in touch.\n\nMy tip is to not be the initiator in “Want my cell?” Or anything. Just enjoy yourself. And when they do basically say: “I’m not much of a texter” or something. Lay the groundrules for new friends, you know. “Coffee/drink, I am yours... but I know I am no star in texting”
2	i can somewhat relate. i can appear friendly, i can also just put on my resting bitch face (& it’ll be easier). but i don’t feel socially accepted when i put on my RBF :/ & i keep wanting to get more friends. when i get more friends, i have fun in the beginning but i get sick of them soon after & reply only after 4-5 days. kind of ruined my rep.\n\ni suggest telling them directly that u have that habit of not wanting to text back all the time or sometimes want to be alone. that should fix the problem. communication is key. set things right at the start so that there won’t be any miscommunication. \n\nif u choose to avoid the problem (like i did previously), it will make them feel even worse about u (i’m sure ur Fe child won’t like that). it’s better to out right state it & risk looking like an idiot than hurt their feelings while also over complicating things\n\n
2	My Dad is a ESTP and he would make tons of friends.  But of course in his day, there was no texting(and not much phoning).  So he would be glad to see and talk to these friends when he would randomly meet them in public.  No problem in that day and age.\n\nMust be a way for the ESTP to function in modern society.  
2	About the feeling of being obligated to text back, I do completely relate and receiving their texts do sting for those who I don’t really want to. \n\nAbout figuring out whether to make more friends or not, nowadays I try (however selfish it may seem) to stick to the rule of whether I can see the potential of somehow gaining/benefiting by being their acquaintance. Although I often end up just making friends with them regardless, and the shitty loop goes on and on. 
1	Yes! I really have this but i don’t see this as a problem. I just don’t build a deep connection with new people anymore because i already have a bunch of good friends and i don’t have time for more. It’s sounds really practical but it’s the truth. Sometimes a make new friends if the are really special and i really enjoy their company. But also there a some really good friends that i lost. I also categorize them. A lot of just normal friends which i see a lot in school/soccer but not really good friends. It could be good friends if i hangout out with them but i don’t do this because of my time for my other friends.
1	If I weren't sure whether or not to get new friends, then I probably wouldn't. It's hard for me to make real new friends if I'm confused or stressed about my social/emotional state. If you really can make new friends with that confusion, then great, the more the merrier, but it would be hard for me to connect if I felt like I was neglecting other friends.
10	ESTP and ENTJ friendship!	i have an ESTP friend, and i had a blast hanging out with him today? the way he just blends with the enviroment and is confident in interacting with it is so fun and refreshing!\n\nhis reflexes and enviroment awareness were really impressive too!!!\n\ni think a difference between us is that, im better at interacting with people if theres a goal (e.g getting into a club, ordering something etc), while hes way better if its just for the sake of socializing\n\nso i want to know what ESTPs generally like and about ENTJs, and what they generally dislike, so ill have a better picture of our relationship!\n\n
8	Not about a goal, ENTJ just wants ego and money. ESTP gets it as a byproduct. \n\nMany of my best friends and people that have annoyed me with their stupid frigid rules are ENTJ. We have fun and they clean up gladly, they just care too much about how others view them.\n\nGood and bad. \nOne of them the Muslim boy who deflowered me and wouldn't marry me because I was no longer a virgin. Fuck him. He knew it was all bullshit but his desire to please and follow stupid rules is too much. Coward. 
10	Any ESTP guys on here, are you guys generally attracted to ENFP girls?	I often hear about INxJ/ENFP or xSxx/ESTP pairings, but frankly, stories with ESTP/ENFP are rare.\n\nIn the ENFP community, most are attracted to fellow intuitives especially INTJ to the point that it's become a comical stereotype that I simply cannot relate to and don't care for.\n\nMy closest ENFP friends and I have realized that most of the men in our lives that we're often attracted to and attract are xSTPs.\n\nHow would you guys rate ENFPs compared to other types that you're attracted to? And if you're repulsed by us, feel free to share and why as well. :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\*Edit: Lol at the downvotes. I can already guess who got butthurt and it's probably neither ENFPs nor ESTPs. 
13	Well I’m an ESTP and am currently seeing an enfp...so pretty attracted I suppose
6	Almost all the people I’ve dated are ENFP/INFP and I’ve been dating an ENFP for 2.5 years now. I guess I’m also seeing a pattern ahahaha.
6	to be completely honest I can find myself attracted to anyone personality wise who isn't a J, and even then I can make a lot of exceptions. As long as you're not going to make me your therapist and you're okay with spontaneous, last minute adventures (even to the corner store) and are okay with not planning everything I'll probably at least consider ya. I'm an ESTP bi dude so I think I fill your preferred criteria pretty well, hahah.
5	I would rate ENFPs middle of the pack to upper level relationship status depending on various factors like shared values, intelligence etc. I seem to attract ENFPs like a moth to a flame or some metaphor especially in socioeducational settings like College as well as parties etc. If you're either one you'd ideally want to show genuine interest early and often if you want to pursue a real relationship and generally talk a lot about how you guys feel about a lot of stuff which the ENFPs love but really drain the ESTP. ESTP like being in control and many times the ENFP likes to wrestle that control away and ESTPs don't really like to manipulate so we let yall do your thing but eventually we need it back. Many times there are increasing levels of selfishness in this regard from either sides so that should be noted and addressed before it can cause real damage to trust levels that can then only be repaired after a period of time (can be years). ESTPs love being analytical not unlike intps not that we don't make logical mistakes but many times those mistakes are due to external factors. Also love playfully stroking our egos hehe. Enfps are straight airheads most of the time so we really have to make sure that balloon stays full of air for the benefit of both parties. Also it's a big plus if you guys can connect on some deeper spiritual or philanthropic level. ESTPs are generally really popular everywhere and care somewhat about their social status so just try not to embarrass them, that can cause them to become resentful or pissed off. We are also constantly trying to improve/elevate thanks to aux ti so you may soon realize that you can become woefully unprepared to handle the awesomeness that we can/will become. Just sayin
2	In Socionics, these two types share an ego relation (described here: http://www.socionics.com/rel/ego.htm) . The functions between them are reversed and inverse - which ultimately makes teamwork hard. And if you're aiming for a serious long-term partnership, teamwork is what you need. This kind of relation is like the equivalent of asking about an INFJ and ISTJ being good partners and why you rarely hear of it. The values are just... different.\n\nAnecdotally, speaking as a dual-partner to ESTPs, their willpower and "alpha"-ness is very strong (extroverted sensing) and wants admiration (tertiary Fe). I haven't really met any ENFPs that respect that Se in the way I see an ESTP needing it. But, again, I'm no ESTP I'm just experienced with 'em
2	My last two boyfriends have been ENFP and I've never had a better time to be honest. We just get each other on so many levels. Finally found the ones that not just get me or tolerate me but accept me and we can just live. Learning how to love them and let them be free, was never used to someone equally free as me. Will report as my latest relationship develops. 
2	Well it’s just casual so far she’s leaving for a six month internship in about a month. I can see where we might clash for example she’s not near the risktaker/thrillseeker I am but in general we communicate pretty well. I’m not really an expert on all the functions and what not so if you want an in depth breakdown from that sort of perspective I’m the wrong guy but I’d be happy to answer any question you have if I can
2	ENFPs are my favorite type

12	Do you deal with loneliness often? How do you get through it?	
13	This a problem for me. I need A LOT of social interaction. \n\nIf I'm home alone for more than 2 nights in a week I start feeling lonely and depressed. I make sure to spend a lot of time with my friends or boyfriend (but we just broke up this morning). \n\nUsually when I'm single I line up dates for almost every night. For the first time in a while I feel like I want to just take some time to reflect and focus on self improvement and my hobbies/art.
8	I’m extremely independent and also very satisfied with the way I am, so I refuse to change even slightly to satisfy anyone else. I live for myself and myself only. Because of that, I end up losing a lot of friendships and romantic relationships. It’s a pretty lonely way to live, and it can be rough, but at the end of the day I’d rather be myself and be alone than fake my personality and change for others, because the reality is that I’m the only person who is 100% guaranteed to be in my life. I don’t think you can ever fully rely on anyone to stick around and be there for you, so what sense does it make to change who you are to please others? I think as long as you are pleased with who you are and can look in the mirror at the end of the day and be satisfied, that’s all that really matters. You will always have yourself, so be somebody that you can love. 
7	I had this irrational fear of being alone and failing in life , these two used to be my nightmare and I would do anything to avoid it but I had repressed it so much that I had to embrace it at one point in my life and first become comfortable with the idea of  being a failure and being alone. Now I’m comfortable with both,  it’s weird but it isn’t that bad it’s actually very  balanced than  what I was before ,introspection and self awareness are good tools to have for someone like us whose life can be quite fast to even notice what’s happening within us. But too much alone time is detrimental too  as I can dig myself in some deep rabbit hole.  \n\nIt was thrilling to face both these fears and embrace them  actually loved going towards something that was threatening  me and to finally make peace with it. 
5	I love being alone. \n\n\nMy true personality comes out when I have money and am at a party where I can be as loud as I can (my place).\n\nIf I could I would live alone the rest of my life but I've come to realize that I need to interact with people in order to maintain my mental health at a optimal level.\n\nOnly women that I'm in a relationship with I can tolerate the most.\n\n\nI realize that I'm lonely when I start to dream that I'm either hanging out with friends or with a love interest. Usually legal and illegal drugs fix that for a moment
6	If I'm being forced to stay inside, alone, for more than 2 days I start getting anxious.\n\nHow I get through it is by going outside (walking, jogging). It is possible for me to replace social interaction with online, but I start getting more frustrated because I prefer meeting people in real life and interacting with them face-to-face and going places.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the off-chance I can't go outside for more than 2 days, I go on the internet and try to be productive with a project or something to keep me occupied. I usually blast loud/exciting music (eurobeat, rock) to help my mind wander and let me relax. Sometimes I even read self-improvement novels, or start reading about philosophy or other questions I have in my mind on what to do. Eventually at some point I'll figure out a solution to my loneliness, and that is usually finding a way to get outside (if in the case I'm ever restricted to, which is terrible).
2	Meditation. Yoga. Prayer. Etc. Realize that we desperately need these because of our inferior Ni. Otherwise we will be stressed, jittery, anxious, and not our true honest natural selves. Also sooner is better than later.
2	As an ESFP I used to be socially needy as a teenager, but now I enjoy my alone time a lot more and don't worry about always getting someone to go out with
7	ESTP Veterans: What did you do career-wise after military service?	My husband's an ESTP and wants to get out of the Army (Infantry) after 7 years in. What led you to get out and what are you doing now? How was the transition from military life to civilian life for you? \n\nHe's seen combat and has had 3 deployments. \n\nHe's interested in sustainable living/tiny homes/earth ships/survival skills/weapons.
5	I work for a company called Colors On Parade , we do automotive paint repair , both the work and customer relations are a great fit for artisans especially ESTP \nThey also have a great program for veterans.\ncolorsonparade.com
16	Sex	Does anyone else really not have a specific fetish as much as theyre open to trying anything your partner suggests?
10	Open but not to all things. I draw the line on being a sub. I'll try almost anything once but there is no desire whatsoever in subbing. 
4	Yes! I am a fiend to please, especially when my sexual partner says something in particular gets them more excited. For example, one will only have sex if I’m wearing my work heels. Easy demand, I say yes every time even when it’s not hotter or easier for me. I sometimes wonder if I’m a pushover for agreeing to this but it’s like .... the demand is easily fulfilled, why risk my chances of getting laid ? \n\nThere’s a few crazier things in the bag I will to try with a partner when they receive my suggestions positively. 
2	i dont have any fetishes but im really kinky and am really open to a lot. only things i wont do are anything with kids, corpses, animals, feet, vomit, or scat. otherwise im essentially an open book and will definitely try anything at least once
6	How to choose career for ESTP?	Man i m studying machine learning and thinking to build a career in it and have a computer degree. As an ESTP, i im into mid life crisis and finding it very difficult to choose a forward career path. And even in my head pops some noise as "something leadership" always from time to time. ESTP has pursuasion word written all over it and even my dad is sales manager. It also embaffeles me to huge extent that although i watched many netflix shows like GOT, Fargo etc but why do i from time to time just watch sherlock again and again and again and even never get bored. Even\nI just want some advice from other fellow ESTP's man how they are approaching life paths and keeping options open.\nI just dont know what to do!( and it really goes into my veins and head these thoughts of wasting time)\nAlso how is maths for ESTP, i mean deep maths because ML and AI is all maths and how we are into field of research.\nI also find studying about entrepreneurship fascinating but if at time we dont have ideas popping how to be one.\nI also think ESTP are psychopaths or sociopaths.\nGrateful for any tips about choosing careers!
3	Are you able to focus enough on research and deep learning/math to enjoy that career? The most important thing you can do is just choose something. Don’t get stuck analyzing all your options. Choose something. Change if you need to. Leadership will come naturally in any role. 
2	choose what makes you money and then pursue your passion

1	I went to uni to become a teacher, did not pay attention, failed a class. Said fuck it apprentiship here I Come. \n\nGot a Job shift maneger Job after apprentiship, 60 people daytime 30 people evening at the sausage factory, Loved it big Numbers and pressure.\n\nGot tired of it after a few years changed to departement manager at a chicken factory. Loved it! For 1 Year, then I had to mive my line to the other side of the country.\n\nSaid fuck it, am now studying to become a high school teacher at restaurant and foodmanufactoring (Norwegian system), and got a Job at my local high school. After I finish I guess I will do it for a few years, maybe take some math to be able to do more later.\n\nI have a 5 Year plan, goals that can be messured "start an education" "care for my marriage" and a few projects. And points on how to do it "I would like to study, teaching or economics/leadership"... It can be broken, but it gives me a focus without beeing locked down.\n\nEverytime I start something I have a frame for how long the minimum time I have invested in it. New Job, I finish school in 2 years, then I can quit if I want to, or stay. But I know everything but my wife and children have a date I can say "FUCK IT, IM OUT" and start Looking around.\n\nThe beauty of this is that I always have my feelers out for something better/cooler and still not Looking like a quiter at my CV. So put on your big boy pants, stop whining and aim for all grades to be A. Become better push yourself, compete against the best you! That is how you stay focused, that is how you win in your own game. Become better, life is a game to crush! 
7	Confused of if I’m a ENTP or ESTP	Could someone please give examples of what distinguishes them? I usually get results as an ENTP but most tests are rigged to the N side instead of S so I’m confused. I tend to take crazy risks like an ESTP but I am always in my head and have trouble paying attention to things because I’m daydreaming. I also an vey honest and straightforward. I am pretty good at puzzles and figuring things out.
6	I'm sort of in the same boat. Have had entp, entj, then estp as results. I tend to think the latter is correct because I'm very sensory. I love to touch things, eat good food and am very good at sensing other people, moods and ambiences. Often in customer meetings I have a wildly different opinion about the outcome than my colleagues because I pay more attention to how they behave rather than what they actually said.\n\nNow, almost everyone enjoy a great meal, but while my peers say it's good I'm having a fucking orgasm in my mouth.\n\nThe thing that puts me the most off with the entp type is the devil's advocate thing. That role is simply not me and something I never do. Also debating is tiresome and often boring. I manage 30 people at work and I don't have time for that stuff.
3	Do you find it hard to stay on topic when you discuss something?\n\nAre you able to focus on one topic and reach a conclusion?\n\nDoes gathering your thoughts become energizing to you?\n\nDo you find it easy to figure out the best method for yourself?\n\nIn honesty, your strike me as an ESTP and I'll tell you why when you answer my questions
3	Pretty easy to distinguish. I'd think ESTP or ESFP would be easier to confuse.
2	Try carefully reading through socionics profiles and seeing which ones you identify with. These are more detailed than MBTI ones which makes it easier to figure out your type.    \n     \n[ESTP by Gulenko](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=SLE_Profile_by_Gulenko) | [ESTP by Stratiyevskaya](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/42478) | [ESTP subtypes](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/6796-Two-subtypes-of-SLEs-ESTps-which-one-are-you?p=129978&viewfull=1#post129978)   \n\n[ENTP by Gulenko](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=ILE_Profile_by_Gulenko) | [ENTP by Stratiyevskaya](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/42487) | [ENTP subtypes](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/1727-ILE-ENTp-Subtypes?p=35818&viewfull=1#post35818)   \n
14	Angry at people sometimes?	IDK if it's just me, but do you guys sometimes get irrationally angry at people when you have nothing else to do? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSometimes I sit by myself, then start observing people, then start getting mad at how many dumb people exist in the world. Then start worrying about how many more people are going to exist, how the world is going to get overpopulated and how everything is going to turn chaotic and we're not really doing anything much about it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nExample mini story:\n\n1) Told to sit and wait in the car alone\n\n2) After probably almost an hour of fidgeting, get bored and start thinking about stuff\n\n3) Observe girl buying a starbucks with a mac laptop, typical\n\n4) Get mad that she bought an overpriced cup of coffee and laptop with a terrible OS \[but not as bad as win10 tbf\]\n\n5) Worry that millions more of these kinds of people exist, start thinking that people must be really dumb\n\n6) See traffic and lots of people honking to get to work, start thinking existentially and get mad about working \~20 years to pay off a house these days (in California), and student loan debt and we are still complacent about this.\n\n7) \[insert more angry angst here\]\n\n8) Gets pumped up, but then gets back home and chills out when I find something to do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know it sounds edgy, but I'm not actually a person to think about these kinds of stuff (only when I'm bored). I think it's a demon thing for ESTPs to be left alone with nothing to do. If I get this mad because I'm bored idk about you guys? \n\nType if you relate fam
6	Can't relate. Would be annoyed if the starbucks girl was a caffeine addict though since its a crutch. Would get annoyed if people aren't aware of their surroundings and are blocking the stairway/street or walking slow
2	When I'm bored, I usually think about my personal problems. In this time the craziest solutions come to my mind. And I see them actually like a good one. But often I'm tired of people and than get angry. I love company. But sometimes people around me are too sensitive and they complain about every little thing, take things too personally and die in their own misery. In this moment they expect, that I'll give them my energy. It's so tiring. Then I get frustrated and I start to be angry and mean to this people. 
1	Ahahaha
1	Lol yeah I do but you just sound like a poorfag teenager. 
1	Seems like you usually use your Ni. INFJ here
5	Se-Fe loop advantages	What's a good way to take advantage of this loop aka our most extroverted functions in daily life
1	I dont even know bro. Fe loops makes us crave attention like a douche.
1	Go to a bunch of parties, bars, and social gatherings\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou'll make connections but not any meaningful ones, but you never know  
12	Tried to date one of you...	Met an ESTP many moons ago, loved his energy and mannerisms, his clear strengths in social situations (met him while he was bartending), but also his ability to offer new perspectives and explanations for patterns in the world, not as well as myself but... not too shabby either. He has a strong intellectual side. Just an interesting human. Ended up being so enamored that I gave him my number (very unusual for me, just thought he was so great). To provide some context here, I was also 100% sober. So yeah, enamored!\n\nWe talked over text for a while & went on a date. I wasn’t sure how it went since I’m introverted & I was super nervous. Didn’t have alcohol to help me because I don’t drink. \n\nAfter the date he listed future days he’d be free, told me he thought of me as exceptionally smart and pretty, asked me what I thought of him, and seemed to want to keep things going.\n\nHe kept mentioning grabbing coffee & then rendezvousing to Bloomingdales to help him pick out a new winter coat. He’d literally been talking about it for days and called me the day of to set up concrete plans, but then called me to say something came up — a “meeting” that sounded more like “bar with friends” to my ears. He works in the music industry, so it could very well have been a legit meeting in a casual setting, but it seemed off to me. \n\nI was disappointed but tried to be understanding. I had already gotten ready. He gave me the option to meet later that day when he could get away from his other stuff, so I set that up & waited for hours for him to show, thinking he would follow through since he was texting me updates. He never did.\n\nWhen the first thing out of his mouth the next day wasn’t an apology but a bunch of excuses that very much sounded like lies, I ended things. I sited not being able to see someone casually or otherwise who doesn’t respect my time & energy, and who can’t apologize with sincerity when they are in the wrong. \n\nI really think he thought I’d be cool. But the inconsiderateness (and probable dishonesty) got to me. I think he thought he could do whatever he wanted that day and then talk himself out of the situation the next day. It killed my attraction to him overnight. He tried to keep in touch with me & I stopped texting him.\n\nEdit: Damn. Didn’t realize that was so long before I posted. Guess I had a lot to get off my chest.\n\nTD;LR: Met a cool ESTP, thought things were going well, ended things because I was concerned with his lack of follow through and inconsiderateness. I guess I’m looking for insight? Or just commiseration. 🙃
7	I feel guilty because I've totally done this. He could just have trouble actually following through with plans. I can totally relate to that. Sometimes I just kinda don't feel like going out, even if I've made plans. I'm not going to do something if I don't feel like it at that time, but I do feel guilty when I flake on plans. Planning things out isn't really my thing, although I really can't speak for other ESTPs. 
9	This sounds really rude of him, so I don’t blame you. Good on you for respecting your time early on.  
4	OP, maybe your personality type could give us some insight. What is it?
4	He may have had other obligations come up that ran over time.  He may have felt meh about going shopping as the day went on. He may have lost track of time. Could be anything. \n\nIt wasn't a date with dinner reservations.  He called you the day of, told you there was  a change of plans, then texted you updates and called you the next day, and tried to keep in touch after.  How familiar are you with the type?  Sticking to social plans is  exactly  the opposite of what we're known for.
2	I'm married to this type. He went out of his way not to be like this . . . on my birthday. The other 364 days of the year, all bets are off.\n\nThey seem to be spontaneous and flow with the moment. It's great if they're with you and you're sharing the moment. He taught me to be happy, so it was worth the annoyance, for me.
2	No type is more trustworthy than the next
1	Did he maybe think you were taking it too seriously? If he felt under pressure to do something serious he might have just felt too uncomfortable. Just a thought. 
1	What type are you? This happened to me, too, but not on a date, just as a friend he bailed on me. Said he'd be at a certain place at a certain time, then when I texted where is he, he didn't respond for days or months. He just says whatever he wants, then doesn't follow through. Wtf is up with that? That's so stupid. He has charisma in person, but there's no point being friends with him if he can't even follow a plan, like wtf, that just kills his whole reputation. I've seen him as a liar in more than this just one instance, too. Is this an ESTP trait, or just some shitty cultural trait? Like saying you'll do something when you're there with the person, just so you won't have to say "no" to them, as if that is supposed to spare their feelings, yet actually does the opposite and makes it even worse when your trust is betrayed. 
-1	u were too easy, lost interest
0	My dad is an ESTP	All of my siblings and other family members have tried to figure out why he is 100% okay with saying something negative about someone, but as soon as anyone else says the same exact thing about said person, he will literally defend that person and treat them to be the underdog. \n\nAnd that’s not the only thing he does, he’s always trying control the conversation. We could be saying the same exact thing, BUT he will argue it and try to make a point, while you’re standing there, thinking “I literally just said this.” \n\nHelp me understand this part of his personality, please. I understand cognitive functions really well. I just haven’t gone that much in depth with his type, yet. 
5	Sounds more like ENTP, my guy.
5	Are you sure he doesn't just have a narcissistic personality disorder? This doesn't sound like an ESTP trait??? Or am I wrong?
3	?
3	My dad is very similar to this, (ESTP according to the 16 personalities test) and I came to this sub to try to understand him better, cause the same issues confuse/frustrate me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nControls the narrative of situations.\n\nUnwilling to listen to conflicting opinions, and doesn't want to hear them (literally shuts down the conversation)\n\nWill still get upset that your "unwilling to understand/listen where he's coming from."\n\n(But you effing are listening...you're just giving an alternate opinion)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUses things against you for millennia, however if you bring up something he's done you're being "unfair, and need to let things go"\n\nJust impossibly contradictory, and denies or acts blind to all these contradictions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI work with him, and strangely he seems to be capable of extreme empathy, understanding, and open-mindedness in a professional environment, just not a familial one. It's kinda mind-fucky, and it confuses my other family members as well.\n\nInteresting to see a lot of people saying this isn't an ESTP thing.
2	?
1	He also discourages big picture ideas, wants to make sure you keep an eye on the little things. 
4	Keeping a global view	Anyone else get the sinking feeling that the entire world isn't right rn and not necessarily fubar but with a general lack of direction and the current state is sort of unacceptable and needs to be saved..
8	Not really. I think that people are getting way too sensitive
4	I blame liberals
3	I think it's just always like that. Like really, when was it ever not fucked up? It can only be fucked up because people think it is. So, I'm not sure how wise it is to want to "save" the world. Just make the most of it, ya know?
2	Come join us at r/zerowaste to save it
7	Smoke?	Almost every ESTP i Know vapes or smokes regularly. Does this just happen to be the ones I know? Haha they also start drinking very early in the morning and I love it
8	I have never smoked, and I never will. \nDrinking however is reserved for after 5pm, and shall be consumed in excessive amounts 
6	I think, it's not about the personality. Like I 'm ESTP and smoking is so adominate for me. I also start drinking later than my generation. I think, it's more about upbringing in childhood. Chlidern, whose are held very straight, has more tendencies to do something banned. 
5	I feel there is two types of ESTPs.\n1. The party type (prolly smokes)\nOr the\n2. Sporty type (doesnt smoke)\n\nSo depending on which you are..\nMy BF is a cyclist ( and ESTP), he has never touched a cigarette. I do however know some ESTPs who smoke
5	I'm not extroverted and I do a bit more than smoke.
3	true
2	no i was raised as an intx
2	I've never been able to afford to smoke lol. Its cool as shit though, might start in the future. I'll smoke weed though no problem. 
1	Used to, not anymore. Recovering alcoholic though. Us and ENFPs are in recovery, see them there all the time.

2	I would've expected this to be in r/intp
5	Need sex advice for estp	Help! I'm an INFP newly married to ESTP husband. When we were dating we had a lot of sex. He couldn't keep his hands off me and typically had an erection any time we were near each other. Lol. I thought our sex drives were a good match. \n\nWe abstained for a while before marriage and it was really difficult. We talked about having sex after marriage, fantasies, doing it "like rabbits" (his words) etc. He knew I wanted it every day. I would kind of joke about that and he would always say "no" but I figured it would be like earlier in our relationship when we had it several times a week, sometimes every day.  \n\nWell, we didn't have sex on our wedding night. Then only a couple of times that first week and he seemed like he didn't really want to do it. I was confused so a week into our marriage I told him it seemed like he didn't want it as much as me so what did he want me to do? Should I initiate? (He has always said prior to marriage he would love for me to do that.)  He got kind of mad about it and said he was aware how much I wanted it and we shouldn't talk about it. I ended up crying and he left me to go sleep on the couch!  Then I was afraid to bring it up.  We've talked a little bit since then but I dont want to say too much and push him away.  Mentioning sex at all seems to turn him off. Like I dont even think I could send him a flirty text or pics.\n\nI don't initiate because if I start touching him he will stop me. He doesn't like to kiss. So I just suppress my desires so I dont go crazy and I wait until he is ready. Then I have to get turned on quickly because he is fast and aggressive.  Sometimes it's hard for me to finish due to lack of foreplay and he gets frustrated because he could be done in a few minutes.  So that adds to the problem.\n\nI'm trying to figure out how to get him back to his normal sex loving ESTP self. If he would allow me to initiate I could get him going but he seems almost stubborn about not having sex as often as I'd like. A couple of times he has seemed to relax a bit and acts like himself (sex 2 days in a row, maybe 3x a week) then we go a few weeks only having sex once a week. \n\nI think some of it is that he is under a lot if pressure from all the added responsibilities but he puts a lot of pressure on himself. I have a hard time getting him to relax. But I don't know what to do about that. \n\nDo you have any advice? 
6	You might want to try r/deadbedrooms instead. Some people lose interest after marriage, like the “chase” is gone— seems like a semi-common theme over on that sub. Is there anything particularly stressful going on in his life currently, that could cause a loss of libido. Bottom line is communication is key here, you have to talk about it. Therapy sounds like a good idea, the sooner the better lest you wake up ten years from now stuck in a miserable marriage. 
4	Hiii, I am an ESTP male dating an INFP female for a little over a year and a half. I would like to start by saying my gf is amazing and has taught me new-found appreciation for INFPs and for people who empathize naturally.. which we ESTPs do not....\n\nI was wondering the timeline of your relationship? The thing about ESTP fantasies is they are much bigger and doable in our heads than reality usually permits..\n\nWhy didn’t you have sex on your wedding night...? That seems off.. Also, when I was in college and had a friends with benefits situation going on, once every 1.5 weeks was what I preferred. It didn’t start that way, but that’s eventually where it ended up via my choice. Also also, he left you to go sleep on the couch after he made you cry?! I hope he can learn to appreciate the times you are actually willing to divulge your inner feelings to him. Those divulgences are hard to come by and should be cherished, even if they are hard for the ESTP to comprehend and swallow. Keep sharing your feelings no matter how they make him feel !!! Stay strong and get what you want !!
3	He's probably going through stress and anxiety. Does he go to the gym at all? Yoga would help too. But estp loses desire when he is locked into a cage with strict boundaries. Maybe his job, or maybe you guys need a vacation, that always helps reset the mind of an estp. Also maybe try being aggressive overly so if possible, that will excite him more than anything, gotta tap into that tert si and be ferocious. But remember that is just the ignition when he gets started give him the keys to the ferrari. Try and make it look as attractive as possible, maybe do light workouts to tone your body. As long as he is a normal functioning adult he won't need to relax that is not the estp way lol
-1	tap into your evolutionary side. FEEL your energy ramping up, feed off his energy, feed it into yours. fuck like rabbits, don't think about anything and just let nature take its course while you engage in the most intimate thing a man and woman can do.   \n\n\nif hes being lame and isnt doing his job, then do yours better. he will mimic your energy, vice versa 
4	Career for ESTP	Hi! I'd like to ask you about your jobs. Why are you heated in?  I have to choose, what I want to study and I'm pretty lost. I'm grateful for any tip. 
5	Try to do something which is applicable to the real world.\n\nI studied biochemistry at first, but dropped out due to it being too abstract. I switched to Biology, more practical and easier to focus, since a lot of things you learn by hands-on experience.
4	Hey! Right now I’m an account manager for a food vending company in San Francisco. I enjoy interacting with my clients and handing day to day operations. I’m studying accounting because I enjoy the logic and real world applications. One day I’d like to manage my own firm or run my own business. 
2	Hello, I am a UC Berkeley English Graduate and a hard ESTP. Don’t think I would have gotten my degree without my father’s (INFJ) planning and persistence.. At least not at the age I did. I am a manager at an In-N-Out Burger and while I do enjoy the work (fast-paced, structured, people-oriented), I do not enjoy the schedule (days, nights, weekends). I just passed the English CSET multiple choice tests and am waiting to hear back on the two essay tests. Eventually I would like to be an English teacher, first High School, then Community College. I’ve learned to love school and am terribly excited at the prospect of returning. I plan to tutor English whilst there, as well as run some bar karaoke nights, a part-time position for which I have been offered, but cannot commit to due to my schedule.

1	Mechanic in the military. Stationed in Europe. \n\nIt’s good. I like the culture. Could use some more freedom though. 
3	What do ESTP girls think about INTJ guys	
11	I’m an ExTP \n\nSome of them are really funny and have the same “no filter” humor that I do. Some are pompous assholes who have nothing better to do than bitch about what everyone else is doing wrong. Personally it really depends on the person — if we’re hanging out in the first place then that means I don’t care about whatever personality flaws you may have— we all have things about us that piss other people off, I’m not gonna fault anyone for that 
6	Hahah hmmm... I am always attracted to INTJ guys but they are a lot of dramaaaa. No offense. They tend to like to spill all their life details onto me and I'm like oh gosh... help. I know people say INTJs are cold but I haven't found that to be true. I really do appreciate how they are very direct and unafraid of talking about difficult subjects. In fact, I credit my INTJ ex for encouraging me to communicate better in relationships. 
3	Insecure and jealous of our popularity. If they got over it things would be great
2	Well, I can't comment on the chemistry between you and the person you're eyeing up. What I can say is that I click really well with INTJs for whatever reason. I've met one INTJ woman, I definitely liked her, but for specific reasons not to do with personality type, I never tried to make a move. So I guess there's no reason to think an ESTP girl wouldn't be attracted to an INTJ guy's personality type.
2	I’ve had a couple INTJ friends and some relationships with them.\n\nI personally find them very interesting and intelligent individuals. What I like is how they can defend their beliefs adequately and also appreciate lots of non PC humor and be willing to go out and explore/experiment. They can be helpful and provide me honest feedback and perceive things that I can’t (how I’m behaving, what seems to be bothering me, inconsistencies in me, etc.). I love it when the loosen up, let go, and have fun! I find them to be dependable people and true to their words. They are good at judging things as well. Overall, we generally have great chemistry.\n\nThe bad parts is that sometimes they can be very defensive or stuck up about their opinions being right and it ends up being a huge argument over who is ignorant and who isn’t. Some INTJs keep a lot of stuff inside and just explode whenever, so be careful. Also you have to respect their personal space, and their tendencies (arrive early please) or they will lose respect for you. Some can like u/sosnazzy said be pompous assholes which is annoying. But overall I think INTJs are really nice it’s just the rough exterior they have but internally they are all fuzzy and warm (if you point this out to an INTJ, they will start getting defensive but we know it’s true :p)
2	Had a weird relationship with one for something like 3 years. Posted about it in r/intj, you can check my history. Bottom line: we aren't in contact anymore, his mind was too closed. Had we actually spoken about things we would be perfect, but alas his ego. 
2	Most of my friends are INTJ or INTP. Not sure why I gravitate to them, we just get along well. Depends on the person, but the ones I know are really easy for me to get along with.
1	I know a couple of INTJs. They are usually quite pompous/condescending. Really fun and interesting at first, but when you begin to see through that, it's not fun at all anymore. In my experience, they're actually quite insecure which is why they seem so insanely awesome and exicint up front. They front load all the things they think make them cool and then when you hear those stories 50 more times over the friendship, it get's boring. They don't seem to actually be going out and doing much. I'm out in the world living and don't want to hear old stories over and over again. \n\nedit: I'm an ESTP female and have known these things to be true for both genders of INTJ. 
10	At what age did everything just start clicking for you?	
8	probably like 24. 4 years later and shits still clicking though. I'm kinda pissed and bitter no one taught me how to win at life while I was growing up. I'm having to figure it out on my own but if I'd have known what I know now 15 years ago I would've been a powerhouse.
3	Pretty much just this summer. Was 20, now I'm 21. Yeah, I've got a lot left to figure out, but I would say it's "clicked". 
2	around 22 for me. \nhad a breakup that made me take a hard look at myself and made a lot of positive changes to my life\n\nthe introduction of psilocybin mushrooms to my life at 24 also made a lot of things click.
1	Literally the moment I turned 23 and that was last week 
1	At 23, which was this year, it clicked that I was ESTP. Still don't know what career I want
7	What do ESTPs think about ISFPs?	kinda curious. 
5	I dunno about anyone else, but I personally find them pretty alright. They're usually fairly chill, though I've not met very many. Fi is weird though, I can't even get my head around it man.
4	ESTPs generally get along. \n\nISFPs can turn into cunts real quick though. Same with INFPs. \n
3	I’ve had 2 mother in-laws both were ISFP, they’re very interesting and adventurous when getting their way and very haughty, self righteous , and self centered when unhappy with their life situations.
1	one of my closest friends is an isfp. i think they have just the right amount of differences but similarities to where we can at least get along
1	Their awesome 
1	They are morally righteous at all times, I am not
1	Not devoid of positives but easily hurt and hard to communicate with, but that’s just my personal opinion
1	I like them far too much for my own good. Though I'm not sure all ESTPs are gonna feel the same way.
1	I don’t like em.\n\n
6	Vincent Swan from White Gold	I've been watching the BBC show White Gold and I'm trying to understand what MBTI type he is. I thought that he could be an ESTP. What are your thoughts?
19	Girl ESTPs?	Yo where the girl ESTPs at? \n\nI’ve actually never met one, and just wanted to know if any are on here! \n\nIf you are, just wondering. Do guys find your personality attractive? I feel like my ESTP type draws a lot of men to me because we’re generally adventurous and fun and pretty blunt and low drama, but I’m not sure if anyone else has noticed this in regards to gender. \n\nAlso this post is not to sound conceited! We definitely have weaknesses as a type too. Just wanted to know if any other girl ESTPs read this and want to discuss the life experience of being a rare type, in regards to dating but also just other things as well since I feel like our type doesn’t lead us to follow our traditional gender role. 
9	Met an estp girl a couple months ago. Instantly it's like we knew each other. Exactly like me but in a female form I swear. It's not that I found her looks attractive, although they were incredible, it was her personality I was drawn to..
6	I'm an ESTP female. I definitely get the sense that men can be into me regarding the "bro" side of my personality, but I am typically the one to decide if the relationship will be romantic or not, and I make that decision clear and stick to it. I can be very charming and bluntly flirtatious, but if I am not romantically interested, I will act extremely casual and uninviting to romantic advances.\n\n  \nI have an unreal number of platonic male friends. I love to hang out with "frat bro" types because they're fun as hell and are always down for anything, but don't find them necessarily challenging to me intellectually, or make me reconsider my perspective on...anything. So as a result I've dated social but nerdy engineers, consistently. I guess I just find them really interesting? I can't say. I love hanging with girls too, but we don't always care about the same things, and even if I enjoy partying with them a lot, they don't  seem fulfilled with my disinterest in basic girl stuff lol, so we drift easily.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn regards to dating history, I dated two super respectable ESTJs long-term pretty successfully, had one VERY fast-paced/fast-ending relationship with an ESFJ, and got really caught up on a brilliant and wildly fascinating ENTP (to this day still kind of am...the challenge, I guess). We had very similar values but our communication styles caused massive problems and we fought all the time, which is super not normal for me. Dude seriously made me crazy, beware of ENTPs lol.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn general, and this may DEFINITELY be flawed, I feel like I could get anyone I wanted if I really set my mind to it. Could be part of just being a woman. When a bf and I break up, I always find someone new pretty easily. But yeah, the "unique" ones are the only ones I ever actually seem to be interested in...but they aren't as fun or easy going?...it's an eternal struggle. In true ESTP fashion I have no fkn clue what I want 
7	I'm here!  I'd say people do tend to find my personality attractive, sadly they usually don't find my appearance quite so attractive . . . But I've always had a wide friend group, both men and women, and my male friends often describe me as being "like one of the guys."
6	I’m ESTx and I feel like I just seem to attract cocky or creepy shy guys… it’s probably just me :(
6	I’m an 24f ESTP time and time again. I would say that a lot of men find me attractive and charming and it’s flattering to a certain point. The point is when you’re not interested in dating or hooking up and the men take that as a challenge. I’m generally a kind person so when these advances come my way, it takes some emotional energy to let that person know that I’m not available and I probably won’t be for a while. \n\nMy relationship experiences have mostly been longer term, and I try to really get to know the person that I’m dating. I feel your dating history OP, that’s about the same as me. I find really intelligent people attractive and I like people who come off as very unique.
4	I'm a female ESTP! Yeah, guys are often drawn to me because I'm so "blunt and down to hangout." But being down to hangout gets me in trouble cause sometimes guys like to assume you're down for... anything... when I'm really actually not smh. A lot of people say I'm really easy to talk to and they feel comfortable around me. I'm usually drawn to unique guys as well. When basically any guy can be drawn to you, only the unique ones are interesting lol. 
2	I don't know how to properly type so I don't know if I've met one
2	I’m 20f ESTP-A! \nMost guys seem to really enjoy how confident I am. Eg: I lead the date (pick the restaurant, decide what to order, drop hints about what I want etc). \nI’m very outgoing and talkative, and all of my tinder dates compliment how they feel like I’m really easy to get along with. \n\nMy boyfriend is great, he handles me taking on too much, or working late, or being the host of the party and not seeing him very often, really well. I think we’re a good match because there’s literally no gender roles in our relationship. He does the dishes, I build the flat pack furniture, (and if I need a work out, he’ll let me squat him haha). \n\nWe made a loose verbal agreement that he’d stay at home and look after the kids (if we have them in the future), while I run my own business. \n\nSomething that I’d love to ask the other female ESTPs is; \nDo you find it hard to find/make friends that you admire?\n\nI know I’m very young, which can make it hard for me to find people that have that same ‘need to succeed’ complex I think a lot of ESTP have. Most of my friends always complement me and admire how hard I work, but I can never find young people who I can look up to! 
2	Yes absolutely they find my personality attractive.\n\nI’m actually an ESTPf (20) and I have a lot of guy friends because of it. I don’t actively look for guy friends, I’m actually just friendly with everyone. But it’s just that the people I’m with tend to be guys because we share the same hobbies and attitude (computers, video games, business, drifting cars, hiking, etc). \n\nOf my relationships, the types that tend to fall for me tend to ironically be IxTJs. But they comment that I’m very honest, chill, and not afraid to defend myself, intellectually stimulating to them, and a savage meme master. It’s just communication issues where it ends up not working out because we have different standards for each other and I’m still in college so I have to push them away sometimes :/\n\nAnyways hopefully this helps anyone\nStill looking for an ENTPm though LOL 
4	here yo! I have a female best friend who’s ESTP and she rocks.  \n\nMale ESTPs are usually annoying dicks and love themselves way too much. I can’t trust them because I know how they think. They’re fun tho until they’re annoying 
1	Also yes love to discuss dating experiences, in the absolute WOAT 
1	ESTP woman here. Hell yes, men still find my personality attractive (I’m 55). I hate drama, but love excitement. I’m happily in an open relationship with my INFP partner.\n\nLike others posting here, I have lots of male friends (am totally “one of the guys”), have a hella time relating to other women, am attracted to nerdy computer engineers.
1	Hi I am one as well.\n\nMen are either wildly attracted to me or afraid. I've had good relationships with ENFP and a weirdly strange attraction with INTJ. I met an ESTP guy once and I think we could have been perfect together, as friends at the very least. I miss him but he lives halfway around the world. 
1	hi
43	I just came here to say why I love ESTPs and ISTPs	Every time I've met an XSTP in real life, I have found them fascinating, full of wit/hilarious and, above all, *grounding*.  I can sometimes get lost in my own head too easily, thus, sometimes it's so rewarding to be around others who will just say *exactly* what's on their mind- and usually with more confidence than I ever could.  Even though there's a stereotype about STPs- especially ISTPs being cold and mean, I've found most of you guys to be perfectly pleasant to be around.  Honestly, most of the time, this "meanness" was actually pretty well justified when I have seen it.  Indeed: you guys will say what a lot of people are secretly thinking (and this is often stuff I'm afraid to even admit to *myself*).\n\nTwo of my closest friends are an ESTP and an ISTP.  They are incredibly fun to be around, and although, in many ways, they're extremely different from me, I often find these differences to be utterly delightful- watching them laugh and make jokes through gruesome scenes in movies and video games that I would usually be wincing through.  Watching them fearlessly getting right up close to and even messing around with video game dangers that I steer *well* clear of when it's my turn.  They also rarely perceive others as above vs beneath them, and I really love that about them.  They have helped me to grow as a person and encouraged me to live more in the moment, learn to laugh, rather than cry at negative things, not to take things too seriously all the time and to just be more "indifferent" to the world in general.\n\nYou guys might be the "coolest" types.  :3
20	:) \nwhen I was reading your post I thought "this must be an INFP" then read your post history and looks like I guessed right. \n\nThanks for being authentically you, even on the internet- \n2 of my siblings are INFP and the thing I most admire about them is their authentic, pure intentions in their interactions with others.  Keep doing you!
16	We love you too! 😊
9	INFP here.... When I was in Uni I found myself befriending two guys ISTP and ESTP. Basically everything you said.\n\nI think my emotional nature and expressions when talking about things I’m passionate about was amusing to the ISTP who would often purposely rile me up while trying not to crack a smile or laugh and see how long he could keep it going before I noticed I’m being trolled. I’d be so pissed and he found it hilarious, but we never really argued or fought, he’s far too chill for that.\n\nESTP and I would often have small arguments and what I loved about him is how easily he’d let go and within a short time we were just bantering and joking around about something else. He was considered ‘mean’ by so many people but at least he never held a grudge, like ever. And he was honest, unlike most people. I respect that. But I was super honest too hence why we’d often clash. But despite any clashes we still remained friends, we could still joke and laugh or share experiences. I love that we are both highly individualistic yet accepting of each other.\n\nIf he went too far with comments or hurting others the  ISTP would always be the one to diffuse the situation. In a light-hearted way. Making fun of the ESTP but still pointing out things he’s doing. I liked watching their friendship grow and I’m glad I was the one who brought them together in the first place 😂. I also enjoyed watching the ESTP make fun of the ISTP. It was nice he met his match.\n\nMan I miss them, but they’ve both moved to different countries. Life goes on.
5	Do you find that you can talk deep psychology, philosophy, etc with ESTPs? Also this is funny because 2 of my best friends are INFPs, maybe our types just go well together :) the reason why I love them though is because I find I can talk for hours on end about abstract concepts, but I’m wondering if that’s because of our types or if it’s just different. I feel like that makes me a less “grounded” ESTP, but just wanted to compare to your experience with us :) \n
3	I always see people on the MBTI subs talking about those from certain groups.\n\nHow do you know who's what? Do you often, like, ask people? And then they know what you're talking about?
2	I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:\n\n- [/r/istp] [I just came here to say why I love ESTPs and ISTPs](https://www.reddit.com/r/istp/comments/a37r5q/i_just_came_here_to_say_why_i_love_estps_and_istps/)\n\n&nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))*
6	You're Now My New Friend...	Recently found out that I get along famously with ESTPs.\n\nI'd give you my info but...trust is something I don't believe in.\n\nSo, heres my PSN Username: Mortaldeadking < I'm 17 so after a certain age limit it'll be considered some Chris Hanson shit. So, if you've PSN and your between 15-24 we must play Red Dead 2 Online together. See you there bro!
5	INFP Wife Considering ESTP Husband's Christmas Gift	I'm an INFP looking to "create" a gift for my ESTP husband (I'm poor lol). For his birthday, I wrote him a short story where he basically woke up on his own time, started a fire, drank coffee, and left his snowy cabin in the woods to go out and test survival equipment with friends. He loved that and he's not a big reader. He had me read it to him, which he generally likes better. \n\nI'm looking to do something similar--either another story or some kind of craft. I made him a blanket when he was on deployment in 2016,  which he loves. He's home this Christmas thankfully so I'd like to give him something meaningful despite limited funds. Do ESTPs generally like meaningful gifts? So many forums say the opposite. \n\nI know ESTPs typically like experiences too. But where to go for free in the cold? \n\nI also have a general curiosity about the relationship between ESTPs and gifts:\n\nHe's seemed to like the more craft-centered things I've done that speak more to his specific likes than things I thought he would find useful and like more. Ive asked about practical gifts before (like knives/coffee makers for the field/etc.) but he's very particular on the brand/type of whatever the object is. Particular to the point he can come off very mean when the gift isn't to his liking. He also hates giftcards that have only enough money to be used for one meal or at places he rarely goes to. He has said he would rather get nothing from someone rather than a "stupid gift" even though some of these gifts should, in theory, fit what he likes. It's strange to me, but his particularness makes me highly aware that my choices for him are often "wrong." Is this common among ESTPs? \n\nThoughts?
5	Make him something he’ll have to think of you with some cute meaning, without any kind of use or purpose. Otherwise you’ll get offended when he points out how it could be better designed or made. 
6	Make something by hand and give it that INFP charm.\n\nSource: Dating an INFP, one of the sweetest gifts I’d ever received was an origami flower representing everlasting devotion.
2	Hello, ESTP male here dating an INFP female. She bought me a very nice bottle opener with the coordinates of our first date and a little heart. Stays on my keys and goes with me wherever I go.. practical and meaningful — can’t go wrong with that !! I generally prefer receiving practical gifts, so if one can get me something practical with meaning attached to it, they win :)
4	please help me determine if my cousin is an estp?	she is 15y/o and is an asian if that helps! :D\n\nif i remember correctly, when she was young she would always cry at new and strange environments like in nursery but will then be very energetic when she gets used to it. i also remember clearly that she was very loud with her cousin (or people she's familiar with) that's around her age and she would always boss them around and do all sorts of crazy things that's inappropriate. \n\n\nshe now finds it hard to verbalise her thoughts well and often get into clashes with overly-sensitive people. i've heard that many of her friends call her insensitive and unemphathetic when she told me that she was trying to help them "in another way" and that her actions were often misunderstood as that. she also has trouble with authority and rebels hard, especially with people that tries to control her or limit her actions. she told me that she knows little of her feelings and doesn't like wallowing in them. i'm convinced by now that she is an ExTP, except that ENTP is very possible as well. \n\n\nshe seeks adrenaline-pumping activites but has limited access to it giving her place of residence and thus dedicates herself to working out. she's extremely determined and feels out of place when she doesn't work out for a few days. she has pretty good reflexes but sometimes acts before she thinks, leading to trouble.\n\ni wouldn't exactly call her a "leader" or "alpha" as most ESTPs are described as, since she has severe anxiety around most guys and some strangers (though she acts like nothing is bothering her) and unless she's familiar with people she wouldn't boss people around since she tries her best to Fe even though she still shows some of those tendencies when she isn't anxious or in depression. she is quiet around people she doesn't mix well with or when she thought they wouldn't click with her. she is also quick to make assumptions and is prone to overthinking at times to the point of paronia. she used to claim to see "ghosts and spirits" and is still afraid of these kind of things. she can analyze well and predict what someone else is thinking or going to do as well. \n\n\nshe is haunted by her past and uses it as a guide for the present and future. she will also react very aggressively when she thinks that something similar to the past is happening again and will use everything in her to prevent it. she is also very quick to learn physical things, and doesn't like to be last. she also tries to be top in everything though she fails at times. \n\n\nplease help me determine if she is in fact estp, thank you!\n
5	Annoying ESTP	Do you find women who want nothing to do with you as a challenge? I can't get one to leave me alone. I've been blunt and told him to go away and he still comes back. I don't like playing games and I'm getting irritated by the constant boundary pushing. Do you think ignoring him would be the best idea?  
9	If you aren't interested then stop talking to him\n\n\nThey are a challenge and in my own experience they eventually budge and have fun. \n\nBut if someone is telling me to go away I wouldn't be still nagging. \n\n\ngotta realize that sometimes it has nothing to do with a mbti type but rather a dumbass 
2	He should’ve stopped, idk why he didn’t
1	Doesn’t sound like ESTP to me. We’re usually so perceptive we don’t waste our time on relationship non-starters in the first place.
1	Aren’t all ESTPs annoying?
8	Old man describes ESTPs pretty well	[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV3TmN55cFg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV3TmN55cFg)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWow accurate wtf
3	Your username is such an ESTP username 
3	what a inefficient way to transmit info 
5	Inferior Se prick here	So really,,,,,,, how is it that you use Se?????? getting trapped in your inside world is fun until you have responsibilities and life. But seriously any help?
7	I mainly use it unconsciously, usually as a stream of input for my Ti. It's hard to explain because unlike what gets written stereotypically, ESTPs do spend a fair amount of time thinking as we're acting, constantly analysing what's going on around us - we just never tell anyone. We also use it to just do things - I often get strong physical cravings and have to satisfy them. Doing things in the real world is much more fun than being stuck in your own head.\n\nMind, Se isn't that much better for dealing with responsibilities than Ni - sure we get more done but we aren't always doing the right thing.
7	.....just..... do..... it......
3	What do you mean?
3	Fucking trees and torturing nerds.\n\nNEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERDS
2	Fuck her right in the pussy
29	ESTP=Big Dick Energy	Confident, prone to taking risks, funny, great in a crisis, and an I-dont-give-a-fuck attitude. Clearly we are all alphas. Tell me I'm wrong.
16	I don't give a shit how big my big dick is.
10	It depends on how you use your functions. I knew a guy who was 100% ESTP and although he was aggressive and pretty intelligent(and wanted to be "alpha"), he was still a follower. You have Fe after all, so I think you're overestimating your ability to not give fucks
7	😎
5	unless the degree to which you believe in your own big dick energy ultimately translates into arrogance and thus extremely small dick energy 🤷🏼‍♀️
7	you’re wrong:P 
4	Last one nah 
2	Okay, you’re wrong. And the language you use is insensitive. There’s nothing alpha about the way you speak. It’s fucking embarrassing.
1	E X P A N D\n                 O\n                 N\n 🍆           G
4	Aren't the ESTPs with an overdeveloped Fe the strangest people you know	
12	... no 🧐
3	Would love a concrete example.. Chris Traeger from Parks and Rec maybe? Ive consciously tried to develop my Fe for years now.. It has become stronger and I don’t mind feeling strange. I think my Fe and Ni could and will always need work tho..
8	ketchup on turkey...try it	PSA: turkey is delicious with ketchup.  I had never considered mixing the two until last night.  My tongue is still all wonkey this evening from last night so....\n\nAnyways, have a safe holiday tomarrow, and thank you.\n\nIt isn't as delicious as on and slathered all over chewy and well done steak.....but what could be?  Was awesome.  Accompaning crispy or crunchy steak is so so so so good.  \n\nHappy Thanksgiving\n\n
2	Heathen
2	Huh. So this is what being triggered feels like. Ewww
1	ketchup is cheating when it comes to cooking.\n\n
6	Adam22 from No Jumper - ESTP?	Do you agree with this? He seems like a pretty good example of your type. Let me know what you think\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRFX1zstPKQ\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-Sf3ar589c
2	Yeah I’d say he is ESTP. I definitely relate to how he approached his early financial struggles and what he wanted to do with his life. Even if it’s illegal, you do what you have to do to survive. His idea about things that could have been done in the future (BMX videos online) is another thing I relate to. I also related to his mannerisms of speaking (and so with the interviewer). I felt the interviewer might be ESTP as well because I’d ask the same questions and reply the same. They both seemed to have a lot of chemistry and know each other’s game and respect each other equally.
2	Eww
1	dunno, he doesnt really say much.
13	Please help me find an activity/pepole to fuck around	I am so so so so so bored, all my friends are introverts who would rather stare at a wall than hang out (good people tho) and the city i live in is small, so i have little to no options. Anything will do, idc if it’s illegal, i have been bored my entire life and will probably suicide if this continues.
11	GYMMMMMMM
7	Every ESTP needs a motorbike. Get that and just play around in traffic. It’s fun seeing how upset people get watching you have fun. Also you can join motorbike clubs but welters I live they’re just filled with lame 50 year olds :(
6	Also I forgot to mention I am extremly extroverted and so fucking lonely because people my age usually find me outrageous/are basically the least interesting people on earth
5	What do you like to do? Find some hobbies, that’s how people connect
3	Do some physical activities that will help, if there is no gym in the area do street workouts 
3	is that not what social media is for? 
3	DIY publicity stunt? I usually make/buy a lot of things to alleviate boredom, but you seem to be more extroverted than me.\n\nMaybe put a table in the middle of town with a weird sign on it, like “Donate to the Eat an Ass Foundation” with a change jar on top.
3	BBQing outside \n\nnot only does it waste time but\n\nit puts it into good use
4	Shut the fuck up and go do something then. If you don't give a fuck what it is, then go do whatever the fuck you want? Thought provoking huh? 
0	Hold on, let me try something....	You’re ALL a bunch of Retarded Cunts.\n\nNow, I’ll watch the fireworks....
14	Doesn’t work like that
13	Ok
7	UwU why are you so tsundere ENTP kun\~
12	Faggot.
1	Whatever I'm sure you're shit at hockey while I knock down all the uncoordinated players 
8	How does an ESTPs thought process go?	Hey guys, INFP here according to the index. Since I'm supposed to be the 'polar opposite' to you I'm really interested in how you would "see the world". See I constantly have this ongoing monologue in my head, like me talking to myself, kind of shutting out the external world to an extent. I would guess this is different  with someone who is a) extroverted and b) sensory over intuitive.I really believe in trying to learn something from those people different from yourself. I frequently get lost in my head and ignore my surroundings due to all these interesting ideas and scenarios I make up for myself. My questions to you: Do you ever get lost in thought in the same way that say someone like me? Do you tend to think in pictures or in words? And if you don't think in words do you think it's because your thought process runs to fast for you to have this kind of "monologue" I experience?\n\nWould be really interesting to get some insight in how you guys would see the world differently. Probably a good way to dismantle any stereotypes there might be too. Appreciate any answers!
16	If i get lost in thought, it’s just me going over things I have to do, things that happened during the day, or I’m piecing together how things work. If I want to relax or sleep, I have to force myself to daydream and imagine.  \n\nRandom but an example that happened today of a thought I had: “does the amount of muscle mass you have help women deliver a child?” *googles it briefly and skims the title of two articles for conclusion*\n\nIf I don’t find an answer in 2 minutes, I’m distracted and move onto my next thought or action. \n\nI don’t always think in words as much, maybe more in memories? Is that considered pictures idk? I do agree that the thought process and logical understanding is too fast/complex for a monologue explanation. No clue if this made sense hope it helped. 
6	thought processes tend to be at extreme ends of one another.  \n\n\nI go over possible events, at its best outcome and at its worst outcome and then mentally prepare for the both of them.  \n\n\nI get "lost in thought" but not in its typical sense, i won't just sit and think. More than likely, ill be moving while I think, doing everyday activities.   \n\n\nI think in both words and pictures, but words being of discussion/monologue with others. If I talk to myself, its a few words and then I get on with whatever I was doing.   \n\n\nAs to learning from other people, I don't seek out to learn from others, it just happens.  \n\n\nhope this helps\n\n&#x200B;
3	The way I handle a problem is to first stay calm and determine what the problem is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen measure the problem to see if it's big or small as this will determine in the "HOW" will I solve it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo if it's a small one, then I just go ahead and tackle it. Mainly through trial and error until the problem is solved. Learn as I go style.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf it's a big one, then I might look for the advice of other people who have experienced a similar issue, or I will do further research on my own.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnce I feel confident with a solution, then I will go ahead and apply it and then pray 13 hail Marys that it will work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf it doesn't work out, then I just try to think on what could have gone wrong and how can I do better next time ? Then try again with the new wisdom acquired.\n\n&#x200B;
2	I think very visually. It’s why I’m an engineer. Been thinking about getting into paragliding recently so it’s been lots of imagining me launching the chute and gliding around etc. 
1	I overthink tiny/somewhat insignificant things, like crushes, questions in exams (the question will be 1 + x = 8, x = ____ and I’ll be sitting there for 10 mins being like, this must be a trick question, it can’t be that easy etc.)\n\nPictures > words (I do like reading, but for learning purposes pictures)\n\nLooking at a ton of words just bores me/I can’t concentrate, like you expect me to read that whole page about secondary cartilaginous joints? No, not happening\n\nBut for the most part, I don’t really think, I just go go go (for most things, not huge life changing choices). 
3	How to help chronically depressed ESTP mom?	Hi my mom usually comes out as INFJ on tests but she fits the profile more of a depressed ESTP (possibly ESTJ) than a healthy INFJ. \nShe's been in the dumps for so long that I think she's gotten used to it. Anyway, she doesn't show any desire to get better. I'm tired of it. Is there anything I can do help her? I've tried being nice, being firm, ignoring her, being a shoulder to cry on, etc but nothing has any results. \n\nEdit: She's been like this for over a decade. She might have tried therapy but gave it up for whatever reason. I think it'd still be a good idea. So what can I do to push her in that direction? Like I said, it's become her new "normal" so she doesn't have any desire to change it. I'm an INTP.\n
6	What do estps think of infps?	
14	Idk what they are
9	I've found they're lowkey judgemental which I dislike.
6	Appreciate their creativity & authenticity, dislike how subjective they can be, and I don't understand why they can be so private.  I am usually drawn to them anyways.
4	It’s fun at first. They’re quiet, reserved, emotional people I want to understand and connect with. Romantically, much harder to be compatible. They can be awesome friends, very loyal. 
3	my nephew is an estp and im his infp aunt i freaking love that kid. Its all fun banter, making fun of shows, my parenta, depression jokes he kills me. He can be insensitive but he has the best intentions, just looking for a laugh. We both like to observe in our own ways but find humor in the same things.\n\n My family has to watch what we say around him because he is literally always listening for new information. Wish I knew more estps you are funny mofos, not all infps are cry babies i promise ya. try it out. 
2	not interested
2	I would assume they were receptive audiences and playmates who would go along with what I wanted to do or talk about because it was important to me, which I may then be inadvertently ignoring their needs. I also see leading them on that our playful, easy-going relationship is a sign of a deeper connection that would not actually exist.
2	My bestie at work is an infp. I consider us activity partners. We usually go to lunch together, go hiking, paint or go to condoms events like seem interesting. Our curiosity keeps our friendship strong and exciting. We are both weird, spontaneous (seen as impulsive to others) and love textbooks and spreadsheets. \n\nI like how yall double check our actions because we're always in 'go mode' whereas yall are more indecisive and more reserved. This helps me take a moment's pause and really think about do I really want to do it.
1	Ah one of my closest friends is an INFP! They're very relaxed and makes for a great opposites attract type of friendship. 
1	Not very highly
1	Boring people who avoid the truth. 
8	Confidence without Arrogance	What's the secret?
13	IMO confidence is knowing you can do it, arrogance has a side of snubbing others because they can't.  \n\nSoo, don't be a dick?
10	Just be ourselves. Our brand of cockiness may be overwhelming to some but can be sexy as hell; and I don’t think it’s the nasty kind of arrogance. 
7	If you mean how do you do it without having people trying to shun you for it, you can't. There will always be people who just dislike you, for the silliest of reasons, but you just have to know yourself and know that your intentions are good. It's ok to feel good about yourself and the things you've worked hard to accomplish. The way I justify my confidence without being egotistical is by trying to be selfless and helping out others that are on the same trade as I am.  
6	Confidence is trust in yourself and your capabilities, to know your strength *and* your limits.\n\nArrogance is when you lie to yourself ie. I already know everything.
3	lol I just accept my confidence. Better than having low-confidence! 
2	I'm definitely the most confident person I know. I feel like I can usually avoid coming across as arrogant- just be nice
1	1/8th of your brain missing.\n\nMost ESTPs pick that part of their brain out from the nose that prohibits them from having confidence with arrogance.
15	Do any of you have repressed rage?	As a kid I just wanted to destroy.  I didn't want to hurt anybody, but I wanted to destroy for a good reason.  Like when you see a rule that is just absolutely nonsensical and restricting people, you want to light it on fire.  I had all this rage, but being put into a monotonous static institution of absorbing information, I couldn't do anything with it so I ended up being very destructive.  Just hurting people, being a bully.  I eventually repressed this, because I felt like a garbage human being, and I became very timid (although still very angry in random periods).  Now, I'm older, and its all coming back.  I shoved it under the carpet, but its not gone.  The other night I was blackout intoxicated on various substances, and absolutely went into an outburst, screaming and threatening my friend, and then I started crying.  It doesn't make me a bad person, it was just misdirected.  It has to be channelled into something helpful, something action oriented, and then it can become more beneficial.  I still don't know how to overcome the self hate that resulted from this misdirected rage though.\n\nHas anybody else gone through this rage?  Whether you repressed it or not?  What helped you?
4	Ohhhhh, yeah. I deal with this big time. I was a goody two shoes kid so I never really learned that I could be loved even when I was a prick kid - and with the issues I had, I had a lot of anger that I never let out. Now it's resurfaced via all my sadness being replaced with anger. Instead of crying, I get so angry I shake and punch walls. I'd kill myself before I ever hurt someone else though. I'd feel horrible.\n\nI can't give you any advice, but you're not alone in it man.
2	Nah I'm chill
1	> and then I started crying\n\nsure you're not an ESFP?
42	ESTPs rule! Some love from an INFJ	ESTPs are great, you guys have this presence that demands attention, its stunning.  \nYou guys are able to hear me out, letting my take my time to formulate my ideas, and aren't shy to tell me when Im wrong, and Im ready to do the same!  \nYou guys are brave and are quick at making friends and getting shit done.\n\nWhen you guys get emotional Im ready to lend an ear, which I like doing. Its funny how you guys can be a stone wall to some people and then be so soft on the inside. And when I get emotional you guys help me clear my head. \n\nYou guys share life with others, and that sharing makes it better for everyone, my fav part about you guys.  \nI feel like I can relax around you guys and recharge, when ya'll are not dragging me into some awesome adventure. \n\nYou guys are beautiful, strong and amazing people.   \nSo go out there and get it! <3  \n\n\nLove from an INFJ  \n
10	Aww thanks \nI have an INFJ friend and I would say the same thing back. I would definitely say he is the missing puzzle piece to me. Although we are vastly different from each other, we somehow mesh together in what we view of the world and others, and have similar senses of humor that we don’t need to be so PC about.\nSomething about him is immensely calming. Yeah, he does help me get emotionally grounded and he is very dependable and trustworthy. I don’t have many friends like that to be honest. INFJs are like golden apples you guys are awesome
2	Thank you for sharing, needed to heard that ❤
9	Danny Duncan....the ultimate ESTP?	As a ENTP, i laugh my ass off watching this guy and im always thinking,"This hass to be the perfect example of an PURE  ESTP".  \n\nIf you have no clue who this guy is look at one minute of his videos and it will be quite clear.\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKJdVZs5PS8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKJdVZs5PS8)
5	Hell yeah dude that guy is ESTP extreme that even I can’t do some things he does 
4	INFJ here. I can see the Fe and Ti in him, and...\n\n“I’m more of a planner, but I take things day by day, might as well just do it once”\n\nYou most certainly do not have to do something once- Yeah, sounds like my opposite 
4	doing things for the fuck of it = estp for sure.
3	Yeah hahah. ESTP female here. Everything he said is prob something I would've said. 
3	The guy who went to every Walmart to buy a snickers each? Yeeah, I agree
2	I hang out with Danny all the time in Florida.\nThe dude is the perfect ETSP of you think about it\n\nHere’s a video when he first introduced his mini horse to me 😂😂\nhttps://youtu.be/4f8EzAiqAwU

13	Did anybody else go through a stage of analysis paralysis?	When I was a kid, I was always trying out new things, but I didn't handle failure very well.  After a whole lotta failure, I decided "Well, I'm just going to expect to fail at everything, because then I can't be disappointed."  This basically put me into a state of paralysis, uselessness, caused by the Ni grip (fear of failure).  Even my INFJ best friend was trying to get me to do shit, which is sad because I was always the one trying to get HIM to do stuff.  Eventually, I understood that this is a terrible mindset, because that negative expectation poorly affects your performance in the moment.  I'm still learning to confront failure though...\n\nDid anybody else go through this stage / are in this stage?
6	Im currently going through it now. Know what you're saying. Pretty dark and fucked up. \n\nWhat triggered it for  me Is similar to what Jordan Peterson is talking about in this video. \n\nThe analysis paralysis was triggered by something similar to this. \nhttps://youtu.be/sVNu9Wz3PgM.

2	 I’m in it now, in regards to finding a full time job post graduation. What keeps me going is knowing I can change my mind and any decision I make will be relatively as good as the second or third. The important part is to make a decision rather than be stuck in the analysis. Cheers 
1	Didn't realise this is a stage. Any hints on how to get out of it? I've had this mentality since I was a teenager.
6	Estp Jealous?	Hello there! \nWell.. I was wondering how ESTPs usually do when they.. get jealous. I have a friend estp and we are actually like.. flirting. But a few days ago something happened and after that he started acting weird.. i mean, lilke more distant. I think he got jealous but I would like to know first how do they act and also.. what can i do...
5	As an STP I usually try to rationalize the situation, THEN distance myself from the person if it is still causing me to feel bad. 
3	Hard feat to do tbh\n\nVery seldom does jealousy kick in if at all
2	If you stare long enough into the eyes of a Estp, they can speak morse code with their blinks 
2	Interesting question.\n\nTo answer to you, in my case, when i feel jealous i hate that ! For the good reason that i feel dependant.\n\nSo like others i get some distance, even if it's my friend (i speak of loving jealousy).\n\nI would like to have an other solution, but for the moment, i don't have an other one
1	Ask the person\nthink of what youve done\nget their opinion\nresolve the problem \n
1	I never really get jealous
5	What do estps normally think of mental health issues?	I confided in an estp teacher of my depression and anxiety and he seemed nice but idk what he thought. 
7	Be more specific. 
5	I think this is more dependant of who you're talking with. I think an ESTP can be a very fierce defendant of mental health as long as he has come in contact with it. Maybe he has had it himself, or he has lost someone close to him who had it.\n\nBut I don't think we are the type who naturally feels sympathy for mental health issues because they're very personal and it's something that can be tough to process for our often empiricist minds.\n\nHowever, he's your teacher and I honestly have no doubts that he's genuinely concerned and interested in the mental health of his students.
4	[deleted]
3	This is more of an opinionated question rather than something an entire type would decide
2	Specifically for your case, I don’t think you’re judged. 
2	I don’t really get it, and don’t expect much sympathy from me either.  If you’re my friend I’ll try and help you up until the point it starts negatively impacting my life then I’d leave you on your own until you become less shitty.
2	Depends entirely on where they’ve been. If they have experience being around or being mentally ill people, they care a lot. If not, then they won’t be as defensive
1	Personally I do have a problem since I don't like to seem vulnerable at all so I stay silent about it.
12	A message for people struggling with anxiety/depression/mental health.	Hey guys,\n\nIt’s me. A random person on the internet. Ik it’s rather strange that I’m just here, sharing my story.\nI know this probably wont be viewed- like ever- but I decided to share anyways. \nI would like to warn you, I’m not that great with feelings. Ive spent years understanding myself and I’d like to say i have some decent emotional intelligence, and I apologize if this isn’t very warm.\n\nI suppose its easier to do on the internet anyways, I don’t know any of you all and I will probably never meet any of you. But i want any of you that are struggling with mental health to know that I may not know your situation, or whats in ur head, but I get you. In some ways at least I’m sure we have a little common ground.\n\nI know you probably think that its just me already all better but I’m NOT all better. I’m still struggling, I’m still having my lows. In fact, I’m going through a tough low today.\n\nI started to struggle with depression and anxiety about three years ago. It’s not uncommon, as an INTP, to not know that this strange thing you are going through is in fact depression. Everything was just kind of-meh. I became even more anxious than i used to and I’d be terrified of speaking to half the people I met. My grades started slipping and I lost control. \n\nThis escalated throughout the past few years. Last year, I remember going to an apartment that a relative owned on the 17th floor, and almost jumping. They had one of those shorter railings where with a little jump I could have gone over. I don’t say this to scare you, but to explain my situation. Now here is some background. I grew up with two incredibly conservative Asian parents, one of which was abusive.  Today, I’m still scared of a lot of men with large builds but I’m recovering. Last year was definitely the worst. I remember wanting to cry, but being unable to let anything out. I was even urged to drink away my problems. Almost every day I wanted to do it, and every time i felt like i was better, the low would hit me twenty times harder. It felt completely hopeless, I felt like life wasn’t worth the pain.\n\nSummer was strange for me, i forced myself to read and I felt as if i recovered, but it was still there, haunting me. This year was a bunch of ups and lows. Ive always felt that even if i try my very best, in this condition, I still couldn’t succeed. Depression destroyed my ability to focus in class(even though that wasnt too great to begin with) and drained my energy drastically. I couldn’t sleep at night ever, and then I’d end up waking up at noon, something I never used to do. I rarely got more than 4 hours asleep and I would often fall asleep in class. My memory also failed, i used to have a really incredible memory where I could remember everything but that was gone, and its still gone for me.\n\nI had built up a facade, a protective method to not let myself appear vulnerable. In some classes I’d be so crazy and immature I’d act like a madman. Sure pissed off a lot of people. It was like some crazy ESFJ me(i am an intp tho) and it was exhausting. I’d barely be able to stay awake and after it would happen i would regret everything. \n\n A talk from a family member actually helped a little. I realized I needed to get my life under my own control and plan for the days that would be the most terrible of my life. I still remember what he said “if in a month, 15 of the days will be bad days, you need to make the good days count twice as much to make up for it.” Thats what i began to do. I did my work a few days ahead on my good days so that I had a cushion to fall on for the bad. I still have lows, but I’m working on wanting to get better. I know it sounds crazy, but really think about it. Sometimes whats stopping us from getting better is that we started to define with depression. We were used to living with it. Without it, we don’t know who we really are. I get that its not the same for everyone, but Ive heard things like this from a lot of people.\n\nAnother reddit post also kind of woke me up. It talked about three main things. Forgiving yourself, acceptance, and every day being a nonzero day. I currently cant find that post, but i thought it was important. I realized that just thinking about all my failures made it all worse. I had to accept that it happened and keep going. It’s a never ending loop and Ive been working to crawl my way out of it. Here i am now, still in a low, but now I feel like I have something to fight for, an opportunity. I think I’ve kind of accepted that i cant work at my full potential currently, but I sure will try my best on my good days, because they are all I have of this stage of my life.\n\nIve kind of learned to stop listening to the pressures of my parents because they only get me into more lows. I had to WANT this for myself. I don’t know if I do but I do want a future.\n\nI guess i want to see something ahead of me. But I’m also scared. What if I don’t succeed? I guess the future is so unpredictable and I truly hope that I’ll be okay. I’m not saying my method will work for you guys. EVery one of you has a different situation and your problems are all equally important. Maybe I posted this story for myself, I’m not sure. Maybe it was for closure. I sure left out a lot. I don’t know if I had the words to really explain it in more detail. That was just an idea of who I am i suppose. But, I do want to let you guys know that I am here. I understand those feelings, when your ears are pounding and you are nauseous and the room is spinning in a panic attack. I know those nights where you either cry a river or you cant cry because you feel so upset in a low and you want it all to end. I get the feeling of how scary it is when you think that the person you value the most could be leaving you, and its all your fault. I still feel this today.\n\nAll this is a part of my own daily life, and Its still an uphill struggle. But while I’m climbing this mountain, i can slowly see the summit. I know this may all sound meaningless to you guys. I get it. That was me, and it is still me sometimes. The only thing I can say is that even if the future is blurry and you think you know you’ll fail, you have nothing to lose when fighting. I know its hard to believe and even harder to start. I just wish i told myself this a lot earlier and I could have fulfilled opportunities that I wasted. If you ever want to talk to me, I’m here to listen. I;m not good with feelings but in this generation, I feel like we need to get our stories out and understand the importance of mental health. It is an illness, just like the flu.\n\nI don’t really have a conclusion, to be honest. I guess ill just end it here. This is my story, and I really hope that by telling this I could help even just one person, even if it is in a tiny way. Goodbye guys and Ill answer any questions you have. (Also, you may see this post on other Reddit’s) 
9	Estp parents and parenting	For those of you that had estp parents how was it and for those of you that are parents how are you at it?
5	INTP with ESTP father.  I would have preferred to read, study and watch TV, but he works hard and plays hard. So I got a lot of exposure to the outside, mowing, raking, woodworking, fixing cars and snowmobiles, hiking, cross country skiing, unicycle, camping, playing an instrument, choir and travel. My older brother got a microscope, telescope, a train set and a chemistry set(note all this was 50 years ago, we didn't have much money but somethings he got us anyway).\n\nAs a introvert I would like to avoid many social settings, but if there was a social gathering, we were there, and he was talking to everyone.\n\nOverall, very helpful having all those experiences, which I might not have had otherwise.
5	I've read that ESTPs are the fun parents. Like, kids generally love hanging out with them and have fun, and feel loved but not suffocated. I feel like I am this parent. I also substitute teach, and the kids the tell me often how I'm fun but we also learn a lot.\n\nMy dad was an ISTJ/ESTJ. He was strict and I hated him for a long time. My mom was a INFP-ish? 
1	I hope I’m a parent one day. Raising a small version of me would be so sweet. 
17	The desire for a simple life	IDK if you guys agree but a coworker (ISTP) and I (ESTP) were talking about what kind of life we wanted in the future. \n\nWe ended up both agreeing on the premise of a simple life. House is paid, all debts paid off, retire early and leave work forever. Spend remaining time/money doing hobbies, hang with friends/family, and vacation/traveling from time to time.\n\nWe both agreed that being too rich and famous was stressful (people suing you, getting kidnapped for ransom, potentially losing it all, etc.) and being too poor was as stressful for obvious reasons. \n\nOn the contrary, with some NTs I talked to, their life goal seemed quite extravagant. Either they want to be the first X to be on Y (ex with ENTJ wanting to make it to Forbes 30 under 30), or something along the lines of being the “best” of their respective field of interest. The simple life seems to scare them for some reason. IDK why, but only a few NTs seemed to agree with us (not a bad thing) whereas the sensor friends I have, all agree on having it as stress free as possible. If we could claim fame for what we do, we can, but it’s not like an important thing to us. Perhaps the best term is that NTs need to “innovate” something in their life to feel accomplished. I know a few that don’t care about that, again, just saying what I find common amongst my coworkers and friends, and if you guys relate or something.\n\n\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nWhat kind of life do you guys want in the future and why? Also state ur mbti type if you’re not ESTP (I see you INTJs).\n\nType stuff if you relate to title
10	Amen. 
10	Yeah. I want to bust my balls doing high risk, high reward stuff when I'm young and make a nice nest egg, then go settle into a job I like. No kids, just go do what I want to do with my life (which is largely travel) and get into expensive hobbies for grown up children.
4	I'm an ESTP and I want a simple life aswell but at the same time, I believe this would make us boring people since we have no goals
5	all i want is a simple life in a farm where i can truly live my life 
4	 ENTJ here. I would like to be lead our first quest to establish a self sustainable colony on Mars. (Wishful thinking) 
4	I'd like a life of no obligations like you. Plenty of money, not having to work for someone. Having time for fun, friends, alone time, time to pursue my own interests, learning, exploring and growing as a person. I think this relates to maslows hierarchey of human needs.\nhttps://goo.gl/images/mDAP49\n
3	INFJ Male\nSame here, the simple life. The sounds of nature to fall asleep to, a garden to cultivate, all the hobbies and reading im interested in, traveling, hiking. I want to build a life towards that. First step would be to find a female ESTP to build our lives, but I have yet to meet one IRL. DM
2	I agree. I’m INTJ and I want to be the best at what I do. If I wanted to travel somewhere, if I wanted to relax, then I would make that my short-term goal, but time is a limited resource. If I relax for too long, my mind is always gonna think,”what’s next?” If every day is not stressful and there’s nothing to work towards, I might as well die next week. 
2	A relatively-nice townhome in a low-COL city. I’m into cars so I want to get a sporty car like a Volkswagen GTI and have fun with that. Try to find a girl to share the rest of my life with and take it from there.
2	Infp here and same.
2	Kind of. I want to be some über-rich John McAfee/Nicolas Cage-type person and then spend the rest of my life as a human prank, spreading chaos wherever I go with elaborate practical jokes (like putting stacks of money on the streets as a bread crumb trail) and random appearances in public (showing up at a Dollar Store somewhere). Like Martin Shkreli, but not a complete pile of shit
1	I want to be famous haha. I definitely like a few spontaneous stuff and drama and if I'm rich I'll get to buy a few cars, bungee jump and skydive (young ESTP)
10	Past Lovers	How did you guys deal with people you had developed feelings for, but for one reason or another couldn't make it work at the time but never lost those feelings? Did you force yourself to move on and find greener pastures or find a way to overcome the roadblocks in your way? 
5	Basically realizing why I felt the way I did, where it went wrong, and if it was even avoidable or not\n\nI then tried to better myself and not look back. I guess the emotional baggage for me has kinda dropped off because I'm a completely different person in nearly every aspect of my life. \n\nI know the same thing wouldn't happen again today unless it let it. Other things could happen but I know I have bettered myself in one way for sure.\n\nTldr: Basically tackle your insecurities and you won't feel insecure 
3	I’ve had that sometimes. It sucks, but I tend to look at it as a benefit because if it would work out and I never realized something that didn’t, then we would be fighting and that’s not good.\n\nI know relationships aren’t perfect and yeah I can still have feelings for those that didn’t work out, but I just suck it up and say I will find someone better someday that will really “get me” and be open with.\n\nTo numb the sadness, at night I just drink a lot, blast some sad songs on my earphones (November rain by Guns n Roses) and eat some comfort food and then sleep and hang out with friends the next day. 
1	They all formed in high school. We all moved to different places for university and to settle down so for me there was just no point in trying to make something of any of those crushes. This is probably a more apathetic response than some of the others you may get, but I still very much think of them when I stumble upon one of their posts on social media.

11	Star Wars vs Lord of the Rings	Hey everyone. \n\nWhich do you prefer?
10	I don't think there is a comparison. They are both equally epic.
8	LOTR. Just because of the sheer epicness of the Mumakill vs Rohan scene
7	Star Wars specifically the EU version. I really dislike the new Disney canon 
6	Lord of the Rings. The babes are better
7	Star Wars\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLOTR movies are very lengthy, and not much action happens besides maybe a couple of scenes within that 3-4 hour time stretch. Star Wars has great music, great sound effects, action scenes, good story, and shifts between different characters' plots here and there to keep it interesting. Also, Han Solo shoots first.
5	Star Wars
5	Star Wars
5	Star Wars
4	Star Wars. I honestly find it difficult to sit through the LOTR films. There are so many holes where very little is happening, and that's where I lose interest. 
4	 Star Wars
3	LOTR. The chase scene to the river in the first movie is one which is guaranteed to give me goosebumps every time I watch it.
10	ESTP and politics	Just a random thought, do you guys have an interest in politics and where do most of you lean politically?\nI'm a politics (and philosophy) student and on the libertarian-right/ small state conservative. \n
16	Fuck SJW's that's all I have to say
7	Definitely center right and I hate PC culture. 
6	Yeah, it wasn’t until junior year of high school that I became interested in political news. After a lot of digging and diving, freshman year of college I finally decided that I’m libertarian-right as well. Very cool question. Hope the thread grows.
11	WOOO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI found a lot of fellow ESTPs voted Trump 2016 elections. We had a HUGE party at NYC, it was fucking amazing I tell ya.\n\nSerious answer: I'm a conservative, but with some libertarian values.
5	Used to care about politics until I realized how it’s so obvious they manipulate people and how easy people fall for it.\n\nStill interested in policy though... so my interests are more in geopolitics/economic policy/diplomacy etc... the government sucks 
4	I don't really care about politics, and I'm a centrist
5	Politics is all rigged. I’m fiscally conservative and mostly hold libertarian when it comes to most other things. 
3	I'm a centrist. 
3	Did my Bachelor's in IR. Would say I'm neorealist or something of the sort without a clear right or left inclination.
3	No interest. I’m a liberal. 
3	I got interested in politics after the 2016 election.  Political science is part of my double major now. I’m populist left/social democrat. Basically, a platform of ending the wars in Iraq/Afghanistan + our drone program, stop selling weapons to Israel & Saudi Arabia, end corporate welfare to wal-mart, Exxon Mobil, and “defense” contractors, properly regulate and tax Wall Street, end the drug war, ban private/for-profit prisons and legalize marijuana, reinstate net neutrality, Medicare for all, end the electoral college (1 person = 1 vote), start a paper ballot initiative, fix the dirty water in Flint + other cities, do a green/renewable energy infrastructure deal, and raise the minimum wage.
3	Just found out I'm ESTP today, been interested in politics since I saw the newspaper headline "WAR!" ( GWB Sr's gulf war). Been following it ever since. Thought I was liberal, then found out I was actually conservative, by the time I was 17. ( I had 'em backwards)
2	Reasonably interested, and lean libertarian (well more like liberal, but in the UK sense not the US). I'd be interested to know why ESTPs tend to be like that. I've also noticed that we tend to be quite independent minded or third party, as opposed to very committed to one side or the other.
2	Right wing Liberal (cut them taxes) what a suprise
2	People think I don’t have political leanings since I’m technically a centrist, but I do have very strong, yet contradictory, leanings, and by sheer statistical probability, I go straight down the middle. Took that political test and ended up as a liberal, though.
2	I come from a very conservative background, and as such, I have conservative views.\n\nBut I don't care enough to actually do anything about it. After graduating college, I realized that I don't care about politics enough to even vote.
1	Anarchist but I realize it's not realistic with a society this developed so I don't really care. 
1	Very interessed in politics. Even considered becoming a politician. Would say that I’m a centrist, but left-leaning
7	Friend ESTP - Ni Grip	Alright guys, a sweet ENFP is here asking for a lil of help (okay, let's keep down the ego. This is serious for me).\nI actually have an ESTP classmate. We've been like... 2 years together at the same class. Those years we didn't talk much due to some stuff (well he actually flirted with me and the things didn't go too well, it's a long story haha), but as we were going to enter to the same career at the same college, we did team work for exams and studied together and we actually have a good .. friendship? Well, for me it's not really a friendship as we don't talk about deep stuff, but we have fun together so well.\n\nOkay, that was to describe a bit my relationship with him. Now I'll explain the situation.\n\nAt first, he was happy about college, motivated u know, but as the days kept passing.. that motivation started to dissapear (there have been already two parties and he refused to go wtf?!?!?). Apart from that, he is starting to get angry easily.. and he is becoming more serious...\nI'm quite worry about him, as I'm seeing he is going into a Ni grip and.. I don't know what to do, i mean, I wanna help him! But i don't know how to do it.. \nHe isn't socializing much with people, it's like if his expectation weren't becoming real? I dunno..\n\nI dunno how to act in these situations with him ;--; so I was wondering if you guys could help me out?
7	IDK looks like to me this ESTP is having some frustration that he doesn't want to tell you.\n\nI said this to someone with a similar problem, but if an ESTP really wants your  help they will tell you. From what your post looks like, is that you haven't told him how much you care about him so he doesn't know about it. He is deep in thought about this problem he has, that he doesn't want to talk to people because it bothers him and he's trying to find ways in his head to get rid of it (the problem).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI guess one way to make him open up is to say\n\n"Hey I noticed that you are losing motivation, not going to parties anymore, acting all serious... is something wrong?"\n\nif he shrugs it off, then it's a personal/deep problem he's been struggling with for some time. In that case I'd say\n\n"Even though I haven't said it directly, I really care about you and want to help you. I was with you when \[insert good time with ESTP\] and think you are \[insert positive characteristic\]. If you want to talk to me about your problems, I'm here."\n\nEither this ESTP will\n\na) Break down and vent all his frustrations to you in some private area\n\nb) Walk away... then come back to you after some time and tell you everything if he trusts you.\n\nESTPs in Ni grip will always want to be secluded until they figure out the solution internally. But they also know that they can benefit by bouncing off (to people they trust) about their frustrations and how to solve them. It is therapeutic to an ESTP like me, to talk to someone and realize that someone is there that cares for me and that I'm not alone in case things go out of hand. They need to feel ready about it first, so it takes some time.

2	I thought you were going to complain about him not studying. Some people are just introverts and the party scene just really isn't their element. You never want to pressure people into doing anything because you feel like you're doing them a favor, but they may also feel they're doing you a favor if they go out of their way to go and if things go south you guys may end up resenting eachother. If you guys can coexist knowing that you have different interests that might be the best route. Keep inviting them of coarse, so that he doesn't feel excluded, but don't be pushy.
1	I think I understand what your friend is going through. Since you only use your secondary function in times of stress (Ti), this adjustment might be extremely stressful for him, especially because he's used to the dynamic life before college that he had a lot of control over, his motivation might be turned into more media consumption/things that stimulate his mind while he processes this new change(using his Ti). \n\nHe might be more apt to spending time by himself because of this. It appears perfectly healthy for me. I have a tendency to be a bit shy as an extrovert so when I move somewhere new it can be a huge adjustment for me because it takes time to build the big friend groups I want to be around. 
10	Easiest way to determine if someone is ESTP	They love Red Hot Chili Peppers
15	Oh shit I’m being called out
3	Used to like them when I was younger. Not a fan of them now 
3	If you meant red got chili peppers, as in spicy food, then you got me.\n\nIDK about the band though, their music is alright but it's not that intense enough for me. \n\nMy favorite bands are Sum 41, REO Speedwagon, and \[anything Eurobeat here\].\n\nGunsNRoses when I'm sad.
7	Can't stand RHCP
2	How did you come up with this? Been only listening to them and Johnny Cash for like 3 years straight.
1	ENTP dropping by. I like them. Flea is a god. But I like other bands more.
13	Dating advice?	I (26F) have recently started online dating this past year and I must say it’s been...interesting. I haven’t been in a serious relationship by choice due to work, school, spending time with my friends, and doing some self discovery. I’m at the point in my life now where Im open to the possibility of a relationship. \n\nIf I’m talking to someone that’s sparked my interest, I am sooo into them-thinking about them through out the day, wondering if they’re thinking of me, have butterflies when they text me something cute, etc and then the moment I find something that I don’t like about them (example: repeated attempts to bend my already established boundaries) or that something may seem “off” (possessive or controlling characteristics surface) I first asses myself and see if it’s something I may be doing, that’s causing these negative feelings/thoughts toward someone. When I realize that it’s not me (which isn’t always the case.. I can be a bit blunt or matter of fact and that gets me in trouble sometimes), I am perfectly fine with just not seeing/talking  to them again. It’s like a switch that goes off-it’s really weird I can’t explain it. It could take me a couple dates in to realize this about said person of interest. When explaining my dating life with my best friend who is an ESFP, she doesn’t understand how I can “cut someone off” lol. It’s hard for her to process or even fathom letting someone go so quickly after having a lot of feelings for them. She can tolerate a fair amount of b/s and I just don’t have the patience for it. \n\nOn another note-I can lose interest fairly quickly in someone also. It’s the same thing, I could be totally into them or be invested in their life and then I kinda get bored and just let things fizzle out. Eh yikes right? Has anyone else experienced this? Or does anyone have any advice? 
3	This happens to me a lot. However, I'm not nearly as eloquent as you. I'll be brief. \nI always put open communication on the table immediately. It ensures that my partner knows I'm earnest. Then, I make sure to reenforce the traits I like with sincere compliments. If my partner and I split after getting close... It's cold turkey. They will usually understand because I've told them I only do things with honesty and openness. Continuing to talk would feel cheap. They usually know that too. 
3	There's always going to be some form of bs, unless the red flags a huge red flags if you're cutting people out of your life for petty things, and are absolutely ok with it there may be a different underlying probelm. likeing someone to the point where you obsess over them might be the problem to begin with because you start painting them a certain way when you haven't given yourself a chance to get to know them, so you mislead yourself on who the person really is and become weirded out or dissapointed when the persons veers from what you initially thought. Also I've learned sometimes some of our biggest flaws don't go away you just have to awknowledge them and try out other strategies. The people you're talking to might get the initial feelings that you're putting out, maybe they don't know how to deal with it either. Also I've been in situations where my ex at first really wanted attention and would get upset if she didn't get a certain amount of it and once I thought I got how much attention she liked, she'd flip it and ask me why I'm clingy. Which I'm not, but seeing that she somewhat groomed me into giving her a certain amount of attention It became natural until it wasn't. If certain problems are repetitive I'd definitely take the time to reflect if you may have aided in certain behaviors. It's really hard to give advice online because I don't really know you so all I can give you is a bunch of different situations that you might want to consider, that being said I hope I brought a different perspective to your situation.
1	Yeah I experience it quite often. I find me and my other xSTP friends have issues with relationships. It's different with guys I'm sure but a lot of girls don't like when I basically tell them they are crossing my boundaries, don't respect my boundaries, and a lot of them don't wanna communicate their issues with me and beat around the bush when I ask what's up or communicate my issues with the potential relationship. I get pretty blunt at times with them too which don't help when you're dating a more sensitive person but ignoring it will only cause issues in the future when you do start being blunt so it's best to be blunt from the start Imo otherwise you'll get the "you've changed I can't do this anymore" thing. Then again I also tend to date crazy girls so that may have something to do with it. Also when you cut them off do you just ghost them or do you straight up tell them you don't think it's gonna work? 
14	What happens when an ESTP doesn't socialize?	So I'm on the bench of rather I'm an istp in their WTF years or an ESTP who's stuck in a Ni grip. There's good reasons I think I'd fit in either one but I think I'm more of an ESTP whos in a Ni grip or even a neglected Se functioning. I don't wanna get all into it so if someone could just explain what would happen if an ESTP neglected their dominant functioning that'd be great.
14	We can tolerate a few days of not talking a lot to people, like weekends where we want to just chillax on our own. But then we start getting bored easily and want to talk to people and hang out places. This is where the bad stuff comes in.\n\nIt's the same as if you force an ESTP to stay in the house all day. We get angsty and want to start doing things to appease our Se. Whether that means running up and down the stairs, eating something, pacing, playing multiplayer games online with voice chat, etc., we need to be doing SOMETHING with ourselves/others or else we start getting easily irritable and annoyed. We might get into angry bursts of frustration, because "something/someone" is holding us back from being able to do what we want to do. We might start getting depressed too. Honestly, we just feel like a dog with their leash stuck to a pole outside. We see a lot of interesting things out there, but we are somewhat held back by an invisible force that causes us to get angry when someone comes near us and tries to mess up our mood even more. Mind you, this is after long periods of not being able to socialize. We start hating people around us and we become easy to anger. We get all argumentative and might even contemplate suicide because we don't find enjoyment in our lives. We start getting philosophical and all that.\n\n Until this "invisible force" is gone, we are able to call our own shots, and we have chilled out after the frustration of prolonged isolation, that we become ourselves.

3	They turn into an ENTP...
3	Lol honestly you sound JUST like one of my (extroverted) Estp friends. Just gonna throw that out there.\n\nOh and ISTPs find action scenarios engaging, but usually have a calm and quiet demeanor when engaging in them. Think Jason Statham in the Transporter series
1	In the most abstract way I can put it: [This video](https://youtu.be/T2DqAFeoqdk)\n\nThe spool represents my brain, the chain represents my happiness/tranquility, and the hole represents lack of social contact
7	Stubbornness and willingness to make mistakes	Any ESTPs relate?\n\nIt's like when people tell us specifically NOT to do something (Don't miss a day of class! Don't put your hand on the mouse trap! Don't try to swim in canals!), it's like it's holding us back from actually knowing why we shouldn't do it? \n\nIt almost gives us a rush to go against what people tell us not to do. And when we do it, (and we survive), we say it's not so bad... or if it does backfire hard, we accept/respect the rule and never do it again.  We do know there are absolutely stupid things that you cannot do, but there are things that we think is possible to do, so we see if we can do it.\n\nLike, I enjoy pushing the boundaries of what I'm told not to do, and when I do push the boundaries I  actually learn more than someone simply shaking their finger at me and saying "No".\n\nThis behavior seems to help us for future things, like assessing levels of risk, also giving us endurance and an optimistic attitude.\n\n&#x200B;
5	Yes. And if you want me to not do stuff, better just tell me that I have to do it. 
3	This is me all over. \n\nPeople want to keep you down. Most of the time when people say it’s for your own good, they mean it’s for their own good. 
2	For me it's also funny seeing them freak out over little things that don't matter. Like jumping over a wall, teachers yell and scream at me because "I could get hurt!" When it's not even ten feet off the ground\n\nPeople need to chill out sometimes lol
8	ESTP Cognitive functions and four sides of the mind EXPLAINED	
2	What are your thoughts?\n\n&#x200B;
2	I agree with his take on extraverted sensing, you see this clearly in ESFPs who want to be the life of the party and give people good experiences. This is because of their dominant Se function. Thank-you for sharing this, im going to be looking at more of his videos
31	ESTPs and knowing how “the system” works	I feel like I figure out how “the system” works really quickly in a situation, which lets me get away with so much shit. Combine that with good persuasion and I can get out of almost every problem. Anybody relate? I feel like ESTPs look really reckless and overconfident because we know exactly how much we can get away with.
17	Yeah same.\n\nI wanted to know what the point of going to school for \~22 years, getting a job, retire, and all this BS I was being forced to do. Then the system all looked like a game to me, with all these rules, who wins and who loses, etc. Eventually realizing that you really don't have to play, or you can decide to play and bend the rules to your favor, which makes life all the more interesting.\n\nQuoting this from a song, but I relate a lot:\n\n"And it seems like a waste of time. If that's what it's all about. Good luck movin' up because I'm movin' out."\n\nI feel like other ESTPs just get this. They don't like being boxed in by the "system" so they strive to see what the whole point of it is and how it works, then they observe what works for them and just do it. This is sort of why we get overconfident with things, because we *expect* things to play out like it should, but life doesn't work that way all the time. I guess this can also explain why we are optimists, because we see how rules can easily be manipulated as well as people, and that we can also change ourselves for the better by looking over what troubles us. Observing people being so caught up by things in "the system" seems like a joke almost, because we know there is more to life than what you are expected by everyone else to do.
15	Yeah I kinda know what you mean \n\nHonestly just remain calm and not rude and you can pretty much get out of anything \n\nSometimes you need to take a small hit to pull off the biggest heists. Some people can't/won't take that hit
8	Relate. And the less time we are given, the more competitive edge I think we have over others in getting out of a situation.
6	Recklessly overconfident - I've literally been called this by a friend. But then again, it usually works out so I don't have to "learn my lesson".
6	I'd even say those of us with a less dominant presence would be victims of bullying from others who think of us as assholes by just being ourselves and can get alienated by others rather easily. Thank god for Aux Ti and tert Fe.
8	How extroverted are you guys?	It's often said that Se-doms are the most extroverted extroverts, and I want to know if this holds true for any of you. Also, does anyone here consider themselves introverts or leaning more on the introverted side of things?
35	If you met me in real life you'd probably think I was some INTP or something. I'm very introverted in real life because there are a lot of people I don't bother to talk to, unless they strike my interest or I need something from them. I can be the loudest person in the room if I'm comfortable, but usually I'm not because I like to get the feeling about the people around me first and adjust accordingly. 
6	I'm an introvert who's good with people. Definitely not extroverted, that's why I often doubt that I might be an ISTP. But all descriptions of ESTP just always seem to fit more for me than ISTP.\n\nSo either I'm either an extroverted ISTP or an introverted ESTP. All I know is that I definitely have Fe in 3rd place and Ni in 4th. Still not certain whether I'm a Ti dom or an Se dom.\n\nI've seen quite a few people who are also struggling with deciding if they're ISTP or ESTP. 
4	Not every ESTP is so extraverted some of us are ambiverted
5	Probably not the most extroverted guy out there; more like being much less shy when it comes to doing stuff most other people would be shy to do 
5	I’m quiet until someone gives me a reason and opportunity to talk. My ISFP friend summed it up best once in a conversation:\n\n“He’s good at starting talking”\n\nISFP: “…and doesn’t stop”
2	💯 
2	Y’all are so cute 😊
1	I’m in the middle. Slightly on the extroverted side. So it comes out a lot at work or socially but then I’ll disappear for a while. 
8	I have a 13yo ESTP son with ADD.	Hi everyone,\nMy husband (INTP) and I (ENFP) have a 13yo son. He also has a 19yo sister (INTJ) and 17yo brother (ENTJ). Recently he was diagnosed with ADD and tested gifted/talented in some areas. Made total sense :)\n\nHe’s wonderful in a thousand ways... but also fiercely logical and independent. He’ll become an awesome adult one day.\n\nI’d like some advice from this group because my ENFP ways are so foreign to his. Even his father finds him a challenge. There’s a lot of love/warmth in this home, but there’s always room for more connection.\n\nI adore him but need advice on how to connect with him in ways that make school, family, meds, life more meaningful for him.\n\nHe’s more than your average teen... and I’m glad!\n\n(I still get a hug and a smile... when I ask.)\n\nTL;DR How do we all show love/connection to our ESTP son/brother in a way that makes sense to him?
9	Just some thoughts. ESTPs are the type to be most likely misdiagnosed with ADD and ADHD. I’m not saying he was misdiagnosed, but it’s definitely something to be aware of. Everyone thought I had ADHD when I was younger. I too am a ESTP and was a “gifted” student. ESTPs are really good at finding solutions to problems without digging as deep as say an INTP would. Once they have a general sense for the problem and a potential solution, they tend to get bored and move on to the next. This, along with their P tendency to wake up and “take on the day” without a pre-planned schedule like their J counterparts, can make them appear really scattered. \n\nWhether or not he truly has ADD, I think that our personality type really starts to flourish when our brain matures. It becomes easier to recognize the downfalls of an ESTP and give more focus to one task at a time. Your son is still really young, and he’s probably fascinated by his mind’s ability to find quick but surface-level solutions to problems and then immediately jump to new problems. Let him explore his mind. And maybe start to challenge him on certain topics where he believes he’s found the solution, but hasn’t yet considered points A, B, or C. Since he’s still young, he’ll likely get frustrated by these deep dives but I can guarantee it will be one of the best things you can do for his developing mind. \n\nAlso, if you are able to successfully do this, he’ll develop an incredible sense of respect for you. He probably won’t show it now, but when he’s older he’ll look back and truly appreciate your ability to challenge him and help him grow.
5	Mmmmh, interesting question. \n\nI think that it could be good if u get interested in his activities. Ask him questions, try it maybe. We love a lot to speak about what we love and do.\n\nAlso, make him feel that he can talk of anything with you. \nFor example, with my parents we never speak about sex, drugs or anything like that.\n\nSo be direct with him, tell him that if he got any problems or want to talk of anything (say the tabou words like drugs sex), he doesnt have to hesitate.\nBut don't force him. He just have to know that u're here in case of need.\nAlso, but i think u already do that, and it's not only with ESTP, don't judge him on what he does.\nU can tell him what u would do, what he had to do, but don't judge.\nBe in reflection with him. And explain ur decisions if u punish him. We hate illogic things. \n\nIdk if it will help you, because idk how I was when I was 13 and idk ur son, but I think it would have worked with me 
4	I'm an ESTP guy with an ENFP sister. We're definitely completely opposite in terms of character and especially how we make important decisions in life. \n\n  \nAll I remember from when I was 13, was that I didn't really want anything from my parents. I just wanted them to stay the hell out of my life. As you said, we're fiercely independent. My sister and I both had a lot of friends and we were both sociable, but unlike her, I did not have the need to talk to my parents about my life. I did not feel the need to "connect" with them. And even today, I still talk a lot less to them about myself to my parents than she does. \n\n  \nI guess just being there for him is all you can do, and I wouldn't be too worried about connecting. Just make sure he stays on the right path during his puberty and if he's a good guy, and I'm sure he is, when he starts to mature, he'll also start appreciating you more.  \n\n\nI think it's typical for ENFPs to feel the need to connect to people, but for us ESTPs that's really not a must, not even with our own parents. \n\n&#x200B;
2	Support him in his sports/activities
2	Ok, I also am an ESTP with ADHD. (15)\n\nLove for me is when someone is interested in what I'm saying, does things my interest and is genuinely worried when something happened to me and caring. I don't put much value in I love you's if that the thing I hear.\n\nIf someone supports my art that's huge for me.

6	How can I make an ESTP happy?	Hey guys, ISFP here. Simple question. How can I make an ESTP happy and fulfilled, and get on their good side? 
31	- Be direct about everthing, no hiddin agendas\n- take them on adventures, or go along when they want to go\n- Dont try to “limit” their freedom. \n- Dont overcomplicate things and problems, for them its “just what it is”.\n\nENTP female with ESTP boyfriend. 
5	Also, we have inferior Ni so we are sometimes prone to fear of the future, or assuming the worst case. We'll rarely say that openly (unless you're very close), so sometimes telling us things will be fine is good. Or better yet, encouraging us to do things we don't want to do, so we stop thinking about what might happen, and start seeing what actually happens.
3	Something I've noticed that my ENFP friend does whenever I'm feeling down, which always works, is taking me somewhere. Be it the park, a museum, the mall, a friend's place, a restaurant, you name it!  Any experience always cheers me up. Especially if it's something completely new to me. But this is more if the ESTP is already unhappy.\n\nSome tips for keeping them happy and content.\n- Try not to shoot down the ESTP's every idea/take part in their impulsive desires every now and then/indulge in their hobbies with them.\n- Say what's on your mind, instead of beating around the bush. If they ask you if you're upset, then don't say "No" if you are, in fact, upset.\n- Ask them for help with a problem. Nothing is more exciting than trying to think of new and effective solutions.\n- Don't expect them to talk feelings all the time, as this can be very uncomfortable and draining for most ESTPs.\n- Accept them for who they are. ESTPs are generally very tolerant and not very likely to judge you, and prefers the same treatment. They might give you shit about some things, but it's really just banter. Deep down they don't care.
2	You don't get or make us do anything, it either will or it won't. If they see it in you, you're off to the races 
2	Ask them if they could explain you something, then listen attentively and follow their advice. Also challenge them from time to time to be better at things than they currently are.
3	Upvote my comment lol
13	The rush of a good chase .	How many of you are addicted to the rush of chasing things like a goal or even while riding / driving or basically to get something you want badly like matters related to  passion or purpose especially when it gets difficult.\n\n
8	That is one of the things that make me tick. I think it's also one of the things that define ESTP's.\nI feel kinda lost after I've achieved something I wanted really bad
3	Spends hours looking for a great deal. Minutes after buying it. Wait a minute I didn't need this.
5	Got cut off by another car on the highway. No dude you deserve the same thing. Chased and cut him off. It's now all cool.
2	🙋🏽‍♀️
1	I mean yeah, that's why I get out of bed in the morning.
1	Yes I relate to this.\n\nI don't know why, but even the act of physically driving, taking the bus, train, or walking to the places I need to go to helps me feel happier and more accomplished in life.\n\nI feel even more accomplished if I get there myself, albeit faster than the rest. It sort of becomes a mini accomplishment of mines to brag about. 
11	Outgrowing friends quickly.	Any of you find yourself outgrowing your friends/ people quickly and find them boring after learning something from them and  move on. 
10	Most people I meet are normies and normies are inherently boring.
6	I found this especially true to my multitude of friends I had in highschool. After college, they become a completely different person and I no longer become friends with them. It's only the friends that really share the same characteristics, that I am still friends with.
1	Reading this and just realized how many friends I used to be so close and now so disconnected. This is quite true. 
1	Change is normal it’s for the b-est. you don’t love the same things we loved in preschool, same favorite foods , same favorite activities. we all change it’s just the friends that stayed the same that we leave behind , the friends that don’t develop with us, can’t hangout because they’re in the same shitty jobs. Those are the ones we leave behind.
1	Finding my old group to be a bunch of sjw who I have to dance around so I dont offend them. 
13	[Edgy] Do you guys find people predictable?	Edgy opinion, but I do tend to find people predictable. I also hear fellow ESTPs can relate to this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMBTI just makes it easier as a tool. But in general, I tend to only need to observe someone for an hour or maybe even first impressions, and I already get the gist of what the person is and what would best suit their needs. I can easily change my "face" to suit their personality, so I have no problems making friends with almost anyone. Sometimes it just comes off so easily to me, that I find it a game and I would provoke certain people for the fun of it (and to confirm my aspects of similar people I already subconsciously know about).\n\nFor example, I tend to troll others just to confirm what I know will fire back at me, also for fun too. I just find it entertaining to confirm how I predict people will react a certain way or something.\n\nIt becomes some kind of practice. **Super edgy**, but just listen a bit... every butthurt comment I get (in response to troll threads I post), I keep an aspect of that personality in my collection of how I can act with these specific people and almost blend in to suit them. \n\n**TL;DR Example:** \n\n1. Post meat in vegan forum\n2. Vegans get mad and start spouting their opinions \n3. Somehow take in their opinions, observe their profile pictures, their usernames, the way they form their text, and create my own "vegan advocate" persona.\n4. Become nearly indistinguishable from the average vegan whenever I want to\n\nType stuff if you relate fam
11	Yes, it’s quite easy for me to be as uncharacteristically professional or as ghetto as I want in order to blend in with a certain crowd. What’s still difficult is to stick to the way I really want to be. 
6	Yes, people are often very predictable. But they are equally unpredictable. For every ten guys who ignore your troll there will be one who responds. So I wouldn't become too arrogant. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways, trolling is a big waste of time. The internet does not equal real life, you don't actually learn anything on the internet in terms of other peoples' character.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn the internet it's way easier to insult people or to get dragged into a useless argument. That's why there are so many trollers and trolled people. In real life they'll probably just ignore you because it's more tiresome to get into a discussion IRL, and more confrontational.\n\nInstead of trolling on line you could give people sincere compliments in real life. That way you're doing the same thing but you're actually doing something useful for yourself and others!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
4	I too find it easy to determine a persons personality in a short period of time. My issue is trying to not project my own thought process/morality on to that person. I’m often let down thinking others respect personal space (public transportation),  conversation (talking too long about nothing and or themselves), simple manners the way I do. I suppose that’s a personal issue but wonder if being able to predict people’s behavior, you also allow yourself to be let down by complete strangers. 
3	I completely relate with you on this. I’ve personally found that people generally fit into archetypes and I think it’s our instinct for people that allows us to adapt and somewhat turn into a mirror for personalities. I like to think that it’s has to do with ESTPs refusing to fit into these molds that make us see personalities at a higher level.
3	Obviously if you go to a vegan site people are going to act like vegans on that vegan site\n\nJust like if you went to a church people will put on a "Church" face. (Depending on the church of course)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe problem is trying to break through that "face" and finding out what a person really cares about/is like in other areas of life. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSomebody at school may hate school and look depressed all the time but outside of school are a total blast to hang out with... just one example there.
2	I think most mentally stable people are predictable, we have ours ways and we like them\n\n\nThat being said, I agree and do it too
2	Yes, PnssyDestroyer. I have no idea how, but as an INFJ you really just described me very well. I do the same thing to people. Everyone has a collection of traits that they show. These traits are observable and understood. You recognize what groups they fall into. Everyone, in my head, is a combination of different archetypes. These archetypes are not really something that exist in the outside world (like "geek" or "jock"), but they're arbitrary ones I have in my head. I do it unconsciously, and then when someone talks for a while, or tells me enough about them, I can pretty much place the rest of their personality. I know this seems arrogant, but I'm usually actually right. Some people can get mad when you do this, but I think they're more upset that you can read them really well and that they aren't as unique as they originally thought. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's not my fault that, left to their own devices, people do tend to center around the same couple of ideas. A lot of it has to do with mass culture and hive minded tendencies. People surround themselves with those that they agree with, and never really strive to change their opinions, so they end up acting the same and it makes my job so much easier. That's why I'm careful to not subscribe to any particular faction, ideology, or group too heavily. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also am a massive troll, and am somehow very edgy for an INFJ. I can go in threads and piss people off with my opinions and make it 100% believable. I could be a flat-earther or might even convince others that I'm an extreme vegan and pose some ridiculous political ideology that runs parallel to the holocaust for meat-eaters / fur wearers. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's why I'm always attracted towards extremely weird or unordinary people. I can't type them down and need more info about them. 
1	I do agree with you.\nBut it's more like "i know if he will bore me" and generally i need like less than one minute to know that.\nAnd if they bore me, it's easy to know how they are.\nPeople are often predictible.\n\n It's pretty boring

7	I have no idea what to do in life advice?	So i have been taking some test and i’m \ndefinitely. The problem is that i hate school soooo much. I want to do stuff and not sit on a chair the whole day. I’m in my last year of my degree but i hate everyday of it. Advice? Really know idea of a career choice. \n
7	Shit sucks but ESTPs can get through all kinda shit and make it through the other side. I thought about dropping out but my degree was probably one of the best things I got. Just gotta take each day as it comes and realise you only get one go so dont fuck it up. Sooner you get it out the way the sooner you can go and fuck around in Thailand or somth.
4	Business / Sports. But to have a job in sales you need to follow a education. But i think you don’t learn the business stuff in school. All the great entrepreneurs say that all the time (elon musk, gary vaynerchuck) the list goes on.  
3	You'll need to give some more context if you want people to give you some valuable help.\n\nHow old are you?What are your ambitions in life?Do you want to go to university?What are your interests?Are you intelligent?\n\nWhere do you live?\n\nAre you able to discipline yourself?How much do you want to work?\n\nAre you good with people?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you want to make a good career choice, you'll have to know yourself first. Not knowing what you want to do is not a problem if you're young. 
2	What are your interests?
2	So I'm an ESTP and I've done school on the side of what I've been doing for about the last ten years. I'll talk about that first and then talk about career stuff, maybe some of it will helpful. \n\nWhat works for me is to cheat. I can only do things that I think are fun and that I can figure out how to market - so I try to turn it into a game and figure out exactly what about each thing I'm doing is valuable and marketable. Then I create a situation in which it's way more costly for me to get bored and give up so I have to finish it. I came from being super poor so I find that forcing myself to pay it out of pocket makes me so mad at how expensive it all is (in the US) that I have to finish it out of spite for all the rich brats.\n\nFor life, I dunno man - beats me. I'm 27 and I'm on my third career - and I got HERE by flipping a coin. Before this, I had 22 different odd jobs, according to some stuff I had to recently fill out. I've lived in three countries and seven different states, some multiple times, in the last ten years. I'm doing pretty well for myself, I spend money on whatever is fun at the time and I do whatever I want. I think the key is just to never worry too much about planning but to always pick things that add value to your background that are fun. If it looks good that you did it, it's easy to bounce back when you get bored. Military is a double edged sword but if you play it right, you can have a new job every year. Physical things are more stimulating for me, but those are tough to find in the civilian world, so sometimes the best I've found is mechanical things that I can do with my hands like working with cars or computers (or language, depending on how you look at it).
24	?? How do you talk to NTs ??	Ello \n\nSo is it just me or is it that there is some disconnect when I talk to NTs? It's like they are in a different world and I can feel they are perceiving us through a different lense which I don't understand.\n\nLike for example, trying to break the ice with NTs, I try to randomly think of big ideas like (What would happen if scientists use the DNA of a mammoth and put it in a female elephant will it work??) and they get all flabbergastic about this and start talking. \n\nI personally find the idea interesting, but it's not something I would enjoy talking about consistently. Where as, NTs, can talk about it forever / go on long tangents, which pisses me off internally after a certain time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe only NTs which I can realistically tolerate for lengthy periods of conversations are **ENTJ**s. Perhaps because I can pitch them some great ideas which have a connection to reality, and they give me great suggestions on how to work it and if it will be successful, and sometimes they become interested and want to work with me. I enjoy conversations that I can end up applying afterwards, which seems to mesh well with ENTJs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI struggle talking to types such as **INTJ/INTP** and **ENTP**s. With ENTPs, I have to think about some LOL RANDOM XD unrealistic idea or show them a politically incorrect meme to get them talking and then end up debating with which give me a headache because I don't caaaareee. INTJs seem like an enigma to me and they either come off as rude and standoffish (ignore any attempts to make conversation), or become critical/give favor about what I talk about and then not talk anything even though it was like 1 sentence long. INTPs are just far out there and start going down the rabbit hole of what I just talked about towards different ideas which is a headache and I have to stop them from talking too much.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR-**\n\nSo how do you talk with NTs? How do you not get a headache with them? \n\nIt's like every time I talk with an NT, I ALWAYS have to give them something interesting. I can't do some small talk like normal people do because some get completely turned off by that and I want to be friends with them. Thanks guys.
21	NT's? Sorry just answering based off your headline, you offer them Pizza, they love pizza. No offense if you're a Ninja Turtle and you don't.
21	INTJ here...I think the easiest way to talk to an INTJ is to minimise your expectations of a response, and prepare yourself for some intense silences. It doesn't mean we don't like you, but yes we're judging you. Don't take it personally, and it's more a cool detached kind of judging to see if we'll invest time in you. We do that with everything! If I'm going to invest time in (read: have a conversation with) you, I think I respond most to authenticity, genuineness, and intelligence.
18	If someone is that far out there in terms of me connecting with them, I just...don’t bother. \n\nMy best friend is ENTP and I know a few NTJ’s. Got no problem connecting as they usually have awesome senses of humor. \n\nMaybe you’re overthinking things. 
15	As an INTJ I couldn’t make any friends with any type other than INTPs ISFPs INTJs ENTPs INFPs never met an ENTJ or INFJ, didn’t like ENFP/ENFJs, and one ESFJ friend that I don’t think he is an ESFJ...\n\nI don’t talk much with anyone other than INTPs i love them they are great.\n\nTo be fair idk if i met all S’ types but most of my friends (before knowing about MBTI) turned out to be NT’s. \n\n(I don’t choose friends based on MBTI thats stupid, i just find a person that i like and start talking to him/ her.)
14	INTJ here. I have a good(?) friend who is ESTP and we get along great...in certain circumstances. My issue with her - apart from seeing her increasingly as _very_ opportunistic (that in itself is troublesome b/c we appreciate genuine, loyal friends) - is that I find her equal parts exhausting and boring. Exhausting b/c she _never_ stops doing: “LET’S GET BREAKFAST”, then “LET’S GO TO THE POOL”, then “LET’S GO SHOPPING”, then “LET’S HAVE A BBQ” and all in the same day sort of thing. Now, that could all be fine, _but_ as you’re doing all of these things, she _cannot_ have a meaningful convo about anything - has literally said “Why do we have to talk about these things, LET’S TALK ABOUT BOYS”. So, you’re exhausted from socializing, but bored to death with absolutely no mental stimulation. We (or at least, I) like to talk about ideas or what’s going on in our life/world and how it _relates_ to other people/things. Make a connection with what they’re talking about and don’t try too hard - have fun with the conversation/them - as another ESTP said, we often do have a great sense of humor. But, we can also sniff out a disingenuous person from a mile away. 
10	Small talk doesn't address **any** of my wants or values. Small talk is a means to an end, making enough trust, cohesion, or familiarity to get something done, not a goal in and of itself. Pulling myself out of my thoughts to communicate with others is effort, and effort requires a payout. \n\n> give me a headache because I don't caaaareee.\n\nWhy would I want to participate in a conversation you don't care about? Do you think I care?! Conversation is effort, if neither of us care why would I put in effort? This is what I believe you are getting from INTJs.\n\nI would (and do) just talk broadly about things you are passionate about, if you both care enough about similar things maybe a good conversation will be had, if not then you will not have a good conversation.
11	>*I personally find the idea interesting, but it's not something I would enjoy talking about consistently.* \n\nINTP here. Chances are the INTP you're talking to feels the same way about the idea, but is continuing on the train of thought because *you* seemed interested in it & they know firsthand what it's like to be interested in something wacky but not have anyone to talk to about it. The rabbit trails are inherent to the type, but *communicating them to you* is the INTP's attempt to reciprocate in the conversation. (Plus it's rare for an INTP to come across someone willing to have those kinds of conversations, so they're going to grab that bull by the horns and not let go if they can help it.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>*NTs, can talk about it forever / go on long tangents, which pisses me off internally after a certain time.*  \n>  \n>*With ENTPs, I have to... end up debating with which give me a headache because I don't caaaareee.*  \n>  \n>*INTJs... either \[ignore any attempts to make conversation\], or become critical/give favor about what I talk about and then not talk....*  \n>  \n>*INTPs are just far out there and... I have to stop them from talking too much.*\n\nI totally get how a person can feel like this, but\n\n>*I want to be friends with them.*\n\n...do you **really**?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI mean, I'm sorry--that probably came off as harsh. It's just that after reading that, my understanding is that it seems less like you want **to develop meaningful friendships** with these specific people, and more like you want **to be the sort of person who's friendly** with all sorts of people.\n\nAnd that's fine, but it means that regardless of the topics you bring up, *you're still ultimately engaging in small talk.*\n\nI think that's probably the biggest contributing factor in the disconnect you're feeling. You're engaging these types in a "small talk" manner, but with all the trappings of "**not-**small-talk." So in a way it's like you fooled them into thinking this wasn't going to just be chitchat. But it ends up backfiring on you, because they took your engagement at face value and wore you out.\n\nSo to circle back to your original question/topic, **how do you talk to NTs?** Deeply, or not at all (generally speaking).
9	INTJ - usually not much talk, just hang with them and do stuff \nINTP - ask them to copy their homework, or sometimes exam \nENTJ - give them aesthetics advice and receive financial advices in return \nENTP - exchange sarcastic/dark jokes and laugh our heads off 
10	If I understand some of the cognitive functions correctly (I'm very new to MBTI and very old to you), here is the problem, as I am seeing it.\n\nYou think in a linear fashion. \n\nThe Intuitives and we are a minority,  think laterally.\n\nCombine that with a Ni's inherent Breadth of Curiosity and your own innate Trait Curiosity ( I do not know if you have breadth of curiosity and mean no insult)\n\nhowever, this makes communication difficult for both of us, when we want to communicate.
7	I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:\n\n- [/r/intj] [A post on r\/estp on how to talk to NTs I found pretty interesting](https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/9mxxf6/a_post_on_restp_on_how_to_talk_to_nts_i_found/)\n\n&nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))*
7	As an INTJ, this would piss me off. It feels like you are more interested in me as a collector's item for your group of friends than an actual person. I wouldn't want to just be the awkward token friend. 
6	>With ENTPs, I have to think about some LOL RANDOM XD unrealistic idea or show them a politically incorrect meme to get them talking and then end up debating with which give me a headache because I don't caaaareee. INTJs seem like an enigma to me and they either come off as rude and standoffish (ignore any attempts to make conversation), or become critical/give favor about what I talk about and then not talk anything even though it was like 1 sentence long. INTPs are just far out there and start going down the rabbit hole of what I just talked about towards different ideas which is a headache and I have to stop them from talking too much.  \n  \nBest descriptions I've ever read 👍  \n  \nIn general acting like their own type or the complete letter-opposite (ENTP->ISFJ) gives the best results. Focus on Ne or Si for the ENTP, Fe or Ti for the INTP etc. I just don't know if you could keep that up for too long.
4	That's totally true.. I already got some friends NT's and sometimes they put attention to whatever i say. \n\nWhen i going to meeting them i read a lot of thing just to have something that sound interesting to them cuz they already know what i going to talk about and they going to be bored so faster. 
4	Two of my best friends are intp (my room mate)  and entp.\nI have any problem to communicate with them.\nI'm maybe less in their World, but they are very interesting and very funny.\nI'm never bored with them.\n\nBtw, yes they dont like smalltalks when they are useless.\nBut i dont especially talk about that too
1	(INTJ here). The only thing I have in common with ESTP's is that we both like to party.
1	>  INTPs are just far out there and start going down the rabbit hole of what I just talked about towards different ideas which is a headache and I have to stop them from talking too much. \n\nWell, I could totally see this happening but usually, INTPs who are socially somewhat adjusted could definitely see that you're not interested in their abstract theories and they would know that most people wouldn't be interested in such things so they won't really talk about it if you didn't bring up that topic.\n\nI have xSTP friends that I am close with and I know that they are not interested in my abstract theories. When I am with them I talk about ideas that are more applicable to real life and generally my experiences and we communicate through Ti so it's fairly easier to relate.\n\nIt's not like I hate conversations about real life stuff that is concrete but I do prefer abstract convos about ideas and theories. AND I also do realize that I can't do that with most of the population so I adjusted myself to it. Therefore, it is good on your part to talk about abstract stuff with INTPs from time to time but you don't really have to force yourself to do so all the time just for the sake of opening up a conversation. :)
4	I created a subreddit for MBTI Music stuff .... share your playlists !	I think ESTPs have awesome music selections. Me and my ESTP friends can just spend time listening to music all day and have a blast topping each other ! I guess there are more of us techno snobs, closet indie heads out there.\n\nI find it notoriously difficult to find ESTP musicians ! My most recent find was [Slaves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmtU-bLyReU) and needlessly to say the replay button was raped. \n\n[The Who](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN5zw04WxCc), [Pearl Jam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MS91knuzoOA) band heads seem ESTP to me ! It's a difficult type but I would say [John Peel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Peel) is good example of the Promoter archetype usually assigned to ESTPs.\n\nFeel free to post whatever here -> https://www.reddit.com/r/MBTIRadioStation/ <- \n\n\n\n 
1	Slaves are fucking awesome bro
17	Do you feel like people are intimidated by you?	For example, at work, sometimes my colleagues are surprised I make jokes with them or partake in their banter, but they always seem really positive about the fact that I do. Then one day, I might not feel like being very social and generally keep to myself or try to initiate conversations. The differences in how I behave I think makes people a bit unsure about how to behave around me.
9	I've been told on more than one occasion that I am aggressive when all I've ever done is talk to them, lol. sometimes people are just pussies, and thats not my problem. \n\nI'll admit I'm pretty full on and I do enjoy putting pressure on people just to see how they react, but really its all just good fun, at the end of it all I dont really care all that much.
9	This exactly. I can sense it as my colleagues are silently baffled by the unexpected change in my demeanor. It’s also quite funny when some of them start to go off on a tangent and ask me random questions presumably to evaluate whether I’m mad at them or something. 
5	Yes, I supposed that's what people feel when they don't act normally around me sometimes. \n\nI tend to have the persona to outsiders as just a quiet and peaceful person that doens't talk much unless interested/told to. When I randomly express my strong opinion on something, or tell a satirical/politically incorrect joke to a person I know can handle it, the people around me start acting all weird because they don't expect it, when in the inside I am the person I hide and only share on special occasions. \n\nI don't take this as being intimidated, but more of that the person is very unpredictable and hiding lots of things which give into unsureness and intrigue. 
4	I definitely square up to people I’m suspicious of. I’m a nice person, but sometimes I have to make sure people aren’t gonna do something behind my back (snitching, mainly)
2	I was one of the “leaders” in my friend group at church, in youth group and after I left the church and stopped talking to the majority of them (Love drama) they started acting differently and my friend there told me that they acted differently around me and are doing things now they wouldn’t ever do around me. So you’re definitely not the only one, and some of them were always trying to impress me or if I act weird/tired they’d think I’m mad at them. Trying to say that in the least cocky way as possible 
2	Yeah a lot of people are unsure about me as well for the same reason. I've asked several people why they acting differently after I start talking again and most of them say they thought they pissed me off or something like that. Im not sure if they are intimidated, afraid of confrontation, or just don't know how to effectively communicate with others but either way it's funny. 
18	Ever feel like a paradox or something?	Sorta like ENTPs (introverted extroverts)\n\nI tend to have a persona in real life that I show as quiet, chill, somewhat intellectual, and submissive. But if you knew me at home, I’m a fucking politically incorrect savage that likes going out and having fun.\n\nI don’t show my real self unless I’m comfortable around the people I’m with, so I get mistyped a lot. \n\nAnyone relate to the persona thing?
14	Yeah completely.. I feel like I come across as the most boring and basic person when you meet me but after I’m fully comfortable with someone I’m like super obnoxious LOL 
7	I think this is Fe in action. We know that you need to act tactfully around some people and can let the leash out on others. It takes time to suss out if people are into unPC jokes and stuff. 
5	Yes, I do relate. Not everybody gets to experience the kind of animal that defines me. 
5	Yess, I do really recognize myself in this! Thought I was weird for being like this, but there are many others :)
2	I guess everybody has a face that they put on when different situations arise. \n\nLike if somebody was threatening you with a knife, would you start shivering/express your emotions or try to remain calm?\n\nPutting on faces is a normal and logical thing to do... Maybe to an extent it can be bad though
2	I’m the opposite
1	I think a lot of people think that just because you're shy, then you aren't an extrovert. Which isn't true.
