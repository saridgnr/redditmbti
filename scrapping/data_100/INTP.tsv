262	PSA: You are all moderators.	To start off, I *do* think link flair is a good idea and makes it easy to quickly identify the type of discussions you want to read.  This is something that I will work on this week.  \n\nEvery once in a while there's a flare up of people asking for hands on moderation.\n\nI've said this from the very start when I was brought on as a moderator to do garbage duty with the spam queue and to add to the sidebar:\n\nI really don't care to police content, nor do I think omfgninja does.  There is no reason to on reddit; that's literally the whole point of the site and the reason user voting is such a popular format for content/discussion on the internet for the past few years.  It allows everyone to feel a degree of control and relevance regardless of whether they participate or contribute directly.  Invariably the content which is most popular with the largest amount of people will be the most successful. \n\nIf it really bothers you that someone is shitposting, or saying something that really rambles your jambourines, all it takes is 5 of you to downvote it and then no one else will have to see those hurtful words on their computer monitors.\n\nIf there is obvious spam, report it and I will 9/10 times see it within a day.  That's the most control I would ever see necessary for a select few people to have over the content on a broad discussion subreddit like this.  Who am I or anyone else to decide what the thousands of active members like to see?  \n\nFor the record, I hate circlejerky PersonalityCafe-esque shitposts such as:\n\n* DAE THIS AN INTP THING?\n* DO ANY OTHER INTPS HAVE A VERY DIFFICULT TIME BEING VERY SMART AND INTERACTING WITH OTHER HUMANS WHO ARE LESS SMART? \n* MAN I HATE HOW SMART AND LAZY I AM.  WHY AM I NOT MAKING $150k A YEAR YET?\n* WHAT IS OBJECTIVELY THE BEST CAREER FOR INTPS (ESPECIALLY ONES WHO ARE REALLY SMART BUT HATE DETAILS AND DISLIKE SOCIAL INTERACTION BUT LIKE LOGIC AND RATIONALITY)?\n\nThis type of shit is the worst on /r/INTJ.  It's not as bad here but it happens.  I still don't see any reason to remove it because if more people disliked it than it wouldn't have a positive score.  It really doesn't bother me to downvote something stupid and stop caring about it 10 seconds later.\n\ntl;dr: the moderation team here is literally fucking useless and don't even read the subreddit and just dont want to do any work.  i don't even think they have internet access.  honestly i hope they kill themselves IRL.  also, why am I not a moderator yet?  I read this subreddit LITERALLY more than anyone else, and one downvote isn't enough for me.  also, i called jungle in lobby and this guy instalocked without even saying anything WTF please all 9 report after game im way too sick of dealing with trolls in this game dude.  my teams always throw and i'd be like 5k mmr in dota, this game just has too many feeders.  i can't believe i'm being forced to play this stupid game.  i wish the guy with the gun here would just fucking leave.
145	> the moderation team here is literally fucking useless and don't even read the subreddit and just dont want to do any work.\n\nSo, INTP's?
62	That tl;dr though. 
44	All hail our absentee gods. Those are the best kind.
23	Yeah, c'mon. This place isn't even at 20k subscribers yet. The real problems don't even begin until you hit 50k and start getting linked in askreddit comments on a weekly basis.
20	If given the mod permissions, I could throw down some Naut and make [this popular post](http://imgur.com/wG1NCkX) the header image. I don't know much about CSS, but it's something.
12	I wish my subreddit was reasonable enough for this kind of talking to.
11	I think the voting mechanism is ineffective as a quality filter in large subreddits, but this one is small enough so that the current regime is sufficient.
10	> I was brought on as a moderator to do garbage duty\n\nthus is the heavy burden of the mod
31	I immediately like you after reading this

10	I honestly think most of the people here who want to be mods just want to see what it's like to have an extra button or two and a green name.\n\nDAE want to be mod?\n\nDAE mods r gey?\n\nDAE INTP?\n\nFor the record, your style of moderating seems fine.
18	I want to be a mod :( \n\nBut only to jazz up the CSS this shit is boring as fuck, can we get some /r/naut up in this bitch? 
7	The circlejerky posts you list are the rite of passage of any new intp to the sub, the most important questions on his mind on which he would like opinions of others like him. Heck, even more older (irl or in this sub) intps might like any new insights with regards to normal human functions (smalltalk, name-remembering, career and relationships) as this can be a life long struggle.
9	This is honestly the best mod policy. \n\nToo many mods in other subreddits get on fucking teenage power trips and start to police content for no reason other than stroke their own egos. Thanks for being chill, /r/intp mods 
5	Weow
3	Will the real slim shady please stand up?
7	Yeah, I hate the guy with the gun too ^^^^hoho ^^^^haha

3	Is this a reaction to my iron hold over r/ENTJ?
3	Hahaha!!! Upvoted for the "shitpost" examples.
3	All hail the mostly uncaring Gods!\n\nSeriously though I think the mods do fine.  I don't see any obvious spam.  I think the DAE and OMG IM SMART posts just means some of the posters are 14.  That's fine.  Let people circle jerk a bit.  I can just skip over the thread.\n\nI do find career discussions personally interesting, but I've never really found good answers in them.
3	LoL>DotA
3	10/10. This was hilarious.
3	This is how a community of INTP's should be anyways. Fuck the hierarchical bullshit.
2	.
2	Seriously though, decency regarding posting and commenting is one thing, but the ability to spruce up the subreddit requires legitimate, official mod powers. Naut, the space banner, we can vote on the colors. I have the minimal knowledge to make this sort of a thing happen. We need a mod to actually do it, and if no-one else will, I volunteer as tribute.
2	> also, i called jungle in lobby\n\nthis was when I was having doubts if I was in the INTP subreddit or /r/dota2\n\n> 9 report after game im way too sick of dealing with trolls in this game dude. my teams always throw and i'd be like 5k mmr in dota\n\nthis was when I started to wonder if I was drunk or high or just too sleepy\n\nedit: formatting errors

2	"Invariably the content which is most popular with the largest amount of people will be the most successful."\n\nI feel really bad for you guys if your mods truly believe this.
4	I'll happily be a moderator, I'm constantly checking for bullshit posts, spam & the like. However, I think you need a giant hug.

152	Giving INTPs a chat room is like giving a blind man reading glasses
93	Cool. I wonder if anyone will use it
33	I am an INTP (duh) that is bored out of his mind by this sub, I was hoping for either some intelectual conversation, or at least to get my dick virtually sucked by some other INTPs when they tell me how smart and superior INTPs are as a type, but no. \n
34	The mods have spoken
21	Wow you sound like an ENTP who's bored out of his mind by this sub. How did you get that way?
19	Is it accessible on mobile?

10	Where is this chat?, how I find it?
6	I made a similarly informative and simple post about its existence a month ago and no one up voted it.

40	I know this is an INTP trope but I have always hated those "random facts" type of guys.\n\nI do have a ton of knowledge about things that nobody else cares about (finance for example) but I wouldn't randomly start blabbing about credit scores & cashback cards unless someone directly asked me.

9	A good man's academic potential rises with age. I won't even be considering university before I turn 45. Then I can take everybody by surprise when I hit the research scene and suddenly peer review all those journals.
7	I refuse to compete in a system that rewards the ability to memorize and regurgitate information regarding useless topics as fast as possible, rather than actual intellectual potential/skills.\n\n\>Fuck the rat race\n\n\>Fuck waking up in the morning\n\n\>Fuck dedicating my life to being a wage slave\n\n\>Fuck competing with other people only for all of us to eventually meet the same fate\n\nSmart or dumb, rich or poor, healthy or ill, mentally stable or full of disorders, happy or sad, we all end up dead for no grander meaning. And that brings me nothing but peace and comfort.
2	Nah, the education system just purposefully ignores our academic potential because if we get high ranking positions on this planet, we will expose the corruption, so we must fail.

2	If a person can't handle my dark, dry sense of humor, I filter them out.
2	Does this usually happen when you are trying to avoid the main issues on your mind and rather than man up and cause friction you make small talk disguised as a shit joke?\n\nThe real funny ones are when we are on about an issue whilst usually frustrated or angry and unknowingly at first making it appear as sarcasm.
1	Don't you hate that?\n\nMy reaction: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzpndHtdl9A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzpndHtdl9A)
23	Hmmmmmm.... problems with theology and thus existence	
11	/r/underageatheism \n\nNo religious text of any religion I ever saw encouraged blind faith. It was the opposite: everything is to be tested for validity. Instead of doing just this, you have truly tested nothing and embraced blind skepticism. And we both know what blind skepticism is called: ignorance.
3	Just because adherents to religion blind follow dogma doesn't mean that is the answer. Wow, I mean when you start studying religious scriptures with scrutiny you see little cues damning the blind followers and damning religious people for corrupting religions.\n\nMy advice, study as many religions as you can and if the day comes when you've finally had enough and you are convinced that God ain't real then please drop some DMT to at least humble yourself.

27	When people press too hard I just give them the raw feed. It's not pretty but it usually does something.
23	Me and my girlfriend every day IRL. Sometimes I don't even have a raw feed. The only way to make my busy brain go completely quiet is to demand me to answer a question, or even worse, to demand me to ask a question.\n\nI just go blank and feel like never talking again. \n\n 
18	This perfectly characterizes ME fighting with MYSELF over what WE should have for dinner. Or which shoes to wear. Or whether we're going to that party we promised we'd go to. Or how to respond when someone says "I love you".

25	Fucking redefine your question. Your question itself has logic flaw!
7	Your question lacks important details. I physically cannot answer it!! 
6	They ask a question.\n\nI give them an answer with all the info they'll need for this question and the next.\n\nThey get bored of my answer and stop paying attention.\n\nThey ask the next question anyways.

1	Aha guys!! I’m so quirky :pp
1	I never tell a story like that. Start it, get to the good/funny stuff and then a finishing punch line. Do you guys ramble during a story? 
1	*telling story* - realises that there's too much context to give them the full blown experience, then give up midway because there's too much you have to go through.

1	reeeeeeeEEEEEEEEEE
4	What the fuck am I gonna do? (Middle Age INTP With career question)	I'm a public school teacher.  53 years old.  Been doing it a lot, been fired a lot (usually for opening my fat mouth when I shouldn't)... more first years than second years at this point, I think, my science and math subjects are in demand.  I just assumed I was going to teach because a bunch of my friends did, but I never really thought about 'is this a good career for me?'\n\n\nI'm glad for the experience I've had as it has forced me to acquire the social skills I did not get growing up, and it has made me a good father.  This has paid for most of the considerable emotional toll teaching has taken on me.\n\nThis may not be an INTP problem since my achilles heel is more planning than social skills at this point, but I am way better with situations than with plans.  I see subjects as complex nets, not simple linear progressions... also I think I can do it all, and that my big general science knowledge base can enable me to teach anything, and here I am again trying to translate what I know into lessons I have never taught before and it is causing me and my family considerable stress.\n\nMy question, I guess, is what suggestions folks might have for a career change... where do INTP teachers go when they burn out?  I can explain science really well, I  am quick study for the beginning of most learning curves, am good with my hands as such but have no formal training in anything else.  I can't lie, though, so PR is out of the question as I understand it.  I have no computer science training but the small bit of Python I played with did intrigue me.\n\nMy fear of the unknown has kept me in (and out) of the classroom... I'd love to be one of those people who say 'I used to be a teacher, now I'm a _______ and I love it'.  I just don't know what _______ is.  Any of you know?\n\nPeace and Strength to my fellow INTP brethren and sistern\n\n\n
3	I’m a middle age INTP and I had kind of the same problem. I’m 42 now, but started a second career at 37. I decided to go back to college, which I guess would be preparation for a new career. I declared three different majors and a couple minors before I figured out what I liked: just about everything. So I became a philosophy major. Oh course, the career track for that is usually a professor somewhere in academia. But, fuck that. I’m just telling you this so you understand that we have the same sort of problem, not because I enjoy talking about myself. \n\nSo I thought what could I do with a philosophy degree, besides the whole professor gig? I like writing. So I thought maybe I’d try to start a philosophy magazine after grad school. Not sure how it will pan out, but we’ll see. \n\nI understand how you feel about the unknown. I too have issues with risk taking because I can see so many different scenarios: good and bad.  Maybe think about what you like to do and see if you have, or can learn, any skills applicable to it. And what kind of job those skills work best in. You sound somewhat like me: kind of a jack of all trades. Maybe you could take some computer class (or whatever kind of classes) at the local community college. It’s cheap enough to see if you like it without wasting too much money. \n\nSometimes I think MBTI career suggestions are not quite right. For example, my boyfriend is an INFJ. MBTI says counselor is a good career choice for an INFJ. But, I tend to disagree with that. He’s an empath and empaths may have a hard time dealing with a bunch of feelings coming at them. He couldn’t handle that. If most INFJs are like him, it seems like dealing with people’s problems wouldn’t be an optimum job. Why am I saying all this?\n\nWell I think about what the recommend INTP jobs are. They’re very specific. I don’t like to be pigeon-holed into one subject. Like law for example. There’s different kinds of law, but it’s still law. I want to learn about ethics, science, astronomy, physics, multiverse theory, personal identity...you get the picture. It seems like INTPs, if others are similar to me, like to study a plethora of subjects. That’s why, I think, it’s so hard for us to figure which kind of career we want to pursue. Also, I don’t like structure and authority, even though I have to accept it sometimes. \n\nMaybe you should try something entrepreneurial,  where you can put your skills and talents to work. You said you’re a quick learner and can explain science well. You could try being a science blog writer, write children’s science books, or text books for adults/teens. Would you want to work in science? Maybe in a lab? Maybe be a technical writer? It’s hard to suggest things when you don’t really know a person. I don’t even know if you like writing. I ramble a lot, which I think is very INTPish of me. I hope this helped a little. 
2	you could do online videos explaining various subjects, there is plenty of websites that might pay you for it.\n\n\na teacher has good organizational skills, you might as well run courses. some people make a living being experts on some topic and just making training events at companies - you would just have to develop yourself in some other area, maybe some kind of technological solution?\n
1	You are gonna have to get creative or look “outside the box.” I once saw an English teacher I had in high school (one who wasn’t even a good/great teacher by the way) as a new counselor at a local college, and she was 50 I believe.\nI recommend going to indeed dot com and looking at all the openings in one area, just to see what’s out there, rather than filtering with specific words. It will take longer, but at least you will be able to see if there’s anything you like that you could do well too.\nAlso be ready for plenty of rejections, especially if you make a resume that only shows your science teacher background and nothing else, in 20 years. Think about how to taylor your resume and what you know or like to each opportunity you want to shoot for.
1	INTPs do better in universities or private schools where they have more freedom.\n\nK-12 public is NOT built for the INTP - teacher or student.
1	If I were to be a teacher I’d definitely be a university professor in a high autonomous position.  Idk how you were able to survive in the public school system for so long.
1	You pose an interesting question and I see similarities in your experience to mine. I've been fired before for being too honest (and apparently too ethical, but who's counting); the solution to that was to work in an environment where honesty and conviction are valued. That is harder to find than one would think.\n\nThe second question concerning career change is more difficult. I have a friend who taught for ten years then went into sales and eventually into management (I think his subject might have been English). Perhaps considering what you like about teaching and what you dislike about it might help you identify what it is that is making you unhappy and want to change. Perhaps it is the fact you work K-12; maybe college level students would give you more freedom. Perhaps joining a tutoring company like Kaman would be ideal. Or starting your own teaching consulting firm might be the ticket - tutoring students for school and perhaps for standardized testing. Maybe add to your acumen by learning how to beat the MCATs, GREs etc would add to your tutoring capabilities.\n\nIf you wanted to get out of teaching altogether, you must be willing to start at the ground level. And unfortunately your age will be a hinderance as most don't like to hire entry level positions with someone of your age (not right I know, but the bias is there). Some areas that would work with your science background include financial analysis, paralegal for patent lawyers, etc. I'm sure there are out of the box positions to consider.\n\nAs for the fear of the unknown, I went back to school to effect a career change. I had 100% conviction of the career I wanted to be in. While there was some fear, my conviction really mitigated it. Unfortunately I graduated in the midst of a recession but I never wavered from my goals. Today I am working in the career I have chosen and I love it.

1	Why didnt you say everything you wanted to?
1	You have conditioned your mind to believe that asking 'why' will lead to a series of consequences which would eventually result in some level of fullfillment. Which is a lie. So now your mind is confused. "How can I be so miserable, even though I am asking so many questions?", it cries. I come upon your mind crying on the side of the road, sit down with it and take a moment before compassionately answering: because you are living in delusion.

1	Why not?
1	This comes up a fair amount on here and I see a few methods of answering it brought up just as often. \n\nYou will have your optimistic nihilism option, which I admit is interesting and worth looking at to absorb the ideas that you can live without a directed meaning for your life and still be happy and productive. \n\nYou have the vague ideas of mysticism or semi-mysticism brought up where it is implied that there is some world that you are ignoring with your questions of why. This is usually limited in what they can provide as a way forward other than a general "seek wisdom away from the material" or "not everything can be proven with evidence". There is some wisdom to be found here in the ideas that we do not really have the answers yet and as a species, we should be trying everything to see what works, but unless you can either find a way to connect this wisdom to material reality or are willing to accept that material reality is a red herring, then there will always be problems with this viewpoint. \n\nI argue for a middle ground. From what I can tell, we are all individual minds in a sea of sensory data. This data seems to correlate well enough that we can agree on some rules for what we are all individually experiencing. There is no why to us being. There are reasons for things happening around us, but that does not seem to be the definition of "why" that you are using. I kind of look at it with the idea that we all start out in a game without a goal. Just sensory data and minds able to absorb that data and find patterns. So, find your pattern. Match it up against the patterns of the other players and see where they match and where they do not. Where they do, strengthen those connections. Where they do not, you might want to revise your theories. Take in more data and start again. Travel. See. Taste. Travel some more. Go to Iceland. It is really pretty and fairly cheap to get to. Then revise and compare some more. \n\nWe all need to figure out what is going on, and we are all most certainly wrong about how we see the world. Thing is, we can try to be more right by taking in data and comparing notes. \n\nOr, you know, fuck it. Do drugs. We need those experiences too in order to learn as much as we can. All experiences are valid data points. Even death. But, death is kind of a hard limitation on getting more data points in this incarnation, so you might want to put that last on your list of data points to gather. Just saying.

If we didn't ask why, we would probably be flinging shit and eating bugs in some african jungle, not using reddit.\n\nAlso, you might enjoy looking into the theory of positive disintegration by Kazimierz Dabrowski, if you're into that stuff. Existential angst doesn't have to be all bad, I hope. I really do...

3	Has anyone here ever gone out and protested something?	As an intp, I can have strong feelings about some topics. When fully enveloped in learning about something, I could see myself getting swept up in a protest on that topic should one happen to be marching outside my door at that moment. But my doubting makes me wonder how accurate my views are most of the time and protesting for or against something without fully knowing where it is I stand seems idiotic. The potential to do more harm exists there in that protesting based on bad data or in just doing it poorly might make matters worse. Any thoughts on this?

1	Protests = People = NO!\n\nIf my SO was into it, I would probably go to protests. They often look unsafe. No pain no gain.
1	I've considered attending one particular protest, but it all comes down to the fact that protests, all of them, take one view and overgeneralize it and then preach on that overgeneralization.  They're all or nothing, and they seldom, if ever, serve to sway opinion; in fact, they often do the opposite.  \n\nI think the only reason I'd ever attend one is for the experience and exercise of that particular right, not to show a solidarity that I will never fully share.

I recently came across [this](https://hockeyviz.com/static/pdf/seahac19.pdf) article explaining expected save percentage for goalies. If you are either not an INTP or not a hockey fan, you may find this incredibly boring or nonsensical, but I find it intriguing. 
1	You sound autistic
74	Before We Had "30 Open Tabs I Want to Read", We Had "that Shelf I Put Books on that I Still Am Interested In, but Should Probably Put Away"	
5	Yeah I am going to get that one once I am done with the "Books I Know I Need to Read" shelf and the "Books I have Recommended but Did Not Read" shelf. You are so far ahead of me.
6	One day you'll make it through Green Eggs and Ham. I have faith in you.
5	My wife and I have been married 31 years. We are both avid readers, but she will never sell or give a book away. I do not think that there is space in our house for another bookshelf, even in the garage. When I complain, she says that I can sell my books to make space for hers. Love is wonderful.
4	Haha. We have our books in the bedroom, the living room, the kitchen, the hallway, the TV room, my office, our kids' rooms and even the garage. We also have boxes of overflow books in the garage that we are going to makes space for any day now. I can't really complain because a quarter of them are mine.

1	I had an 8” table, like a folding buffet table, that I piled all my research books and books I was reading. I would often have 10 or more, sometimes starting one to cross reference another. Sometimes I miss the warmth, and visceral nature of it. But nothing is as efficient as my computer. 
1	Who else might be (slightly) scared of ghosts?	Alright tough guys,\n\nWho wants to share their (not true) story when they saw a ghost or something. Or, if you concluded they don't exist, how? Certainly just cause one can't prove something exists, doesn't mean that it does not exist. Ignorance proves no claim to knowledge\n\nPersonally, I leave the idea open, but I can't see why a ghost would waste time on me. All it will do is make me leave the place. Makes them sound irrational. That irrationality that makes me want to antagonize one... But, only feel that way when I watch a horror movie. Lol. Also I do nag people who don't believe in them, and encourage them to visit one. Prob won't ever go with them.\n\n(For the record I am objectively pretty brave  😆)
3	I've never seen a ghost, so I'm pretty sceptical.
2	>Who else might be (slightly) scared of ghosts?\n\nDepends if they want to scare me or befriend me. I'm sure there's a few friendly ghosts who just want someone to talk to.
2	someone burned to death in my apartment right before i moved in. i was expecting some paranormal activity but i ain't seen shit. 
2	INTPs would you stand on the right side of the tube escalators or walk up it on the left?	Wondering if you guys also walk past people on the escalators up/down to tubes to get to somewhere quicker. I could be lazy and stand but there’s something about not wanting to wait around, and that standing still is usually boring. \n\nWhere do you all stand (lol) on this? 
2	I usually stand going up, and walk going down.  Unless it's really busy, then I'll just stand and let the runners get their run on. Mainly because I'm a slow walker and don't want to hold everyone up. 
2	I would take the elevator. Vertical trajectory of travel while standing is shorter as opposed to horizontal trajectory of standing and or racing up the escalator. 
1	I don't know if the stairs are an option on the tube, but that's always what I choose. Everyone is lazy and taking the escalators, so I can avoid people and I can get some exercise. 
1	It depends how quickly I need to travel. No rush, I stand and enjoy the thinking time.\n\nOne time, I didn't need to travel quickly (was drunk and just trying to get to a sandwich shop off Brick Lane), but still managed to clear two thirds of the entire escalator in seconds.\n\nWorse, was going *up* the escalator when I fell back *down* it.\n\nWorse yet, being the escalator at Angel, was also Eastern Europe's third longest escalator.\n\nThey say your whole life flashes before your eyes during a near death experience. They lie.\n\nAll that flashed before my eyes as I plummeted and  ricocheted from metal to metal was being approached by strangers if I didn't die / knock myself out before or when I hit the ground. \n\nHence, and despite dinting my skull, still jumped up when I reached the bottom and did jazz hands whilst shouting: *I'm fine!*\n\nCould've gone straight to A&E. Instead, went on to the sandwich shop...only to discover it was closed.\n\nNot a great day. But not the worst experience I've had on the tube.
5	Opinion on my case	Today I got INTP on a personality test. I am sure that I answered all the questions sincerely, but I disagreed with some points of the INTP personality because I think some of it’s characteristics doesn’t fit into me. First of all, it says that I don’t enjoy social company. However that is very far from truth. I have many friends who share none interests with me, but I enjoy their company. Also, I would even like to be more sociable, but sometimes I can’t, but I really want. Also it said that INTP’s lack of emotional comprehension. However, I am completely emotional and many of my decisions are sometimes influenced by emotions. Sometimes my emotion is so powerful that I act based on it rather than in my reasoning (even that my reasoning is very good or brilliant). Is there any personality that fits me? What do you think about this?
2	The results are not always accurate, and it is only correct 75% of the time. (I don't remember where I read that so I won't say that it is definitely accurate since it might be wrong.) You are probably another type- if you are curious and want to get more in depth, you can research more about MBTI and find you what your real type is. I can't type you since I've never spoken to you in person, but hopefully, you know yourself the best.
2	Some test use percentages, you could be 56% introverted and 44% extraverted. Same thing with the thinking and feeling side of things. Us INTP's are adaptable, so if we're surrounded by extraverted people, we can almost match that energy although we would probably be socially drained afterwards. Also if everyone around us is open with their emotions, that can rub off on us making it seem as if we're feelers, but when it comes down to the line, we prefer thinking over feeling. 
2	Function testing>dichotomy testing
2	Types are usualy not exact and you can be mix between 2 for example intp-infp
1	I think it’s misleading to read some of these descriptions. Just because you are an introvert doesn’t mean you are social. What it does mean is that being social with a group of people it drains your energy and you need to recharge. This might be why you want to socialize but don’t have the energy. Also one on one interactions are considered introverted actions so you could do that often and not feel as drained. \n\nSecond I find any description of INTPs being emotionless is a fallacy. I myself had a lot of emotions. I don’t necessarily show them and over time I have learned to distinguish the emotions - like everyone else - so I know what I’m feeling and hopefully how to deal with it. \n\nThe best way to determine whether the test is accurate is to learn about cognitive functions and to figure out how you receive data and how you react to that from the real world. For example INTPs lead with introverted thinking. That means we gather data from the real world and create a systematic way of thinking about things. \n\nEvery INTP is different on the spectrum but how we use our cognitive functions should be similar.  
1	> First of all, it says that I don’t enjoy social company. \n\nYes, that's a bs description at play, it's more what kind of social company. \n\n> Also it said that INTP’s lack of emotional comprehension. However, I am completely emotional and many of my decisions are sometimes influenced by emotions. \n\nLike, what ?\n\nMaybe you should consider if you're an INFP\n\n> my reasoning (even that my reasoning is very good or brilliant).\n\nYeah, *you* think it's brilliant, and that's no way to type yourself. 
3	Intense, short random projects anyone?	Like everyday I would pick random topics to read about intensively and other days I would spend entirely on talking to others. I can't do things half-heartedly when I want to do it. It's either do it damn well or don't.\n\nIs that a INTP or ADHD trait? I have both.
6	>I have both.\n\n"I have INTP"
2	Researching isn't a project, neitheir is talking (I mean, once you're out, you're out, so might as well talk...) Neitheir take much effort, researching even is our natural tendency due to TiNe.\n\nA project is when you produce something. \n\n> I can't do things half-heartedly when I want to do it. It's either do it damn well or don't.\n\nEh, depends on what. I half ass school related stuff everytime. I try to go to the nitty gritty/core of the topic (i really dislike having to pace myself with the shallow stuff) but that's all. As for talking, I'm rolling with the flow and seeing how the person is responding... Meaning I don't say everything I want to say.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
3	I have intp. One day  I am learning and practicing calligraphy, another day I read about plants and actually growing them, the next day spent hours on reading articles about whatever that interest me. Thing is, I get bored easily or i just need a break in between interest to spend time on other interest. Probably we are the master of double-timing our interests/projects 😁
1	Never short, never random, always intense.
2	Reasons to Remain Single	
1	I think wanting to stay single is fine, but I also think we need people, like friends, to keep our mentality in check.\n\n\#1. Romantic love can be a dangerous illusion if you're selfish and ignorant towards your partner's needs.\n\n\#2. An opinion and he says, "relationships best suit the kind of people who don't actually expect too much from them."\n\n\#3. You have to apply yourself and want it. "Retiring oneself voluntarily in order to save others and oneself from the consequences of ones own inner emotional turmoil is the true sign of a great and kind soul." The true sign of a great and kind soul? It shows maturity and respect, not this exaggeration.\n\n\#4. That's the result of poor communication and low self-confidence.\n\n\#5. Poor communication and ignorance towards each other's needs.
77	Somewhere in the irrational number pie, there exists a continous string of numbers that if it were to be tranformed into binary it'll write a picture of you taking a piss.	
13	I love this
19	Well, technically there is no transformation into binary necessary. If pi is indeed infinite, the sequence of 1's and 0's literally exists within Pi's perpetual string.
5	Is this necessarily true? For all I know after a surtent amount of digits pie could just continue like. 01001000100001 etc always adding one 0 more. It's still irrational but there's not every number hidden there. Proof me wrong. 
5	I remember finding a C++ project on GitHub a few years ago that would let you store any arbitrary data as indices to the position and length of various sub-sequences in Pi and then encode that list of indices and lengths as yet another pointer to the appropriate sub-sequence.  Meaning you could achieve absolutely insane compression ratios - think 10,000+-to-1 kind of ratios for traditionally nearly uncompressable binary data.  Of course the relationship between the amount of data and the time/memory it took to run was exponential but still it was an immensely impressive proof of concept.  Will update if I ever find the repository but it's actually not too difficult to implement.
4	I mean, this is not impressive depending on the resolution we are talking about.\n\nHere's a black and white, 3x3 picture of OP:\n\n    000\n    010\n    011
4	This is only guaranteed if pi is normal, that is if the distribution of the digits is completely random. Although most mathematicians believe that pi is indeed normal, there has not been a proof of that yet.
3	Any number could be transformed in such a binary image. Binary systems are arbitrary as are the methods for translating them in images. This is sort of like saying "I could make any 3D shape with enough Play-Dough.
2	The real question is: who baked the irrational number pie?
1	Two comments on this. First, this could be true of any irrational number, not just Pi. Second, you would need a program to take the binary and convert it into the image that we humans would recognize as me taking a piss. \n\nThough, of note, the program necessary for the conversion of those binary numbers into that image of me just pissing into the wind would technically also be contained in that selfsame irrational number.

5	How I prevent myself from looking dumb in front of a group.	
0	Ah man, I love flow charts that tell me how I should behave in social settings.  /s
2	Does anyone else have any tips for dealing with messiness at home?	I just can't keep my flat tidy because whenever I tidy it up it becomes messy again within like a week, my friends recommended me to pay a cleaner to do it but I know it always goes back to being messy again, so i'm trying to make it so that I don't really have to clean or tidy it often. I also struggle with remembering to tidy it every day so that's not really easy, I like to do a full clean but when I'm tidying it really pisses me off knowing that it'll go messy again in no time. What to do?
2	Commit to cleaning up one single thing every day. Wash a few dishes. Wipe that smudge off the floor. It will be hard to make a mess faster than you are cleaning it up. It will never feel like you are really cleaning.
2	Enjoy the clean appartement, then, you've got a reason to keep it clean.\n\nIf you do it only because "you have to", you won't... 
1	Train yourself. I used to have a chair that I'd throw my jackets on because I was too lazy to hang them up. I put the chair in my closet and now I stop, think, and hang them up. I'll take the chair back out in a couple days and see if it can stay jacket-free. 
1	I make a list of things I need to do.  I.e. clear off coffee table, vacuum, make bed, etc. Then I leave it on the table. Each individual task only takes a minute or two. I pick a convenient task at random points of downtime. Then cross it off\n\n\nJust break it down into smaller pieces. Even if you only do two, it's still a cleaner place than when you started. 
3	Music recommendations from my fellow INTPs?	I wonder if personality says anything for the kind of music genres we enjoy. Of course, the reasons people listen to music will differ from person to person but I personally *really* love to ponder over my music. Dissecting the lyrics, the beat, any and all transitions, the instruments used, and the way the vocalist sings especially is a hobby of mine. I find progressive genres offer the opportunity to spend literally hours and hours mulling over lyrics and the way they are conveyed in search of a hidden message or meaning, and I seriously delight in this.  The poetic, oftentimes metaphorical lyrics associated with the progressive rock genre particularly delights me, as the message is oftentimes more impactful.\n\nMy favourite prog rock artist is A Perfect Circle, but I'm also a huge fan of Puscifer, Oceana, Closure in Moscow, Circa Survive, Tides of Man, The Dear Hunter, O'Brother, Vela Ceras and The Mars Volta.\n\nBut I've always had a relatively broad taste in music. Other artists I quite enjoy are Mili, XXXTENTACION, Arcadea, Omar Varela, Dream On Dreamer, Bring Me The Horizon (each and every album save for most of Amo), Daft Punk, Ice Nine Kills, KIVΛ, Sullivan King... \*deep breath\* and many, many others.\n\nSo what about you? I figured this would be a nice way to gain exposure to new music. The only kind of music I don't particularly like is the kind that goes "mainstream" (for the fact that most times its content is shallow or uninteresting), so aside from that, I'll look into any and all suggestions. Especially the kind labelled prog rock, or any prog genre in general!\n\nFeel free to share specific songs as well. :)
5	Two steps from hell, particularly children of the sun and global waste
2	Ive been listening to A Perfect Circle a lot lately. The lead singer is Maynard James Keenan and he also the lead to Puscifer as well as Tool. You probably already know this however. There's a rumor that Tool is working on a new album, I hope it pans out.
2	>I wonder if personality says anything for the kind of music genres we enjoy.\n\nThere's a thread about this every other month.
2	I’m a fan of both Lorn and Kavinsky.
2	Dream theater. And if you are into instrumental stuff as well, animals as leaders should also suit you. I'm basically trying to say you should get into some progressive metal too :)
2	If you are a fan of transitions, I suggest trying to dissect Bach organ fugues, it’s a hell of a task
2	CCR, especially their "Have You Ever Seen The Rain".\n \nAlso ELO, The Who, Boston, Kansas and other bands from that time period. Back when music was an art and not a product. 
1	Wow I just listen to music for enjoyment.
1	Recently I've been listening to a lot of instrumental music, the way things can be expressed without a word fascinates me quite deeply. Some artists I listen to frequently are Jóhann Jóhannsson, Max Richter  Hauschka and Susumu Yokota, for the most part that is, because I also enjoy a lot some Spotify instrumental music playlists. I also like a lot these artists: Daughter, Made in Heights, Ex:Re, HÆLOS, Interpol, Liza Anne and Massive Attack.
1	I get that. I just did not want to come across as discounting your experience.
1	Mu music preference is mainstream, especially Lana Del Rey. But what I like from her music is how every sound she produced is being harmonize in the song (but her lyrics are quiet cringy). Another singer with quite complex song is James Blake (I recommend you to listen to his songs). His songs are very unexpected, making you question why he did things. And lastly Norah Jones. \n\nOverall, I like how the three singers produce tranquility in my environment, which lessen my overthinking (and pretending to be high, I don’t know but it feels good)
1	Jazz & Classical mostly. Queen tho, Fred voice is from another world

1	Electric Mantis. 
1	GUNSHIP, Timecop1983, Dear Rouge, Com Truise 
1	Skillet, Breaking Benjamin, Starset, Fall out boys, our last night, Linkin Park,  Thousand food krutch.
1	Music is so much to me, but I'm very particular about it.  My criteria are as follows:\n\n1. Aggressive, stylized basslines\n\n2. Exceptional musicianship\n\n3. Particularly unique vocals\n\n4. Thought provoking, well written lyrics\n\n5.  Polyrhythms\n\n6.  Whatever seemingly arbitrary force connects me to any given sound/song/piece, creating the most exquisite, undefinable, and oftentimes all encompassing brain and heartgasm.\n\nA minimum of any four must be met (the exception being grunge and Cliff Burton era Metallica, which I unapologetically adore).\n\nTool and Rush meet all six.  \n\nPrimus, Pink Floyd, and Led Zeppelin meet five.\n\nBlack Sabbath, Steely Dan, Tori Amos, David Bowie, Jimi Hendrix, and others that aren't necessarily coming to mind at the moment meet four.  \n\nMy favorite album of all time is Tool's *Lateralus*.  \n\n\n
1	I personally really enjoy Zero 7's work! Their music is beautifully complex. My favorite album from them has to be Simple Things.
1	Existential Origin	What came first, the chicken or the egg. Or was it the snake or the egg? material or thought? Why does quality of life depend on the little things? Would you be the same person if you knew for a fact that there is no judgement day with an omniscient god awaiting your day after last?\n\nWeather looking inward or outward, its all space and perception. I imagine myself in the afterlife flexing my mind power, clutching onto my conscious awareness, in an attempt to avoid oblivion long enough to discover the one thing ive wondered about since I was ever able to evoke the concept (very young); what is the origin of existence?.
3	This is a lot to unpack, but I at least always thought the chicken or the egg was a simple evolution v. creation question. If evolution, the egg that had the genetic material of the chicken. If divine creation, the chicken first to nurtur it's young. And for the love of Pete if we haven't torn the Creation theory to pieces in this century thoroughly enough I will personally do it myself. 
2	> the chicken or the egg. Or was it the snake or the egg?\n\nObviously, the egg when animals first started to walk on land. As for the proto-eggs, the one in water, you've got to go back to cells\n\n> material or thought?\n\nMaterial\n\n> Would you be the same person if you knew for a fact that there is no judgement day with an omniscient god awaiting your day after last?\n\nYes, because I don't belive in that\n\n> \n\n
1	1. If from the same species, then the egg, since it was the first to have the necessary genes to belong to that species. If not, then the egg as well, as it appeared first in the chain of evolution.\n2. Same\n3. This one is waaay above my paygrade. I would argue that thought is an exclusive luxury of complex systems such as brains, but that is debatable, as insane as that may sound. Also, who knows if sentience or even consciousness is an inherent property of matter... What was the question again?\n4. Because they are little only inasmuch as we haven't acknowledged them. You could say that not being in traffic 2 hours a day, having a walk in a park, or having somebody who tells you hello when you get home are small things, but if one where to realize how much impact they can have, then they wouldn't be called "small". Misaligned incentives and superstimuli are another possible reason. We live in a world which is very different from that for which we evolved as an species, no wonder we get lost. Not 100% sure about this one.\n5. Yes, since that is what I believe.\n6. The origin of existence has to be either nothing (which would go against the laws of physics and maybe logic) or existence itself. So basically, existence is what existence comes from, or there's no rhyme or reason. If you claim creation, even God is an existing being, so where did he come from? I side with the "matter and energy cannot be destroyed, only transformed" side of the issue.
1	>What came first, the chicken or the egg. \n\nA better question: why is the chicken not the egg?\n\n>Would you be the same person if you knew for a fact that there is no judgement day with an omniscient god awaiting your day after last?\n\nThere would be no me.\n\n\n>what is the origin of existence?\n\nThe intent to exist.
1	I just want to answer the "chicken or egg" question. It would be the egg that came first because whatever avian-x that laid the egg, wasn't a chicken. The avian-x had a mutation in the egg, turning what was suppose to be an avian-x egg, into a chicken egg. Thus, the egg came first.
1	Egg came first. 
124	ITNPs + vulnerability = happiness?	Dear fellow INTPs,\n\nI think I have figured something out that changed everything for me. And I wish I knew this earlier in life because I think it would’ve spared me a lot of overthinking, anxiety, and regret.\n\n**TLDR:** *INTPs understand stuff by gathering data, but we suck at reading people. So, to understand people we need to get data directly by asking them how they feel and being open and vulnerable with them. The extra datapoints that this method provide frees our mind from overthinking and the anxiety that comes with it. Being vulnerable like this sounds terrifying to an INTP but it actually fits the direct way we prefer interact with people when it comes to non-emotional issues. Being vulnerable not only allows us to understand others, but it also allows them to finally understand the misunderstood INTP, it comes across as confidence, and it's attractive. So being vulnerable = happiness for the INTP.*\n\nLike most of you vulnerability and being open about how you feel is something that doesn't come naturally to me and that I always avoided. But I've come to embrace it and it has changed my life. Now I’m not only convinced of its importance, I also think that it’s something that is very much aligned with the INTP way of thinking, and that it’s necessary for us to be happy. You are not a robot, and now matter how unnatural it may feel to you right now, if you don't learn to talk about your emotions you will never be happy. Hear me out.\n\n**1. Being vulnerable allows for gathering more data**\n\nThe great flaw of INTPs is this. We are analytical creatures. We understand the world by spotting trends in data and connecting patterns. This allows us to be exceptionally adept at things which can be understood with publicly available data: math, engineering, trivia etc. But what about people? Gathering data about how people think and feel about situations is hard because people tend not to share it directly. Data about humans’ feelings is only available indirectly – we need to infer it from their actions. To make everything extra fun, reading people is perhaps the thing INTPs suck at most.\n\nThis leaves us with a shortage of data to analyse. And with this limited data (often corrupted data because we may focus on less meaningful actions by others while missing some important signal they gave us) we do not have enough datapoints to reach definite conclusions about the intentions of others. Your powerful INTP brain will still try to do it though, which will only lead it to aggressively overthink without reaching a conclusion and leaving you paralyzed with anxiety and inaction. In my own life this has, for example, led me to miss out on girls because I could never decide how they felt about me. I would compare their current and past behaviour, the frequency of their texts over time, and other equally stupid indicators and always end up “not being sure”. And just when I thought I finally figured out she likes me, then she would do something that seems like it doesn't fit the current model of her behaviour I had in my mind. And then my brain would want to analyse everything all over again. This is bullshit. DO NOT allow that powerful brain of yours to keep you captive like that.\n\nThe solution? You can’t change that you suck at reading people or that you understand stuff through analysis. The only thing you can do is change how you gather data. SO GATHER DATA DIRECTLY. Allow yourself to be vulnerable. Tell people how you feel, and ask them how they feel about stuff. NEVER JUST ASSUME, because you are an INTP, you suck at assuming the intentions of people correctly. ASK. I promise you, you will be surprised at what you find. People are not as complicated as we perceive them to be.\n\nThis sounds terrifying doesn’t it? It’s not. It’s the most liberating thing ever because it frees your mind from the constant loop of analysis going nowhere. What’s more is that you were made for this, but you’ll never see it if you don’t try it. Why do I say that?\n\n**2. Being direct comes naturally to INTPs**\n\nWhen it comes to stuff not related to our own feelings we love being direct. We don’t like reading between the lines so we want to settle disputes with facts and logic. We want our boss to give direct feedback to us, and to be able to tell our co-workers directly how they are wrong and should improve. We have little patience for titles and rank and stuff not based on merit and we are frustrated with political games in the workplace to keep everyone happy, while we know that everything would be easier if everyone was just direct and honest and focused on the facts and performance. This direct approach works great for us since it allows for more open sharing of data. Why are we so naturally direct in most areas of our lives, but when it comes to dealing with emotions and relationships we suck?  It's a contradiction and doesn't make sense. Do what you do best. Be direct with people too. Tell them how you feel. It’s the INTP way of resolving just about everything else, there is no reason why you should not (with a bit of practice) feel comfortable doing it with people too. Once you realize that this is the most natural way for you to successfully deal with people as an INTP, you will be free. I promise you: it seems terrifying, but once you do it you will see that it's actually quite an exciting rush. It's at least 1000x better than anxiously wondering about something you will never know if you don't ask.\n\n**3. Being vulnerable allows others to understand us**\n\nINTPs always feel misunderstood. This is partly because we misinterpret the actions of others, and then get confused by their future actions towards us, because it doesn’t fit the initial understanding we thought we had of their feelings towards us. But, more importantly, it is because we can be such a closed book to people, so they never fully understand us. We are less likely to be vulnerable and share our private thoughts than most. As INTP you tend to live in your own head and it's easy to forget that other people don't have access to everything happening in there - IF YOU DON'T GET OUT OF YOUR HEAD PEOPLE WON'T UNDERSTAND YOU. They will NEVER know how you feel about them or about some issue if you don't tell them. The solution is simply to show them who you are. If you miss someone and want to hang out with them it might seem like they don’t care, but the truth is probably that they don’t get how you feel at all because your INTP behaviour makes it seem like you don’t care about anyone. Allow yourself to be vulnerable and show them how you feel, and I promise you will be surprised at the reactions you get. You owe it to yourself: show people who you are so they can understand you. Be vulnerable, direct, and share your crazy and quirky Ne theories. If you don't you will always feel misunderstood and unhappy.\n\n**4. Vulnerability is confidence, and it’s attractive**\n\nI used to feel weak when I shared stuff with others that make me vulnerable. This isn’t true. Actually, it shows real confidence because not many people are able to do that. As INTP our inferior Fe actually gives us a very pure and childlike way of processing emotions. If you share it with the world it’s actually rather cute to them because it’s so pure. If you tap into your INTP directness to share these pure feelings you will seem super confident because not many people have the guts to do that.\n\n**Conclusion:** if you want to say something – say it, if you want to know something - ask, if something someone did is bothering you – let them know, if you want to do something – do it, and, most importantly of all, if you miss or love someone – tell them. You will be understand people better, be understood, have less regrets, and you will be happy.
11	ehhh... no good deed goes unpunished. even though i love being direct and it's like a cement block was lifted off my chest.....sometimes being honest can have negative consequences. i'm careful around my co workers and boss about what my opinions are. if im on a job interview i only try to exude positivity. a lot of recruiters will try to trap you by getting you the spill the beans on something negative about yourself (i had a recruiter coach me, and she said i am too damn honest about my shortcomings). i would never encourage lying... but sometimes you should omit the truth in certain situations. 
17	This is the more detailed and fleshed out version of something I recently realized. The follow through still needs work, but I definitely agree with your post.
5	I've recently come to the same conclusion as yourself though your thoughts are clearly much more fleshed out than mine. I have become direct in my questions while also direct in relating my thoughts. After all, if I'm going to ask them directly, it would not be fair to offer the same information in the same manner. What I have found is that 1. people like the honest truth and 2. sometimes you get honest truth back. How they respond is a data point that can be analyze. Unfortunately not everyone is honest and that's why having a good bullshit meter is helpful when putting your vulnerabilities out there. 
5	Honesty, sincerity, and being genuine.  
14	This. Fucking this. I learned this a long time ago but have forgotten it in the confusion that is life. Thank you good sir for this well needed reminder. I salute you
4	Thank you for sharing your thoughts. This is something I’ve observed myself planning to do, but am still not doing because of my low confidence. And you have worded all of my thought process out. Very interesting
4	I certainly agree that allowing ourselves to be vulnerable is a critical part of our development, but I see it a bit differently.\n\nYounger INTPs tend to think of relationships in terms of "understanding" or "knowing" people. And we know all about understanding and knowing. It comes naturally to us.  However, that leads us to think of others as objects or to classify and identify others' characteristics.\n\nI have been married to my wife for 31 years, but I would not say that I "understand" or "know" her.  I learn something new about her all the time, probably because she keeps changing on me.\n\nFor me, allowing myself to be vulnerable was synonymous with getting to know people without understanding or labeling them. I could not tolerate vulnerability to people when I treated them as things to be understood and defined. When I started to accept people for who and what they are, I realized that I could not establish a connection with them unless I was in some way vulnerable.\n\nBeing vulnerable also required trust and accepting the fact that I did not really understand people. Exposing myself to people who could and might hurt me was a huge leap. I think it would me more accurate to say that allowing myself to be vulnerable allowed me to share more data, not collect it. My relationships with people just does not consist of gather data.  Gathering data leads to making judgments, and that never leads to a happy place.\n\nSo I guess I would state your proposition 1 as "Being vulnerable allows me to get to know people without judging them." \n\nI agree that it is best to be direct with people, but I would add an element of nonjudgmental authenticity to that. Being direct is pointless if we are not being honest and forthcoming about who and what we are. A lot of INTPs feel a need to manifest an acceptable or safe persona. We do that to avoid pain. We can be as direct as we want, but it we are not genuine and authentic, it means nothing. We have to be willing to give as much information as we get, and honesty is inherently vulnerable. So while being direct comes naturally to INTPs, I do not believe that authenticity does. \n\nI would restate your proposition 2 as "Connection requires authenticity and honesty."\n\nYour point about INTPs being closed books is very well taken. A lot or maybe even most of us learned to manifest a persona that was not true or genuine. I think we did that because we were hurt when very young, and it was a solution. I became so buried in layers of me that I lost track of who I really was. Every INTP I have known wanted to be understood, but if we never show up as who and what we are, that need can never be satisfied. At the same time, being who we are has caused pain in the past, and our protective minds scream never to do it again. \n\nFor me, this may have been the most difficult step of all. Every fiber of my body told me not to reveal myself, but I was so lonely. When I was 20, I met the woman whom I would marry, and she accepted me as I was or seemed to be. That was such a strange and exciting experience, so I revealed more of myself, and she still accepted me. I finally summoned the courage to expose the hideous beast within, but she did not run. That helped me to be more genuine with other people. I was lucky to find someone who just kept accepting me. I was very lucky, and I can only imagine how difficult this must be for people who do not have a savior.\n\nI think that you have proposition 3 just right.\n\nYou statement that vulnerable shows confidence and is attractive really hits the mark. I convinced myself that anyone I exposed myself to would savage me for fun. I had been hurt so much when I was younger, that I just knew people would torture me. I have experienced just the opposite. Being vulnerable to someone shows respect and trust. It would be a very unusual person who responded to that by attacking. When we make ourselves vulnerable to someone, we tell them that they mean so much to us that we will risk being harmed. No meaningful relationship can be formed without mutual vulnerability. \n\nI want to say that I thoroughly enjoyed your post and learned a lot from it. We all have different takes and angles on things, but in the end we are saying the same thing. You have come a long ways, but you have not yet really begun the journey. Happy travels.
3	Be yourself, eh?
3	This post could not have come at a better time. I'm going out with a girl tomorrow who I've liked for over a year. I have a decent suspicion she likes me too, but I've never been able to confirm it. There is some distance between us, and can only see here once every couple months or so. I can't live with this question mark over my head anymore, I need to know if it's worth going out of my way to see her or not. Anyway, I'm scared shitless, but this rienforced my belief that it's just something I have to do.
3	You fucking genius dam. Sometimes I think I'm retarded that I get these things so slowly. 
3	If anything deserves being a sticky post it may be this... I'm trying to apply this myself, I hope I can.
7	Very well put. My vulnerability more takes the I don't give a shit what you think route. Personally employing this behavior has made me come across as straight foward, no bullshit, and very ENTJ-like. Quite frankly, I don't care for social and emotional issues getting in my way so I make quick work of them for efficiency's sake. 
4	Though I agree mostly with this post, I disagree about INTPs being bad at reading people, actually quite the oposite. We are really good, just the overall emotionality of other people overload us, and we take distance. Heck, Jung was probably an INTP. But knowing how to productively listen to people and break our barriers and let people know we do care is one of the biggest challenges of all INTPs, and one of the most productive in terms of helping others and helping ourselves
5	The older I get, the more work I realize I have to do.
4	I see a lot of people commenting "This."\n\n  \n\n\nSo I'm gonna read it later, OP don't delete it lol
2	I understand why you frame this in terms of data and vulnerability, because this is intimidating to you, but while I think that the insight is very helpful in your development, the framing itself does you a disfavor in the long term. \n\nIf you limit yourself to “collecting data”, then you miss the beauty of the interaction with the other person because you’re retreating behind your robot mask. I suppose this is where the “vulnerability” comes into play as a proxy to allow you to open up and be attentive in the moment, but perhaps it would be simpler to think of it in terms of “interest toward other human beings”? Not just as data but as more than the sum of their data with respect and curiosity for who they are? \n\nI personally see them as wonderful little puzzles to crack, so yes, data comes into play, but they’re so much more, and that’s infinitely more interesting to me. You will never fully understand the human condition, and that should be enough for you to give them your undivided attention when you decide to engage in interactive behavior. It’s them and all that they are, you and all that you are, and then you together and something synergistic is borne out of that that’s pretty damn interesting, not to mention a great, mutually beneficial experience. Even when it’s not! Human interaction and behavior in general is fascinating.\n\nA lot of people here lament their low Fe, but I feel like they’re using it as an excuse to be awkward. What do you do when you don’t know how to do something? Yeah you study, you try, you fail, you learn. Social interaction is the same thing. Everyone has the capacity for growth. We just have to trust our intuition and channel it into interest toward other people. We’re human too, you know. Let yourself feel. It’s worth it, I swear.

1	I broke up with my gf twice and have regretted it both times. Should I tell her, or am I just a dumbass? Idk at this point. What even is love?
1	Too depressed to read
1	Sure... this is just normal stuff and mostly irrelevant, all you are saying really is to be direct. P types are largely wishy washy and skirt around the issue and reason or think. You are just saying be direct, that solves one issue I suppose, but it's hardly how to be happy.
1	Wow I just subbed to this a couple of days ago and I’ve been talking with this girl for a month and it has been making me feel insane.\n\n(Details paragraph)\nShe’s a friend’s cousin’s friend I already knew, So I messaged her on an app and said I always thought she was cute, she returned the sentiment, we talked, and moved on to text. We’ve talked about depression, her abusive dad, our families, and about our lives recently. Some of which you’d tell a friend, but some I felt she’d only tell me if she were interested. But she’s totally cautious of men because of her dad, and I try to be contentious of that by being kind of laid back... now I’m not sure whether to text her super often, or lay back and see what she wants. Very weird middle ground I’ve been in for a couple weeks. Maybe I need to just ask her what she thinks? Not really sure what to say though. But I’ve just been guessing at what is the right “play to make” (maybe I should be assertive to be a masculine presence she missed with the dad, or keep letting her lead). We’ve only hung out once but she’s skittish and gets headaches or is just tired (which I actually like about her since I’m the same way) but we’ve only hung out once and I need to get to know her better...\n\nBasically I’m at the point where I have no idea what will happen, and I’ve accepted that whatever the outcome is is fine. I just need to figure out how to emotionally connect or organically tell her how I feel in order to get things to move along. Much easier said than done. I don’t know whether she thinks of me romantically still, likes texting a lot or not, or in typical INTP fashion, if I’m talking about her interests and life and not enough about emotions... Obviously this isn’t r/relationshipadvice or anything, but I would appreciate help as I’m trying to use this advice this weekend. Regardless, this post helped me realize that I’m probably making the situation more complex than it actually is.
1	Thank you, this is all very true.\nI realized recently I'm very direct at work especially with my superiors and in performance reviews. This is probably what landed me most of my promotions.\nNow, applying this to relationships is not as easy but your post is a good reminder and source of motivation to do so. 
1	This. 
1	Pretty much, yes. 
1	The message itself is not wrong, but it's badly formulated, so it's misleading.\n\nIt's not really about being "vulnerable" eitheir.\n\n***\n**"1. Being vulnerable allows for gathering more data"**\n\n> This allows us to be exceptionally adept at things which can be understood with publicly available data: math, engineering, trivia etc. But what about people?\n\nPsychology is a thing, you know ? You're using such a publicly available system right now...\n\n> Gathering data about how people think and feel about situations is hard because people tend not to share it directly.\n\nEh, I find that just looking on the internet, you will find that info much easier. Not only you will be able to see with a wider pool, which is also a lot more diverse, the anonimity means people will be a lot more honest. \n\nAlso, it's not on you to fix it, so "no risk".\n\n> To make everything extra fun, reading people is perhaps the thing INTPs suck at most.\n\nTrue, but it's not a question of vulnerability. It's because Se is our PolR, ie, we don't pay attention, we don't observe, we are not in the "here and now". Instead, we're juggling with ideas in our heards, stuff happening around us being mere distractions, running Se at the bare minimum level so you don't walk into a pole or something...\n\n> Your powerful INTP brain \n\nOur brain aren't more powerful...\n\n> In my own life this has, for example, led me to miss out on girls because I could never decide how they felt about me.\n\nI cannot say I don't relate, but again, it's not about being open. Here, the misunderstanding is failing to understand how fucking barebone this whole "love" thing actually is. We are smart technos monkeys, but animals nonetheless. It's pure attraction.\n\nSo, again, it's Se.\n\n> And just when I thought I finally figured out she likes me, then she would do something that seems like it doesn't fit the current model of her behaviour I had in my mind. And then my brain would want to analyse everything all over again. This is bullshit. DO NOT allow that powerful brain of yours to keep you captive like that.\n\nThis is you ignoring evidence in front of you, tho\n\n**Overall, I agree, but it's not being "vulnerable". It's our Se PolR/blindspot**\n\n***\n**"2. Being direct comes naturally to INTPs"**\n\n> When it comes to stuff not related to our own feelings we love being direct.\n\nActually, I was going to say something about thta. Being honest concerning that stuff isn't the same as being "vulnerable". A vulnerability is something that can be used against you, hurt you. But tbh, once I express a feeling, I really couldn't give less of a fuck afterward. \n\nI've had people try to tease me with it, but I had a natural pokerface then. \n\nReally, the "protective" aspect I notice in myself is not me not wanting to be vulnerable, it's more people trying to pry it out of me, so then, that's a question of privacy, which is a different concept...\n\nAnyway, it's pretty ironic that you say that, because it seems you almost realized it ? **INTPs aren't actually vulnerable with our own feelings.** Fi is one of our unvalued functions after all, and why would you be vulnerable about something you don't care about ? While for a lot of people out here, insecurities are the reason, for us, I would say it's something else. \n\n***\n**"3. Being vulnerable allows others to understand us"**\n\nHaha, no.\n\n> INTPs always feel misunderstood.\n\nI disagree with "always", and generalizing this on all INTPs... Also, who doesn't feel misunderstood ?\n\nGo talk to INFJ, he/she will say the same. Same for others types.\n\n> This is partly because we misinterpret the actions of others, and then get confused by their future actions towards us, because it doesn’t fit the initial understanding we thought we had of their feelings towards us.\n\nSo, INTPs are idiots that fail to understand when they are the one misunderstanding something and project that on others ? \n\n> But, more importantly, it is because we can be such a closed book to people, so they never fully understand us. We are less likely to be vulnerable and share our private thoughts than most.\n\nMeh, not really. \n\nI'm willing to share my TiNe thoughts and ideas all the time, it's just that I get weird stares when I do. And tbh, this often launches into a debate, and here, oftne the person doesn't care about the topic or simply can't keep up.\n\nI for one, actually do better socially when I shut the fuck up. \n\n> If you miss someone and want to hang out with them it might seem like they don’t care, but the truth is probably that they don’t get how you feel at all because your INTP behaviour makes it seem like you don’t care about anyone. Allow yourself to be vulnerable\n\nAgain, not really about vulnerability. More like apathy in that case.\n\nTbh, "being vulnerable" here is openning with your lower function, say, Fe/Fi, but the real "you" is really Ti. Let's be honest, we don't give a fuck about our own feelings, what is there to be gained if someone understand you Fi wise but still not Ti wise ?\n\nSeems counter productive, tbh. Of course, you can then use that to try something else, and expose your Ti ideas, but it's not like you couldn't do that from the start... \n\n**Anyway, cosplaying as something you are not, here, an emotional perosn, won't help the "real" you be understood. They will understand the Fi/Fe you, not the Ti you. Worst case scenario, people will actually feel lied to. I've seen relationship post on this very sub about that problem, where at the start, the INTP is wonderful, attentive, etc, but after a while, becomes more distant and all that. We go back to our natural tendencies, play pretend can only last for so long...**  You should work on your Fi, which along the aforementionned Se is the cause of our problem since we don't get that people operate in it... But still, while being open Fi wise will help you make friends, etc, but it won't help you be more "understood".  More integrated or able to understand others, though ? Surely. So it's worth working on. \n\n***\n**"4. Vulnerability is confidence, and it’s attractive"**\n\nKinda, but not really. Confidence certainly is attractive, but not all vulnerability is confidence... \n\n> I used to feel weak when I shared stuff with others that make me vulnerable. This isn’t true. Actually, it shows real confidence because not many people are able to do that.\n\nNah, people do it all the time ? It's probably a rare thing only for us who never do it. \n\n> As INTP our inferior Fe actually gives us a very pure and childlike way of processing emotions.\n\nNot really, Fe is concerned with the group value, and while we can very well be childlike and pure here, if not naive, wanting everyone to get along and all that, it's not really "processing emotions"\n\nThe F function are actually about like or dislike, and your values. Not feelings, well not really. And another note, feelings and emotions are actually two completely different layers, with emotions being a lot more raw, so that one for sure aren't the F domain. \n\n> If you share it with the world it’s actually rather cute to them because it’s so pure. If you tap into your INTP directness to share these pure feelings you will seem super confident because not many people have the guts to do that.\n\nLol, sure. You used your experience beforehand to say you missed chances with some girls, then, I assume for this, you've got some experience too ? Like, practicing what you're preaching ?\n\nIf so, how did it work for you ? Tbh, I'm pretty sure you didn't look more "confident". \n\n\nOverall, it's about if you're confident into what you're exposing, if it shows that you won't be moved, that thoses are immovable convictions and beliefs ? Then sure. Share your uncertainties, or really, something you're actually weak about ? People may relate, but they won't think you're "confident" or attractive. \n\n**The act of exposing yourself isn't admired in itself, it's all about the content...**\n\n***\n> Conclusion: if you want to say something – say it, if you want to know something - ask, if something someone did is bothering you – let them know, if you want to do something – do it, and, most importantly of all, if you miss or love someone – tell them.\n\nYeah, I don't think it works in practice. I think you wrote this right after having an "Eureka" moment, where all the puzzle pieces suddendly fit into place, which you hurriedly summarized into this post ? Your somewhat excited writing style kinda shows that, but maybe it's just BS from me. (I wrote similar "I made a discovery" posts here on others topics, so maybe I can relate)\n\nAnyway, you didn't consider everything. For example, that half I want to say is actually offensive to people, and won't help them since they won't listen... So I have to censor myself so as to not *hurt them*, not me. \n\nYou're exagerating the part of us that feels vulnerable far too much, and explaining our "privacy/aloofness" using it, but it's not really that thing. Say, what about the "I don't want to bother people" feelings ? It's not vulnerability, but I can think of a few examples where it stopped me from saying stuff. Ie, not being selfish. (Tbh, it's also a bit insulting ? Like, along all thoses anxiety posts we see here everyday, people are starting to think INTPs are NF who aren't honest with themselves, this is not the case. Beside for the ton of mistyped INFPs here.)\n\n...\n\n**Anyway, working on paying attention FiSe wise would help you more than being "vulnerable".** It's not because you share something than others will too. They will do it if they feel "safe" with you (the types that care about this Fi stuff, not us), and while epxosing your own vulnerability can somewhat be a guarantee, it's not a 1:1 trade. \n\n
33	Anyone feel uncomfortable forming an opinion even for subjective topics without doing research?	Example. "Can men and women just be friends (and is it overall beneficial for the man)?" This is a widely debated topic on the internet, something I've been aware of for years. It's mostly a subjective thing, like in a sense it's whatever you value , whatever works for you, or even whatever you want to believe.\n\nWhen it comes to Fe-related questions and anything to do with social/cultural norms, I tend to feel uncomfortable about trying to make anything out of my limited experiences and any pre-conceptions I have about the question. I think that everyone else's opinion must be a lot more educated than mine so I go browsing the web (reading almost a hundred web pages) for what other people argue. Then I examine what I think are the best arguments and pit them against each other and refine them. But I still don't necessarily form a conclusion or a fixed opinion (thanks, Phase II of INTP life stages...).\n\nI think when I was a teenager I was a more arrogant and confident that I could derive a solid opinion from thought experiments alone. But as an adult I operate more on the basis that I can tweak or improve on other people's ideas as opposed to building my own from scratch. It's interesting that this is also the approach I take to music; I don't write scores from scratch, I transpose what other people have made or improve on other people's arrangements, mainly because I don't think I can make a better core feel or foundation than other people.
29	Yeah, and I drive people nuts with it.  \n\n\n"Give me a snappy answer!"  \n\n\n"I can't; I need more info."  \n\n\n"No, just give me an answer!"  \n\n\n"I CAN'T! I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M ANSWERING!"
5	Depends what you mean by "friends" exactly, and what level of friendship. Also, are you saying friendship with absolutely no sexual attraction?  \n\n\n  \nSee with Ti we have to be very specific. Ti is all about true or false. And if we can't answer with true or false then we break the question down further until we can.  Once we get some solid findings, Ne will piece together a big picture. Until we get to the point where we manage to conclude something like... "well in this \[insert\] context, yes men and women can be friends. But in this \[insert\] context, no." And so on.   \n\n\n  \n\n\n 
5	With most subjects, yes. Occasionally, especially with my INTP Irish twin, I get annoyed mid conversation and say things without evidence, then abuse Google to find the evidence myself because I wouldn't claim something that didn't have evidence to back it up, even if it was personal evidence.\n\nFor example, your hypothetical. The latter bit about being "beneficial" to the man would set me off because it could be interpreted as very sexist. I'd use my own personal experiences first, but for the most part I'd find factual information. Especially with a fellow intellectual. 
3	To so many things I end up arguing from both sides, to a yes/no question i have arguments for both, but I dont decide for one.
2	I'm often willing to give opinions even if not backed by research or airtight logic, but then I will try to be VERY clear that those opinions are to be taken with all the skepticism possible. Ultimately, I think it is impossible for me not to have flawed or incomplete opinions, but at least I can try to be as honest about them as I can.
4	Nah. I have found that research leads to a conclusion that something is correct or incorrect. So it basically is a coin flip. I researched everything up to age 25, but my accuracy was imperfect. So I just started flipping a coin, any my accuracy went up. Only works with a lucky coin and you can't have mine.
1	Oh, yes, and if I don't have enough info or experience, I'll just listen and ask questions (unless the convo is being dominated by bulldozing EJs, in which case I'll most likely check out... sorry, lol).  I was like you when I was a teenager too, and I approach much of my art in a manner similar to how you approach your music... sort of a permutation of an existing concept.  To that end, I think, as we both mature as artists, we'll be able to create from scratch.  We'll develop certain instincts.  I do it a little with my abstract stuff and learning to trust what emerges from that is pretty cool.  Why wouldn't the same thing happen as we continue to listen, observe, and experience in life?

-1	To answer the question, the guy can be friends with a girl if he had a lot of options outside the friendship. Constantly pulling tail and highly desirable to the opposite sex.\n\nOr the girl is simply unnatractive to the guy. \n\nThis is my personal experience. In both cases the girl will develop feelings for you and you can escalate to a sexual relationship if you wanted. \n\nOutside of this you are getting cucked. 
12	I'm an INTP with a stutter. Ask me anything.	
14	Does that voice in your head, which is vocalizing your thoughts, stutter too?
7	In your dreams, do you still stutter?
8	Do you stutter when you sing? 
8	Does your handwriting have sections that look like a seismograph wrote it?
5	Does the stutter reliably go away under any specific set of circumstances?
4	Goddamn i enjoy this sub just for how concise the questions and answers are. My ti really appreciates it.
3	Must suck to know your brain just decided to be inefficient. I already have trouble expressing myself quickly. Is it really slow for you?
3	Do you stutter when talking about your interests?
2	If you were to, say, read a prepared speech aloud, but in your room by yourself with no one near, would you stutter?
2	I've had situations where I stutter because my mind has either traveled too far from my thought process or i've split my thoughts into too many different directions. Do you experience something similar?
2	What made you post it???\n🤔 I too stutter....\nBecause only when I get pissed off/irritated I start asking questions or telling them to ask me questions, any questions...\nJust to change my perspective or waste more valuable time.\nLoL
3	Have you ever used the line "Did I fuckin' stutter?" when someone doubts what you just said?
1	As a fellow INTP, I would like to ask how you manage conveying your thoughts when you are bambling about a topic you love? There must me so many thoughts trying to take over mid sentence.
1	Do you want to get rid of it? Have you done any research on it or tried some methods?
-3	How is babby formed? How girl get pragnent?
0	INTP? I don't know how to title this	I researched a lot of MBTI and INTP after discovering it about a week ago. \n\nSince the first letter of INTP stands for 'introverted', it makes me skeptical. Yes, I never start conversations and I sometimes ignore people (I am not proud of admitting this), but I don't mind speaking in front of many people and I can be very talkative when I'm with the right person.\n\nYes, I am logical... I guess. I do enjoy browsing through the wiki and finding out random facts, but I don't research every time I'm having a debate. I rely on personal experiences- but I guess I can defend this by saying I just simply don't care about the debates enough to put in the effort to research.\n\nApparently, INTPs are very intelligent. To be honest, I don't feel very intelligent and I have never considered myself of being intelligent. I always told myself that I was an idiot, actually. I don't really have the best self-confidence. \n\nI don't know if I'm an INTP or not. I just wanted to ramble and I don't know how to end this bye
2	This entire block of text just screamed "I am definitely an INTP" lol. \n\n"Introvert" in this situation is not defined by a person who sits alone all day (even though some of us do, myself included). It's mostly referring to your cognitive functions, which in our case our dominant function is introverted thinking. INTP are however a part of the "shadow" type which is not an initiating type, we prefer to be approached. I can also testify that I am good at speaking to an audience and feel comfortable doing so. \n\n"Thinking" makes you prefer reason to feeling. Introverted thinking in particular just makes you live in your head and logic everything and anything. I also don't go into debates with a binder full of statistics and facts. \n\nThe thing that might make you feel dumb is your preference of intuition over sensing, especially since intuitives are a lot less common. We're not dumb, we're just different as far as how our brains work. \n\nI recommend you look into the cognitive functions a bit more, it should clarify some things (that is, if you are actually an INTP). \n\nEDIT: If anyone reading this is more experienced in this area and notices I said something wrong please correct me I am not a professional. Though I shouldn't even have to say this in a subreddit full of INTPs.
3	How do you personally define intelligence?	
9	Intelligence is the ability to understand and solve problems. Problems could be anything from scientific principles to emotions or how to have a wonderful day. None is any better than any other kind.
2	Ability to penetrate the reality of a situation. Everything else is just a talent i.e - mathematical ability, art, social skills, memory, writing. 
1	The mental capacity to solve problems
1	The ability to apply knowledge to a real problem.\n\nThere are plenty of academically-brilliant morons.
1	Pattern recognition. 
1	In my view, I believe that intelligence doesn't just depend words, emotion, or even how one does on an IQ test, but it mainly depends on how well a person can see value between the idea itself (i.e. the abstract world that humans create) as well as the real world in which it thrives or can thrive in (i.e. the real world in which we live in). \n\nTake math for example; anyone can learn a simple algorithm in a mathematical concept, but it takes true intelligence to see how that algorithm can be used in the real world (i.e. using the pythagorean theorem to make buildings after learning it in school). \n\nIn my view, intelligence is a symbolic device; and a symbolic device contains a variety of paths of which one must immerse his/herself within as a finite human being in order to reach a higher understanding. By doing so, a person begins to see how the truths within those paths relate to one's past, present, and future. Upon doing so, the person begins to see how the truths are, in a way, universal. That's the key point of my view; that it's because intelligence is relative that it is, in a sense, universal. 
1	The ability to have complete accurate and complex assessments on information
0	Being sapient. Humans are sapient. Modern day animals such as, dolphins, elephants, and octopuses come very close to sapience. 
2	How do i tell if im INTP or INFP?	fuck i promised i'd leave MBTI alone since its pseudoscience but here i am again lol. But yeah, i've gotten INFP before but i took a test and now im INTP and im just curious as to which one i am now. By the way, even when i got INFP i think it was like a 40% thinking and 60% feeling so it was kind of in the middle. I forgot my exact results for when i got INTP but i think it was around 50% for each. So how can i tell for certain?
5	INFP are lame
3	You needa learn the difference between Ti/Fe and Fi/Te
1	Do you feel like your infp or do you think that your intp?
1	INTP has different cognitive functions to an INFP. I didn’t know either until I watched a video about the different cognitive functions, after I did I knew I was an INTP.
1	I don't know ,but I always visit other reddit to see which interest me more .INTP reddit is always filled with meme+random fact meanwhile INFP is aesthetic photo+"anyone else 'insert story'" .Find which content you like/relate more .Also how do you act when under stress ,INFP having inferior Te would lash out or snap ,INTP having inferior Fe would withdrawn from world .Also INTP more cluesless in romance or rather they simply do not care ,INFP can imagining possible romance scene in their head that they want to do.
1	If you consider INFP you are not INTP
1	You tryna decide if you’re an eggplant or an apple. Its not that hard between the two types. What is your dominant or preferred function set. Do you make decisions through your emotions(fi) or your mind / thought process (ti). 
2	Books recommendation?	I want to start reading but I don't know where to start I thought I ask here \n\np.s: Sorry for the bad English 
2	1.The perks of being a wallflower by Stephen Chbosky. Quite sad but it's really beautiful written. It's mainly for teenagers because it goes like this: It's a series of letters that a boy writes to somebody telling his daily life, his bad day, his good days, traumas from the past... I've read it a lot since I was 15 (I'm 19 now).\n\n2.Any book of Edgar Allan Poe but I recommend the short stories, and the murder of Morgue Street. A curiosity of Poe is that you never know when he's talking about him and when stars the story. It's really entertaining. I really like "The Murder of Morgue Street" because it's a detective story, and I love them as you could tell because of the next suggestion.\n\n3.Any of Sherlock Holmes books by Arthur Conan Doyle. I haven't read it all yet but my fav is the first book "Study in Scarlet" (for now).\n\n4.The tree of Knowledge by Pío Baroja. It's a philosophical novel about live. Awesome. \n\n5.Three Tops Hats by Miguel Mihura. It's a comedy  about a couple who's going to get married but in the previous night of the wedding happens lot of unexpected things.\n\nI can't remember any other titles right now but I think you have quite a lot yet hahaha.\n
3	Chemistry	Do you think chemistry can be one sided? Can others sense when two people have chemistry..is it something visible? \n\nI'm finding this train of thought about feelings confusing and difficult to put into words. Has anyone given this thought before?
3	I was interested until i realised what type of chemistry you were talking about.
1	I think it’s something both parties feel, which is almost always unspoken at first. But I suppose, at least in my experience, it can be misleading at times. I think attraction (in any way) comes as a natural connection with this in which there’s a desire to just be close to the other person, more than even on a physical level if that makes sense. Maybe I’m interpreting your post incorrectly. In short though yes, I think it can be both one sided and not, visible and known to both parties but not always on the outside.
406	Pretty much.	
126	Is this an INTP thing? I personally don’t relate. Do you guys thing rates of aromanticism are really higher for INTP’s, I don’t see why there necessarily a connection there 
18	what's the apostrophe doing there
17	I don't relate as an INTP. But I did break up with my last boyfriend 3 days and I relate on that level so hard. I'm not over him and so not ready to date. 
13	thank's'es'esses'\n\n&#x200B;
20	Aaaand then cupid's last breath was to stab with the arrow directly... and we go like "DAMMIT!!!" 
6	hum, I haven't felt in love for quite some time now, I miss it
6	Maybe it's female INTP. It's me for sure. I can't help falling in love, but I don't want too because it never works out in the end and just ends up awful. Nothing I can do to fight it, but that anger is real accurate.
7	Well I personally relate.  Falling in love seems to take a lot of work. 
13	This fits my personality perfectly
14	r/aromantic 
9	I don't relate to the whole INTP vs Emotions thing\n\nI have emotions like everyone and i can actually deal with them less well than the average person.  If an INTP doesn't like emotions then id argue its because he doesn't know how to deal with them. 
3	This is me now only because old INTP me has fallen head over heels so many times I’d like to think I’m learning something.
3	Non INTPs: "Is this really how INTPs are?"\nINTPs: "The god damn apostrophe!"
2	Jesus. Wow. I feel personally attacked.  
2	Yeah, other people suck
5	Nothing but trouble 
1	Standard
1	I’d grab the bow and break it over his head 
1	Exactly me. Just because i like someone, I will never pursue them because i dont want to involve in complicated mess (I know nothing about relationship and dont bother about it). Admire from a far is more than enough so i can focus on other things that i can actually control or at least wont affect me so much if i started to get boring and decided to drop it. Losing myself in a relationship is an odd feeling. Like placing a fish in Legoland and expect him to enjoy it.
1	Too damn relatable, my gf* (won't be that much longer I'm afraid) is on her way to 'talk' and me building a wall is a primary reason... Just knocked at my door wish me luck
1	Ok you got it wrong. Believe it or not but INTP people actually care a lot more than most people would. We are just incapable of expressing this. Basically for me. When I'm trying to express my emotions it feels like I'm walking through a thick foggy mist with only a small petty flash light with a very dim light that's about to go flat at any second. And the moment it goes flat I feel that mist suffocating me and subjugating my mind with its pathetic stupid time wasting ineffective mushy lovey dovey crap. Also if you want my opinion about relationships I'm gonna say it all in caps.\n\n\nUNLIKE MOST STUPID PEOPLE OUT IN THIS WORLD FALLING HEAD OVER HEELS AT LITTERALY ANY PERSON THEY FIND REMOTELY ATTRACTIVE!! BECAUSE THEY DONT KNOW HOW TO THINK WITH THEIR MINDS INSTEAD OF THEIR DICKS\PUSSIES I UNDERSTAND THAT RELATIONSHIPS ARE A RESPONSIBILITY. NOT A LUXURY!!!  THESE RELATIONSHIPS TAKES A LOT OF TIME AND A LOT OF HARD WORK, DEDICATION, DEVOTION AND FAITH TO STRENGTHEN AND PROTECT. LOVE IS A SACRED DIVINE MIRACLE THAT THE PRISMATIC LIGHT OF HEAVEN DID NOT GIVE TO US TO ABUSE WITH A CROTCHES LADIES AND GENTELMEN. \n\n
0	Uhhh hate feels. Makes me vulnerable. 
0	me
0	I get this in terms of wanting romantic feelings to be based on something real.
3	I'm INTP	and at any time I can suddenly immerse in thoughts. Most of the time I think about time travelling, black holes, fourth dimension, how does our brain work and other scientific stuff. I even did my own little research on time traveling (I came up with idea of that you need to teleport somewhere every moment time goes back to prevent bumping into yourself from past). So, do you, INTPs, have the same thing?
2	Im not sure whether im an INFP or INTP but i guess i do it as well. I have my own kind of sci-fi universe in my head and sometimes i like to research space and blackholes and all that sometimes while daydreaming and worldbuilding in my head. 
1	Hi, be sure to spread love in all of your travels. Humanity needs it!
10	What's the most common MBTI type you're friends with?	I hope the title made sense I'm high on 2 cups of coffee and a redbull. I'm aware that's not a good excuse but anyway,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll of my friends are INFP's. I also have 1 ISTP friend. \n\nTell me about your friends
10	[deleted]
6	2 of my closest friends are INFJS. I seem to get along with INFJs really well. 
4	I surrounded by SJ types. Nightmare. But i have few friends like NF types.
2	best friend INTJ\n\nnext close is INTP, ENTJ, INFP\n\nand one ESFP who is sorta my cousin, so that explains it :)
2	For me, INTJs
1	Not sure whom to consider friends, but let's say a few INTPs, a couple of INFPs, ESTJ and ISTP.
1	Currently ? My closest friends are an *ENFJ*, an *ENFP* and an *INFP*. In a wider circle, I've got a few *INTP* friends.\n\nTwo people I've been considering getting closer to are *INFJ*s, and another possible close friend would (probably) be an *ENTP*.
1	I have one friend who's no doubt an INTP, but I get on famously with ENFPs. Much like vampires, my hang up is about making the approach, and I find ENFPs just take care of that part for the both of us, both when it comes to initiating the friendship as well as when we are around other people in a group. Metaphorically, it feels like I can just walk at a leisurely pace and the way will be clear.
1	I get along best with INTJ's and ISTP's.  Also other INTP's. 
1	My best friend is an ISTJ and I really admire her penchant for efficiency, desire for cold logic and hardheadedness. She is incredibly stubborn, but she has high regard for me and it's the primary reason we get along very well.\n\nMy other close friends are INFPs, INTPs, INTJs and a single ExFP.\n\nI'd like to befriend an INFJ in curiosity as to whether the INTP/INFJ "golden duo" exists as they say.
1	I asked my friends to do the test from 16 personalities (some I can confirmed correct but some not sure). But here are the most common: \n\nMost common is ISFJ (4), ISFP (4), ENFP (3), ISTP (2)\n\nLeast common: INFJ (1) & ESFP (1). Others I don’t include because I am not fond of them and these two are the types I want to meet more. 
1	Okay but anyone else ridiculously attracted to ENFPs? 
1	INTJ and ENTP. Haven’t met many other INTP’s, but it seems like half of them are socially retarded and I dislike them, but the other half function without being pure cringe in public, so I can have good chats with them and trust them not to embarrass me or do some autist shit that ruins the atmosphere without reason. Generally I consider myself a socially competent INTP, and INTP’s who haven’t developed their Fe to the same degree as me kind of make me feel more awkward and embarrassed by extension and remind me of how I was when I was younger. 
1	I have 3 infp friends, an isfp, and one I cannot type for the life of me but I'm sure shes esfp
1	I have lots of INTJ friends, an INFP, some INFJs, and an ISTJ. Never really had an argument with the INTJs, but some clashes ideologically with the INFP. 
1	2x infp, 2x infj, 1x enfp
82	like come on brain why can't you think of this stuff earlier	
9	That's because your Ne was taking a nap, but now you got one in bag ready to go
1	saem
1	I think this is common of all personality types. But I actually think INTPs are a more observant and aware type, so probably can argue better or process faster than some others.
1	Eh, things like this happen all the time. It's like when you're playing a strategy game (like Chess or Go) and after the game you review what happened only to wonder what possessed you to *not play this incredibly obvious move*
1	practice quickens the wit.
1	So relatable. Except 20 minutes later, a few hours later, a few days later, a few years, later. 
1	Literally tho 🚫🧢
2	Hobbies	Hello INTPs, \n\nWhat are your hobbies? What do you do for fun? What is your ideal way to spend the day/night? 
2	Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. It’s a solo kind of sport which tests every aspect of my brain and body. It also brings out the social side of me. Adrenaline is a wonderful thing. 
2	I like to read and just research random things on the wiki
2	Art and learning.
1	I like to play bucket drums in public places. My friends in I will go sit in front of some buildings and just jam out for awhile. It's great fun. 
1	I love programming (using Java)
1	My hobby is guess is collecting historical documents and signatures. For me, having a document signed by Abraham Lincoln or Einstein is oddly satisfying.\n\nFor fun I work and play. If something is not fun, I pretty much won't do it. Almost all of my fun involves other people. Especially at night.

6	Any of you guys was able to be academically successful? And how?	  
10	[deleted]
7	Keep trying even after you fail. That's really it. Just don't quit. 
5	I study my butt off and try to avoid to many distractions. I can sit and study for 5 hours and be so distracted that i accomplish what I could have done undistracted in 1.5 hours.
5	Remained convinced despite failures and fuckups and setbacks and depression that getting a diploma in science would open valuable doors for me and that the field would be a source of motivation (let's face it, I have always been and will always be a fucking biology nerd).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLowered my standards from 'have to prove you care enough to single-mindedly pursue top grades and become the next Darwin' to 'just fucking get a passing grade and gtfo' so I could finally face the pressure, stop feeling trapped by unreasonable goals, and graduate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI got in total three years delayed while catching up one year again, got my master's degree in biology eventually, then ran from academia to find myself a job in the corporate biotech world. Actually been having a good time working with some like-minded people. So, despite having mediocre grades, I consider graduating in the end (rather than quitting or bouncing from one thing to the next) as successful. I felt that despite the bullshit and the anxiety, the end result was worth it, stopped feeling sorry for myself, and committed to reaching that goal no matter how slow or undignified it looked.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for 'remaining in academics and actually getting anywhere with it', haha lol, only if you're prepared to sell your soul, basically. I've never had one single interest that'd make me happy if I pursued it and only it for my whole life, so I guess that shit just ain't for me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy advice: commit to what makes sense to you, and then fucking work towards it in your own way. As long as you get there, it doesn't fucking matter whether you were following a Perfect Student's Handbook or doing the Procrastinator's Limbo Of Death, just keep pushing, do what it takes to pass, and believe in the fact that you can make it there intact as the person you are.
2	I was very successful academically through law school. I would not recommend my methods, but I think it depends on how your brain likes to receive information.\n\nPossibly because of undiagnosed ADHD, I could never take decent notes, and when I tried, I just threw them away. At the end of the semester, I had no notes, no assignments, nothing.\n\nAs luck would have it, I have an unusual memory. I can remember most of what I have read and nearly everything I heard. I found that I remembered enough through high school to get mostly A's, but not the highest. In college, I tried notes again but gave up.\n\nI developed the ability to pay attention to the professor, and my oral memory improved. I often answered exam questions with the professor's own words. While I was an astronomy and physics major, I found that my memory allowed me to figure out exam questions that at  first seemed unknown. I bailed on that at the 600 level and focused on liberal arts.\n\nWhen I went to law school, I knew I was in the big leagues and had to get my act in gear. So I took careful notes and saved them in organized notebooks. After the first week, I went back and reviewed my notes. It was like reading something for the first time.\n\nSo I said screw it and went back to my old ways. It was much better in law school because the professor's literally say everything you needed for exams.\n\nWhen I listened, i tried to put the information into context with what else I had learned, and I saw all kinds of connections. I have always been more interested in connections than details.\n\nSome of my law professor's freaked out to have a student just watching and listening to them. A few told me that I needed to learn to take notes or would not last. I was first in my class after one year, second after the second year and graduated third in my class after three years. I am glad law school is only 3 years.\n\nThis worked for me because it was how my mind worked. I did not know I have ADHD until I was 50, and I wonder if it may have helped me.\n\nI am an extreme case, but I was always surprised at how little my classmates remembered come exam time. If I take notes, the information is in my notes but not in my head. As an attorney, I still do not takes notes. Even my calendar is mostly in my head.\n\nMy advice would be to take a week's worth of notes and see how much was already in your head and how much is just in your notes. If you do not know and remember it after a week, you won't remember it at the end of the semester, and exam prep will really be learning.\n\nFind the balance or system that produces the notes you need but still leaves you engaged enough to own the information. Everyone is different, and you should find what works for you. A classmate recoded every class and took extensive note in class, then listened to the recording and just thought about later. I could never make myself listen.\n\nYou have a way to be successful academically, but it is not an out of the box solution or what you were told to do. Find the limits of your memory and trust it. When you fight the right method and balance it will just feel right.

2	I'm trying to be less academically successful because it's a waste of my life
1	I'm currently doing great in high school. \n\nbut I don't study most of the time. i just read through the material right before my exams and that's it. 
1	The goal of academic success is to get somewhere. Once you are there, who tf cares, really (unless you want to be an academic for the rest of your life, then I guess you care).\n\nI made sure I was academically successful in high school just so I could get into a good college. For me, it really wasn't that difficult as the material in high school was not that difficult. I had poor study habits - studied in front of the TV if I bothered to study; I took poor notes; I failed to listen attentively in class after I felt I knew what the material was. This set me up for failure in college - academic failure. Not to mention having someone wah wah wah at me in an auditorium bored me to tears so I never went to class. Despite my own self destructive behavior, I did manage to go to a good college and manage to graduate from said college. Even better, I was able to get a job not based on my academic prowess (which I just explained was poor) but because I networked. That's laughable right?\n\nTo date, I continue to get jobs through networking and cold calls and pure legwork. Despite being an analyst at work, I manage to do credible work even though I get distracted from actually working every 5 minutes. I even managed to obtain industry certifications (that require lots of testing) again despite being majorly distracted while studying.\n\nYou figure out what works for you. Use your weaknesses to an advantage and lean heavily on your strengths. My pattern recognition was so strong that I didn't really study, I just did sample problems for testing. I read just enough material to understand the pattern and avoid having to delve into details that don't affect the bottom line. My ways may not work for you. Trial and error until you get it.
0	What if we had a device that could scan your brain and measure your intelligence	That would be so interesting if I knew what everyone’s iq was and how mine compares. I’m tripping also, I like being immersed in my own mind, Music is really good.\n\nBut yeah we could group students in classes based on intelligence so they get the correct guidance. So say everyone’s iq was common knowledge like their ssn. Every brain scanned and placed in a data base. Scientists could find the smartest people in the world and get them together. Etc. just an idea, and tripping on dex
2	Sounds like "Gataca".
4	You are both misunderstanding and over-valuing intelligence. Intelligence is not a thing. It is countless things. Mozart was not particularly "smart" but he was a genius. Where does Picasso fit in?\n\nEven if we could claim to measure intelligence, other elements of character like determination, empathy, and insight are just as important. You are drunk on the INTP Kool-Ade that intelligence is the measure of people. It is not.\n\nSuggesting grouping students by "intelligence" so they get the "correct guidance" is treating them like cattle. Should we just off the dumb ones for their own good.\n\nHuman beings cannot be measured or judged in any respect.
1	I would like to do that, but based on my measure of intelligence and comprehension. It depends how you define intelligence, what if you're not intelligent enough to realise how unintelligent you or the people you selected are? Then you'd be fucked. Also you just can't afford for everyone to be an intellectual, who's going to be happy to do the manual labour while the intellectuals are off on their scholarly pursuits. Nature has balanced everything out for a reason.  Which is why NTs are only ~12%of the population.

14	Who has an effective formula for small talk	I’m horrible at it, I don’t like it and inevitably lose interest.
13	Look deep into their eyes and nod and inject some uhhm huh and mhmmm’s here and there.
11	I have found that every person has an interesting life story and something to teach me. In "small talk," I make it my mission to learn what they are.  The key is to focus the conversation on them, not me. And to resist that impulse to add pertinent information or correct them. This will not work if you are using a "formula." When you use a formula, you are thinking about the formula, not the other person.  If you have a genuine interest in and curiosity about people, then the conversation will end too soon and leave you with questions for the next time.
11	Ask them about the weather, and then segue that into a question they haven't probably been asked before, slightly related to their answer.
16	You are adorable.  Only an INTP would ask for a formula for small talk. I mean that in the best possible way. I love INTPs.  
8	Go observe some ESTPs. They never seem to run out of things to say.
3	Game-ify it. Try to notice trends and patterns in responses. Map them out accordingly to the way you categorize ppl (archetypal). Try new speech paths to see how robust their small talk can be. 
6	I've got you covered.\n\n**INTP Small-Talk Formula:**\n\n1. By default, assume all women are ESFX and that all men are ESTX. (If not, assume women are ISFX and men are ISTX. They won't want to small-talk anyway. Have to pick your battles.)\n2. On Mondays, ask people about past-tense verbs and direct objects.\n3. On Fridays, ask people about future-tense verbs and direct objects.\n\nAs needed: ask people about themselves and, eventually, say at least one nice thing or one validating thing to every single person you'll have to nod/white-people-smirk at on a regular basis.\n\nAs an INTP, you'll naturally develop a reputation for being more quiet/aloof, so the nice things you say won't come across as insincere. Plus, people won't hold you to the same small-talk standard as they would everybody else. Your effort will be obvious and appreciated.\n\n**TL;DR "He keeps to himself, but he's really nice."**
3	Small talks is about observations in the S domain, what happened ? When ? Etc
2	Talk about animals or pets. Most people have them and if they don't they probably want one. 
2	Weather, then next week's weather, then last week's weather, then last years weather, then next years weather, then weather in other areas of the planet. Should take up at least 15 minutes.
2	Awareness of impending small talk+walking away=far less small talk
2	There isn't really a formula. I can only hold small talk for a couple minutes, so if it's worth doing I will move on to more important topics and get on with the conversation. Otherwise, if it's not worth having an actual conversation with the person, I'll engage for a minute and find some excuse to disengage. 
2	Small talk can serve any number of purposes. So it depends on the situation. 
2	- start with a common topic , \n- listen and respond to what they say\n- encourage them to move to non small-talk topics

2	Human beings are social animals. We need relationships to have a meaningful life. All of us do. Life without relationships is not possible. You might as well be asking who hates oxygen.

32	Intuition has allowed INTP to do this without an instruction manual. 
11	Turns out, when there are other people around, you’re supposed to play with them.  Playing with yourself when others are around makes the teacher call your parents.
3	Haha, I don't need a book for that! 
2	Finally, this book is getting places!

1	What are you views on the concept of altruism/selflessness?	Altruism implies selflessness from an individual, and the tendency to care for the well being of others without being interested in the benefits to the self. It is one of the greatest virtues one could be associated with, because it is the opposite of flaws such as selfishness, greed, and callousness. However, I have heard more than once that true altruism does not exist, which makes me wonder if altruism itself has a selfish root to it. \n\nWhenever we do something that could be considered "altruistic", we tend to satisfy our own desire and ego simultaneously. If a mother jumps in front of a car in order to prevent her children from being ran over, she is acting out of her own desire to preserve her loved ones. If a person donates all his life savings to charity, he is also nourishing his own ego by being what he believes to be a "good person". Anecdotally speaking, whenever I do something "altruistic", I feel personally happy, because it preserves my sense of ego by allowing me to feel that I am good, and a positive force in life. \n\nTo me altruism is based on one's own desire and sense of self, but is expressed through benefiting others. When a person does something that benefits the well being of the others, his own desire to feel content and proud is also to be satisfied. In other words, altruism exists as a result of a person's own desires, and it cannot exist if it doesn't have any impact on one's ego and self interests. \n\nI also think it is beneficial for humans to be "selfishly altruistic" because humanity is a collective species as a whole; any actions that benefits others is conductive to the species' success as a whole. Therefore, those who have stronger desire to act in a way that benefits others is likely to be rewarded by both internal self assurance and external validation.
4	The way I see it, altruism is a net positive whether it comes from a selfish root or not.  There's a reason why heroes are celebrated throughout time and rewarded for their virtues.  If an altruist feels some kind of glee from helping somebody, a bit of pleasure, what does it matter?
2	Well it's mostly like you wrote. Dawkins explained altruism as caring for your own species, even if not directly related.\n\nPersonally i have this odd idea that if i help people out, out of goodness of my heart, i will have put some value into our society. Some of which may work like karma is allegedly supposed to, by giving me rewards down the line. You may form new relationships with people, and they might consider your help a debt of gratitude. Who knows, maybe that stranger might be your doctor in a few years. Or just have good opinion of you, which might spread to others.\n\nThen again, there might be people who would try to abuse that and pull favors from you all the time. So, personal judgment is important here.\n\nEven if it does not happen, it usually leaves me feeling good. I applied my skills to help someone out, i did something useful.
2	I'm definitely a bit selfish whenever I do something good, and I recognize that.  Anything that I do for another person, out of the "goodness of my heart," feels like an investment more than anything else.\n\nWhich is probably why when somebody does something for me, seemingly selfishly, my spidey-senses go off and I get outright suspicious.  Like, "what does this person want from me?"\n\nI know that doesn't clearly answer your question, so here's this: from an INTP's perspective, I'm very cynical of pure, altruistic good.  \n\n
1	I suggest you search for altruism gene or altruism evolution. Altruism is very real, and it is an essential part of being human. It cannot be explained with satisfaction or ego. Evolutionist now believe that our altruism is a kind of group survival, but they really cannot explain \n\nPeople are inherently kind and generous. We may not be able to explain it, but I do not know why anyone would designate or deny what makes us human.
1	Works in theory, assuming no one is selfish
19	Those of you who are married	How?
37	She took pity on me.
15	I have been married to an INFJ for 31 years. We got married because when we purchased a car, the insurance was ridiculously expensive since I was a single male age 21-25. I have always maintained that my marriage means nothing. It is just a designation from the government, and it changed nothing about my relationship. What matters is our mutual love and commitment to each other. \n\nMy wife was the first person that I ever felt accepted me for who and what I am. I came to realize that she also was the first person that I accepted as who and what they are. All of my safeties were blinking and making siren noises when we became romantic, but she somehow was more important. \n\nShe was and remains more important to me than any person, any thing and any thought. Parts of me used to fight that, but they lost. I guess I would say that I fell in love and committed to her by being a person instead of an INTP for a change. In one fell swoop,I realized that there is more to life than all this thinking, and I realized that I really wanted all of it, not just my dark little cubicle.\n\nBest damn decision I ever made.
13	Met online on an rp forum, basically becoming friends around a shared activity we both loved. Over the years of talking basically every day our friendship turned quickly to caring about each other a whole lot. Long distance wasn't much of a problem, we're both ace and never deliberately dated, kind of assumed we'd just remain single until this while thing.\n\nEventually there was a first in person visit after abt 3 years. Went great, was as if we'd known each other like that forever. 2 years later he moves from the USA to Belgium to move in with me while starting a master's degree, i just graduated and got a job. Two more years later we get married, another two we wrap up and move to the USA. We have a cat now.\n\nAnd there I am, an INTP ace nerdlet married to another INTP ace nerdlet, in California, still adjusting after the first month here. We still rp, this time more in the form of dnd with other fun peeps here.
11	She found me on MySpace completely random. She liked my beard. Ten years and two kids later I'm still not sure what happened.
11	I married the first person who seemed to "get" me and was receptive. Big mistake. That understanding? All an act. Cue two decades of **constant** tension and arguing. I'm leaving her, and it feels like getting out of prison
5	Infp here! Married to a weirdo Intp. We met on Tera online through some mutual friends and got along instantly. I appreciate his blunt honesty and logical views. He has helped me a lot in my life. :)\n\nI mostly wouldn't stop talking to him and annoyed him about my love life til he eventually fell in love with me. Lmao. Thank God he has a lot of patience... I guess he was the one that took pity on me. XD I dunno what I'd do without him, lol.
3	Family set it up, so kinda arranged marriage, but we dated and we were both okay with it. But i’m not actually married yet, soon to be.
3	See earlier [thread about being vulnerable](https://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/ayqb2x/itnps_vulnerability_happiness/).\n\nThis doesn't mean, "confess your undying love on the first date."  That would silly.  And scary. 
4	IT’S A TRAP!!\n\nSource: Married lol
4	We were both in the military and met while getting to our first assignment. Both being new helped give us something in common and we started to hang out. I invited her to my gaming group (pen and paper style) and she seemed pretty into that despite not much exposure to that kind of gaming in the past. We just sort of slowly got to know each other by hanging out more and more. Eventually I asked her to marry me and after a total period of about four years, we got married. I designed the cake...
2	I'm still trying to figure that one out (so are my parents).
4	Why do I befriend people and then I feel like I need to abandon them?	I'm in a situation where I meet many new people recently. I'm usually interested in them and I enjoy getting to know them better but after some time I just know that it won't work long term. And at that time they kinda like me and they invite me to sth but I'd rather stay at home... \n\nI guess my problem is that I feel connection to others so rarely. Some people just get along with everyone, they bond so easily. And I don't really mind that I'm not like that. I'd be completely fine having just one person I can truly connect with (I mean it's a super win situation). What I hate tho is that I disappoint people. It's like with me the risk of not having a connection is 95% and I feel that it's unfair for other people when I know the statistics and I still go through the process of getting to know them. It's like I waste their time and play with their feelings. I feel awful when it comes to the moment when I know it won't work. But I can't isolate myself. Do I just accept it or do I play the social game in a wrong way?
7	I think this is something a lot of us share.\nIve noticed (especially when I was in college) I would meet a lot of people, and made friends quiet easily. People liked me, and I liked them. \n\nLike you, I enjoyed it.\n\nBut what I realized is that the people themselves didn't matter to me, the momentary connection did. While they wanted to have more plans and be friends in the true since of the word. I always thought I did too, but the person they met wasn't really me (if there is a real me).\n\nI tend to mirror peoples mannerisms, speech, and mold myself into the person they want to spend time with. So when we hangout after that initial day or night there is always something off. And 9 times out of 10 its me. I have no real interest in them, I was just initially curious about them.\n\nNow im not saying this happens all the time, I do meet people I'm genuinely friends with. But it is a natural reaction for me to put up this visage, a mask of a man that is always changing.\n\nI think a lot of us do this and don't realize it 
3	I have to ask a question. Do you consciously act to abandon them or just fail to maintain connections? My problem was always out of sight out of mind. I just never thought about people, but I was glad when they called to ask if I was dead.
1	I had very similar concerns and I was given some excellent feedback here:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/aynokv/are\_you\_as\_an\_intp\_unafraid\_of\_losing\_friends/](https://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/aynokv/are_you_as_an_intp_unafraid_of_losing_friends/)\n\nAll the best. 
1	Whatever your decision is, in regard to how you wanna deal with the situation, keep in mind that we're all gonna die one day, and suddenly nothing is gonna matter anymore.\nI relate to you brother/sister :)
2	What’s the best school of study an INTP at university?	My take... History. It’s such a big large complex thing with many grey areas pinging off one another and the human factor is amazing. 2nd place goes to meteorology/astronomy. \n\nPS - I’m in my 40s, left school at 16 but never stopped learning. 
8	I will never understand why people insist on thinking the a certain school of thought or profession is appropriate for INTPs. The truth is that we can do whatever we set our minds to, and that those decisions are better left to the heart than the mind. Study and do what you love. 
5	Biology, chemistry, psychology, anthropology, many more like it... anything that contributes to one's understanding of the underlying systems of the reality we live in's all awesome in my eyes.
3	history is a great one. it’s like all those fantasy worlds and stuff but then you realise that what you’re reading actually happened (with reasonable margin of error) and it blows your mind a bit. real life lore

18	People just seem to tell me everything	I was recently called (while smoking copious amounts of marijuana) an “entity” that just happens to “collect information” from others almost unwillingly. By information I mean that people open up to me very quickly and tell me a lot of information about their lives, drama, and what is usually considered to be personal and secretive information. I am an INTP female and am just curious if any of you all experience something similar? 
13	Either people find me easy to open up to or they tend to chronically over share information I am not sure which or if it is just both.
12	YES! I had this conversation at work this week. People are constantly sharing with me, and I have no idea why. From their holiday plans and pics of their dog in dresses, to their wife's menopause and subsequent hysterectomy, to all the details of their vasectomy (including the shaving), to bloody diarrhoea. Who tells this stuff to work colleagues, and why am I always the chosen one? Nobody else gets this level of detail!\n\nSomeone once told me I'm non-judgemental, so people probably feel safe telling me stuff. But I think they have non-judgemental confused with not really caring. Because I really don't.
11	Always followed with "I don't know why I'm telling you all this."\n\n*Ponders career with CIA*
3	Yes, I've found it quite easy to get people to open up.  You just offer up details about your life that the other person would deem personal.
3	Yes.  People have always told me the most personal, most horrific shit and I've never been able to figure out what I'm putting out there that makes me appear so non judgmental and trustworthy.  I mean, they're right, but how could they possibly know that?  Vibes?  Maybe it's that whole "reading people" thing. 
3	I can relate, and often feel like I attract people who use me socially. What it comes down to is, if you’re quiet and willing to listen, you’re going to find yoruself surrounded by narcissistic and overly dramatic people who will talk about themselves and their petty interpersonal drama for hours on end. The same people will never be there for you when you’re going through something hard and need emotional support. If this bothers you, stand up for yourself and don’t give them the attention they want.  
3	Yes, all the time. It's actually a "skill" I found to be quite useful. That is, I primarily use it to get the scuttlebutt in the office. If there's someone who hates someone else, it's important to know the underlying tension in a room because that can explain situations that inevitably arise. Also if there is something secretive and big about to happen in your firm, then knowing early and having a plan B is critical. You can sift through the useless information about birthdays, children, etc. for the actual important information of who might be getting fired, what might happen to your department etc. By playing the trusted listener on the children, you may end up being the recipient of good company secrets.\n\nINTPs are extremely good listeners because 1. we are introverts, 2. we like to gather data, 3. we are non-judgemental, and 4. we typically proffer good advice.
3	Yes, absolutely. I am an atypical INTP, in that I am quite good st reading people's body language and subtle verbal cues. If someone wants to talk about something, I come across as "safe"(or so it's been described to me), so people tell me things. I'm pretty used to being the guy people use as a sounding board because I'm a good listener, and I give decent advice. 
3	i think it's just that i prefer if others do the talking.\n\none thing is that it makes them open up, the other thing is that they enjoy talking about themselves and don't really care about what i have to say anyway.
2	Yes, and adults used to do this with me when I was a teenager.  My high school teachers and camp counselors would talk to me about very personal troubles they were going through.  I just listened because I figured if they were unloading this information on me that they didn’t have anyone close to them who would listen, and I thought that was sad.  
1	Yes ! Male intp here. People seems to speak about their deepest social problems with me and seek answers i don’t know why cause my moral compass is personal so i tend to tell other people about those « secrets » if i judge that it is not something that big of a deal ... also i love drama. But they keep coming back ...
1	Yes. I can confirm this.
1	Any advice?	Tl;Dr: Considering skipping college, starting up my own thing, don't know if it will be worth it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI need some advice. I'm at the end of high school right now, will potentially be starting college this fall. My major choice is CS related and I have already got into some great universities. CS is actually something I like, I've been into software and a bit of hardware for the last 5-6 years and it's been a blast.\n\nThing is, I looked into the college courses and I have covered 3/4ths of the syllabus by myself over this duration, not in a theoretical or perfectionist manner obviously, I don't remember any theory except how to make my code work and how to make it do whatever I want it to do. So I'm considering if it will be worth the money.\n\nI have built apps, made assistants and automated a couple homes, started an NGO as well as developed a couple backends for some companies and completed a lot of personal hardware projects. Now that I'm thinking of the future most people get into, well, the thought of being caught up in a job sounds really boring to me, partly because I have a bit of hatred against routine and seeing how much I change my hobbies, I am doubt my ability to stick to a job because my interests change too fast. If not different fields, definitely different parts of the field.\n\nRight now, the most risk free path seems to go, get a degree, get some work experience, learn how companies work, for a couple years maybe, and then come back to my hometown and start my own thing. But I look around me and it's like, most of the old people I know have so many unfulfilled dreams and I'm a bit scared I may end up like them because I'll be losing at least 6 years in this process.\n\nEven my own parents have been caught up in a job ever since they completed graduation because of finances. And then there's the problem of college tuition, it's a fucking lot for a piece of paper that I probably won't be using after a couple years in a job. Hopefully.\n\nAt least in my country. It all just seems like everyone's caught in a race since the day they are born and no one knows where's the finish line at. I just want to kind of break free but there's so many things that could go wrong and lead to me being reliant instead of independent which is basically my goal. Being free.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's all, any advice on what should I choose to do? and any other alternative paths?\n\n&#x200B;
2	For me, college was a lot more about growing up in an environment where I could not do serious damage than anything else. I made connections with people who are still friends 35 years later. I went to college knowing what I wanted to do and went through 12 majors. The college years are so critical in human development. Our brains do not even finish their physical development until we are 25, and the last parts to develop are the frontal lobes. \n\nYou might go do something and succeed, but you will not be as well equipped to deal with the ups and downs of life, and you will miss out on a lot of experiences that might send you in a completely different direction. These days, it may be less important to complete a degree, but if it were me, I would want to at least experience a bit of it before opting out.\n\nI will say that nothing you learn in college will matter. You are not going to stuff facts in your head that will be relevant in 10 years.  You may, however, learn how to learn more efficiently. And you will almost certainly that everything you knew going in was dead wrong. I would sell my soul if necessary for my boys to go to college.
2	Does something need to be observed to exist?	What counts as an observer?\n\nWhat counts as existing?\n\nAnd before this is brought up please know that the double slit experiment can run autonomously.
5	The truth doesn‘t change whether you observe it or not. If something exists, it exists independent of your observations as well. You observing it just lead to you being aware of its existence. Since before you didn‘t know of its existence, you didn‘t know what you didn‘t know, but you now know it exists, therefore it exists for you as well since you observed sth that has existed all along now you‘re just taking place in it as well.
4	In astronomy, that is referred to as the Anthropic Principle. Would a universe without intelligent life to perceive it exist? It has been a while since I last looked at that, but a lot of good thinking has been put into the question.
2	TLDR: what cannot be consciously interacted with (or observed) is of no value. It is as good as nothing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would say the question is ultimately non-relevant, because, even though the universe appears to evidently have a structure that is independent of whether we are aware of it or not, everything that is ever to be observed has to be perceived by a sentient agent, directly or indirectly, otherwise it is non relevant. Sure, there may be a hidden elf trying to make you lose your keys all the time, but if there is no evidence of its existence, and you can not make it a part of your awareness or of your conscious chain of causality, then its value is zero, unless that changes. The same applies to everything in relation to an observer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe concept of the unknown is a thing. The fear of the unknown is a thing as well. Imagined unicorns that fuck piñatas for fun in hell are a thing (they are now XP). But something you literally can not hold within your mind in any way or form (even feeling it counts) is subjectively an impossibility at any moment of your life, and the same goes for every possible sentient observer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGranted, if you said that something will interact with you in the future, or somehow reveal itself, and so it exists even if there can be no awareness of it now, then sure, go ahead, but the fact of the matter is that, until that happens, then it has as much relevance to you as whatever you have never imagined or seen or felt. Whatever influences something has upon you that are evident even though the thing itself is not (say you have a soul that gives you consciousness, but it is for all purposes undetectable and unreachable) will be what can exist in your mind, or be perceived, but the thing itself is just out of grasp for any practical purposes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf, following the last example, evidence surfaced of the existence of such "soul", then you could both observe its influence upon you and have a chance to consciously (being aware of the implications of your actions) influence it. And if it had an imprint upon the world and was part of the chain of causality, then its subjective utility (the only one that ultimately matters for everything with a point of view) would become a reality. If it happened that you suddenly lost your soul and then disappeared, but there was never any way to prevent this since you were never able to become aware of its existence or interact with it, then, for all intents and purposes, that would be the same as you disappearing out of reality just because of mere luck, without any reason. YOU (the conscious you) never had any agency on the matter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo one can intentionally break laws they no nothing about, and nobody can understand something that is perfectly hidden. A photon drifting forever alone in a void that does not interact with anything is as good as nonexistent for all other things. Does any of this make sense?
2	Observe deez nutts nigga lmao
1	It's a matter of definition. Descartes said, "I think, therefore I exist". That was his definition of existence, which did not involve observation.\n\nBy changing the definitions, statements would change. A lot of athiests could become agnostic.
1	We cannot by definition know what or how much we know  we might be one last fact from knowing it all.
1	What reason is there to believe in MBTI	I feel like the categories are pretty arbitrary and I haven’t seen any evidence to suggest why people should actually fall into them. Basically like astrology. There are other similar schemes that seem just as valid. Is there research to show that different qualities really cluster together into those groups, or that overall personality types can be split into 4 different ‘spectrums’?
6	Let's compare: astrology is based on a date and stars and planets, none of which are actually causally related to a person's genetics, environment, culture and resulting personality. The idea that all people born in that month have the same kind of personality is laughable from the foundations up.  \n\n\nResult: 'I was born in July 1995' tells you absolutely nothing about the person, other than their age. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMBTI is based on a person's notion of their own preferences, which IS directly related to what kind of a person they are, other than their age. Sure, results may have a margin of error due to people over/underestimating themselves compared to others or giving answers that follow how they would WANT to be rather than they are, but that doesn't change that the answers someone gives to a batch of these questions will give you a pretty good crude idea of how this person is likely to think and feel and act in a broad range of contexts. The notion that personality exists is not laughable at all, and crude personality trait dimensions (which means: this thingie will end up acting in a certain way that is quite consistent across contexts even if it's not always the most optimal option) have been found to exist even in fish and bugs. Humans also very much do have behavioural strategies and processing methods they can't just change at will and that influences how they experience the world and how they react to things.  \n\n\nResult: 'I actually do like big crowds and I care more about solutions that take results and facts into account rather than just people's first gut reactions' does actually tell you something relevant about what kind of a person you're dealing with. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMBTI's four dimensions also strongly correlate to four of the Big Five, which have significant scientific validation behind them, with a growing body of hypotheses of what kinds of brain differences lie at the basis of, for example, extraversion and introversion (spoiler alert: it's dopamine and serotonin reward system and how active these are in a person). The only one MBTI left out is Neuroticism, because 'your brain likes to be a well of negative emotions' just isn't sexy enough to be marketable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPersonality exists, and science has allowed us to start analysing what kind of personality dimensions lie at the basis of the significant and socially relevant differences between people that we observe. MBTI is one such an inventory, with a lot of inaccurate mumbo jumbo and overly exploitable tenets (which I believe should absolutely be dismissed) piled on top of an actual plausible basic framework. It's like The Big Five lite with ads.
2	You sound like the kind of individual who would deem psychology a pseudoscience.
3	Are you an INTP? If you are, do you see yourself here.  Do you have people, and they are here? If you are not, have you ever seen more twisted and sick people? \n\nI tested INTP with MBTI, and gave it little credence. Then I found this place and went, holy shit, I am not alone. I do have people, and they are right here. I was 45 at the time, and I had long since given up on finding a single person like me, let alone people. \n\nBeyond that I could not care less. A huge void in my life has been filled, and I am not foolish enough to question or doubt it. I found my people, so take your silly question elsewhere and look for someone who cares.

1	I agree with you, I don't dismiss MBTI completely because there is some truth to it but it should only be treated as a reference tool and nothing else. Judging someone only because of what four letters someone got would be unfair to people on an individual basis. \n\nSome of it I see here I agree, some of it is unrelatable. 
1	it's a decent enough set of categories. it makes sense to me, to an extent.\n\ni don't believe in mbti, it's just that it gives me reasonable enough answers.
1	If you try to view it as an exact science, you're gonna have a bad time. It is one of many useful ways to understand the inner workings of the human mind. If you do not find it helpful, try a different metbod of categorization.
1	The only reason to is if you identify with it. If you do then it can help you. If not, then it's irrelevant and just a theory anyway. 
11	Whenever I say certain words/phrases, song lyrics with those words/phrases immediately pop up in my mind...	... and I sing them out in the middle of conversations (and although softly and to myself, still audibly), often being perceived by others as completely random.\n\nI don’t do it on purpose. Just something about me causes me to recall song lyrics subconsciously when I hear those words (even when I haven’t heard or thought about those songs in a long while, maybe even up to years). \n\nI don’t listen to music much, maybe once a week. I’ve probably listened to up to 500 unique songs in my life in total.\n\nI really wonder why I do this and I‘m curious if other INTPs (the ones who listen to music even the slightest bit) do this too.
3	You only listen to music once a week? I think thats the weirdest part about this. I probably listen to 500 new songs every few months. As far as the singing, yeah I do that too, my family also sings words and phrases, so doubt its an INTP exclusive thing.
2	I can relate. Even when there is a word that is similar to the word in the song, I will still use that word to the song. Although the lyric now doesn’t make any sense, at least I am having fun. Thank our Ne for that!
1	that's how memory works - by association.\n\n> I don’t listen to music much, maybe once a week. I’ve probably listened to up to 500 unique songs in my life in total.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/AbUWe1d.png
1	I usually listen to 80 songs every day and I usually have this type of thing once or twice a day at least.
0	DAE think the second industrial revolution was the main contribution to the destruction of the natural world? Also, DAE think it’s child, socialism has ultimately been a source of good, or bad?	
-1	Thanks for the downvotes guys. Really good argument. 
1	The disgusting social trend of masking frailty & magnifying virtue.	
3	Let's see. That "trend" started before humans were humans, played a vital role in our evolution into what we are now, and is hardwired into every human who as ever existed. I think I'll keep it.
1	This guy is amazing at fixing Apple products. I love how he lets everyone know how Apple purposely designs their products to fail and be extra expensive to repair. Not really a fan of this particular message he's sending out. Just delete facebook and twitter. No explanation needed. 
0	Relationship Advice - Give up on INTP?	To preface, I'm not even dating him. I've been waiting to date him for years, but he's always been in relationships with other girls. He's in a relationship right now and asks me to wait for him to be single. \n\nI do not think I mind waiting for him but I don't think I should be around him when he has an active girlfriend. The thing is he's often playing hot and cold with me because he's scared of losing me? But why be scared of losing me when you are dating someone else. That's question number 1. \n\nHe always says he likes me, but that can't be true since he is still choosing to be with his girlfriend instead. But to clarify, I have told him that I wouldn't want him to break up with his girlfriend just to pursue a relationship with me. That'd make me uncomfortable as well. But at the same time I'm questioning what he even wants? He often states that neither dating me nor dating the girlfriend he currently has makes him happy. Which I don't interpret as either bad or good. I think he's just looking for more internalized joy/happiness rather than from an external source. Though, that ends up making me feel like he would/should not date me in the future anyways. So then should I even wait for him if he sort of isn't even into me?  \n\nHe just seems so nonchalant about it all which doesn't seem to match up with how not nonchalant it is to ask me to wait for him for years. \n\nHonestly, I just do not understand his thought process in all of this and would like someone to help me understand wth this boy be thinking. \n\nYou can ask me for more specifics in the comments, I guess. But making conjectures can be fun too!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for the help! I've been agonizing over this for a long time. 
12	I'm sorry, but whatever type you are, "I like you but hold on till I am done with this girlfriend" is worse than nothing. Are you number two or three on his list?\n\nNothing about being INTP would explain or justify that behavior. I can tell from your post that you deserve do much more.\n\nPutting your life on hold until his current girlfriend dumps him would be squandering life. Life seems endless at your age, but at 54, every moment seems previous including the ones I wasted.\n\nIf you really want a relationship with him, I would tell him that, and also tell him that you are not going to wait. If he does not care for you enough to leave his girlfriend, then it is very hard to see how he cares enough to get through the hard times that every relationship has.\n\nI say this as the perpetual romantic optimist. But you deserve better. You really do.
6	> He's in a relationship right now and asks me to wait for him to be single.\n\nNope. 
2	Are you me?\n\nI’ve been going through the same as you in a “waiting around/being strung along” situation. However, not to a bad point of being asked to wait for him to be single. Just him saying that to you alone is a complete no – you deserve better. All in all, I’ve come to a realization (and need to constantly be reminded) to be with someone who will treat you as his/her #1, not as “the other person.” That’s not love.\n\nI would type out a whole ridiculous long post but I think these previous ones, especially /u/vasubandu’s always great insights, have a big point.\n\nIt’s really tough. Really, really tough especially when it’s someone you’re deeply close with. Even learning new things to keep him engaged. I get it all. I’m currently feeling it too. DM me if ever you need to talk. I stalk this sub and never post but I thought I’d crawl out my hole to lend my similar personal experience.
3	Are u 11?
1	If INTPs are all like me, they are fiercely protective of their personal time.  We’ll often have hobbies or thoughts that are impossible for most people to relate to without years of study and obsessive interest, so we simply can’t engage in them while spending time with other people.\n\nIt sounds like he’s already wanting to get away from his current time commitment, so the prospect of initiating another one right after is probably extra unappealing.\n\nNow, at least in my experience, I don’t count social time spent discussing/developing these topics as lost hobby time.  If you’re able to figure out what he’d rather spend his time doing, and then show him that you’re able to earnestly engage with him at a high level, he might see the prospect of socializing as less of a chore.\n\nAnd if I’m wrong... at least it will have been highly entertaining ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 
1	Intp or not, he sounds like an asshole. \n\nHey if you could just put your life on hold for me while I go do whatever (or in your case whoever) I want, that would be great!\n\nFuck that noise. \n\n
1	You're his back-up option when shit hits the fan. Do whatever you want out of that. 
7	Ti/Si loop Ti/Ne switch	A lot of Intp's mention this loop keeping them in the same thought patterns but I find it's an automatic process for me. Sometimes I drift into a familiar memory for long periods and even reanalyzing thoughts that I already feel are complete. I also have a tendency to rapidly increase my energy level when expressing myself. I can be a monk turned circus clown in an instant, often times it feels like I'm switch personalities but they share the same memories, kinda like Yu-Gi-Oh lol.  I just wanted to throw this out there.
3	When Im in a really comfortable situation with friends or if I need to be extroverted I also go kinda neurotic and use my Ne
1	Heart of the cards!! I’d just like to point out that Yugi and the spirit of the Millennium Puzzle deeply care about each other and continually learn and grow from each other. :)
1	It’s not a bad thing but the thing is that some intp’s in time’s of distress or unhappiness get stuck in a ti-si loop in particular and it polarizes their life/ consumes it. I’ve personally been stuck in a loop for a year + and let me tell you its not a fun thing to experience. I find that loop in particular to be having your head up your ass. The important thing is being able to pull yourself out of it.
1	What types of people do you hate?	
7	People that treat other people poorly. I hate them only in theory though, in practice I can understand everyone's POV and why they do what they do
4	People who deny facts. But refuse to look them up. Like I'm showing you a article. With tons of sources "nah, I dont believe it. Tbh you shouldnt believe everything you read." \n\nOmg that really gets me violent. How am I supposed to talk to you if you dont except facts as the foundation. I cant talk to those people. 
5	My mental resources are too precious to me to waste them on hating people. If I don't like a person, I don't spend time with them. Out of sight, out of mind. Like they don't exist.
3	[deleted]
3	I can tolerate dumb nice people because they're nice. I can tolerate smart mean people because they're smart. But put me in a room with a dumb mean person and shit's gonna get violent. 
3	People who laugh at everything and have the most annoying laughs, who also try to talk to you all the time and are super fake intense about everything. Ugh.
2	Fact deniers\n\nConspiracy advocates\n\nThose who relay false information and become defensive when corrected with contradictory evidence\n\nIndividuals who are driven solely by emotional or non-factual non-objective information\n\nReligious individuals\n\nToo many to list really.
2	Unreasonable, poorly mannered individuals.
2	I hate people who consistently talking over someone. It's plain rude especially when they add nothing relevant to what is being discuss. \n\nIn my opinion, people like this love their voice too much. They are always eager to share their opinion no matter how pointless and irrelevant it is.. It's written all over their fave that they are not really listening to you because they are busy thinking "It's has been 30 seconds since I say anything, think fast what other shits and irrelevant stuffs should I add to this conversation". \n\nStop doing that if youre that kind of person. It's not a conversation if you are only interested in talking and not listening
2	The arrogant who enjoy picking arguments but refuse to reframe their point of view or admit to being wrong after being showed up, if only for the sake of their pride. My siblings are much like this and it's often the only thing that INCREDIBLY riles me up about them.
2	I thought about that and am coming up empty. Something must be wrong with me.
13	How do you deal with it as an INTP??	Being called an exceptional student and extremely intelligent but you cant get above average grades, (oh sorry i meant) but you cant get average grades
8	I will talk about myself and my two other INTP friends. \n\nI'm decent with marks because the subjects that I'm studying are something that I really like although they're probably nowhere near what I think would be my favorite so I may have thoughts of not being able to cope with this. Exams are stressful but since I like the subject and  study it in my own way I do okay in exams  INTPs think a lot and in my experience only two things can help you deal with it. 1) intense mindfulness that is to say when mind becomes calm like water. I use this approach. 2) you've found your thing. That's rare with an INTP. I suggest every INTP to start with Zen like awareness practise. \n\nI'm the healthiest of all my friends. My other INTP friend is a real genius and loves everything that he studies. But exams give him anxiety so he misses most of them and gets below average GPA. \n\nThe last INTP friend stopped studying what interested him and didn't like his major. He went into suicidal depression. \n\nSo to sum it up, look up Zen like awareness and practise it intensely. Don't believe me ? Read the description of a Type 5 enneagram personality traits at healthy level 1. \nAlso study in your natural way. Don't cram it up. Take time. Get good books on the subject. And take time. Don't rush to complete the syllabus. An INTPs learning method is different from the rest of the society. 
2	Not sure if you mean high school or college, because those are two different ball games. I did great in high school without even trying. I didn't take notes or study, just listened in class and did everything that needed to be turned in.\n\nFucked me over later though, because no matter how smart you are, you do have to try in college. So I flunked out because I thought the grades would come as easily as before.
2	I wish I could help. I hated school. I only got good grades in the classes that interested me. I passed a full ride to UofD to pay for tech school in industrial robotics. I just knew me. If I’m not interested I can’t fake it. 
1	I cheat in exam lol. That's why I don't have to force myself to study a subject that I don't like. (And I hate all the subjects we learn at school. Because we all know that school won't teach us what we actually need, what we actually like - or maybe it's just my school) Still get high grades enough to pass.   \nIn class? I nearly don't pay attention at all, I just sleep and mehh, I don't care about what will happen to me. And if there's a very important test coming, I'm just gonna stay up late to study and thing will go well again. \n\nBut if I don't cheat, I will definitely get lower than average grades.
1	This is one of the weirdest placements of brackets I've ever seen, no wonder your grades are poop. 
1	I've dealt with the kind of thing for a long time. I stopped going to school when I was 15, but up until then, school was very easy and I usually had straight A's. \n\nA lot of people that I've met tell me that I'm very smart and weird, but I never really paid attention to it. I always felt like people would discredit all of the work and time that I put into things simply because they thought I was smart and that I could naturally do things that others couldn't. \n\nI don't see people as being smarter or dumber, I see people that try and people that don't. \n
1	Yeah a lot of my professors actually call me "remarkably bright" (I really im not making that up), and then halfway through they are like... uhhh you want to do the work or?\n\nThen I don't do the work so I don't learn. I get so overwhelmed by grades and deadlines I would rather just go at my own pace.\n\nMy uncle is self taught computer technician and hes an INTP
1	Intelligence is not just quantified on a piece of paper. That’s standardization. You can be intelligent and bright and compassionate and caring and score poorly on tests. Do a test in chinese. You failed. So you are retarded now?
1	Sorry, but I loved the competition with the other students. So grades were never a problem.
1	It's because we know the material would come to us easily that we don't genuinely try. I mean I *know* I could do well in Chem Lab if I read that shitty little manual, but the thing is... I do HAVE to read it. I just show up to lab and let the chip on my shoulder lead my thinking and end up fucking me up.
1	If you genuinely want to understand, then you’ll out in the work and the grades will follow, the educational system is just another system to understand. Testing is a specific skill. If you understand how to study, how to test well, and the material, then you’ll have decent grades. If, for some reason, you don’t give a damn, then of course you won’t score well and you can’t blame anything but your own complacency.
1	i either get good ones, or terrible ones.
1	Do you have ADHD?
18	I managed to do some small talk with someone for over 30 minutes and I'm proud of myself	I identify somewhere in between the ENTP-INTP spectrum so I thought that posting my little success here would be appropriate. Besides, ENTPs are kinda good at small talk and I really can't relate to that. \n\nBut for a while now I've wanted to be better at socialising and actually networking with people. Normally, I would've had zero patience for small talk and just end those conversations abruptly which sometimes gives off an impression that I'm rude. Forgive me, I couldn't care less about how sour the oranges you had today were. But today! I managed to give an impression that I did care and I asked stupid questions and had a conversation about the things that don't really matter! I asked my ENFJ friend a while ago to help me with my small talk skills and he did, and I'm proud to say that for once in my life I didn't just make a conversation awkward by ending it abruptly. \n\nHahaha idk why I wanted to share that, I'm just proud of myself 
7	Mannn...you have use your weekly human-interaction quota for that 30 minutes small talk. Report back here 1 week after. LOL...
3	Way to go! :) been interested in socializing/networking too a lot this past two years or so. At first, it felt like I would never progress but I eventually did and got a lot better at small talk too.\n\nSometimes, in the middle of a conversation, I suddenly become self conscious about the fact that I am doing small talk. This makes me anxious because I don't want to fail and seem awkward. But it is getting better though!
1	Yeah I usually have friend when I go out cuz im6'8, which is like having huge tits or a fat ass, someone is gonna look and approach. So I answer a few questions and then my friend will enter the conversation and I'm save *whew* 😪
1	Ralph Phillips - INTP Mascot?

81	More, checking in.
39	Software Engineer here. I get to work from home every day and feel like I can never go back to working in an office again.
22	Google’s got to be wrong, because if you click “more” , one of the options is Human Resources Manager. And it sounds like hell to me. \n\nI’m an engineer, btw.
19	Lawyer, and was a teacher for a while until it got boring and repetitive. 
32	Artist here~
13	Artist reporting! \n\n

11	Lawyer and very happy with it, but not because I am INTP.
10	Engineer here
8	Kinda. I work in medical simulation.   \nAny given day I have to act (as a patient, bystander, paramedic, etc)  \nI get to teach students somewhat, especially on communication skills.   \nI have to do research to properly simulate medical issues.   \nI get to be a makeup artist since we have to prep the patients or mannequin. I also get to make silicone wounds and appliances to simulate different types of injuries.   \nI have to fix glitches and problems CONSTANTLY. Our mannequins are very high-tech, but also prone to failure for a number of issues. Figuring out the problem and fixing it is one of my favourite parts of the job.   \nOH, also, when not doing simulations, I work mostly alone. And while I have a desk, I work from there 30% of the time. The rest is in our labs that simulate hospital wings, apartment, retail setting.   \n\n\nI think I found my **thing** and it is glorious. 
6	Paralegal, musician, artist, and part time mask of murder.
7	Me: "I like being alone and thinking."\n\nNobody: "Ooh, you should be an actor! Or a teacher!"\n\nThis is the real WTF. Obviously the mask of murder thing is the reason this was posted but that's just a parsing error or something.
25	Finance should be the #1 job for INTPs. I Excel at it. By a LOT. Very quiet and unpopular work that gives you a mental outlet. \n\nPay's amazing too. 
6	Researcher.
5	I study economics not related to your question but I think it’s compatible for INTP
6	Oddly im a mechanic, wanted to be a scientist, chose the easier option in life since my pops has a shop and he had already taught me everything. No, im not an ISTP.
4	Copyeditor; me, my computer, noise-cancelling headphones, a red pen, and a door.
5	Software engineer and Math grad student here
5	Composer and programmer for VR games
6	Librarian, who loves doing research and doesn't get to do enough of it at work! Would love to be able to work full time as an artist, though.
4	Studying to be a lawyer.
4	Artist here. \n\nSpecifically, commercial art and graphic design
3	Hmm. Im 16, currently in highschool and will follow Mechanical Engineer in university. Im great at Physics amd Chemistry and maths too. My dad is a ME too and he has to deal with a lot of people too, something that I highly dislike due to shyness, social anxiety... but it pays well and I love mechanical engineering. I will try to find a job where I have to deal as less people as possible, working alone would be great IMO
3	My degree was in ME but somehow I've found myself working in Manufacturing IT
3	I act as a hobby. I always thought it was one of my less INTP-esque traits. Who knew?  A for my career, I'm a paralegal, which is related to "lawyer" and "research" since I have to do a lot of it.
3	Musician
3	Musician
2	Well, data science is research right? And I'm a musician for a hobby. 
2	Engineering so yes. 
2	Teacher here
2	Working on a PhD in computer science and healthcare, working towards becoming a professor in the next few years, which is one of the classic INTP professions.
2	Educated as an engineer, hobbyist musician, analyst/researcher day job, mask of murder only on the weekends
2	engineer kinda not really but in the furute somewhen maybe\n\nbcs im 16... and draftsman in engineering and if im not procrastinating and im no getting kicked out of school in 8 years i might be\n\n(switzerland, work 3 days and go 2 days to school and study afterwards) 
2	My email signature says I'm an Engineer, Artist, and Musician, so I guess I'm those.
2	Optical aerospace engineer. I love my job.
2	I was an army medic and I’m a biology major in college now. Eventually I want to be a doctor of some type. I’d love to be an orthopedic surgeon. \n\nI also have a weird obsession with drawing floor plans for houses so if the medical thing doesn’t pan out I’d like to do something involving that. 
2	Geologist here. I get to work with rocks and try to piece together their stories. It's nice because there is always more to learn and rocks don't have feelings.
2	In college to be an artist, so I'll basically be unemployed forever lol
2	Mechanical Engineer here, but I tell my wife all the time I'd be an awesome criminal.  Should have known I was predisposed for the job.  
2	High school teacher.
2	Digital marketer by day, but really a musician at heart. Still need to finish my songs though... Im glad I saw all these artist type of occupations. Usually personality tests encourage INTPs to become scientists. That is so not me, even though I love science.
2	I act like I know what I'm doing in my role, does that count?
2	CG artist, hopefully director in a year or so ;) 
2	Been a musician, but was also  a surgeon who taught residents how to operate, so teacher as well.\n\nI also did research, and killed a bunch of animals for a drug company.
2	Architect.
2	Classical composer/musician (flutist and pianist) and nurse checking in! 
2	Musician here
2	 I think we all missed the boat. So far as I can tell, **allergist** is the dream job.
2	MORE HERE
2	Worked in logistics, transitioning to machine learning, AI, and consulting. Logistics I feel is an underrated career path for INTPs because of the high degree of logical thinking, process focus, and "common sense" required. I wanted to do sth "grander" however, so I made the switch.
3	Inspection, welds/piping etc. 
2	Hmm. I love people and even dogs. I guess I could conceive of loving a thing. But money? Money is not even a thing. It is a construct, an idea. The fiction that money is a thing is used to make people do things they do not want to. Money compels obedience if you believe in it \n\nIn fact, money owns us more than we own it. We have to save our money and invest it. We have to protect it. Money enslaves us to a system that makes worthless things no one wants or needs. \n\nYou can never have enough money, so it is a hunger that cannot be sated, a thirst that cannot be quenched. The more money we have, the more we need and want.\n\nCome to think of it, I don't care much for this money idea.

1	I am happy because I enjoy being an attorney. I just do not think it is particularly related to being INTP. I think that we sometimes give INTP too pervasive an influence on our lives. INTP describes my general approach to life and was very pertinent in my development, but it does not define me, nor am I bound by it's definition.

8	Shower Thought:	Swear words are just words with a bad historical context surrounding them. Does that then mean that anything could be a swear word if society associates in with something bad?
6	To me it sounds like you're describing "derogatory terms" more than "swear words", because I don't really see the bad historical context for s$%t and f$#k 
5	To me there are not any bad words, just words used badly.\n\nWords like fuck and shit actually have a real definition. Where they actually becomes swearing is when an object upsets you and you call it a peice of fucking shit. Intercourse and excrement have nothing to do with it.\n\nAlso when someone uses a different word in place such as fudge and sugar, the intent is basically the same so you are still in effect swearing. It is an exclamation of negative emotion.
5	Probably.\n\nI know in Quebec French anything to do with the Catholic Church is a swear because of history
5	YES. When I was a kid, I was thinking about this. So I picked a random word (“King”) to repeatedly say provocatively in front of my parents and snicker uncontrollably like I was saying the naughtiest word ever. \n\nThey had no reaction at first, thinking I was just being my usual, weird self. But then, it took them (ISFJ and ISFP, I think) literally less than a day to start getting really mad at me and telling me to stop saying “King”, even though they had no idea what I meant by it. Even when I started saying it later with a normal voice without the snickering, they would instantly get mad and tell me to stop. 
3	It's like people who replace "fuck" with "fudge" or use "shut the front door." What did fudge ever do to anyone?\n\nWe know what you want to say, stop being a pussy and say it.\n\nUnless you're around kids. Or not. Whatever.
1	I suppose so. In the past it was deemed okay to call people idiots and retarded (literally in the medical sense). But that definition was skewed so now it’s unacceptable to say the “r” word and socially acceptable to say “special” and then it moved to mentally disabled instead. All three words had the same context originally but one has been adopted more recently. I’m confident that in a few years calling people mentally disabled (legitimately or not) will be considered unacceptable again once people start using it under a different context and we’ll have to say something else. 
15	INTP artists?	Hey guys I noticed there’s quite a few artists here after the post showing common INTP jobs. I am also an artist and am super curious to see how our work compares. Considering most of the posts here comprise of people basically reading my brain and revealing shit I never even realized about myself, I’m interested to see if there’s any similarities. I work mostly with fine point India ink markers and do pretty detailed black and white drawings occasionally with colored pencils/ acrylic / digital.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/user/dustywhale\n\nPost your art! I’m mostly interested in visual art but I’d love to see whatever else you guys have made. 
5	Yeah, very surprised to see teacher and artist as a common job type on a post yesterday.\n\n[https://tomorrow.threadless.com](https://tomorrow.threadless.com/)
5	here! somethings i'm proud of !\n\nvery focus on the human body and flesh\n\n[https://vimeo.com/216989214](https://vimeo.com/216989214)\n\n[https://vimeo.com/276920658](https://vimeo.com/276920658)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
3	INTPs are actually really creative: it's just rarely is used to be artistic.\n\nIt's funny, I kinda see a correlation between math ability and musical ability.  Most musicians I see are good at math, most who arent musical are bad at math.  I suck at math, and have no musical ability whatsoever, no matter how I try.  Could be completely unrelated things, but it seems like they use the same pathways of the brain.
3	I paint and have worked as an illustrator here and there. I'm a very visual thinker and art making really tickles my brain.\n\n[My creative stuff.](https://www.flickr.com/photos/56205226@N06/)

1	I'm impressed you guys can make a living from it!  I make cards and paper gifts outside of my day day job, and honestly it's a struggle just to get anything finished. The amount of time and effort that goes into making something perfect, nobody is gonna pay for that! 
1	My main outlet is music, guitar mostly. I don't enjoy playing with other people so I just kind of do a bit of everything. I've been playing a lot of R&B jazzy stuff lately because I like how I can express myself through it.\n\nI also enjoy drawing, though I'm not awesome and I never make myself get better. My favorite style is to have something very close to the front, taking up most of the paper and then filling what's left in the background with meticulous ass details. 
1	Amateur at everything but I like figuring stuff out.\n\n[some art](https://www.instagram.com/p/BubU4FsBHUb/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=1do3wix9s6oo5) \n\n[Attempts at music](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2FSc1hgx0cDkF-uy5q3JxQ) \n
16	Interpersonal drama and gossip is absolutely repulsive to me	I don’t understand why so many people love it so much. When I’m with a friend and they start talking about someone we know behind their back, it just makes me wonder what they’re saying about me when I’m not around. And people wonder why I have so few other female friends. 
5	I was thinking about this earlier, actually. I realized I’m pretty desensitized to it by now but every now and then I’m reminded of how fucking stupid it is. a lot of the time I can only ever have a lasting conversation with my mum if it involves talking about someone else, same with a few others that are close to me\n\nfor their sake I can stand it to an extent, but when it’s incessant and non-stop it just drives me insane. my connections with those people feel less and less genuine, almost like the only way to connect with them is by plugging someone else into our interactions just so we have something to talk about for more than 5 mins
4	I find it intresting from a sociology PoV. It's really fascinating to see the spin things takes in function of who spreads what to whom. What they think they can get away with, like you don't know the other person. When challenged they're like "oh but you don't know them like I dooooo!" It's mostly fun because you can laugh at them straight to their face if you're so inclined(I know I am). Otherwise, it's pretty inane, I agree. \n\n To quote Eleanor Rosevelt : small minds discuss people. average minds discuss events. great minds discuss ideas. 
2	I feel you. Thankfully I'm a man; not that I am mysoginostic, but the INTP kit is already a burden most of the time as is, and I think it would be even harder as a woman. For instance more small talk organically in relations female-female, society isn't scared by men's intelligence, it's easier to stay alone as a man etc etc.. Thanks to that 'additional' chromosome I have the chance of having a very tight group of (male) friends in which no one would ever gossip about anything; we have our very special way of being as a group.  And even like that, simply with few other friends, family and 'everyday people' (work, school, groceries, neighbors..) there is not a day where I'm not fulminating in my head because of a 10mn pointless conversation full of useless information, or worse, an eternal phone call. Oh do I hate those... Phone calls are the worst, it's home of small talk, avoid it at all costs! All in all I have no idea where I was headed and my message end up useless, but I sympathize with all my heart. I wish I could give any piece of advice but I'm the weakest when it comes to face small talk... If you are on the same wavelength with the person/he is knowledgeable in a domain that proves interesting/he is of some appeal to you for any reason, you can always re-route the discussion and end up having a good time, but how rare are these moments. 
2	I recently just asked to move departments at work because of this. I was in a room with 10 other females and they were always up in each other's business, gossiping, making drama, saying rude things that were intended to be nice but are actually very inconsiderate. They range in age from 19-50 but all about 15. A few are very nice, but the majority are as described above. I myself am a 29 year old female that for the most part keep to herself, doesn't mind helping others out and being a team player but prefers to just come to work, do her job and enjoy a good podcast or audiobook. It's not really my kind of environment... Luckily I have moved out to an area with a mix of male and female, everyone keeps to themselves and I have my own little booth. I've been there 7 years and have never felt more peaceful, calm, focused and happy with what I'm doing. 
1	I dislike the spread of inaccurate information. However if what they are saying is true then what is the difference between oral tradition and gossip? Granted, most of the time this information is inaccurate at the fault of the limitation of the human brains ability to remember accurately. There was a time this is all we had though.

7	I have it, but never use it
5	Facebook is a cesspool. \n\nWe already know facebook is spying on us. 
3	8 years clean. I can’t wait to see how this insta what’s merger pans out.  How can people not see they are giving up their privacy in all aspects of their lives ?  , being force fed ads to consume shit based on what we let them steal and sell. We are called users , what does that even mean ?? Sorry for my paranoid rant. 
1	Had it when I was deployed... got rid of it right after.
1	Grandparents had it before me. Haven't used it in many years. I don't know the password to it and don't care to find it to delete it.\n\nI'll *clears throat* eventually get around to it.
1	I have 2 accounts, a total of 3 posts and 0 passwords, so no.
1	I have a profile, but not logged on for over a year. It was becoming detrimental to my mental health  so I took a short break, and then realised I didn't miss it in the slightest.
1	I’m not on anymore, all I have is twitter and sometimes I’m on Reddit.
1	I have an account, but I don't use it the way Facebook intends. I'm registered under a pseudonym, and nearly all of my friends are people I only know from the internet. I deleted the account under my real name years ago.
1	I have one with a shortened version of my name so no one can find it, to add close friends who want to use the messenger.\n\nI then have a burner account named Angela Lansbury that I use to lurk and add enemies.\n\nSo kinda? 
1	I haven’t had it in about 7 years and I’ve noticed a change in human behaviour. I’m so glad I’m not on it. It’s like walking around and seeing a brain slug on peoples heads. People are more divided, combative and hostile than ever, worldwide. I’m pretty sure it’s down to social media.

4	I was into them for a while and really went all in on researching it. I have gotten professional star charts done and have really looked into both astrologys' predictive ability and its use as a tool for self development and advice. \n\nAfter significant interest I slowly came to the conclusion that it is no better than random chance at prediction of future trends and as a self help tool it is only as good as the intentions of the person using it. Meaning that it is useful for helping a person look more closely at what makes up their personally, but I do not think it accurately describes a person any better than any other cold reading tool.

6	Are you, as an INTP, unafraid of losing friends?	In advance, I'm sorry this is an incredibly long post, but I've accumulated so many thoughts on this topic I need to speak my mind.\n\nThis is a question I've had for a very long time now. It largely concerns the way I think and have acted towards others, but I've wondered if this is a personal problem as sparked by earlier experiences when I better fit the criteria of an INFP, or in my current personality as an INTP (in the case this sounds strange to people, I have always been very balanced in my Feeling and Thinking traits). I was never quite sure where best to ask this but here I feel I might be able to get some reasonable answers.\n\nThe gist of it is, for a while now I've noticed that my attachment towards other people, friends especially, is extremely transient.  My status as a friend to others, I regard with extreme rationality. For some reason, the way I've always seen things is that, "I can indeed be a friend, and a bloody good one at that, but I myself don't \*need\* a friend".  My friends, both IRL and online, have all made it very clear they appreciate me. I know how to adequately meet their emotional and rational needs and have no problems making moderate sacrifices for most people if it means pleasing them. They show gratitude and I may be complimented for it, but this doesn't make me feel any attached to them.\n\nAnd then, when something goes awry in a friendship, even if it is a VERY trivial thing, they might be an emotional mess in the wake of my bitterness and yet oftentimes I can completely cut ties without much distress. I despise this, but as a result I feel I could throw away all the people who interact with me in an instant and I'd ultimately be just fine on my own. I felt annoyed and incredibly apprehensive when I was asked by someone who I consider a close friend to make a promise to stay in contact with them in future, and in fact lied to please them despite not feeling that... commitment they desire.\n\nI'm just not sure being an INTP explains why I feel as though I appear to not need people the way they need me. I don't take pride in it except on the theoretical level of "independence is a sign of strength". Oftentimes I feel bitter that I don't feel the desire to be closer to people who want to be closer to me, or that I fail to trust others beyond a certain point, or that if they told me they were leaving me, I would come to accept it with very measured concern. People come and go and are replaced, and I've long been fully at peace with that, understanding the same for myself as well. I desire closeness with people but at the same time will actively entertain the idea of making permanent distance for the fact that I know I can and that it would likely be better (?) for me long-term, or that I seek relief in the prospect of them doing something that should irritate me, or for them to somehow become irritated with me, that would then validate me in choosing to ditch them sooner or later.\n\nHonestly, I may waver between feelings of fondness towards someone and desiring to disappear entirely from their lives in an instant, all in the matter of a day. But why might this be? Is it a case of emotional detachment? Is it possible I simply don't feel as though I am loved enough so I am overcompensating in the relationship, but in feeling as though the attention I receive is inadequate or not to my standards, I am more willing to cut ties for the fact that I am not benefiting the way I would like? Then what \*should\* I expect of relationships that would be considered reasonable enough to desire to keep people? Why feel this kind of emptiness towards with my personal relationships despite spending time and effort maintaining them, and bother to establish new relationships despite having the same approach? It often surprises people when I turn on them completely, from that "friend who is always there" to severing ties completely, and I feel momentarily bad about it, but I know it is easier to cut things off and to archive the few good times we had, so I do. Why is this? \n\nThis really sounds sociopathic almost, but its not an active attempt to play with people's feelings because it entertains me. It's just as though I quickly become disenchanted with people, and question the necessity of maintaining bonds when in solitude I need not worry about those people at all. I understand an INTP often complains about loneliness whilst simultaneously keeping their guard up much too high, but in pursuit of a solution, how then can I create a desire to keep people near without rationalizing as to why I don't need them, or why I shouldn't have them in my life? It sounds depressing to think ultimately I won't need companionship at all, when the very idea is so revolting, and yet my approach to people complies with just that. How can I learn to enjoy proper commitment, to want and to need people holistically, so that I might form healthier relationships?
8	Yes, but I guess that depends on what you call a friend. Here's my take:\n\nQuality over quantity. Cut friends off that you find you're having to please, and keep the ones you genuinely want, with whom you can be real with. If you find them to be shallow friendships then your actions are completely normal. If the relationships are one sided (you meeting their needs) then of course you won't care. Next reason could be that having such an abundance of friends or leadership position result in you not caring about any single relationship anymore. Another reason is that you have or had a single friend with whom you share a very deep connection. Since social needs are low for us, it would explain our lack of concern for extra relationships. \n\nThe truth is that you are a self contained individual who never let's people inside your head. Without vulnerabity on your part, you won't give a shit about losing anyone because they never met the real you in the first place. They are a burden to whom you are providing self-less but ultimately, pretentious benefits you dont truly care to provide. Altruism is a bitch. \n\nAs you can see, your problem may really be one of personality development. On the other hand, you really don't need anyone and vulnerability is useless to you. This is one of those you don't know what you don't know type of things, and your solution is to harshly stop any and all people pleasing and work on projecting your subjective self. Being INTPs, this is naturally difficult for us in the first place, because we are like conduits of pure objectivity. In that case you may learn to be completely honest in sharing ideals you believe are objective, if people don't like it then they are free to go. \n\nUltimately, we are not dependent or emotional in that way, because we tend not to need it in the first place. Increasing your vulnerability and opening yourself to criticism may be the only way to change that. You will care more about that person and their role in your life. However, should they consistently violate your standards, that can change quickly as well since social neediness is basically nonexistent to our type. \n\nVulnerability = deeper connection = fondness. I would say online friends are better in this regard.\n \n\n\n

3	I suppose I was pretty frivolous with my friendships when I was younger. Drifting in between friend groups and not staying with one for too long. But when I got to college I began to deeply appreciate more of my relationships while I also cut out toxic ones. I don’t think I’m resistant or indifferent with friendships because I truly value them, but I value myself above them and if I am slighted I feel justified in cutting them off, no questions asked. (Obviously for this it means I truly believe they aren’t adding value to my life, I don’t cut them off for simple petty reasons)
3	I didn't realise I cared as much as I do about my friends until an outsider tried to degrade them, and I had so much anger about it. Like if anyone says and touches them, I would be ready to fight and put aside my rationality. But I agree with more people thinking me as their "friend", than I do them, but it might just be semantics because "friend" means something much deeper to me than them. I would never throw around words like "love" or swear words as frequently as they would.
3	Well shit, this has kinda vaguely been on my mind recently.. I relate very strongly.
3	It's good, and a bit sad, to know I'm not the only one who feels like this. I've been cutting people out of my life since middle school and is continued to my adult life. If I've felt underappreciated, abused, or continually misaligned with someone it's been easier to end the relationship than rectify the situation because being alone hasn't always been bad. The only exception has been with my husband because he refuses to let me do this to him.
3	I am probably very disconnected from my feelings. As of now I don't feel close to any friend at all. A.J Drenth in his book about INTPs discusses the Lone Wolf vs Nice Guy tendency in INTPs. Whenever our Fe needs are met by people we start focussing on the affairs of Ti which makes us think that we don't really need people in our lives. But cut them off for a while and you might want to get back to some. \nNow most people don't have much to offer and we really want smart people so if the other person is too dependent on us they might be typically proving otherwise. 
2	I don't have any friends, and don't think I ever really have. Lots of acquaintances though. 
2	I feel the same. I haven't had a friendship that I really cared about in a while. I'm a very loyal person and most people don't return that loyalty back and end up betraying me. That's why I don't get attached to people and I'm ready for whenever they decide to leave my life. Either way, I change myself every time I'm around different people and I don't have anyone who can really understand me; and that stops me from connecting/getting attached to them.
1	(Sorry but i try to improve my english)\nFe function makes us worried about people's feeling. I lost so many friends last year. I did regret it very much. The problem is because abt workgroup. I even asked myself "why they do this to me, and it's not fair." And end up blamed myself over and over and over again. I re-evaluate myself. This is for you INTP:\n- talk with them. Just talk, understand them\n- i know we are so worried about Fe. But please, understand yours. INTP last function Fi, makes us not aware of our own feeling. If we feel its done. Then, its done. We are so avoidant when it's about conflict. Then cut them off, but in friendly way\n-me, as INTP. Have found that source of my loneliness is not how many friends that i had. But how i am not connected with my reality. So, you dont have to be worry abt have few or no friend/s. But how you observe and aware enough to your surrounding.
1	You mention that you fail to trust others past a certain point, and a lot of the more rewarding benefits of relationships aren't realized below a certain threshold of trust, so...maybe look at that?\n\nWhen did this start (how long ago/at what age)? Did anything happen before/around that time that might have caused it? How was your childhood? \n\nKind of off-topic, but you don't *sound* very balanced between thinking and feeling.

12	On today’s episode of “INTPs, reason out!”: What are similarities between an old man and a fire truck?	The replies to the last one were funny (and cool) let’s see this one INTPs :P
24	Probabilistically speaking, both parties are closer to ashes than the rest of the population. 
15	The hose is bigger than you may think
8	Both tend to drive rather slowly under normal circumstances, but when it is "go" time, they will both drive recklessly making lots of noise quickly down the road and you better get out of the way or there is going to be trouble. 
7	Both need regular maintenance on their pipes.
8	Both are, with enough effort, edible.\n
4	they’re both associated with sirens, in both cases the sirens mean something bad
4	There will be some dribbling. You should also expect some leaks. And in the worst case, serious ruptures now and again. Sometimes erections are going to be tricky. 
3	Both can put out a fire from a distance 
3	Both are capable of being very loud and obnoxious. The latter likely due to being hard of hearing, or they just think they're hilarious. 
3	Every time either one shows up, the part isn't **lit** anymore 
3	Both won't last forever. 
2	both physically exist\n\n...wtf, that’s all i can think of
2	They both require lots of maintence. 
1	Red, elongated parts and need multiple people to maintain function :)
1	Both are closer to the death
1	one is a fire van and another is an old fuck.
1	Both are liable to expel copious amounts of water in a short time while making a mess out of everything.
0	The meanderings of an INTP	As an INTP, I experience all four sides but I'm more attuned to my logical abstract side, allowing me to effectively take apart ideas,and concepts and create my own. I feel like I'm Ti or Fe at all times. Like a wild fascination for things that feel good to me but since I'm Ti Dominant I fear the bad feelings and avoid them where possible unless it bothers me in my everyday thinking. We like to walk around in comfortable shoes so we are constantly checking for pebbles, sometimes we take it as a challenge to endure the pain. During the pain process we are exposed, so those close to us will receive our Fe experience if we trust them. After we determine some mild spiritual/logical reason for the experience, and then we move on the the next adventure. Well at least in my case, personalities are very fluid yet rigid, we are limited in our infinity due to having to take one step at a time, and we all compete at different levels mentally and socially. \n\n\n   I like to read people and imitate them and while I can simulate sincerity, I don't often feel sincere. I make the proper faces and become empathetic to their needs but I also look for an out if one is presented. I hate for those I don't like to know I have a problem with them, because revenge is pizza left from a party, I can have another slice longer after the fact. I see myself as very outgoing then find myself wanting to leave, even those I consider very valuable to me, I keep a far reach  as if it's an escape from them, when it could be me not facing the reality of myself. The second I found myself achieving success with lots of women I felt as if I was a whore, and isolated myself. Now it's a back and forth struggle between wanting to work the system (which would mean me becoming the system effectively) or going against the system and watching the arrows in the sky black the sun as they are coming for me. \n\n  
3	It seems to me that you are stuck in your head and overstating the significance of MBTI. No one "is" Ti of Fe. Those are gross descriptions of tendencies in people over a spectrum. You are who you are.  Ti and Fe do not explain your feelings or perspective. \n\nAvoiding bad feelings is fine, but suppressing or rejecting them is futile. If you are not sincere, that is a choice you are making.  You can choose to be sincere instead of acting sincere. The moment you accept other people as complete human beings just like you, sincerity will come naturally. You seem to equate success with women and sex, but it is so much more than that. As long as you treat women and people in general as objects, you will be alone and disconnected.\n\nThere is no system or formula to life. There is only life. We either choose to dive in and participate in life, or we watch it go by. I so remember when I could have written your post, but then everything changed, and it changed again, and is still changing now. We INTPs seem to think that we have arrived at our destination in our teens, that we will not change. Things will not change, but you will. \n\nNo one can tell you how to change or what you should be. But you can realize that you are not your mind, and that even if you cannot control who you are, you can at least choose the direction. If you are not happy with your life or who you are, take a sharp left.
2	I love to imitate and learn to speak/act like other people and it's very difficult to find a significant other that is ok with this
25	Ever doubted yourself to an extreme level?	Have you ever doubted your actions, as to why you did something? For instance, I did the mbti twice, and both times i got INTP, but I feel like I only picked those answers not because those certain answers describe me the best, but because I want those answers to describe me and I dont know which is it.\nThis may not be that extreme (for you) and really retarded, but I wanna hear others opinions. 
16	You realize this is an INTP trait, right?
4	I dislike doing tests that determine what you like, or your compatibility, and all the ones like it with subjective answers from around 1-10 does this describe because I can't tell if what I answer is what I'm actually like or what I wish I was. I know I'm biased and will not answer the objective truth. Yeah I doubt my actions, at least once have extremely, but I think everyone does at some point to some degree. Sometimes I think I'm totally right for some reason and others I was pretty sure I was way off the mark.
5	All. The. Time.
1	Been through a rough patch last few years and it got to a point where I had totally destroyed my confidence and ego... I would doubt every single thought I had. Constantly second guessing my intuitions and allowing, almost inviting, anyone to walk all over me.\n\nIt got really bad but thanks to trying really hard and realizing that I could not be as bad as I thought, I managed to rebuild myself and now I am back!\n\nOr course, I still second guess everything, but in a more positive, constructive way.\n\nDoubting everything is part of how we work and learn, but once it gets out of hand, it can be really destructive.
392	Anyone else think they’re retarded and the smartest person in the room at the same time?	So I often question my own intelligence and hop from feeling that I’m probably the smartest of all my friends and family to thinking I’m retarded and realizing just how dumb I can be/my limitations. Before I took the MBTI test and realized I was a designated personality type I felt pretty strange around most people and never really knew what group to be with. I became pretty aware that I was at least a little different from the people around me but didn’t know what it was. I literally thought I had ADD or light autism at points in my life (which I came to find out a lot of us thought). But even up to this day, realizing I’m not actually retarded 😂, I’m still balancing on this line of self doubt. The only thing I can figure out is that an indication for intelligence being a true aspect of myself IS the fact that I have such bad self doubt and criticism. Even though sometimes I think I’m suffering from the Dunning Kruger effect, I always realize that I AM questioning myself. Idk I guess I just wanted to see if anyone else felt like this? 
154	My brain: “Oh my god you’re such a fucking dumbass. You’re failing all your classes. All these other people are doing so much better than you.”\n\nMe: “yeah it’s because I’m not a tryhard. I’m smart. I just don’t apply myself.”\n\nMy brain: “you just keep telling yourself that, see where it gets you”\n
40	Find someone that is willing to push you. You're questioning yourself because you really care. You want your projects to be perfect and you expect them to be perfect the first time. Just keep practicing on something you really enjoy and do your best to ignore the mistakes you make. Every time you make a mistake remind yourself that mistakes are part of learning. Use that self doubt to better yourself. That feeling you get after you've accomplished or created something and made it near perfect is better than an orgasm. Intelligence is decided from an outside perspective. Nikola Tesla and Einstein didn't see themselves as geniuses. They saw themselves as passionate. Everyone else labeled them a genius after they died because of the accomplishments that they made. Until you have something to show for your intelligence it's best to assume everyone is on the same level of intelligence. Strive for greatness but  keep a humble outlook or you'll never actually accomplish anything.
37	I am both smart and dumb. Clever is perhaps a better word. INTPs are clever.\n\nI do get too hard on myself when I screw something up. At age 50, I don't think it's going to get better.\n\nI think that the grading and pass/fail of educational systems makes us fear failure and fear embarrassment. It's learned. You weren't like this as a small child. You learned it in school.\n\nSociety values performance and rewards it. Punishes failure. Even at my job, I just got my performance review. I didn't think it was accurate. Some others I know got crappy reviews also. People who deserved good reviews. The system is rigged. I now go home after my 8 hrs unless there is a very good reason not too. After all I'm just "meets expectations" so says my review. (Did I mention I'm spiteful?)\n\nSociety values conformance too. Conform or be embarrassed. You can make the news for refusing to conform. In most places, you must have a certain square footage in your home. Must hook up to electricity. Must hook up to water. You can't live in a tent on property you purchased in most places. Not that building codes are bad. They are needed for safety, but your tent will bring your neighbors property value down.\n\nIn an agricultural society or hunter/gatherer what failure would we fear? How much embarrassment would there be? How much pressure to perform? I saw a lady on TV bitch out her man for not doing a good job skinning a baboon. LOL I don't think that's as bad as worrying that you'll be fired someday if you screw up big enough.  Then you end up losing your home and start living in your car all sneaky because that's illegal in a lot of places now too.\n\n
25	I think I am smart because I understand a lot of very complex things to a depth that I don't see in other people. I think I am stupid because those very complex things are not at all useful for making my life better. 
11	> I often question my own intelligence and hop from feeling that I’m probably the smartest of all my friends and family to thinking I’m retarded and realizing just how dumb I can be/my limitations. \n\nI can't speak for everyone, but to whatever degree we are similar, I think it's a function of the "big five" *conscientiousness* trait more than MBTI dimensions. And, I suspect it's even more subtle than that. \n\nI am generally conscientious--but only to a point. If we're talking academics (though I've long since graduated), I might do 1/3rd of the assigned math homework and feel confident that I get the gist. I grok the concepts and theory, but I'm not necessarily rehearsed in the trickier or counter-intuitive details. This is where the Dunning-Kruger feeling comes in. Invariably, during the course of homework, I'll reach some threshold where the cost/benefit stops making sense. Do I spend 4 hours doings essentially the same repetitive math problems where 1 of them will be the final boss "gotcha" on the exam? Or, do I spend 4 hours doing literally anything else. In other words, am I happy with a 'B' in this class? Some people are a lot better at hunkering down and powering through that moment where you reflect and ask, "why the fuck am I wasting my time on this shit?" They don't see it as a waste and/or they are much more motivated by achievement.\n\nAgain, speaking for myself, my "super-power" is understanding and synthesizing concepts rapidly. I can usually relate a new idea back to an analogous old idea that I fully understand and step forward through the ideaspace with some confidence. This is useful and gives me a leg up in a lot of situations. However, my weakness is as described above: details, inconsistencies, navigating arbitrary complexities, rote boredom, etc. People who focus on the trees but miss the forest think I'm smart. And when I only see the forest, and they point out the trees, I feel stupid. Another way to look at it is the difference between bottom-up versus top-down learning styles. \n\nYMMV.
8	I am always in awe how otherwise stupid people do anything for smarter people not to start "their" topics of conversation
9	I have always struggled with math and quantitative things; I can't do mental arithmetics very well, and I can't seem to hold many numbers in my head. Math that is above 10th grade level simply becomes less "natrual" to me, and I had an awful time with all my college math classes because I simply don't really grasp the concepts behind what was taught deeply enough for me apply them. My spatial reasoning and my sense of direction also suck, and I'm frequently oblivious to my surroundings and is very likely to be lost without a GPS in my hand. My working memory is within the normal range, but I suffer from ADHD, so sometimes I don't "register" things if that makes things. I have a decent long term memory, but it isn't anything too spectacular. \n\nI am a lot more comfortable with the qualitative things. Language, insights, meanings, writing, reading, understanding purely abstract concept without practical values etc. I don't really know my IQ, but I bet it is within the normal range because I was always "good" among my peers throughout my school years, but never exceptional. \n\nOther people do tell me I'm smart, and I really do enjoy the idea of being smart. However, in the end of the day, I really have no proof or justification to actually be sure I am smart. I have always struggled with the constant battle between my insecurity and vanity; I frequently switch between thinking I'm a smarter person than most, and I'm an impractical and incompetent dumbass. I also have this feeling that I'm not in sync with reality because my point of reference is always abstract and subjective, so I can be blind to what is practical and right in front of my eyes. 
6	Uh I'd wager that a lot of us are autistic 
5	I got tested at a 125 FSIQ and I usually feel like an idiot. Also have ADD and am on the spectrum so gang gang
6	Most the time I think that if I can grasp a concept with the amount of effort I exert, surely so can everyone else.  The idea that I might be the smartest person in any given place, at any given time, is both hilarious and terrifying because if that is truly the case, there is no hope for mankind.\n\nOn the flip side, showing greater capability means more responsibility and potentially some sort of leadership role, so I try to downplay and self depreciate as much as I can, but that doesn't always work....\n\nI've intermittently suspected I have at least ASD as well, so it was nice to learn I'm just intp.  The meme holds up.
9	Beware of depression and a complete disregard for all of humanity... Since after all we're stupid, but since we're the smartest among everyone, how ABSOLUTELY MORONIC must others be? Best to hide from them all, since they're not worth our time.
8	Everyone thinks I’m so smart I’m not lol I’m just good with language 
4	Well I don't just "think" I actually am... Retarded
4	I thought about this yesterday, I'm not one to brag about my intelligence but from a general view I'd say I'm above average. I tend to not let anything offend me, but when someone goes after my intelligence it really gets under my skin. I think it has to do with this thought line. 
11	Take mushrooms. They’ll help you doubt your self less and hopefully kill your ego.  Currently trying to get to a better place with myself with the same issue. 
3	Wow, this is exactly me. 
3	So I actually do have ADHD and believe me I feel like this all the time!
3	There is such a thing as an intelligent fool. Unfortunately, I qualify.
3	I tried coming up with a punny hashtag for Instagram for a photo walk and everyone in my group looked at me like I just farted during a funeral \n\nSince it takes place in Jacksonville I used the area code 904 and incorporated it into \#90fotowalk
2	Any> ...retarded and the smartest person in the room at the same time?\n\nWhat you've discovered is the difference between knowledge and wisdom.
2	I was actually diagnosed with ADHD and am currently on prescribed meds for it. So, yeah, I feel like this all the time
2	This is exactly me. I've always feel smart and intelligent but when it come to understanding additional math for example, I feel so retarded. I'm not terrible at additional math I just take more time to understand compared to my ESFP friend. And that really scares me. 
2	Old here: This stuff takes a long time. You have to learn to live with yourself first then, once you're happy that you aren't a dick - try to ignore the stupid stuff and concentrate on the interesting. Even the supposedly daftest person has moments. Get a pet.
2	I like to describe it with the rules of DnD\n\nIntelligence is the stat that shows how quickly you understand and modify this knowledge.\nWisdom is the usage of this knowledge.\n\nThere are obviously different kinds of areas in which you can learn faster or apply your knowledge better.\nBut in general thats the easiest and fastest way to explain these intelligent dumbasses we call INTP lol\nWe often have more intelligence than wisdom if you see it like that, there are always exceptions though 
2	posted the exact same thing like a month ago, but so yeah I get this feeling constantly 
2	Most definitely. On tests and understanding concepts I'm perfectly fine, better than just fine even, but put me in a room with my fellow humans and the most dumb incomprehensible shit seems to come out of my mouth. Don't get the time to process in my mind and whatnot. Written communication is much easier with editing, redrafts, but yeah I'm really dumb. Like so dumb it sometimes confuses me when people label me as one of those smart people. I am, I'm not, I don't know. I feel you.
2	 I really feel this... I have so much doubt in regards to my own intelligence. My lack of self-confidence often feels insurmountable. I've had teachers tell me that I'm a fantastic writer, I've had friends tell me I'm the smartest person they know, but I can't believe them. For whatever reason, I believe they are somehow disingenuous or somewhat biased. This is a completely irrational thought, but I can't help but think it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn the other hand, I look around me and see how idiotic people can be. I don't understand how they can be so dense, careless, and inconsiderate. 
2	I feel you, I always acted differently and thought I was off my rocker. But when I'm alone I don't contemplate it as much as I focus in on my favorite activities. Only when I have a bad interaction or I say something extreme, and when i get suspicious of someone who proves innocent. In my head I see a large and in charge guy but when it comes to doing it, I reserve my responses and look for a backdoor wherever possible.
2	There is such a thing as impostor syndrome, where you misjudge yourself to be less competent than you actually are. It's a struggle since you can't exactly have a clear judgement of your skills due to your own insecurities. Happens to the best of us.\n\nOh yeah and I suspected myself to have mild autism, went to get diagnosed, and it turns out that I don't have autism! It's GAD! It felt like a waste of time after researching about autism/myself for so long but well a little more knowledge wouldn't hurt much.

1	very me
1	I have aspergers so yeah this is a constant feeling 
1	I’m retarded and the people who tell me I’m smart are even more retarded.\n\nBut somehow I’m still more retarded because of social stuff..
1	I feel the same way most of the time, and I’ve even made my own explanation for it (so I don’t dwell on it to much)\n\n\nMaybe I am/you are one of the smartest people alive but still dumb due to limited human biology/nature. In which case, why care? :)
1	Yep
1	Yes. A thousand times yes.
1	Me. I have nothing to add, I just relate.
1	Did I ghost write this lol\n\nYes, with constantly questioning myself I can continuously keep checks on myself and stay factually correct. But I always feel dumb as shit when doing so. 
1	I think it's a negative thing to look at yourself as a "...designated personality type...".    MBTI is useful but not perfect. you can change yourself and work on you shadow functions. you don't have to confine yourself to a box.
1	Yes. This. \n\nI feel as though I alternate between the INTJ and INTP personality types. I've had times in my life where I've been the standard INTJ, motivated af, hyper diligent human who was completely confident in my abilities. I was convinced I was gifted, as I could pretty much solve any math or engineering problem if I had a template to do so, and I could just extrapolate from that pattern. \n\nI didn't really start to feel the sense of 'retardation' (for lack of a better word) until I hit my junior year of college when concepts started to go from abstract to more realistic, and I was required to operate a lot of tests/do labwork. I could not repeat a simple process if my life depended on it. I also realized that engineers actually had to be able to verbally translate concepts to other people. I didn't realize that my brain worked backwards, I thought in symbols and equations and then translated everything into a concept. Purely useless in my field. This is sort of when I realized how impractical my intelligence was. \n\nIt was then that I realized how damn dumb I was, because in my field, this is what real engineers do on a regular basis. It took me way too long to realize this, and I realized how truly fucked I was. If I had a do-over I'd go into computer programming or something where I could just build without having to explain what I'm doing to other people. Lock me in a basement and have me build a program.\n\nI hope you guys know how much this sub has helped me understand myself. Even if I'm a useless human, at least there are 200 million people who probably feel the same way.
1	Yes, people are always surprised funnily enough. 
1	It's only natural that as you learn more, you realize that there's a lot more to learn.
1	Same here.\n\nHere's a conversation keep replaying in my head everyday:\n\nMe: Wtf why did I get those low grades? Didn't I try hard enough? Or maybe I'm just a dumbf\*\*k that nobody needs.\n\nAlso me: Lmao why do I have to care about those dumb shiet tests anyway. My head is full of other interesting stuff. \n\nMe again: I should try harder for the next exam. Or else others will call me with idiot names again.\n\nAnd guess what, here's another me: Or maybe nah. Lol.
0	Yo, hey ya’ll — in 2019 even not- intelligent people know to not use the word ‘retarded.’  I’d say emotional intelligence is about 0 for using it, and being an INTP/J is not a justification.
0	UBI x2	
2	Government mandated gf’s would be hilariously low quality \n\nThe free market would win again 
3	INTP Scientists?	INTPs have a long legacy of Physicists and scientists.\n\nWe have had Newton,Einstein and Galileo,however I don't find any INTP who is a scientist here.\n\nI personally am on track to be a Physicist. How about you guys?\n\nEDIT:Your research interests/inclinations are invited too :)\n\n&#x200B;
3	I studied medical microbiology, but found out too late it was the wrong degree for the job I wanted. Considering a career change back, but given the time I've been out it will probably require another degree worth of learning. 
2	Currently in college and considering being a scientist, I was initially leaning towards history professor though. Any insight would be appreciated 
2	Right now I'm doing my last year of highschool. After that I'm trying to get to University of Helsinki to study cosmology and theoretical physics. \n\nI've been a huge physics guy since a kid and I want to study our universe and existence. 
2	It's because the particular intps you are searching for probably won't bother wasting time on Reddit.
2	Studied biomechanics on older adults with Parkinson's. Also helped on Zika, malaria, salmonella and undersea medicine studies. 
2	Well, if it counts for anything, I'm currently completing a dual degree in law and psychology. While many consider psychology a "pseudoscience", I would think the fact that psychological theory can be tested via experimentation, and its outcomes replicated, demonstrates otherwise.
2	Newton was ESTx. And you're awfully chummy for someone who claims to be INTP. In fact, the only reason you say "we" is because you want to be chummy like an ESTx.\n\nEdit: I took a look through your comment history and I'm reasonably sure you're a clinical narcissist thus ESTx.
1	One here ... jumped from medical to material sciences 
2	Common misconceptions of INTP women?	
10	That they evenexist is a pretty common one
5	That they enjoy these repeated threads about them. 
3	Why are all these questions about INTP women popping up lately? I don't even know if there are specific conceptions of INTP women that are that different from those of INTP men. Maybe that our Fe is more developed? That our chameleon powers are stronger? \n\nI also find it hard to figure out what INTP women are like in general since my set of examples is so small. There's me and then I've known only a handful of others in my lifetime.
1	Hot
1	That they're like normal women (SF-like).
1	That they are unicorns or objects? Taking an archetype and then generalizing behavior further into gender isn’t something anyone is going to be able to provide “good” advice on. The fact you talk like this alludes to the fact that you already think they are some kinda unicorn or object to be gathered. I find this question really creepy overall. They are no different than their male counterparts but rather as different. You wanna talk to women and get laid then you kno... talk to them. If they like you, they like you like any other basic human interaction goes.
3	How to befriend an INTP female as an INTP male?	Edit: Okay so now I feel like an idiot. Thank you all you wonderful people!
11	Why is does this thread keep popping up? Lmao. I suggest you actually u know treat women like you would any other person and perhaps talk to them.
5	1) initiate conversation \n\n2) if you find at some point in the future that you are friends, congrats it turned out successful
5	Treat them like guys
5	The hardest part is finding one
2	PERKS OF BEING AN INTP!!
2	1. attempt conversation on potential topic of common interest.\n2. repeat until you find said topic, but don't be too desperate if you cannot find one.\n3. if it works, profit.
2	Perform acceptable verbal communication according to the local culture and customs.
6	Making up scenarios in your head	Do any of you think about situations you could get into and how you would react to them?\n\nFor instance, I sometimes think about real life situations I could get into, and the many things that can happen in them, then think about what I'd do in the scenarios I thought of.\n\n&#x200B;
5	I imagine this scenario: if someone is in the car with you, and they point a gun at you and try to force you to go to a location, they're basically fucked. You can technically take them hostage and speed up the car to dangerous speeds and crash into a tree or off a bridge, and not slowing down until they throw their weapon out of the window. If they cooperate, you might live. If they shoot you while you're speeding, well.....it's not your problem anymore now is it...?
3	I do that often too, thinking about the most likely things that may happen and think how I will react, like I would try to prepare for it.
2	Yeah I think intp's are the only ones who generate multiple endings and loosely go back and forth to find the best few possibilities ( there's always more than one). I use to moreso as a kid but now I project other personalities and guess their next step. I feel that's why we ID other personalities and people when we are out, if we are in a more Ne/Ti state. In our Ti/Side we will replay old memories or whatever concepts we are tinkering with and play with that.
2	Yes, all the time. I remember spacing out while waiting for the bell to ring in school and thought to myself : "Hmm, what would happen if the roof collapsed? Would the first floor people get hurt the most since there are more floors above them? Should I jump out the window? Would hiding underneath a table work?" etc. I love doing this.
1	But you never had a seatbelt on, if I have the chance to hurt you while hurting myself, that's just a better memory in the highlights, warriors love blood
1	r/maladaptivedreaming
3	How do you all deal with confrontations?	I know this isn't necessarily INTP related, but I'm simply curious. I have always been extremely conflict avoidant, and is awful at handling conflicts if I ever end up in one. I like to keep peace and harmony, and I generally back down very quickly if things get heated. I don't even like to argue with people on reddit, and my comments are generally neutral and unprovocative. In real life, I try my best not to offend people, and if I end up offending anyone, I apologize very sincerely. I don't talk politics, religion, or anything that might end up in major disagreements. For physical conflicts, I'm a "freezer", and I simply wouldn't know what to do in a violent situation.
2	Let me them walk all over me and then burst out and lash out at them if they corner me.
2	When it's on, it's on. Fight if I have to. But I do have issues with situations where the confrontation is less direct, or done in diplomatic manner etc... I just can't keep a good face in bad game, and in fear of overreacting, I play it safe and underreact instead. Hate when that happens. 
1	I deal with it poorly at the time, and do the same as you (basically run away). However whatever they did to bother me will be filed away, and they will be duly repaid with inaction. Normally little and often, but if the opportunity presents itself I will not hesitate to let someone walk off a cliff. \n\nI mean they never know I'm doing it, but it does make me feel better :) 
1	I'm the total opposite. I live for it, I'm always correcting people or saying how this is biased and this is wrong, if someone say something even remotely subject to debate I'll jump fiercely unto it. It's not that I control it. Instinct. 
1	"Never start a fight, but always finish it" about sums it up. I would rather not have to, but I will absolutely not shy away from confrontation. 
1	I'm not terribly afraid of contradicting other people in debates or conversations; that's what they are for. I hate conversations where everyone only says things that everyone already knows or doesn't care about. Sometimes my stomach twists itself into knots, but I tell myself to grow a pair and just say it. So I do. 90% of the time, anyway.\n\nPhysical conflicts? Yikes. Those scare me. Mostly because I know I have a blazing temper when attacks get physical. It'll be a real fight. I might get torn to pieces or the other person might get torn to pieces, but whatever happens, it is gonna hurt. I don't like getting hurt. So I do my best to avoid fighting. I won't back down from someone trying to intimidate me, but I also never under any circumstances make threats because if someone called me on it, my whole facade would crumble. I just stand there with a totally blank expression, as best as I can manage that, and tell them in a clear monotone voice that unless they plan to make good on their threats, they're wasting everyone's time.\n\nThat worked remarkably well in high school when all the bullies were weak and afraid. It came pretty close a time or two, but I always was able to find the courage to just stand there and the situation eventually just defused itself. I haven't had to use this tactic in real life. I hope it doesn't get me killed someday.
1	I offend a lot of people. I love offensive humor and sometimes I say things before thinking if I should really say them. Aaaand, that gets me into trouble. \n\nAnyway, it depends who the person is. If the person is someone who I know isn't afraid to voice their opinions, I just try to be polite and leave the conversation ASAP.\n\nIf It's some small angry short boi then I just make jokes about it and if it doesn't work, offend them more until they shut up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nno wonder i don't have any friends.
1	I avoid conflict. I try to handle it. But people said that i am quite sharp-mouth person. Even tho i handle it?????\nIdk i just said or asked the fact?? And even i quite offended people, i always laugh in the end. Geez, do people really afraid of what fact or truth speak?
129	I’m really busy tonight	
7	The more you do this, the better you get at finding those goldilocks excuses that are vague enough to not be lying, but specific enough that, due to social norms, the recipient of the excuse will not be likely to inquire further about it.
2	Its stuff and I'm doing it

1	Friends: do you time to hangout on [insert date] \n\nMe: sorry, I will be busy on that day \n\nReality: I'm too busy doing nothing by staying home and chillaxing.

8	INTP'S are you right or left handed?	
30	I have both thank you.
6	I’m right handed but cross dominant and do some activities as a lefty out of comfort 
3	Selectively and exclusively. I don't know how to express this at all. I write, pitch and sew with my right hand. I racquet, shoot, and eat (finger food) with my left. Trying to use the opposite hand for the activity doesn't work and it seems every activity has its own dominant hand. So every time I learn something new and they ask which dominant hand I am, I have to say something to the effect of I need to try first. 
2	I couldn’t answer your poll, as I don’t have an account, and I didn’t want to create one.\n\nI’m right handed. I’m so right handed that my left hand is almost useless to me.
2	Right handed. But can do the Spock 🖖 with both hands. 
2	I use my third hand usually
2	Right, though I am not too bad with my left on most things. 
2	Right, but I think I was originally left and trained to use right as my dominant hand.\n\nIf that makes any sense.
2	Ambidextrous which you left out. 
1	right handed:/
1	Left handed
1	Lefty here
1	Is neither an option? Neither.
1	Fact: left handed people can't clap correctly
1	Cross dom.
1	Wow, there are 3x as many left-handed INTP's as there are in a general population.
1	Aggressively right handed
1	Lefthanded. Was apparently tested as a kid to see if I am left-everything. I am 100% pure lefty.
1	Now, I think there is a correlation between handedness and MBTI types. Out of all strawpolls almost all of them received the same results such :\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAround 70% of INTP are right handed\n\n20 to 30% of INTP are left handed\n\naround 5 to 10% of INTP are ambidextrous. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou may also  take in consideration that lefties like myself are more prone to answer to the poll.
1	Bold of you to assume I have hands.
2	Question	If u had to guess what my psychological diagnosis was what would your guess be?
1	Histrionic
1	you have really distinct personas. \nlet me clarify.\nwhen I take on a different persona, I have to consciously shove myself into it.  Like shoving my 200lb body into a bodysuit made for a 120lb person.  \n\nYou automatically switch, sometimes without even being aware it's happening.
1	Autistic. 
1	Definitely narcissism, maybe Alzheimer's, and probably micropenis.
14	Anyone else got this problem?	I'm really bad at texting and I don't know what to do about it.... Like, I do alright with writing essays and stuff, but texting actual people was so hard for me, I pretty much stopped doing so. I feel like my responses were so boring, I didn't wanna bore the other person, so I eventually just stopped responding to everyone.\n\nDoes anyone have similar experiences? If so, any tips are highly appreciated.
6	I just write texts the same way I do anything else. Punctuation, no abbreviations. The few times that people have complained, I just ignored them and continued my ways.\n\nWhen I write, I have something to say. I am not going to let others dictate how I write. Same thing with the tldr crap. Other people may not bring their attention spans up to the level of my writing, but I am not going to change to meet their attention spans or preferences.
4	I'm bad at texting. I talk a lot better in like group chats like on discord. DMs aren't for me unless I have an interesting thing I wanna say.\n\nI'd much rather call people or talk in person.
2	Idk I'm fine with texting and if they are bored, it's not like I'm forcing them to have a conversation. 
1	In the same boat no clue
1	Same issue, I just try to find new people right now that i only chat to (dont know them in person) and I try to lead the conversation to what I am interested in, when the other person is too then great discussions appear. My go to topic is psychology and i talk about the MBTI test, it is weird to some but whatever, also need new interests and ways to approach other people interest. But thats where I am at for now.
1	I just don't text people unless I have to. I much prefer actually being with them in person (unless I don't know them of course)
1	Practice until you completely understand the process.  Just like your other interests.
1	type faster
1	I don’t text in my class chat at all unless I really need to use my classmates for help. I only text my very very close friends and family members.
1	I don't text, generally.
1	To be honest, hacking conversations isn't THAT hard. Act like you're interested in what the other side has to say. Ask open-ended questions. All that yadda yadda anyone can find on google.\n\nIf anything, texting is way easier than holding the same conversation in person, because you don't have to manually take care of your body language and facial expressions and can focus more on what you actually want to say.\n\nDoes not apply to group chats. Also, fuck group chats.
10	INTPs: Do you think itʼs more logical for a supreme being to exist or is it not? Why?	
18	[deleted]
12	How are we defining supreme being here? If we're in a simulation, is the admin who runs our computer a supreme being? Do you mean a more traditional notion of a God or divine figure with supernatural abilities such as omniscience or omnipresence?\n\nAnd by what criteria would one argument be more logical than the other? I can argue that a supreme being doesn't exist because no evidence exists for one, but I can also argue that a supreme being could hide all evidence of their existence if one were to exist and wanted to make themselves unknown.
9	Anyone ever heard of Dr. Sylvester Gates?  Theoretical physicist I once heard speak at a research conference. Dude really opened the idea to me and others [that we might live in a matrix.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NkFemtrRZs) Speaks about discovering computer code equations in String Theory. Short discussion of when he brought it up there but other lectures explain more.\n\ne: it makes me think God might be a programmer who left his PC on.
7	Per Occam's Razor; no. If you can imagine a universe that is cyclical, for example, in a constant cycle of Big Crunch and Big Bang, that needs less assumptions that imagining such a contradictory thing as a being that is eternal, timeless and outside the universe itself, and is able to, somehow, transcend the laws of physics as we know them and make things out of nothing, go against the law of entropy, define specific goals for itself out of no previous experience, and yet be free to pursue whatever, be both infinitely loving and hateful, and all other contradictions, or maybe be limited in it's scope, but then still be called "supreme", etc, etc, etc. Not even mentioning the contradiction of specific gods such as the abrahamic one, who says he wants nothing but good for his followers, that he is all powerful, and yet allows both evil and the possibility of eternal damnation to exist. or you could say the "supreme being" is just the universe itself, but then you have done very little.  \n\n\nIn short, something such as a "supreme being" is entirely dependent on how you define it, and even then, if it's not "God", then what are you talking about?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo effort argument from me, but you might find it useful.
5	Sure. If by supreme being you mean my waifus, and by exist you mean can be found in the internet.
5	I'm not sure, to be honest.\n\nThe best logical case for the existence of some greater being or creator is the great many coincidences that make our universe suitable for life. The strength of gravity and certain other fundamental forces are so perfectly tailored to a universe that allows life to exist that it really does raise an eyebrow. Even the slightest of deviance among any of the fundamental forces of the universe would make life as we know it completely impossible. It's quite a compelling reason to suspect that their could be something greater than us at work, be it the Christian God or some other super-dimentional being that decided to run a simulation of life in one temporal and three spatial dimensions, or something else entirely.\n\nOn the other hand, if you subscribe to the idea the this universe is just one of infinitely many universes, it only stands to reason that a universe such as ours should exist. Depending on the size of that infinity, there may even be an infinite number of universes that are exactly like ours.\n\nI don't know. It's a question for the ages. Maybe someday we will know. Maybe not. It is difficult to say anything for certain when we know so painfully little about our universe.
5	If you mean, like, god? I think it doesn’t matter either way, because even if my religion is only a coping mechanism created by humans, it hasn’t hurt my life and has in fact enriched it. \n
2	I don’t think it matters if one exists or not,at the end of the day the only meaning for humans is one based on the subjectivity of the actions of the individual. I don’t believe in a meaning outside of that and so if a supreme being exists or not is irrelevant. I guess in regards to your original question the more logical of the two would be  dependent on how one would define a supreme being.

2	Humans should worship the Big Bang. Energy exploded outward and we have been following a set path of reactions ever since. 
2	It literally doesn't matter.
2	1. I as an entity within the existence can experience existence\n\n2. Therefore the entire existence must come together as an entity experiencing existence\n\nHow could you not define the everythingness that exists by everything it contains? If you are conscious, you have a conscious source. If you aren't conscious, you don't exist. But you do. So you have. Alright.
2	Yes.  I like Thomas Aquinas' *The Argument for Sufficient Cause*.
2	If a Creator does exist, then he/she/it would not be perfect. Yes the universe does work, but there are a few bugs here and there.\n\nI think that it is logically possible, however there is no real evidence for or against the idea. Add to this the sheer number of  inconsistencies of the various beliefs regarding said being, I have decided that religion is not a viable option for me.
1	No. I think people are all good at different things but born in the wrong era where something is just better. S.g, Intelligence over strength.\n\nSo how good you are is determined by what time period you are/will be born in.
1	No supreme being exists. Life is pure randomness and suffering, therefore it does not make sense for a benevolent creator to exist. \n\nPossibly a non-benevolent creator exists, but given the large vastness of the universe I believe it is improbable that some being created it all. Who created him/her/it?\n\nI think because humans are born from a predecessor we are hardwired to believe in a before that had to beget us. This idea is present in many myths via the trope of the race/generation overthrowing their creator/master. The human brain likely struggles with the concept of no "before" and that is why 99% of humanity has developed and clung to an origin myth of some kind. 
1	It's not more logical for a supreme being to exist. But is logic the way to know whether a supreme being exists ?
0	INTPs who go for these fairytales sicken me\n\nC'mon, we humans "created" meta-s*it
0	A supreme being exists or doesn't exist. It is a factual question. If a supreme being does exist, then its existence is logical  of it does not exist, then logic cannot help. Sounds like you found your supreme being in logic.
-2	Jusus fucking Christ, this thread's answers make me want to vomit.\n\nI really didn't know INTPs could be this dumb/naive/ignorant, y'all should really doubt more your intellect.
3	Anyone else jealous of INTJs getting Karl Marx as a notable personality?	Cause I am.
7	Somehow, I doubt he took the test. Seems pretentious to say he was INTJ.
8	Marx may be responsible for more deaths than anyone else in history. 
1	I'm not sure if this is a joke or not. I think it is. Karl Marx is the father of one of the most murderous doctrines this planet has ever seen. \n\nSo I guess it's pretty funny.
1	I hope this is an elaborate troll, if it is it's very funny and well executed.
1	No. Marx was an asshole.
0	No, because Einstein.\n\nedit: also Marxism is like 5th grade philosophy level faggotry. Read a fucking book you retard. \n\nMaking all INTPs look bad with your stupid ass,
3	[humor] INTP translating social media.	
8	Reading saved articles	Wish me luck. Today’s the day. I’m going in. Have approx 20 thumb flips of saved websites to go through on my phone. \n\nMaybe some day I’ll get to my countless saved reddit posts. 
4	Always have at least a hundred saved articles. When chrome needs to load for a minute or so I delete them 😂
3	I have 70 tabs open and more things bookmarked than I will ever actually read. Every once in a while I'll get down to single digits. 
2	What? You're supposed to read them?
2	If a tab's been sitting around for more than a few days without me feeling motivated to finish reading it, I close it. If I wasn't bothered not having read it all that time, clicking away and forgetting it exists isn't gonna fill me with regrets either.
2	Same with TV shows. I just seem to love browsing and saving things more than actually watching/ reading stuff. My compromise is podcasts.
12	How curious are you people?	I've recently discovered a topic that caught my interest and I haven't been able return to my normal life, it became like an obsession, finding new and exciting things to read and learn about.
15	Let me put it this way. If curiosity killed INTPs the way it does cats, I would need way more than 9 lives. Something like a google plex.
6	The easiest way to answer this is by telling a story.  \n\nMy wife came down to get me to go to bed one night and I only noticed the time when she spoke to me.  It was 3:30am.\n\nI had been reading up on a new technology to store computer data.  It was capable of storing a terabyte of data in a cube the size of a sugar cube.  The downside was it took femtosecond capable lasers.  It used two lasers and the data was stored as they crossed each other in the cube.\n\nUseful? Not really.  At least not in any day-to-day way. But it's so cool. 
6	We are the most curious. 
2	Yes
2	I think my favorite characteristic in people is when I find them surprising
2	Normally I'm 0% curious about anything, but once something catches my attention it turns into obsession. 
2	3.1415/5 curious
1	I regularly get obsessed over things i find interesting to the point that its all i can think about for days.
1	3.67 curious
37	How in the bloody hell do I force myself to study?	I often don't study for a test. In fact, the closest to studying I usually get is looking at my mediocre notes (and my many sketches) for about 5 minutes before the test.\n\nEven if the subject is interesting, I can't bring myself to study for something like a test. Just seems like a poor measure.\n\nHell, I should be studying now. I have a test in 4 hours, and instead of studying I've been watching videos and browsing forums all night long. Nothing works. Nothing but glorious ADHD meds. 
35	2 methods that worked with me.\n\n1- (I know this may sound very stupid but really worked for magically) I make up a class situation consisting of two to three pillows and I take the role of the teacher and I teach the shit out of them. I ask a question and demand pillow one to answer and I answer as I'm am pillow 1. If correct good, if not I'd feel free to shout or hit pillow 1. Repeat with every pillow until you are done.\n\n2- I set an alarm on a clock or a hand watch and through my phone away and I would study for 20 to 30 minutes until the alarm goes off. Then I'll set another alarm for 30 minutes and take my phone to play a game or watch videos.
16	Hey, so I'm INTJ just scrolling through. and I wont pretend to be able to help you... \n\nBut you might want to try that thing where you set a timer for 20-30 minutes, and you can't do anything but study within that time period. It doesn't matter if you do study, but you can't do anything else.\nJust get used to not doing all that other shit. If you can force yourself to do that, that is.\nIf you get bored, the only thing to do, is study. \nYou could get one of those apps, that shots down your computer and/or phone  for a certain period of time.\nIdk, just an idea.\nPeople usually do this with a schedule that looks like this:\n-30 min studying\n-10 min pause\n-30 min studying\n-10 min pause\n-30 min studying\nEtc. \nYou can change the time and such. 
5	Have you considered just not giving a fuck and letting your life fall to shambles? Worked wonders for me.
5	I never studied and I did......decent
4	I hate to be that guy, but do you /need/ to study? If you’re happy with your grades, you honestly may want to evaluate whether or not there’s anything wrong with your current method ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
3	I didn't study either.  Just take good notes and the process of writing stuff down was all I needed most times to imprint on my mind.  Also, understanding the material as it comes in, or even try to predict what the teacher will say before he/she says it.  Once the material is incorporated into your understanding of the world, it is always there ready to go. 
3	Masturbate, then if that doesn't work masturbate some more. 
2	Go to the library or a coffee shop or anywhere where you can’t be distracted by dirty dishes, your cute cat or other people talking to you.
2	I wasn't one to study. I listened and seldomly took notes. The classes I excelled at were the classes in which I would help others with the content. I always tend to think outside the box, so when I helped others, they often asked questions I might not have asked myself. That caused me to re-evaluate my understanding. I was usually pretty quick at developing accurate responses to their questions. Teaching often makes the educator learn different methods of delivering the same information. The more methods you know on how to teach a subject, the better you will understand the subject in general.\n\n

1	Honestly, I'm the same. BUT - lately I've gotten so pissed at myself for not studying that I made it into a challenge to do it. And it's been working well for me lately though not without some extra push. Go download Forest: Stay Focused or FLIP - Focus Timer for Study. First one gives you a tree for every 25 minutes of studying (and you get to plant a garden every day) and the second one lets you set goals and beat past records. Challenging yourself like that can get you into the habit of studying quite smoothly. 
1	I've found that one trick that worked for me was meeting myself halfway and saying "Ok, you know you're not gonna study for all 4 of these hours, so we'll have a system where you set an timer for just 30m, and study. After it dings, set another alarm for 30m, and have guilt-free spare time. But, after it dings, rinse and repeat"\n\nWould do this when studying for uni exams, somehow I appreciated my willingness to give myself a break and ended up have at least half of my hours be productive.
1	You being a Ti driver, you'll have to use the method that makes logical sense to you. Here's a method that's been proven to work (Te) and I hope it fits in to your Ti.\n\nPromodoro Technique - Where you study for 25 min (I do 30, don't see why not) and then take a short break where you reward yourself by relaxing, taking deep breaths and stretching (I can't possibly see how they're rewarding so I do one or a couple rounds of the Twenty game).\n\nIf the material is particularly tedious, focus on the process (study-break-study etc) and make sure you practise examples (if mathematical) and try to recall as much as you can after a session.\n\nObviously it's too late now but best of luck in the future :)\n
1	Set a time every day where you aren’t allowed to use electronics. Force yourself to do something outside of YouTube videos and reddit. If you don’t have school stuff to do, do something like reading or exercise. Make it at the same time every day.\n\nEdit: typo 
1	My thesis guide told me to JUST GET STARTED WILL YOU. It kinda helped for a while. As did the Pomodoro technique. As did making appointments with (introvert) friends to study together. 
1	i had a convo with my friend recently about doing work and what we want and motivation, and he made me see something clearly: sometimes you need to do things you don't want to do as part of a greater goal that you do want. so i would say clarify to yourself the greater goal that you want which requires you to study. then you just need to know that studying is something you don't want to do but you should be driven by the thing  you want which is now clear to you. i haven't really tried this out yet myself, but it makes sense, and could probably help you
1	You first you need to build a study habit.\n\nLets imagine you wanted to do 300 minutes of rigorous exercise a month, the easiest way is 10 minutes worth of exercise a day, also best way to establish the habit, but if you instead tried to do 300 minutes at the same time you will not build a habit, you will hate doing it, and you will fail.
1	Think how much you might regret not studying in the future when your income is far lower than if you took this shit seriously. 
1	I struggle. I play techo music or someone talking. Going somewhere else. Even just sitting in my car has been effective. \n\nAlso how are you studying?\n\nThere are different techniques. Maybe you haven't found a good way for you.\n\nIf you can get good grades without why would you study?  People study to memorize. 
94	Pretty much	
6	Being lonely and being alone is different. Sure we may (or may not) have friends, but that does not mean we connect with them, especially when our way of thinking and speaking is usually too direct for most people's superficiality. And id rather be alone than be fake, because making friends with a fake personna will achieve nothing since at the end of the day they wouldnt be *my* friends.
1	Totally me. “Why don’t I have friends hanging out with me? ;( “ \n(When a bunch of friends showed up)\n“I’ll be at my room. You guys have fun”
