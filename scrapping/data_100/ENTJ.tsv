17	New Mod Selections	This has certainly been ~~an exciting~~ 3 weeks. I'd like to thank all of the members of r/ENTJ that decided to apply.\n\nI have decided to follow a strict interpretation of the application rules that I initially set forth. Applicants were expected to follow basic instructions. Notably, applicants were required to send me a private message, rather than a public comment, indicating that they decided to apply. I explained this at least twice.\n\nIn selecting candidates, I considered the merits and motives behind each individual. I believe that all of the candidates that followed directions and applied are qualified for some level of moderation.\n\nWhich is why I've decided to promote all of them.\n\nThis new class of moderators will not be allowed to change permissions for each other. They will also not be allowed to add or remove moderators. That will remain my job.\n\nAs for the new mods (should they accept), their responsibilities will be as follows:\n\nu/Nobleghost will be granted almost-full privileges. His role will be to head up changes to the configuration (including presentation changes as desired) and to mediate low level disputes among the team.\n\nu/ArtemisWinchester and u/TrapWolf will both be in charge of content moderation. They will be given appropriate access, and are expected to work with each other to resolve disputes. \n\nu/Soul_M will report to u/Nobleghost and will be given permission to work with the wiki, chat, and flair.\n\nPrivileges will take effect around Monday, leaving time for discussion and further questions.
10	Nice. Looks like you have built yourself a good team. 
4	Looks good, I don't really do a whole lot on this sub unless chaos ensues. I'm still active on reddit so I'll remain on as a mod so if we have any rogue mods I can step in (like we had happen with some mods a couple years ago). 
1	Cool! Is it too late to apply?
16	Do you guys usually act crazy when you’re energized with other people?	Unless I’m an ENTP because I can be funny af. I know everyone can be funny but ENTJs can be too serious so I conclude that ENTJs are more serious than ENTPs. The thing is, I see myself as an ENTJ but sometimes I’d rethink what if I was ENTP.
23	If I’m around people that I like, I’m like cocaine in human form.  So, yes.
6	?
5	ENTJ: Te, Ni, Se, Fi  \nENTP: Ne, Ti, Fe, Si\n\nI think your answer will be found in function analysis, because they're cognitively very different.\n\nedit: typo
5	I don’t act “crazy” exactly but I do have a lot of fun with other people, certainly. 
8	That might be the Se child
3	I call it groove mode. It only happens when I am super comfortable in a social situation... if I have some form of control. \n\nBut, when I’m there. I am so crazy, goofy, unpredictable.  
2	When I’m around people that I enjoy and trust, I am opposite of reserved and controlled. I want to let loose and have fun but I have to be able to decipher if they are even worth letting go around. However, I think ENTJs are some of the funniest people I’ve met because they have a dead pan style of humor and a bluntness to them that I think others lack. They also possess nuance of language and can read in between the lines and are willing to say things that other people would feel uncomfortable by or just be unwilling to say. I think that kind of semi-shock factor can make some people really feel uncomfortable and others relax and laugh. \n\nI’m not sure about some of the other people on here, but when an ENFJ friend and I first hung out, she was very surprised by how much we had in common, especially linguistically. She had thought that I was just a hyper controlled machine but was pleasantly surprised as I can have a gregarious nature and like making people laugh. Which I think is another fact that people misconstrue about NTs in general, that they are serious all the time and don’t know how to let go. \n\nWe are not tightly wound, we just know when it’s an appropriate time to let loose. 
1	Look into enneagram i think 3 7 and 8 r entjs most common types. U could be an ennea 7
2	Clarifying ENTJ vs INTJ. What does it mean to be extroverted/introverted in the world of MBTI functionalities.	A repost (with a bit more foreknowledge) from my comment on a thread that asks for distinction between ENTJ and INTj. It seems like there are many people, myself included at times, that find it hard to correctly categorize ourselves as ENTJ or INTJ. I believe the primary cause is the lack of understand of what extroversion/introversion is, and how and why their effect of our primary function determines our MBTI. \n\nBefore I begin, it is important to understand that MBTI essential consists of dichotomies of functions of T,F,N,S- each with dualities of E and I. Hence, Te, Ti, Fe, Fi, Ne, Ni, Se, Si. Our functions are consistent of them and the primary function defines our natural preference of being as well as our state of extraversion or introversion (for ENTJ, our primary function is Te, extraverted thinking, hence we are technically extraverts). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMoving on to extroversion/introversion.\n\n It is basically asking do we prefer and pair our primary function (thinking/feeling/sensing/intuiting) with the objective (outside world) or subjective (inside world). Objective being extraverted and subjective being introverted. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow. Let's move on to ENTJ vs INTJ.\n\nIt can be hard to tell if an ENTJ is E or I if he/she has both strong Te and strong Ni. In social settings, because ENTJ use Te first, we can be viewed as 'introverted' or 'shy' when the reality is simply that social settings that require more Fe simply doesn't interest or bode well for our Te primary function as ENTJ.\n\nEssentially, the best way to tell is your natural primary function's preference. Would you consider yourself extraverted thinker (Te) first or introverted intuition (Ni) user first. That's how you should interpret extraversion vs introversion.\n\nAre you more primarily or constantly thinking about the objective outside world (using thinking to rationalize the world around you) or do you let information in the world flow by and absorb and then understand the world innately from a bigger picture point of view (aka introverted intuition).\n\nENTJ's primary function is Te, INTJ's primary function is Ni. Hence we get our "extroversion" from Te as our first function and INTJ get their 'introversion' from Ni as theirs.
1	When using functions, I don't think it's right to see INTJ as the introverted counterpart of ENTJ. ENTJ/INTP makes more sense to me, since it's the difference between Extraverted Thinking and Introverted Thinking, and both types have inferior Feeling functions, with the introvert struggling with Fe, and the extrovert struggling with Fi. \n\nWhen it comes to telling if someone is a Te/Ni dom though (or just the dominant function of anyone), I just take a look at what function they struggle the most with. It's usually much easier to tell if someone has inferior Se:\n\n* difficulty with assessing, acknowledging, and adapting to the environment around them\n* having little interest/unhealthy manifestations of sensual experiences\n* a strong focus on the future which may neglect the present circumstances\n\nor inferior Fi: \n\n* an unhealthy disregard of personal emotions \n* failing to take the feelings of others into consideration and remaining objective (near cold) in personal situations \n* a discomfort with dealing with emotional matters or communicating, verbalizing, or acknowledging negative feelings\n\nENTJs are better with Se, INTJs are better with Fi. Someone who prioritizes and is better adept at dealing with the external world (the environment, external phenomenon, people, events, etc.) is an extrovert, and someone who prioritizes and is better at dealing with themselves (their thoughts, their feelings, their perspectives, etc.) is an introvert. \n\n
3	Infp that needs some help	I feel like this post is ether going to be ignored or im going to get roasted....(takes a deep breath). So I have a crush on this ENTJ who is my classmates. Its an educated guess but he is hyper and really direct and he literally fits everything for an ENTJ. So my question is I want to talk to him he is in one of my classes. I'm planning on just talking to him as naturally as I can because yolo and I really want to get this situation out of my head, but im like really scared to do it. So like how would you guys react if a really shy person/classmate talked to you? Any advice would be appreciated thanks!
8	Just talk to them - ENTJs respect directness. I have no idea how they will react as everyone is different. You won’t know either unless you try.
2	Show them u r interesting with some cool trivia or story ("Did you know that?") maybe try asking for advice/opinion with some matter but dont go showing them right away u r into them. 
6	I realized that the more you care about efficiency the more you get lazier	I honestly care about efficiency a lot. I just end up thinking and planning on how to do the end goal very efficiently. It would take so much time. Btw, I’m 16 so I just think about what to do. I conclude that if you want the least amount of effort, you can literally just get lazier overtime and end up not having motivation.
5	Start calling this “Pareto optimization” and you're on track for the C-suite. Keep calling it laziness and you're gonna piss off the people who think superficially.\n\nYou need to be effective, which is different than being efficient. Part of what sucked about being 16 was not having any really challenging goals that I could meaningfully work towards. When I was sixteen all I cared about was getting into college. I feel like I managed to get really high grades despite being incredibly lazy. I got in, so I was effective. I barely made an effort to study, so I was arguably efficient.\n\nWhen you get a chance to chase bigger game, your effectiveness will be the whole point. If I find myself getting too efficient and waxing indolent I know I need a bigger challenge.
1	>  I just end up thinking and planning on how to do the end goal very efficiently.\n\nINTJ
4	In what way do you feel you are extroverted and not introverted?	What makes you an ENTJ and not an INTJ in this regard?
3	I get depression symptoms when I go without social interaction for a few days. I prefer to be the one leading the conversation. I like to initiate conversations as well.
1	I need to find solitary time to get my job done (software engineer). I also love the whiteboarding and the general shit-talking I do with my colleagues, but when I'm coding don't talk to me except by Slack.\n\nI would hate to work alone from home all the time. Good workplaces are crucibles for the bonding and socialization that creates teams from individuals.\n\nMy nickname in 1st Grade was *Chatterbox.* It wasn't exactly kind but it was apt. Still fits.
1	I feel that even though I can focus and get stuff done alone, I am at my best as a human being with people I enjoy being with. I however, don’t enjoy being with just one other person. It’s either no people or a group larger than three. 
1	So I can attest to the whole “I’m with others so let’s just be on all the time” attitude. I’m able to drain others when I’m super psyched about an activity or a topic of conversation. What I need to remain “on” is a constant influx of interesting stimuli. These stimuli can be people as well. Even more so when I’m attracted to someone in the group. Nothing else matters, and I am totally zoned in to impress, flirt with, and attract her. \n\nOnce I hit a couple of downers however, I’m done—regardless of who is around and that includes the attractive girl. I want to leave because I’m no longer amused or patient for something to happen that I feel is worth my time and attention. \n\nThe issue is this, I think: when we are out and about we likely want a goal to manifest itself in the outing when there are other people around (getting to know someone, sex, games, drinking, eating, swapping stories, enjoying a place/game/park etc.). This keeps us focused and interested in spending time with others. I think we can add work too seeing as there are some commenters here who have commented on their workplace, but I don’t want to be so broad as to include it in my list because work doesn’t apply to our choice to be extroverted or introverted. \n\nMy introversion kicks into full gear when I’m tired, impatient, bored, disappointed in the incompetence or idiocy of others, or when individuals in the group selfishly call attention to themselves for their own sake (out of insecurity or a need for validation). At that time, I retreat into myself. I stop talking, I seldom engage others unless they are willing to break from the group and talk about something deep or interesting with me. This may be because I also have a tendency (like some ENTJ’s do) to isolate myself from people generally, and I care to have one on one interactions because they’re so much more intimate and I can spend more time delving into a topic with one person rather than have others who string the conversation to other topics I don’t care to talk about.\n\nPresently, I only spend time with my girlfriend, and when I absolutely have to, two to three other people for extracurriculars or just a night out. I am the self-preservation 8w7/ENTJ—if that helps others reading this understand where I’m coming from and how to limit my contributions here. So, I don’t gravitate to nightlife. The biggest reason is I do not like other people. Learned to not like them by their own teachings. I can’t say I’ve sworn off making friends at all, but my standards for others in my friend group is the same that I hold for myself. Very few meet those standards. The point in my explaining this is that yes, I need to be around people to get that surge of energy now and again, but I don’t feed off it. \n\nI feel extraverted when I am talking to a big group. I feel introverted when I am analyzing them or sitting at home playing video games or watching movies/tv series. The extraverted feeling isn’t difficult to embody, it just carries a risk of social dramas that I’m not patient enough to suffer through.
1	Some goals are just too big for one person to accomplish alone. For this, I need to be able to delegate work amongst other people.
1	I love talking to people and sharing my stories or opinions and the other way around because I believe its the best way to learn how to live, from each other. 
1	Most people drain the hell out of me, which is an introvert thing, but when I need to I can just inhale and a flip switch and be “on.”  I don’t think many introverts are able to do that so easily.
1	ENTJ vs. INTJ ?	What does extroversion look for you?\n\nTrying to figure out if I'm E or I 
3	It can be hard to tell if an ENTJ is E or I if he/she has both strong Te and strong Ni. In social settings, because ENTJ use Te first, we can be viewed as 'introverted' or 'shy' when the reality is simply that social settings that require more Fe simply doesn't interest or bode well for our Te primary function as ENTJ.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEssentially, the best way to tell is your natural primary function's preference. Would you consider yourself extraverted thinker (Te) first or introverted intuition (Ni) user first. That's how you should interpret extraversion vs introversion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAre you more primarily or constantly thinking about the objective outside world (using thinking to rationalize the world around you) or do you let information in the world flow by and absorb and then understand the world innately from a bigger picture point of view (aka introverted intuition).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nENTJ's primary function is Te, INTJ's primary function is Ni. Hence we get our "extroversion" from Te as our first function and INTJ get their 'introversion' from Ni as theirs.
1	What are the ten commandments for all ENTJ’s?	Full disclosure: this was inspired by an ENTP post. Rather than being presumptuous and throwing down my own ten, I’d like to put it to you all great looking mofos out there to come to an agreement (through debate obviously) on what those ten are. 
6	What NT type do you feel you're least like?	Logic would say INTP, due to the nature of functions being inverse, also an introvert but the only other NT type that is a judger. ENTP however is a dominant perceiver, maybe those with better developed Ni find more similarities?\n\nDo you see yourself in INTJ or ENTP shoes sometimes? I would think that INTPs are going to be the most distant because of how detail oriented they are, and how they can spend a lot of time on a single thing, where the ENTJs would probably get frustrated with it.
15	I think I am least like the cuNT type. 
2	Intp because of the relaxed attitude 
2	Time management / To-do lists	If any, what App(s) do you use for time management and/or managing your to-do lists?\n\nThank you
12	I use an ancient app know as a pen and paper
3	I use my planner. For me writing things makes a difference so I have a day timer style one 
2	"Tasks: Todo List, Task List, Reminder" and "Google Calendar." 
1	I schedule everything in my Outlook calendar.
1	I am beginning to use the native callendar app but I usually did it in my head. Honestly. But don’t ask r/ENtJ r/estj or r/istj will be much better than real entjs about this.
1	Flock.  It’s free and there’s an app for your phone and desktop.  There’s group chats, group sharing, the ability to assign tasks, etc etc.  Google “get Flock” and you’ll find it 👍
1	I use Trello for managing my TODO lists\n\nI use my gut and occasionally watch for time management.
0	Would the entj appreciate it	If I told him he was:\n\n as pretty as a rose, as gentle as a feather, as soft as the sound of rain, and as beautiful as a lullaby. \n\n\nOr would he’d think I’d gone soft?
11	No offence intended but I hope you're a really girly INFP head over heels or actually gay cos dude that's pretty damn gay.
5	I’m...not sure *anyone* would appreciate that, under any circumstance.
5	Ah, you must be an infp 😜 
4	I personally wouldn't. I dont like to be seen as most of those things. Instead say that you admire them or you look up to them 
3	id much prefer something physical\n\n&#x200B;\n\nanyone can whisper sweet nothings
2	I suppose it would depend on what part of the T-F spectrum he/she/it is on. 
1	He would not think you’ve gone soft, he probably already knows what you’re like. \n\nHe would also not appreciate it. At least not in the way you want him to.\n\nYou know he has a soft side, but that line needs to be translated into “T” if you want it to reach the squishy parts. 
15	What do you think of INFPs?	Do you interact differently with healthy and unhealthy ones?
16	They're indecisiveness and tendency to make decisions on emotion is a little annoying. They are the best people to have around when upset.
9	My best friend since childhood is an INFP and we love each other to this day. We always make each other laugh, and we're always there for each other.\n\nThe worst romantic relationship I ever had was with an INFP. She scarred me for life and made me more cautious and less trusting of human beings in general.\n\nResults may vary.
7	Weak, insecure, artsy, jealous, sweet, fake, up for my weird ideas. Sorry for all the negativity, my closest INFP is just treating me like shit lately. I dont dislike most of them.
4	Married to one. He's rad. We're both pretty healthy within our MBTI types. We're really good for each other and a good balance in that he keeps me grounded and I keep him moving. We definitely clash on things, but most of the time it leads to a better understanding of ourselves once we solve it.
6	Love them. Their viewpoint of the world is mesmerizing and entertaining and it makes me have hope for humanity since I'm such a realist and reality is laden with pessimism.
3	Wow..is..that..how..you..feel..about..u..s.. awww x)
3	I love them 
6	Snowflakes
2	My SO is. Requires a decent amount of tuning and communication but the output is an exceptional understanding of each other and push to each other's goals. She makes me a better, happier and more balanced person. I give her momentum.
4	They are supposed to be the best match for us. I'd say they are one of them but for sure not the only type. I dated one and it was the longest relationship I had and we are still friends. They really seem to get entjs to a degree. Feel free to counter this but this is just my experience 
1	I believe the ENTJ-INFP match is famed as one of the best matches but as nice as it is to perhaps have a disney-level happy ever after, realistically that's quite unlikely so I'd much rather stick with the similar but more logical INTP
1	No not really I think I’d sack them if they were stupid. Haha! INFPs are fine so is ENFPs. I tend to not get on with ISFps and ESFPs.
3	Any of you ever played D&D?	Or any type of role-playing game? Or is it too slow paced and time consuming to get into?\n\nIf you have, what sort of character, alignment, campaign, etc did you play? Or were you the DM? I can only imagine how frustrating trying to wrangle and keep players on track would be for an ENTJ...
1	rolls for initiative. 1... Damn dice overlords!\n\nSo yes, a whole lot. [roll20.net](https://roll20.net) is your friend!
1	I do play quite a lot of D&D. Really early when I got into it I gravitated towards being the DM, which I found to be the best way to enjoy the game.\n\n Since the prep requires a lot of work, being able to keep your notes consistent and organized is basically a must, so we tend to do pretty well. Aside from that, the best part is that the game can be whatever you and your players want, so all comes down to how your group decides to play it.\n\nIf you want to start playing, I'd recommend you to look for a group of people who you work well with and a oneshot adventure (like The Wolves of Welton). These usually take 3-4 hours to complete and are quite a nice introduction to the game.
6	How do ENTJs learn to jump into conversations?	Hi guys I’m ENTJ and one thing I have realized is that I seriously have trouble talking to people unless they talk to me first especially women. Now that doesn’t mean that I don’t know how to talk to women, whenever women come up to talk to me it almost makes me improvise and I instantly lose the pressure I felt if I had to walk up and start the conversation. \n\nThe feeling in a different perspective is when someone comes to talk to me it’s in my home court, like I have the upper hand and I’m able to have a clear mind and have a great conversation. Whenever I try to do it I always fuck up socially, such as say the wrong things, doing something stupid that makes me cringe inside, stuff like that. I just want to know if anyone else has an idea how to throw an ice breaker that will make you feel like any situation can be your home court. \n\nI’m extremely charismatic I’m in school for business management and minoring in communications. I’ve gotten feedback as a natural leader and public speaker but interpersonal communication kills me sometimes.  
4	First listen! Listen what is the conversation about. Where is it heading? How are the participants feeling? Is somebody about to say something? Watch your thoughts and mind. Are there any good associations in your mind? Offer one. Look at the reaction. If it spurs something, go on. If not then listen more.
3	Think about those days in high school where you’d play 20 questions with girls over text. Or, when you’re trying to get to know others more. Once the conversation turns to something you care about, forget the game. I can honestly say I’ve experienced what you’re going through when I was in college, but I learned a really funny thing that’s broken the ice for me with the many attractive women I’ve been with: \n\n(1) Like some of the commenters have said, listen to the conversation. \n\n(2) When you hear an idea, concept, subject, topic, etc. in the conversation that has a lot of meat on the bone for you to chew off, ask the person who said it why they said it (if you don’t know anything about the topic, you ask what is that if you can tie it to something else you know about). \n\n(3) Incorporate others into your challenge by keeping your body open to them, look at some of the others and gauge their body language and facial queues. Of course keeping your eyes on the speaker. \n\n(4) If the speaker isn’t the girl you want, ask her now whether or not she agrees, or simply break the link and ask her what she knows about the subject if it’s not a discussion with any clear sides of debate\n\n(5) I should add that I’ve always had a ton of confidence with women because I’ve always been able to talk about anything. Knowing as much as I do about many things has made it comfortable for me to discuss whatever she may have to say. So remember to put your best foot forward, no fear of failure. My tip for topic for you all here is get the conversation onto a show or movie that everyone can say they like or love. Never fails. \n\nThe art of this is recognizing what’s the most interesting topic of discussion for the person you want to converse with. If you don’t practice, you’ll never learn. Find others you are comfortable with and note how you talk with them. Listen to the girls you want to talk to, acknowledge their communication style, and then replicate it only so far as to make an entrance, but after that, you’re all you. Don’t be something you’re not. 
3	It’s your inherent test of their loyalty and submissiveness to you.  Women coming to you.  \n\nPlus you like gaming them.  Falling for you without you having to do anything.  It’s more gratifying.\n\nIt could just be me though. 
2	Mindset is everything. This will sound cheesy, but having the correct mindset will give you superpowers.\nIf you are chilled out and just want to have a great time and enjoy, you’ll have it. If you want to just do nothing specially and just have good time, you’ll have it; just don’t get stucked in your mind, and try to trust your intuition and instincts. We ENTJ’s are intuitives, but we lack to trust them. \nYou won’t make this instantly, it’ll take practice and some time to get confidence in your “gut instincts”.\nI know you’re interesting, attractive, intelligent and someone worthy to talk with; also believe this; believing this, you’ll be a supernova socially.\nAlso, don’t be fooled and rushed to get friends, they’ll come eventually if you keep your path, you’ll find interesting people; don’t go away of your path because of someone.
1	Go into the conversation thinking what value you’re providing and what you’re contributing to THEM. Why they would want to listen to what you have to say.\n\nFor me it helps take my mind off any potential insecurities I have about myself if i’m focused on the value I’m giving instead.\n\nAlso, and it can’t be reiterated more, LISTEN TO LISTEN. Be a master at listening, and you’ll be surprised how easy carrying a conversation becomes.\n
1	I'm a woman, but I tend to be the same way with everyone. I think there are a few reasons for this:First, in the culture where I live I'm naturally a little more charismatic than people are used to, and I tend to get really excited about things that interest me. Because of this I've learned to just not talk unless someone initiates conversation with me and seems like they're willing to keep going.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSecond, even if someone initiates once I really get into the conversation I can forget my surroundings and end up unintentionally offending someone. I tend to speak a lot in generalities and then, if need me, I can use laser precision when a topic needs laser precision. These two extremes can put people off and are another reason I tend to just not talk.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThird: The only person I ever wanted completely in my world and let in for the most part was an ex-boyfriend. I was dedicated to him completely, but he eventually left me for reasons that were not at all clear. When it comes to the opposite sex I have a difficult time trusting them because of this combined with the fact that my parents were not trust worthy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFourth: I was highly involved in the arts in high school and through college and beyond. All of that helped me develop an active and rather bizarre imagination. I also tend to be labeled as an intellectual even if I don't try to be. Usually I'll get excited about something and the nerdiness will start to seep out and people don't generally know what to do, and because I can entertain myself readily with what happens in my head people end up confused about what is actually going on. When someone makes me comfortable enough to start talking and let this side of me seep out is when I tend to end up in trouble for accidentally offending someone (see point second).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFifth: I'm not static--I can very much think very quickly on my feet and while I hold my opinions extremely strongly, they do tend to change quickly if new information shows up that proves a prior opinion to be wrong. When this happens it's usually because a very large and fast influx of data has occurred that forces me to reconsider a prior position quickly and logically in order to avoid a cognitive dissonance. My ex boyfriend saw this happen once and his response was that I didn't know how to think for myself--in reality, I'd had so much information coming in so fast that I made a very quick, logical decision that didn't make sense to him (he was a more slow, methodical mover and thinker).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSixth: On a side note, I'm completely disinterested in stupidity. If I sense that someone is going to be a complete airhead I don't have any desire to jump into a conversation with him or her. Of course, I can be a little more idealistic than I should be, and there have been times when I've ignored my gut feeling and engaged someone I knew would be an airhead and regretted it later.
1	I learn faster by trying to do whatever I’m learning. How do you learn?
1	The power of the question. You can win more friends in 2 minutes by listening than you can in 2 years trying to get people interested in you. I rely on ‘what’s been keeping you busy?’ for business function networking with strangers and for personal functions, the question in my back pocket at all times is ‘what is good with you right now?’. Keeps you from fumbling over words, stays in command and works for me.

10	Stig Pryds is a Danish record holding freediver. He was diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis in 2008, which disabled him so much that he lost his business. After 5 years of intense pain and increasing dependency on drugs, he decided to quit all drugs cold turkey, and find alternative ways to deal with his disease. He began practising yoga daily, changed his diet, and started practising freediving. This caused drastic changes: within months he could walk without a cane, and he could play with his two young daughters again.\nIt also taught him how good he actually was at freediving; within a year he started setting Danish records. He started traveling the world going to freediving competitions, where the warm weather and sun also improved his condition. He used his increased exposure from the Danish records to tell the story of his recovery and inspire people to live a healthy lifestyle. He started teaching others how to deal with auto-immune disorders.\nThe downside of his new fame was that the insurance company, who paid his monthly disability check, noticed that he was doing things a healthy person does. Despite the argument that he's only healthy because he can do these travels and trainings, the insurance company threatened to sue him for lying -he'd have to pay back all the disability checks plus a fee. With the help from his doctors Stig managed to convince them his disease is real, just that he manages it well, but the insurance company decided to stop paying him his disability. The stress this whole procedure caused was enormous and Stig relapsed into severe pain.\nWe shot this video in January, the hardest month for Stig, where he had to figure out how to proceed. We talked about how life can keep dealing you blow after blow, and how you know that you'll be ok anyway. But it still sucks that you have to deal with the blows, and have to go through that uncertainty of what comes next. Stig has decided to focus on his new breathing program, in which he teaches people how to breathe properly to deal with stress and disease, together with yoga and diet. He might not be able to compete much this year, but he's getting back up and doing his best to be of use to others. Find out more about Stig here:\nhttps://www.stigpryds.com/

8	ENFP Interviewing ENTJ Alan M. Te-Se PC/S(B) MM	
12	What would you do?	You are at war. Deciphering an intercepted code, you learn two things about your enemy. A single spot in their defense will be at its weakest in ten days, and they will attack one of your cities in five days. What do you do with this information? What is the most efficient course of action?
9	Spread a rumor online that they are racist.
3	Pretend like you were caught off guard during the attack in 5 days. But try to keep the amount of casualties to a minimum without drawing attention. This will lead the enemy into a false sense of security. They’ll believe they’re winning and that our forces are not organized. This situation optimizes the chances of success for a hidden attack.\n\nBasic lose the battle win the war technique \n\nThen plan a strategic hidden infiltration for the ten day mark when their defence is at its weakest. The hidden team will burn the women and children alive in their sleep, and then capture important people to torture for information. \n\nHey, don’t judge me. All is fair in love and war.\n\nI’m not even an ENTJ.... or am I...
2	Set an ambush in the city to weaken their forces in that area. Fake an attack a day later in that area to draw more forces into the area. Then on day 10 the weakness will be even greater
2	Fend off the attack, feign a counter attack in one of their strong spots with a token force, then throw all my forces at the weak spot after.\n\nPlace out scouts ahead of the attack on your city to excuse the "knowing".
1	Attack full force in 5 days.  However attack style would be defensive until the 10th day, then switch to an offensive attack style once the weakness can be exploited.
1	Conduct a plan of battle that causes them to overextend and commit more of their forces during their attack. Completely annihilate their forces. \n\nOn the 6th day, roll into their territory unopposed. Crush the enemy, see them driven before me and hear the lamentations of their women! 
1	Evacuate the city & leave a small troop with plenty of alcohol and drugs. Hang back/hide and when their army is sufficiently drunk and stoned, attack. If they take it back & don't consume it right away, all the better- Ive likely provided enough to keep them inebriated for 5 more days to further exploit their upcoming weakness. \n\nIn addition, on that small troop left in the city is a false order that these items were intended for the observance of a holiday, the troops all have been ordered to a specific camp for observance of the holiday (hence the currently evacuated city), and they were to bring the remaining alcohol and drugs to the camp for the holiday in 5 days. Naturally, it's an utter ploy- the enemy will hopefully jump at the chance to attack, especially if it looks like my army will be intoxicated. Once confirmed they're moving into the trap, my full army will be able exploit their weakness unhindered. The "holiday" camp happens to be rigged with enough explosives to easily wipe out the vast majority of their invading troops. \n\n
1	I absolutely love that this is posted in the ENTJ reddit. <3\n\nNo time period is specified so for my strategy I'm going to choose Sengoku Era Japan and put on my Oda Nobunaga cap. \n\nI'd evacuate the city as quietly as possible the evening before and send the people into either the mountains (if any around) or forests. I'd have some men in the army dress up as peasants and have them carefully hide their weapons in key areas to have on hand for when the attack comes.\n\nStation archers in upper floors of buildings with heavier concentration in areas where the enemy is likely to enter through. Infantry in lower floors and have everyone hide in order to ambush the ambushers. \n\nCavalry and second wave of infantry will hide in forest outskirts to wait for a signal some time after the battle has started to rush the town.\n\nDepending on how it goes, I'll decide about their weak defense spot afterwards.
1	I wish I could give you an accurate answer, but there are so many unknown variables here. Positioning, likelihoods of success and risks, potential to tip them off by engaging in defensive action, etc. etc. If I don't know what's on the board it's hard to tell you where to make the next move.
1	Other types are better at war strategies xstj and xntp xstjs war generals are very common.\n\nBut as to me.\n\nBuild up defenses guard the cities put up intercepters. Such stuff. Try to warn or smooth it over. But plan a counter strike and find the current weakness and strike first.
0	I'd unleash a [killer joke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVQKRqJbOTo) on their asses.
15	What kind of man are ENTJ women's looking for?	This post is referring about romantic relationships ofc\n\nSo what would be "ideal" man for you? Describe him
44	Healthy individuals with their shit together. A lot rarer than it should be.
29	Masculine, not insecure, challenges me, ambitious, and smart. 
7	In terms of MBTI types, I’m most drawn to ENTP, followed by INTP and INTJ guys. Wouldn’t mind a healthy & mature INFJ either.\n\nI value maturity, understanding, intelligence, humour and drive in a man. Also I have a thing for guys who can really make me laugh. Bonus if he comes with a special talent (eg, music).
8	Can a male and female ENTJ combine forces to create a ENTJ relationship super structure? Or would they fight each other 
5	Intelligent, funny, resourceful, self-improving, financially responsible, independent, with a warm and generous heart. I already found him, but had to kiss a lot of frogs along the way.
7	Someone who can keep up with us, support us without getting in our way, and also stand up to us when needed. I was single for a long time because I would get bored too easily or was too busy to try and meet someone and settle down. I've been with an ISTJ for 2 years now.
4	As others have said someone who has his shit together and can call me out on my BS but without a toxic masculinity complex. 
8	My ideal man is basically me but kinder and gentler. For mbti types, I tend to be romantically drawn to INFPs, INTPs, ISTPs, INFJs, and INTJs. \n\nI tend to have flings with ESTP guys too. 
7	INTP worked the best for me. Soulmate material! 
3	Mentally healthy individuals, physically active, ambitious, traveler, no toxic masculinity and STEM-ish intelligent. 
6	ENTP
4	It's supposed to be 'What kind of men are ENTJ women looking for?'.
1	We need to hear from people who have tried. I fight more with ISTP than with ENTJ or INTJ’s I have dated. INTPs cheated on me. INTJs whom I know, ghost 👻 people they date regardless of the other person’s type.
1	Someone I actually trust.
1	My best dating experience was with an INFJ.  \n\n\nThe imagination and sense of humor were up the same alley. He had the backbone to stand up and hold his ground when it was necessary and I respected that. The difficulty is that both of us were equally hard headed about the same types of things so if we disagreed on any of those key issues it was extremely strenuous on us both because we didn't like to compromise in some areas. I tended to be more intellectually flexible than he was, and he tended to be more emotionally flexible. Some how I tended to be more perceptive than he was, and that caused some issues at times, but honestly I would date another INFJ without question. 
2	Edited: Nevermind. My detailed answer is gone. All I did was answer the question - I did not explain WHY certain things were important to me because I don't have enough time, I thought my answer was already thorough, and I had answered the question. 
1	ENFP
3	Will the truth set you free or will lies pave your path?	I met an acquaintance of mine a couple of years ago who works as a biochemist. Soon after I met them I found their story to be filled with holes. I visited the university they graduated from and there was no record of them. I questioned them and turns out most of the story is false and they gained their job lying on their resume and having no other education besides a high school degree. \n\nWhat do you think as ENTJs/other?\n\nIs the truth always better or is the lie just too convenient? \n\nWould/have you lied to promote yourself to new heights?
3	What is lie?\n\nSome Jews pretended not to be Jews long time ago. It worked out for some of them.\n\nSomething Something staying alive stayin alive\n
4	No, be honest.\nThere is strength in honesty.
1	As with everything, it depends. And as an ENTJ, this type of thread bothers me because it's impossible for me to pass judgement without all of the information, and I pride myself on my ability and desire to come to calculated conclusions. \n\n*In general,* leading an honest life is one of the best ways of ensuring long-term fulfilment as it eliminates one source of anxiety that many people feel on a daily basis. The anxiety that comes from even white lies can subtly hamstring our ability to perform, learn, and grow. \n\nOn the other hand, your description of your acquaintance puzzles me because biochemistry seems like one field in which a person without relevant experience would get outed as a fraud pretty damn quickly. I doubt AP Bio and AP Chemistry are sufficient to jumpstart a career in biochem, so the cynical part of me is wondering if you left out critical information because you want us to blindly support a moral stance you have clearly already taken (lying = bad). If that's true, you are asking for support from the wrooooong type.
1	Truth is very important. If you have any ethics you will tell the truth. Healthy ENTJs don’t need to lie. And I would have to proove beyond a doubt that they actually didn’t go to a college and then I’d report them. But otherwise it’s not really that great. I’d likely not even investigate. Honestly It’s not my business.
0	Lying is generally reserved for shitty people. 
2	ENTJ or ENFJ?	I’m confused if I’m ENTJ or ENFJ.\nI don’t know if it’s my confidence that makes me rational, I’m faking it or I’m actually a thinker.\nI feel I’m emotional a lot, but I keep it for myself, I don’t show it; though when I get to my top emotionally I explode.\nHow do I know if I’m a Feeler or a Thinker?
2	How much do you absorb someone’s emotion. Every fe user I know have this huge heart especially nfjs.
1	Try carefully reading through socionics profiles and seeing which ones you identify with. These are more detailed than MBTI ones which makes it easier to figure out your type.    \n[ENFJ by Gulenko](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=EIE_Profile_by_Gulenko) | [ENFJ by Stratiyevskaya](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/42485) | [ENFJ subtypes](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/4845-ENFj-EIE-Subtypes?p=103981&viewfull=1#post103981)    \n[ENTJ by Gulenko](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=LIE_Profile_by_Gulenko) | [ENTJ by Stratiyevskaya](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/42486) | [ENTJ subtypes](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/46746-LIE-ENTj-subtypes?p=138234&viewfull=1#post138234)    \n
-2	It is actually rather easy.\nEspecially on a young age, this two types tend to mainly base their identity on their primary functions: Te for ENTJ and Fe for ENFJ.\nNow this mean that this two types, as similar as they can appear through their confidence, charisma and desire to distinguish from the mass, still show particularly easy to spot differences. Just to cite the most important one, Why do you want to be in charge? Because you want to help others or for personal gains and to establish your will?\nAnd, last but not least, I think the easiest thing is a lack of remorse. I, as an ENTJ, am extremely unscrupulous and almost never feel even in the slightest remorse. It is just not possible for me to behave in that way. Now, I’m particularly extreme on that issue, even for ENTJ’s standards, and you most likely aren’t that unscrupulous. But really, if you are an ENTJ or ENFJ it mostly depends on how you feel remorse. Not how you show it, just how you feel it, inside, when no one is looking
27	Lonely extrovert	I find myself sometimes traveling to a place of sad loneliness. I love going out and have plenty of awesome friends who love partying with me, but no one ever wants to just hang. No one ever wants to jut go grab breakfast or watch tv or a movie. No guys want to be around me except for sex. I see my friends hanging out without me and only hitting me up on party nights. I can tell they like being around me.. or do they? But why would we hang out if they didn’t? What about me tell people I’m just here for the party. Am I not love able? I’ll ask them to go shopping, hang, study, ect but they’re always busy or something else. I guess this is where I lack in social skills. It makes me feel like there is something wrong with me and that I’ll be alone. Anyone else feel this way? Have any tips? 
16	You don't have real friends. They will disappear at the first sign that you need help.\n\nCut your loses, invest in real relationships.\n\nDon't waste as much of your time on parties.\n\nMeet actual non-zombies.\n
7	OP - please reach out to a counselor. It’s great to reach out for information here, but there are likely other things creating negative pressures in your life that are manifesting in your relationships. \n\nI too have been in this boat, and it’s very refreshing to sit down and talk with someone that can give a different perspective on things. \n\nI checked your post history, and there are  four free sessions available at your school’s Center for Counseling. \n\nAs a fellow ENTJ - I’ve found that inactivity makes my mind wander and can go into some dark areas. It’s best to stay active in things that interest you. Finding people you associate with in these hobbies or groups are great places to diversify your time investments and find some entertainment. It will get your mind out of the dark because you will be distracted from those feelings the more you’re involved. \n\nIf I could go back to my early twenties. I would tell myself these same things. Because I was in a very similar place :)
4	As another has said, you're still young. There are no magic words I can say that will make you feel better, but know this: this is life. It's very hard for us ENTJs to establish friendships because we're different, rougher than most even among introverts. Consider your friendships carefully, and distance yourself from people that don't see your worth. I imagine it's a lot harder for female ENTJs since sexism is involved but there are worthy people out there that will see your own worth.
4	I resonate with this and actually needed to hear the advice from the comments. My background is a bit different but nevertheless I've struggled with loneliness and friends who aren't loyal. Actually, this is a poem I wrote a while ago that you might like. I hope you realize that you aren't the only one that feels this way and it's not just because 'every man is his own island' but you have a particular desire for loyalty and you search for it. Stay genuine. \n\nThey want the laughter\n\nSo they keep you close\n\nBut when you call they never answer\n\n\nYou make them dance\n\nAnd you make them smile\n\nBut when your smile falters they wonder if you are worth the while\n\n\nWhy, you died trying\n\nWhy, you tried dying\n\n\nDid they notice, you were around\n\nThey didn't notice, you weren't around\n\n\nBut I'll notice when you're around\n\nI'll notice when you aren't around
2	1.)Read 'how to win friends and influence people'\n\n2.) relalise, so-called friends dont like You, but how you make them feel (if you can make people feel good)\n\n3.) stop getting emotionaly ripped of, because you know the truth\n\n4.) take it more easy, apply principles, notice how friendships work better and eventually make hella new ones\n\nI'm a man but was at this point 2 / I really hit rock bottom and needed to build myself up again.\nYou know how many friends where there? Like one. And I appreciated that experience.\n\nIf you lucky, you can really just only relly on family, if hatred is involved, only solution is to talk with psychiatrist or church servants about your problem.\n\nIts a djungle, metaphoricall speaking\nI saw kill your friends last week and smirked at last saying:\n"success is gangbang, while failure is a lonely rapeist in the backwoods" lol\nBe the success in this cold world and if its just about being happy n positive, people will come to you like insects fly to light :)\nLet them feel good and you have alot friends soon, but never depend on them\nRather invest in relationships, education, buisness, self development or helping really needy people - not some exploitive, maybe party or alcohol addicted selfabsorbed friends\n\nYou can really do it
2	I think it’s tough sometimes to be an ENTJ we are capable of so much. We can form the deepest connections and most meaningful bonds! Some people don’t seem to need or want that and it’s discouraging
1	[deleted]
1	Wow. I really relate to this... I’m not feeling great now 
1	You will find better friends in the future.
1	Get an INFP boyfriend
5	Alone Time	Greetings!\n\nDo you see yourself enjoying your private time, why? 
2	Yes. I usually have something to do.
1	Why not?
1	Absolutely. Alone time for myself is growth time. Either for my own work, my hobbies, or personal self care. 
1	Some is good. Not a lot, If you enjoy a lot you’re probably INTJ. If I have too much I go crazy and I have to use social media a lot and lots of fun and music around here.
3	ENTJs opinion on INTP?	I’m fascinated by entjs and really curious to know what entjs think of intps. \n
5	Boring. Moves too little and too slow. Overthink like INTJs, slightly funnier than the latter though. Hard to manage/direct, though if they commit they are good. Very good for crunching complex matters.
3	They seem to swing between being very dreamy and detached to acting super manic when they are excited. I can tolerate INTPs at work (as long as they're not my boss) but don't bond well with them in my personal life. \n\nMaybe if I met one who was good at communicating like "hey let me think about that for a second" instead of just staring into the abyss.
4	I only know one intp, and i get along with him really well. Too bad hes a dood tho instead of a cutie girl. No homo.
2	I’m in favor. 
1	I dislike INTPs in general. There are exceptions but most of you annoy me. Nothing personal. 
1	They avoid me like the plague doubled down on them. I have no idea. Haha! I think I’d be able to tolerate though but yeah. Don’t know how close. 
18	I'm seeing so many parallels between ENTJ and ISTP personalities	Maybe I am confusing INTP with ISTP but my understanding is:\n\nENTJ: Te Ni-Se Fi\nISTP: Ti Se-Ni Fe\n\nThe problem is that while I understand that Ti is categorical building logic and Te is process-oriented goal structuring... I still see this fail in real life to accurately type people.\n\nBecause in real life I see ISTPs who are goal oriented. And ENTJs who like to gather knowledge and understand things. Or at least, **I can't tell which they are**.\n\nThis is amplified if the person might be looping or if their tertiary function is as developed as their secondary function (which is pretty common).\n\nSo then I resort to really shallow ways of telling ENTJs and ISTPs apart. Like their "vibe". How "physical" or "academic" they are. All of which doesn't do me any favors in acurately typing an individual.\n\nAny advice on this? Again, I know the difference in Te and Ti in theory not in practice. And I can't spot the grip 4th function most of the time so please don't make that your argument if you can help it. Thanks
7	Genuinely just interested in the topic and seeing other comments.  *bump*\n\nI am an ENTJ with an ISTP S.O.  ama (kidding mostly)
8	I'm an ISTP who was just told I am an ENTJ. See post in r/ENTJ titled "Second opinion, if you would?" My type me post with a full description is also linked in that post.\n\nHere are a few of the differences I've noticed while I looked into this.\n\n- We both like challenges, but you guys seem to like more long term challenges, like growing a company. I like to deal with short term challenges, like can I find the answer to this question in front of me or can I fix this item I'm holding.\n\n- If I set goals, they're also usually short term. The future doesn't really exist to me. It's too abstract. I can't set a five year goal. I don't know who I'm going to be in five years, or where I'm going to be, or what opportunities are going to present themselves in the next five years that I haven't even thought of yet. \n\n- My middle name is procrastination. You guys seem to like planning and scheduling and driving forward and winning. I like winning too, but in a different way. I like winning things that are right in front of me, like solving a puzzle, fixing something, walking to the other side of the hot coal pathway. From what I've been reading, you guys seemed to like to win in more long term ways, like securing an account you've been working on all year or working all semester to get straight As (generalizing, of course). I'll get bored with that.\n\n- Also, I saw a lot of mentions of ENTJs and team building. Working on a team gives me hives. I don't want to collaborate. Tell me what you need, when you need it, and then leave me alone to do it.\n\nAMA.\n
3	A stark difference I feel is if there is any procrastination habits between the 2 types if at all should be by one of the two types and not so much the other.\n\nI never cared for putting things off until the last minute.. personally.
3	Te is focused on broad understanding and intillectual leverage. "Yes thats good and all that youve distinguished what this is but WHAT DOES IT DO?!" Is Te chiming in. Se is more of a "YEAH YEAH JUST DO IT". The problem comes from seperating thinking functions from another axis. Te is primarily utilization of world knowledge and using that knowledge as a tool. And if your going to use a tool you want it to be accurate right? And thats where Te trusts other Ti users. Ti wants to know the structure of the object and be intimate with it, a Ti user will with out a doubt know the object better than a Te user, but the Te user will be on how that object applies to the REAL world like white on rice. 
2	yes istp and entj are the most driven intellectuals afaik. enneagram 8 ish. the others are rather flimsy with their vision  
2	Just look to their sense of aesthetics and the differences should be apparent.
1	A dead give away is how much they talk to say the same things.
1	Te is A LOT more terse and forceful.\n\nYes, Ti in combination with Se can also appear "direct", but it's not nearly as forceful as a type that \*leads\* with Te.\n\nISTPs are usually quite calm, independent and great at tinkering/building/empirical fields like science or mathematics. ENTJs can be quite fiery, frustrated and are also extremely detail oriented and empirical but their Te lends itself to management, direction and strategy over independent tinkering and discoveries. They have more of an itch to organise the external world, thanks to Te.\n\nAlso, a small note, but an entj will correct you for factual inconsistencies, before a Ti user will correct you for logical inconsistencies. Meaning, A Ti-user has their own system of logic that may or may not be factual (as per Jung's Ti definition). A Te user tends to have a very broad but also detailed framework for facts, efficiency, pragmatism and so on. A Te user will apply that to all information \*forcefully\* whereas a Ti user must check information against it's own system of logic and is more investigative than 'forceful' in it's application. It might be a bit more 'open' to considering a thing/information, if it can manipulate, and "draw something" out of that thing. For example, a new theory, process, or a new innovative approach might arrise from their investigation. The "new theory" thing is more intp, whereas I think istps are great with new processes ime, as they really understand systems and parts very well.
1	You fail because you're considering only half of the functions, imho.\n\n> The problem is that while I understand that Ti is categorical building logic and Te is process-oriented goal structuring... I still see this fail in real life to accurately type people.\n\nWell, for one, if you're strong at Te, you're strong at Ti too, and vice versa. It's really a matter of preferences. So it's perfectly normal to see one aspect in another\n\nFor two, thoses aren't really accurate definitions. \n\n> This is amplified if the person might be looping\n\nLooping actually isn't really a thing, imho\n\n> if their tertiary function is as developed as their secondary function (which is pretty common).\n\nEh, not really...\n\n> How "physical" or "academic" they are.\n\nNeitheir are very academic, tho. As for physical, I would say neitheir are ? Say, the ISTP are very natural in that domain, and tbh, ENTJs come off as try hard to me Se wise...\n\n> Any advice on this? \n\nConsider the whole type, so with the shadow functions. That would be researching socionics, imho. You also should probably update your definitions of the functions too, yours aren't wrong per se, but too vague, imho. \n\nI can give you a description of both types using socionics concepts if you want. \n\n\n\n\n
20	Is it Normal for ENTJ having loads of anxiety & Stress?	Honestly have been working my ass off in school, catching up with anything I missed or didn't do. My stress and anxiety went up and that's when I get emotional breakdowns couple of times. :/\nI found out I was really tired when I almost fall asleep so quick just for closing my eyes for 15 seconds.
8	Wow this is literally describing my life at the moment. For me, I am constantly plagued by stress because I have a huge far of failure and an internal desire to be the best at everything I do which often results in overworking, loads of stress, and the inevitable mental breakdown. I mean on Sunday I pulled an all-nighter, went to bed at 5:00pm Monday night, and woke up at 3:00am this morning. I honestly wish I had something useful to say, but this is something that I'm still trying to fight, so good luck!!
7	I deal with work stress just fine. I do NOT deal with personal stress well at all. Illness, relationship problems, etc...it can not only get ugly for me, it spins me right into anxiety and panic. 
6	We often try too hard for things and want to be good in lot of things. \nI would recommend Coursera course "The science of well being " to get the anxiety down. \nhttps://www.coursera.org/learn/the-science-of-well-being
5	Yes! My way of dealing with it is to run every other morning. Exercise will alleviate a lot of that stress through the endorphins. You’d have to set time aside for it, but it will require you to study or work smarter, instead of harder or for longer. \n\nI realize that Se activities do get us out of our heads, and, exercise being one of them, if that doesn’t work, you’ll need to impose a “that’s it i’m shutting off my brain for “x” hours” lockout of any and all work. Come back to it fresh and you’ll be so ready to handle what you took a break from, the stress won’t even cross your mind 
5	My wife says being able to sleep anytime, anywhere ten seconds after closing my  eyes is my superpower.  \n\n@teddybearcommander mentioned exercise. That is key.\n\nBut I had a co-worker once that noticed how stressed I was getting and what he told me stuck with me and I've repeated it like mantra in times of stress ever since.\n\n"You are only human.  You can only do what you can do."\n\nSeems silly and simple but it's a good reminder.  So much of our perceived stress level we directly build ourselves.  Don't expect more than what a human can do, because that is what you are. I've found that at most of those times the 'must dos' and deadlines are not all that critical.  No one's going to die.  Just do what you can do.
5	At least you can fall asleep quickly! I find that my mind races non-stop and I wake up in a panic over things and then over-analyze them. \n\nTo answer your question, I would say yes. When things get to be too much, I get overworked and my emotions are all over the place. I hate it! I have learned that it's important to take some you time. Stay home and do whatever you want that is "mindless" and that you enjoy. Even a few hours can reset your mind. 
5	You guys overwork yourself so much you could burn out and barely notice you're not fine.\n\nYES, it's normal. You may be overachievers, but you're still human and eventually, too much is too much. \n\nMake sure you get enough sleep, have an outlet for your frustrations (I hear ENTJs do very well with the gym as an outlet), and see some people so you don't turn on yourself.   \nI'd recommend finding an xNFx type friend that you trust, we're good at seeing through that veneer of "everything is fine" and dialing our reactions to accommodate your needs, whether that's going along with something mindless and distracting, kicking you into resting when you haven't done anything but work for weeks, or taking the emotional breakdown in stride and helping you get back on your feet if it happens. 
5	I know a handful of very successful entjs (CEOs and C Level) and they definitely get stressed, but they let off steam by partying, staying off social media on weekends, and socialising. Basically a lot of Se type activities that get them out of their heads.  
2	Know your limits. Plan better for the next semester.
4	Yep for sure, you just need to find some balance (have some fun)
2	MBTI Types of people close to you?	What are the MBTI Types of your family and friends?\n
3	Friend of a lifetime: ESFP (don't ask how we became friends, I was honestly surprised too)\nBest roommate and friend: ISTJ\nMom and dad: INTJ and ENTP\nBrother: INTP\nOther friends that I share my inner self with: ENFP, INTJ, INTP, etc\n
3	Dad: ENTJ \n\nMom: ISTJ\n\nSpouse: INTJ\n\nBros: ENFJ, INTJ, ENTP\n\nSis: ISFJ\n\nBFFs: ISFJ, INTJ, INFJ, ENTJ, ESFJ

Could be a personal thing, but I just don’t get along well with xNFP’s past a rather superficial level due to very differing approaches (dominant Fi/Fe) towards life in general.
2	Mom: ISTP\nAunt: ESFJ\nCousin: ENFJ\n\nFriend#1, 2, 3: INTJ, INFJ, ENTP\nWife: INFJ.\n\nI'm very drawn to N types.\n\nEDIT: Formatting on mobile is horrifying.

1	How does everyone know this? Do you just know all the types and how to indenting them or have them take the quiz?

3	Second opinion, if you would?	A number of hours ago, I wrote this type me post:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MbtiTypeMe/comments/axqeuw/test_too_easy_to_manipulate_please_help\n\nThe results came back ISTP and xSTP, which is pretty much what I figured. I had thought ISTP for a while, but wrote the post because I had a temporary doubt and wanted to see if there were any other possibilities I was missing.\n\nWell, considering I can't actually remember the last time I set a goal, you can imagine how surprised I was when I got a message detailing how I'm an ENTJ. But I wrote the post to see if anyone could point out information I overlooked, so I'm willing to explore the possibility. So far, the only things I've noticed that we have in common are we both like music and a challenge. You guys seem to like more long term challenges though, I think? Like getting a business to succeed, for example.\n\nAnyway, I was hoping if you had a spare few minutes you could look at my type me post and see if any of it resonated with any of you. I don't see it, but I'm cool with being wrong.\n\nMuch appreciated.
3	INTP or ISTP.  I liked your other post.  But more ISTP to me, you really like honing into a craft but you’re somewhat of a loner with some badass in you. 
1	intp > istp > entp > entj. thats the progression depending on the certainy / agency you have by defining your values   \ntests fuck up easily though, and its all contextual. u can identify will all 3, i do (entp doesnt much fit)
17	Name Your Favorite Fictional ENTJ In Media	It could be from a show, movie, game, book, whatever. \n\nMy favorite would be Yennefer of Vengerberg from the Witcher 3. I think she is arguably the most "accurate to real life" type of ENTJ. Where yeah, she's certainly rough around the edges, impatient, forthright, bossy, and driven - But is clearly shown to have a heart, and is extremely protective of those she cares about. The writer of the Witcher series stated (and I'm paraphrasing from memory because I can't find the original quote): "I intentionally wrote Yennefer to be the exact opposite of the "damsel in distress" trope, which is so common in fantasy stories."\n\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/DyqHaZ0VsAEoYbk.jpg\n\n\n(Spoilers for Bioshock ahead)\n\n\nMy runner up would be Andrew Ryan from Bioshock, which is actually an anagram of Ayn Rand. His character is that of an ENTJ, but exaggerated to the highest degree. While only present through half of the story, his philosophy and sense of presence lingers, leaving a lasting impact through the rest of the series. \n\nhttps://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-5CKPthx2DXg/XCoi83EZIqI/AAAAAAAAA_k/fkrDVt-mDVAsldIFhAQ4wSlq_xBewDHvgCJoC/w1392-h1392-n-rw/001

1	Clyde Shelton from Law Abiding Citizen is one that easily comes to mind since it's one of my favorite movies.\n\nAs I mentioned in another post, Ultron is also an obvious choice. But huh... I'm not sure if he's 8w7 or 7w8. I would say he seems more 7w8 but it might be my own bias honestly. "I had strings but now I'm free" can definitely be seen from both point of views. Not wanting to be controlled and wanting freedom. But there is a lot of critical aspect to his views on the world which is typically 7 because of the 1 disintegration. \n\n&#x200B;
11	Selling my business, need some ENTJ advice	I am seeing my ecommerce company that I built a year  ago due to running out of money and growing a passion for software dev at the same time. I only ever got to completing the website to accept pre-orders and buying the samples as well as finding the best manufacturers. \n\nI put it up for 2k and a few weeks later I have a businessman who is interested in purchasing it. The brand name is very strong and unique as well as the products and I now feel like I may be underselling? Am I really even if I haven’t made any sales yet but built the foundation with social media presence? It is a jewelry business and my plan was to focus on my new job as a dev and perhaps get back into biz/tech later on. \n\nAny advice would be appreciated!!! \n\n
6	Could you sell only a part of it?\n\nScalable businesses have a high upward potential.\n\n2k is like a joke. That's like 1 week of junior/mid programmer's time.\n\nWatch some Dan Lok before it is too late.\n
8	Tell him you have another investor who wants to invest 10K on a 50K valuation.\n\nAct like you're being honest.  "I saw that you were interested and reached out to a few  VC firms to test the market."\n\nThen ask him if he'd be interested in joining the investment pool.\n\nPin the imaginary investment deal against him and if you truly want to sell you can probably sell for 5 to 10X higher.\n\nBut it sounds like he may be interested in funding you, so why sell?  Tell him you would rather go with him and will accept a 5k on a 20K valuation, giving him 25% ownership and a backer who may infuse you with funds down the road.  Plus now that you have an investor you can poach other investors and use this valuation to gain more attention.  \n\nHope it works out.
2	There is a bit of a calculation to get the real value of your company. How much money is it going to do in the next year ? In the next five years ? In the ten next years ? You can't answer this question with certainty, but trying to get an answer is what investment banker are doing. You don't have to go into heavy calculation, but as a basis for selling, you have to consider the opportunity cost, i.e all the money you will not make by selling it.
2	It doesn’t sound like you’re upset about losing the business, so I wouldn’t put any money into it.  I would tell them that you had another offer for $30k, and go from there.  If you lose the sale, at least you know a better price for the next person.  Keep building it in your spare time until you sell.
2	If you have no experience in sales and its urgent, seek out for a good SALESMAN (friend! Not another lmao), ask him to negotiate with you the pitch\nRead about sales, techniques and if personal persuasion (influence)\nYou never have to close a deal.\nIf you think 2k is to low, lie the heck out of it (there was recently another buyer who offered xy but i like you personal blabla)\nGENERALLy for sellers, set your anchor (First price) HIGH  (buyers vice versa ofc)\nThe first number always is a fix primer, comforting our brain to the price\n....\n\n\nBut what do you provide is now more worth then when you estimated it first?\nYou should have a good answer for this, if not and you already lost interest... Sell\n2 quid is solid Money (yet not much in e-buiz, but did you found the new paypal? Facebook? Google? Be realistic /ask third party and dont solely trust your biased emotions (maybe your hourly wage gotten into building would be off like 5000h for 2000$ but...\n\nEveryone wants to buy the dip, all want to sell highest, but nobody has a magic glass pretending the future ;)\n\nIf you dont relly on the 2k, get another learning, take it as challenge to sell as high as possible, no remorse and see how far you can go! (its always further in both ways lol) 
3	Also well suited to /r/Entrepreneur if you haven't asked there already.
1	Personally I‘d suggest you to focus some more on the business, like half a year. See how it goes, if you‘re only making slow progress than no matter how much of a jewel it is it probably won‘t suddenly blossom. And then you can sell it. In that time add value to your business so even if you sell you sell it for a better price than before and get sth in return for your efforts. If you have a gut feeling that it is going to be much more successful, don‘t sell it off. You‘ll regret.

8	ENTJs which goal do you catch yourself thinking about the most?	When you’re dreaming, thinking, envisioning this one thing happening in your life, it’s like music playing and you’re at peace.  What is that one thing for you?   Very curious to know about that.  
27	This isn't a goal but more of a desire. I would love to spend a rainy Saturday in bed with my SO without any worries of work or having to actually get out of bed. Just the two us taking and laughing while the rain is pouring in the background. \nSince I am super single, that is honestly just a thought in my mind. However, I hope to do this one day. 
12	The day I close a big deal. Once I do that it will be a snowball effect. 
12	Having a stable and loving family with a big house, 4 kids, 2 dogs and land, for which I could provide by being the man of the house and bread winner.
9	I’m always doing something music related or dancing! Makes me super happy. \nBut also love dreaming about a nights sleep where I don’t wake up a few times with a new idea or thought relating to work the next day, lying in until the afternoon, drinking wine in the sunshine! I get to do that occasionally in real life and it’s bliss. Does anyone ever book themselves or their families a little weekend break ‘just because’ sometimes? (Planned in advance of course) x 
8	Financial Independence
5	Helping the environment.
6	The happy place I want to be in three years: have a job outside of Manhattan, owning a home, watching my wife garden and renovate, drive to work listening to classical music, having summer cookouts with my neighbors, learning how to fly an airplane, maybe even find a low key church to join (more for the social networking and community integration rather than a religious need).\n\nI'm 33 and it's the first time in my life that I want anything like that. A year ago I thought I was happy being a workaholic but I burned out. I finally realized that I am human after all, and that the silly little things that don't seem to have a purpose in my plans are the things that have caused my plans to derail (burning out so hard that I got put on medical leave for dysthymia). 
7	Getting a cat, not getting into debt and moving away from home. 
6	Paying off my student loans. It's pretty much top of mind everyday yet somehow I still manage to spend money on things that do not spark joy. 
4	Being satisfied with myself and always, always trying my best
5	For a while it was getting into my dream school. Literally ever second was spent in some capacity working towards that ultimate goal. Now that I’ve accomplished it, I’m sort of in this stagnant phase just envisioning how I need to operate during this next stage of life.
4	The overarching theme is simplifying and organizing my life. Moving to a place where just about everything is the way I want it to be (no I am not ready to buy a house) so that I can have maximum freedom and relaxation at home. Getting rid of possessions. Combing through my digital files and purging what I do not need, keeping that which I do.\n
3	Starting my own startup has been the goal for as long as I can remember. I’m right now on the verge of closing an angel deal with a big investor and making it a reality. I couldn’t be more excited.
3	being a source of positivity on society
2	Being a very powerful diplomat and running various campaigns from my second home in south of France. And of course being married and submissive to my future husband. Gotta balance out the masculine and feminine energy ;)
2	Getting super fit and hot. \n\nI’m turning 30 this month and I’m 5’5 125 pounds. \nMy goal weight is a toned 115. \n\nGoing to the gym and working out is an obsession right now. \n
2	No. Every corporation in every industry has huge emissions. I’m in healthcare 
2	For me it’s personal success, all I think of is running my own successful company that gets me out of bed every morning. I have started two ventures and both failed, always thinking about what will be the next one and how to make it the successful one 
2	Social power and my political work. 
10	ENTJ Counselors, Therapists, Psychologists & Psychiatrists	It's a career path that many people don't often attach to ENTJs.\n\nI think we can be really amazing at it (as with any type and any career), particularly if it's something that aligns with our Fi values.\n\n*Are there any ENTJs on these career paths* that want to share their story? What were your challenges? What motivated you to go down this path? In hindsight, what would you have done differently? Any regrets? Do you experience emotional exhaustion? How often? What do you to manage it?\n\n*For people who do go to therapy, and have had an ENTJ clinician -* what was your experience?
15	My ENTJ bf is a psychiatrist, and I think it really compliments his personality. He’s tough enough to spot bullshit when he sees it, but smart and empathetic enough to know when someone truly needs his help. Additionally, working at a hospital makes him exercise his Te, which he loves, and the great lifestyle of a psychiatrist gives him time to work on his Se. \n\nI’m in an occupational therapy program myself and I believe one of the program heads is an ENTJ. Although the stereotype is that this type should go into business, I think they can do a lot of good for others in healthcare. 
6	I know an ENTJ pediatric occupational therapist. She works almost exclusively with special needs kids and I recently found out her niece has Down’s syndrome, which I doubt is a coincidence.
5	Just the other day I thought that an ENTJ would be an awesome life coach if I ever chose one
3	I am getting my Master’s in Social Work right now actually. I have a strong idealistic side and want to work with people. My wife, an ENFJ social worker, was an inspiration for me to change careers. I saw the important work she was doing and decided I didn’t want to serve media corporations anymore; I have a hard time doing anything I don’t really believe is important, and from my volunteering experiences, I found that I really enjoy working with older adults and learned a lot from their stories. It appeals to my creative writing background as well to meet lots of interesting people and learn about them. I discovered in my first social work internship that my calling is in hospice, and I’m thrilled to be working in a field that feels vitally important to me. On an everyday basis, hospice deals with what I perceive to be the greatest injustice of all, that someday we all must face: the process of dying and ultimately death. \n\nMy pragmatic side also appreciates that serving the aging population has advantages in that it’s a fast growing segment of the population. Also, unlike professions that favor some regions of the country or world over others, one can be a social worker anywhere. And social workers can’t be replaced by automated labor — or at least, they shouldn’t be. In hospice specifically, I’m finding that most social workers work in the field doing home visits, and they get to set their own schedules, which is something I value a lot. I also like the idea that with clinical licensure, I could start my own practice at some point should I choose that route. \n\nShould be no surprise to this crowd that as an ENTJ (and a 30+ y/o male to boot) I’m very different from most of my classmates. I have a sense of mental toughness, personal/professional drive, and organizational skills that not everyone around me has, and I’m not scared to speak up if I have a question, or to take a leadership role when no one else wants to. But in helping professions, difference is valued. \n\nSo don’t be discouraged when you find you’re different from others around you. We shouldn’t let caricatured Myers Briggs stereotypes define what we will do in our careers. Not all of us want to be heartless industry titans, nor should we be. 
1	I'm a doctor so there's that
0	HANNIBAL! lol 
0	I am an ENTJ psychiatrist. At me anything!
0	I think NFs are good therapists while NTs are good psychologists. Psychology is still an ontological science and still undergoes scientific methid and philosophy. some of the best psychologists had to be NTs. 
5	INxP (f) Seeing an ENTJ (m)... problems...	SO, long story short, I (f) started dating male (entj)...who I love... and we're not in a committed relationship yet (it's been 7 months!). A year and a half ago he was engaged. His ex broke up with him because of devastating family issues (dad has dementia) and is moving back to her home country soon. He's still friends with her and relies on her for support and is absolutely not over her.\n\nA few years ago, I dated an INTP who was trying to help me get over a breakup. He saw all these problems with me that he wanted to fix, but it ended up bordering on abusive and he was extremely critical of me (even if he was right). He had concerns about my own mental health which later proved to be true. Also, he was a genius and knew a lot about psychology and the brain, so he was basing his judgments on real info and he was right but I didn't realize it until much later.\n\nNow, I'm in the opposite position of my ex. I want to help this guy I'm seeing (entj) get over his ex. I have a whole list of recommendations for him that is research based and I know would help his mental health. There are real issues that I see, and I want to help him get better. He could get better in a few months if he followed my suggestions.\n\nIs this crazy of me? I just want him to get better. And I do my research and base everything on evidence. It's a great plan that will help him.\n\nAs an ENTJ, would you appreciate this?
10	First of all I think you're definitely INTP or a veeery stressed INFP.\n\nI don't think you should try so hard. You have to stand on your own 2 feet. Don't hang on to him.\n\nSometimes in life, you have to let go of what is most hurting you, in order to get it. It might not work out, but develop yourself. Become better yourself and then if he's into you - great. If not, you'll be attractive and strong. 
7	Definitely not your job. Been acquainted with many extjs, the "helping" can push them away. Because what you truly want is to be with them (been there, I get it. Sigh). You can't fix/heal someone, and the more you try, the more they will pull away. Save your sanity and find someone who can give you what you want, without you needing to 'heal' them. 
3	i dont really see the point in getting over her. if you love someone you will continue doing so and its a good thing.  \nfocus on yourself more than him. if you provide a good example , attractive virtuous human that wants him, thats the best thing you could offer.  \ntheres no conceptual solution as i perceive it  
2	Ahaha I'm a young ENTJ but as a advice it's better to let go and take care of yourself :))
2	Sounds like an unhealthy person and may not be ENTJ. But seriously I don’t know how much you can honestly do.
3	I would be direct with him.  Let him know how you feel about this ex thing.  ENTJs like it straight up no bs.  And will respect you for your courage.  This whole looking up ways to help him seems like you’re beating around the bush.  
1	Never Met Another ENTJ	I live in Bangladesh and I feel that ENTJs are very rare here. I don't think that I have met another ENTJ in my life (I'm an ENTJ). What are the odds? Is it even possible to not being able to meet another ENTJ?\n\nP.S: By meeting I meant at least get to know someone or get acquainted with.  
1	I mean at least u met a couple on ENTJs online lol, a sub teacher of mine is a ENTJ :')
1	You probably have.

6	How to work with ESTJs?	I’m working with an older gentleman who I originally believed to be ENTJ. However, lately I have started to suspect he might be ESTJ. I outline my reasoning below:\n\n* Strong Te (challenges me all the time)\n* He gets very impressed when I use my Ni \n* During one of the rare moments where we had a personal conversation I discovered that he is motivated by following his duty (Si)\n* His factual memory is impeccable (Si) \n* He calls himself old-fashioned (Si)\n* He is quite entertained by what he calls “madness” and tries to encourage my...”crazy Russian antics”. Has a bit of a chaos to him when he cuts loose (tertiary Ne)\n\nI greatly respect the man and even though he doesn’t ask for compensation I want to help him. \n\nIf you have experience working with ESTJ(s) successfully, the two main pieces of advice I need:\n\n1. How to successfully combine our different leadership styles? (He has history with the group but they are looking to me for the vision, and building momentum for the business)\n2. How to increase rapport? \n\nI also welcome any other wisdom you are willing to share on building a successful long-term business relationship with an ESTJ. 
5	1. Ask him to help you get organized. Ask him how he might make something better and then talk about potential for improvement.\n\n2. Talk about something controversial and ask him for the perspectives he thinks are noteworthy and then have a debate on which is best 
5	People generally like people that value the same things that they do. You guys are both high Te so it should be easy. Just find opportunities to appreciate them for their other strengths and try and relate as much as possible. \n\nI love ESTJs :)
3	I like ESTJs. And STJs in general. Really underrated hard workers, thinking if having one help me with my buisness. Id make them know that they are valued, that their loyalty and razor focus is dually noted. That will tickle their fi and make them wanna cry. 
2	I get along with eSTJs and especially one I know decently well. We have a little bit of issues but it’s minor I think. Discuss leadership with him and just work together. Usually if you have the same goals it’s very easy. Just discuss everything. You will just see what you and the estj can do you will have different ideas what you can do with the situation and I think both can be done. The ESTJ I am currently working with is a professor of mine but I may have to work with him in term of some work I am doing that may need to engage his club. Use your te to connect.
1	> He is quite entertained by what he calls “madness” and tries to encourage my...”crazy Russian antics”.\n\nLike what?\n
1	They follow instructions well. \n\n
14	Balancing ENTJ loops	I find I get into these all consuming aggressive goal directed ENTJ loops. How do you balance these out or come down from them? There comes a point when solving or taking on the worlds most difficult problems doesn’t work.
10	Have you seen *Was That Really Me?* by Naomi Quenck? This community talks about “dom-tert” looping but Quenck also talks about “being in the grip” of your inferior.\n\nFor me, I've noticed that my Te-Se loops are sustained by some kind of Fi-based black and white decision that's made me see everything in terms of Right vs. Wrong, Me vs. The World. I lose sight of my Ni's long range perspective instead of taking setbacks as a natural course of chance and realizing that the future is still to be influenced. I replace my world view with a nihilistic view of the present, and I can only pick fights with how things are now instead of adopting a strategy to deal with things.\n\nThe advise, from people ranging from Quenck to Jung to Von Franz, is that you need to assert your auxiliary, to *parent* your tertiary and inferior functions. I know I'm getting out of the grip when I start imagining the future several years into the future again, and using that perspective to make my decisions and to orient in the present.\n\nI like the concept of the [Orient-Observe-Decide-Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop) loop as an engagement schema. We ENTJs need to *continuously* orient with Ni in order to keep Te-Se from locking into maladaptive Observe (Se) - Decide (Fi, Te) - Act (Te, Se) cycles. (Or maybe psychles.)

34	I Am Shocked At How Many ENTJs Have Never Met An INTP	Recently I started talking one on one with a few ENTJs on here. \n\nWhile I have met a few ENTJs in person, it's admittedly rare. But I welcome it anytime I get the opportunity. \n\nYou guys aren't nearly as scary or as cold as your reputation portrays 😂 \n\nYou guys are a buncha softies underneath, at least for the people you care about. 😊 \n\nYou just prefer to take the "tough love", and blunt honesty approach. While the other more "sensitive" types skirt around issues, so they perceive the ENTJ's take on caring as aggressive, or indifferent. \n\nINTPs and ENTJs get along great, but I found it surprising at how many of you have never actually met an INTP, let alone talked with one. Interestingly enough, for a type toted as "Extroverted", one frequent I've found is you guys tend to stick to your comfort zone when it comes to people. Even when unhappy or feel unfulfilled with your current circle, you tend to stick with what you know. Personally I think you're more concerned about being hurt or betrayed, so you stick with the types you know what to expect from. \n\nI mean, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, I welcome it!  😄
10	Hi. I'm INTP and never met an ENTJ sadly ;(. I would love to hang out with you guys because you care about becoming a better version of yourselves.
20	ENTJ here. Met an INTP. We got married. We never EVER had a fight. We were the perfect team. She got cancer and died. I know I will never experience the same level of happiness again :( 
5	I am an ENTJ and I know a ton of INTPs. However I do not know any other ENTJs.
7	I'm an ENTJ and my husband is an INTP. \nI think it works exceptionally well!
4	I agree with you concerning others takings as being insensitive when we are taking the tough love approach. Sometimes you need to be direct, and feelings need to be put to the side so one can think clearly. \n\nRegarding friends, I get easily annoyed by people and that drains me, quickly. Therefore, when I find people who don't drain me and I enjoy being around, I stick with them. It can take time to get there and people are put on different levels in a sense. There are very, very few people that I can always be around. 
12	Hurt, betrayed, sure. But the biggest one is disappointed. I have very high standards for myself and I pride myself on that. I’m never satisfied with staying “the same,” and I tend not to hang out with people at all. Notably, it’s because I cannot help myself from holding others to the same baseline assumption that they are constantly working on themselves as well to be better, smarter, and more fulfilled in their lives: mentally, physically, and spiritually. Don’t get me wrong, every blue moon, I’ll go to a happy hour, but most of the time it’s just me and my girlfriend (who ironically is an INTP). \n\nI do this because so often I am disappointed by others. Their refusal to talk about anything interesting or “deep,” as I’ve been told; their tendency to avoid using their head; their somewhat, though at times only faintly, desperate need for attention and validation from one person or the group; their emotional baggage coming through in passive aggressive statements; and, the worst of the lot, their seemingly constant need to phish for compliments. Not something I care to babysit when I’m out trying to have a good time. \n\nSo, to be utterly blunt, my reasoning for pushing people away boils down to the following: (1) people are inherently bad, (2) people who choose to not use their brains for anything other than attention and real-time comments are incredibly off putting and boring (e.g. someone who says things like “man that’s funny, did you see how that napkin just flipped over like that, like at one point it was just laying flat and then the next second it’s flipped over”), and (3) people let their emotions take too much control of their worldly experience, and it’s just petty drama at some point with most people. \n\nSo, that’s about it. I do care incredibly deeply about a select few people in my life and that’s my significant other and my immediate family. If you’re anyone outside of that grouping, you’re basically getting ghosted. 
3	In brief interactions you can seem a lot like other types. I can only tell it's an INTP if it works in IT or wants to argue about Bitcoin or Politics. 
3	I never really got along that well with the INTPs I met.
5	entj and intp are 2 sides of the same coin. ideally both sides strive to develop the other. finding it in a partner is secondary   \nE shape environment, I analyze environment. focus is efficiency, efficiency is happiness )
4	Loyalty is of utmost importance.    \n\n\nI like INTPs as well.  
5	I get along with INTPs better than other ENTJs. 
2	i know a couple of intps, and am close friends with one, but do not know any other entjs (though i do know *of* some) 
2	Gee someone finally understood, I also dont get why people think we are so scary LOL. \nOur reputation is like you said "Cold and scary"\nBut we can be nice as well even though we lack emotions apparently. :/ We just like things our way and get critical if it's not. Or by inrelevant people, eh we can get mean. And that's how it is, people made stereotypes.
1	I'm an xNTx and geoscience student.\n\nI agree on the social circle part 100% from my pov, nice observation. \n\nLike 80% of my colleges are intp's and despite enjoying the mindheavy abilities of my m8s I really hit rock-surface bringing along my flattering jokes.\n\nI was in civ eng undergraduate and really had a better time with this branchea ppl tbh.\n\nP.s. At least one of my exes was defo intp and she kept rolling eyes on my grandiose excitement and constant need to explore new ground, which kinda made me mad (cuz I appreciated her rational down to earth bringing logics alot) \n\nTl:dr it's just a wague personal opinion, but maybe intp's and entxs dont mix along so well.\n\n
1	My amazing debate partner Maddy, an intellectual Scorpio bad bitch, is an INTP
1	Gonna get downvoted but here goes. \n\nThis thread: WOE IS US, FOR WE ARE TOO SMART FOR NORMIES TO UNDERSTAND US\n\nI know two ENTJ’s, and they’d never say something as stupid as “people don’t get our intellect and are too shallow for us to befriend”. Although both of them are some of the smartest people I know, they can have unbelievable warmth and a genuine interest in people around them. Please get ahold of your egos. Being ENTJ doesn’t automatically make you more intelligent than everyone else. 
1	If I would be given a chance to have an ENTJ as a long time close friend it would be nice. It is understandable however that it is highly unlikely. Given my current track right now I am more inclined to be with people high in Fe as I am learning to be more appreciative of collective effort and belongingness.
1	Never met an INTP. Met plenty of ENTPs though, and we’re compatible as friends. Where do INTPs hang out? 
7	How to build up confidence?	I consider being myself good and a valuable person, but my psychologist told me that I lack to believe that I’m actually good and valuable, lacking on having a relationship because I just still don’t offer anything.\nAny advices on how to solve this? I’m 16 years old btw; adults needed.
11	Read the short novel *Old Man and the Sea* by Hemingway. You’ll finish it in just a few hours but emerge with a complete motif of how to answer this question for yourself. \n\nThe greatest misunderstanding about confidence is that it is gained and lost through victories and defeats. *True* confidence is immutable.
13	ENTJ tactical analysis. At age 16 you are making a transition from childhood to adulthood. You are discovering yourself, learning who you are and probably dating. Personal growth comes with high school, college, social networking and friends. What are you doing to better yourself? Be patient.
4	Self confidence is just that.  It comes from the self, there is no external validation.    \n\n\nWrite down a pro's and con's list about yourself and focus more on the pro's but see what you can fix on the con's list. 
3	Hi, ive a 50 dollar for you, want it, guess its worth?\n\nOh I dropped it\nOh I stomped on it\nOh I putted dirt on it\n\nIs it still worth 50 dollars?\n\nAnswering what one can offer is a bad question anyone might stumble across, especially in your age with troubles / uncertainty / (forced) dependence of your parents and teachers.\n\nBut guess what, there will always be challengimg circumstances esp. if you aim high enough\n\nYou'll fall and fell like the stomped dollar or compare with peers or your future goals (not good)\n\nEmbrace the moment, be aware youre always worthy no matter what\n\nProtip if you feel competitive\nThere was this runner guy (lost his name)\nHe won not only one but several distances and when ask how he could achieved this he told\n"no matter how much it hurt, I new my competitors had more pain, so I pushed trough"\n\nSo how does it transition to you?\nLove can and will hurt emotionally but dont take it on your ego, stay positive and open so you will find your other half\nAnd for the giving part, you are just good as you are, thats how easy it is
2	I read that we ENTJ’s are all about creativity, and it is when you create success with your creativity (which it is like your personal identity) then you will have confidence. Because it is essentially about testing your abilities and understanding how valuable they are, which should I guess, create a good perception of yourself (as your abilities are part of you, although it can be argued that it isn’t as well) and there is where self-esteem comes to the game as well and develops your confidence for the whole of you - for yourself.\n\nHope it helps!xx \n\nENTJ- A, people mastery 
1	Honestly, I am surprised that your psychologist didn't help you out with giving you tips on what to do. \n\nMy advice, as simple as it sounds, is to believe that you're are worthy. Crazy but the act of just believing something is true can change your entire life. I had to go through this process when I was younger. I had to tell myself that I could do certain things and that I was a certain type of person. The more I told myself, the more I believed it. The more I believed it, the more I lived and became it. \n\nThe same can be for you. Believe in yourself, even when it's difficult and others tell you otherwise. You have lots to offer, it might take some time to see and believe what they are but trust me you do.\n\n&#x200B;
-1	> How to build up confidence?\n\nExposure and winning.\n\n> my psychologist told me that I lack to believe that I’m actually good and valuable, lacking on having a relationship because I just still don’t offer anything.\n\nWell maybe you don't ... yet.\n\nYou are not ready to be a father and protect your kids. You have no money, you can't box. You are small and have little life experience. You have no powerful friends that can protect you and no valuable skill to offer.\n\nThe same is true for most guys your age but that does not stop some of them from fucking. Why? Because a lot of them are dumb. They see boobs, their penis goes up and they will do anything to get laid. They are not over-thinking the intricacies of the universe.\n\nIf you are smart then you should look for a smart girl who is 1-2 years younger than you. She ought to appreciate your company ... hopefully.\n\nYou need to work on things you do not have - skills, exercise, etc. Expose yourself to situations that make you nervous and survive them. Being able to laugh at yourself on stage is a shortcut.\n
0	Do you often feel this way or is this a result of something recent happening?\n\nConfidence we supposedly exude. \nIt's one of our strongest alleged notable features.\nCould you perhaps be confusing confidence with something else?\n\nAm I the only one thinking this?
31	When you meet people do you also predict their life?	The one's that want to change their trajectory and have the balls to do it captivate me.  \n\nDo you guys do this too?
23	Yes, to a good extent. \n\nI enjoy learning about people's lives, their challenges, their strengths, their moments of weaknesses - essentially their story - **what, who, and how it made them the way they are today.** \n\nThe ones that rises above, no matter the story or tiny moments, are the ones I tend to appreciate more. **The higher the rise, the higher the appreciation.** \n\nP.S: The prediction is a way to fine-tune Ni. I'll call it a hobby at this point.
6	My best friend does this. He told me he dismissed me entirely as hopeless when we first met, as I was aimless and headed towards failure. And well, I did crash as expected but I got out stronger and determined, and that caught his attention, so he kept me around. Updates me every once in a while when he foresees a change of path or when he sees a bad habit of mine snowballing, which is cool even though I feel like a test subject in an ENTJ life-coaching experiment sometimes. 
13	You calculate them, assess their vulnerabilities and gauge their worth
7	Where I live right now most people are going to die from sugar, drugs, smoking and drinking before they are 70.\n\nA motivational speech by an ENTJ would save their sorry asses and turn them all into triathletes CEOs.\n
2	No but the more I get to know them the more easily I can imagine their hole entire future. 
2	This is freaky, specially makes you feel exposed. ENTJs have Ne critic which makes them conscious of other people's future and very responsible with their own (Ni parent). I never put it in that context.\n\nAlways believe I'm quite perceptive but I'm probably more worried about other people's future if at all. This fits so much really.
2	No but I'm going to start. Seems like a cool thing to work on.
2	Haha yeah, and sometimes we tend to be somewhat controllers on others decisions, because we like see the future
1	Yes, eventually after about eighty eight minutes
5	Cast aside all relationships and embrace your destiny	We are ENTJs\nCold passionate and calculating\nLove us or hate us we will win\n
14	Edgy
12	This feels like an Emo Kylo Ren tweet...
5	"Destiny"
3	Win at what?
2	At any cost sir. At any motherfucking cost
1	Considering doing this
17	What causes anxiety for you?	I'm wondering what causes anxiety for other ENTJs. I know for me it tends to be the likelihood that I will fail at a task and not be able to accomplish my goals. I can also get anxious about relationships to an almost crippling degree.
22	When I feel I’m in a situation I perceive to be threatening that I have no control over. Classic ENTJ I guess. It comes out most when I’m flying. 
10	Irrational worry/fear resulting from deep seated childhood trauma and losing people dear to me unexpectedly and always in unpleasant manners. Has left me in a high alert state that is only subsided through meditation, lots of training and an unhealthy obsession with achieving all of my goals, both big and small. Anxiety is a bitch, but it’s a bitch who can be tamed.  Oh and 420
10	Being able to effectively parent an INFP child...
15	I get anxious when I'm not able to get what I wanted to done. Like when it's one of those days where you get e-mail after e-mail asking you to do shit when you already your day mapped out.\n\nI'm not nearly as flexible or open-minded as I should be when it comes to work, but structure results in insane levels of productivity and I wish I could take the insanely stupid requests from colleagues and shove them up their asses.
4	Loud noises when I’m trying to focus or concentrate. Repetitive noises are the worst. You know how some people like to turn the TV on for background noise? I can’t stand it. 
5	Group projects with assigned groups. I don’t procrastinate, but I’ve been stuck working with people who wait until the very last second to start and what do you know, their part is either unfinished or severely lacking. 
5	Not very flexible when my schedule has to change - I plan my days so I hate it when things change. I used to stress a lot about being good at my job but I’m feeling more confident these days 
4	Failing to get done what needs to be done in the timeframe I have given it. 
5	My INFJ daughter saying that astrology is better than MBTI typing.
7	When I'm around someone who is basic as fuck.
2	I think this has to do more with enneagram. I am very similar to you. I also think unexpected things. It has to be badly unexpected and very shocking. Unexpected moves. Like I said really big ones. But yeah. Unprdictable people. Can’t think of too many things right now. 
2	stores. maybe its the lights or all the stuff to look at. breathing techniques  work, in the nose out the mouth. It's still the most uncomfortable thing I do.  this is a recent change. as a kid/teen i loved walking around stores all day. 
2	ESFJ supervisor 🤪
2	When I’m at work, I often find myself frustrated and anxious when I have to depend on someone else to do a project. I guess it’s the fact that I can’t necessarily control what the other person does. Makes me sound like a control freak but it’s that mentality of “I should just do it myself” 
1	Not being able to get what I want done quickly and unreasonably hindered by people you can’t immediately out-maneuver, at the same time. Dead end situations. 
1	When I don't have enough time to do things properly. 
1	Feeling like my time is being wasted and I can't do anything about it. It happens a lot in my University where they shove you into a random political talk when I'd rather be studying (Venezuela)
1	Failing at life because I'm procrastinating my life away, or already have and it's too late
1	I get anxiety if I don't get work done lmao, everything must be caught up and perfect all the time, sounds tiring but apparently that's life xD
-1	The bullshit Trump investigations are causing me to lose sleep.
6	Feeling extreme anxiety working towards my goals	Hello fellow ENTJs, I'm an ENFJ. If it helps, my tritype is 4w3  (with a strong 3 wing) 7w6 8w9. Recently, I have been extremely motivated in reaching my goals (18, fresh from highschool!), from planning every day of my life, to taking the initiatives in finding opportunities and part-time job openings. In the past 2 months, along with a tiring F&B part-time job, I've taught myself graphic design, improved my people skills', appearance and way of speaking, regular exercise etc. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, I can't help feeling **extremely** anxious everyday. My shoulders feel "weak", my hands tremble and I feel really anxious. On the outside, I keep projecting a confident image but the inside is opposite. I constantly compare myself to other people on social media (I know it is everyones' highlight reel, but still...), and in my heart I really, really want to one-up them. I used to be extremely confident and outgoing till highschool, where I had horrible depression, intense emotional outbursts that drove away all my good friends. I have been betrayed by jealous 'friends' before, who constantly put me down while I was dumb, naive and tried to foster harmony. Since then, I have built up new, far more positive and supportive groups of friends. I had extreme social anxiety for 5 years and pushed myself everyday to get rid of it. Since then, I am able to make prolonged eye contact, talk confidently, assume leadership positions. However, inside I am quaking with self-doubt. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am doubtful I will ever be able to achieve my goals, I am extremely afraid someone will eventually betray me especially in the friendships, workplace (I know this is inevitable), I am afraid that my drive for harmony will continue to lead people to step over me. I feel so stupid being so idealistic and naive sometimes, especially since my true vision lies in Arts. I like to believe in the good of people and get extremely angry internally when it backfires. Last but not least, I **need** to be validated by people liking me, as stupid as it may seem. I get really upset when people do not like me, and need to find out the reasons why. (I know there will always be people who do not like you, but it is difficult for me to accept, unhealthy as it may seem) Truthfully, I get insanely jealous of INTPs/ISTPs/INTJs, who can do things their own way confidently.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny advice? (I am asking here because of the common Ni function we share, am really interested in seeing the differences between a Te-dom and Fe-dom)
7	I'm not going to tell you to compare yourself to others. I'm going to tell you to not RELY on comparison to find your worth. Or alternatively, realise through comparison that you're doing well, and hence stop being so anxious.\n\nNo compulsive desire is good. Your desire to one-up them/be liked by everyone is healthy until it makes you miserable. \n\nJust let it go. Seriously. Don't make these desires personal, because that's when they swallow you up. That's when you start getting miserable by ironically trying to be likeable, and you start hating things you love. 
5	My impression of you is that you are very intelligent and self-aware. Your honesty is brave, but you have to be able to identify when your brain is playing tricks on you and blowing things out of proportion. As confident as we all try to appear in life, everyone has insecurities. Fake it till you make it, and I do believe you will make it in time.  \n\nPhysiological manifestations of anxiety may be a sign of an anxiety disorder, which is essentially an overactive fight-or-flight response. You are the boss, not your reactions. Exposure-response therapy is the most effective treatment for social anxiety. You can try it on yourself, or seek a specialist to help you. \n\nI do not have the same emotional needs that you do, and have never craved validation or experienced jealousy of that sort in my adult life. I believe your fellow ENFJs may have better advice for you on that front. I will say that there’s no shame in having thoughts/feelings/needs that are irrational in nature, it’s how you respond to them that counts. 
2	You know what.. you should not give so much damn about your emotions. You're intelligent and self-aware. If you can't be successful, if you can't be confident, if you can't be whatever you want to be, then something is controlling you. Maybe it's your anxiety. Maybe it's your longing for validation. But what makes this all up is your EMOTIONS. You should control it  — Control it before it controls you. Don't be afraid to be ignored. Don't be afraid not to be liked. Fake it 'till you make it but do not resist everything including your feelings because it will end up hurting you more. Just like I said, control it, but don't resist. Be smart and confident enough to achieve your goals. Emotions are just there to guide you and make people understand you, not to control your destiny.
7	Drinking or staying sober?	I’m turning 18 soon(legal drinking age where I live) and I am not sure if I’m gonna want to drink or not. \n\nI am wondering what is your reasons for drinking or staying sober?
20	I stopped drinking because of hangovers fucking up the next day.
11	As a rule of thumb, I stop after two glasses, whether it's beer or rum.\n\nTwo important pieces of advice:\n\n* When you drink, stay hydrated. Alcoholic beverages dehydrates the body. So have a glass of water for every glass of something else. This will reduce hangover, sickness and hopefully stupid behaviours (fatigue & alcohol compounds, removing a bit of physical fatigue is not a bad idea).\n* Alcohol is the archenemy of memory. When you drink, whatever happened since the last time you slept is going to get blurry or forgotten (memory get "set" during sleep time). The more you drink the less will remain. Never drink after a day long of studying, that would waste all your efforts.  \n
6	* Hangovers suck\n* Bad for your liver\n* Pissing away your money\n* Useless calories\n* Encourages poor decisions\n* Negatively affects mental performance for multiple days afterwards\n\nAll for a “fun” night that you will barely remember, if at all, followed by a day of feeling like a vomitous salty squid with brain fog. \n\nI used to drink socially but as I got older the hangovers became more and more debilitating so I dropped the drink. \n\nIt does give a nice buzz and liquid courage, but it’s a lame way to socialize, so who cares? \n\nWorking out gives me a nice buzz and *solid* courage, plus a slew of health benefits and basically ZERO drawbacks. Life enhancer, longer lasting, I look fly as fuck, I get more positive attention, I have more confidence, more energy, food tastes better and I get an all around boost in physical and mental performance. 
5	The key is everything in moderation. Alcohol is great and may have health benefits in low doses. It gives you a buzz and makes you feel disinhibited. The problem like everything is it can become a vice. Healthy use of alcohol would be two drinks 2 or 3 times per month and never in dangerous situations like operating vehicles. I would definitely try it at least once or twice and learn to use it responsibly.
3	1. Hard liquor first. Beer after you're already buzzed.\n\n2. Drink water.\n\n3. Loose lips? Just don't drink
3	I love to drink. I'm really into craft beer, so that's the main reason I do it, but I love to get a buzz going on weeknights, and then get decently drunk on the weekends. I just do it because it makes me feel happy (not that I'm unhappy otherwise), and I love trying new beers. \n\nIf you're gonna drink often, just make sure you eat a balanced, healthy diet, and drink a lottttt of water. Overtime you'll learn what you like, and what your body can and can't handle, so just try new things and take it slow.
5	I don’t do any drinking or drugs. They do not work for a productive life. They are bad in my book. Drunk people means lots of them act weird. I haven’t touched a drop of alcohol or drugs in my life. And not going to do it. I won’t touch it. Well okay. I’ve had alcohol but most of that has evaporated because I’ve only had it cooked in food and when it’s finished there you know they’re not very drug like at all! I’ve had stuff like banana foster pudding and things with cooking sherry but that’s it.
2	What ever you do, don’t drink around your exes and her mutual friends because you will embarrass yourself. \nIf you’re gonna drink with people you don’t want to annoy drink lightly.\nIf you’re at a random club, drink lightly\nIf you’re with the boys then drink till you’re fuckeyed\n\nEdit you’re a girl ignore what I said 
2	Try it until you’ve “been there, done that” then reevaluate. 
2	I had my first drink when I was about 12. My father did not care. Older people around me would succumb to alcoholism or die when drunk (I grew up in a crappy place) but I never received the alcoholic gene. Hard liquor still tastes like shit to me and I don't hold the liquor too well. I did drink plenty of beer though throughout college and afterwards. Eventually I stopped because a) alcohol and crappy food would upset my stomach and that was not fun at all and b) I got tired of being around stupid people and being stupid myself. Seriously, being drunk handicaps you. Also hangovers do suck indeed.\n\nUnless you think you might get addicted, which is usually genetic, I recommend trying some decent alcohol in small doses. If you are Asian, Native American, Inuit or some other exotic ethnicity that doesn't have a history of alcohol consumption like Europeans do, you might want to stay away altogether. Even if you are Caucasian, you might still get addicted with lower probability.\n\nHaving tasted alcohol (after a long day or on a weekend so that it does not steal productive time from you), I would cut down on it or quit altogether. You re a lady and should not try to outdo the dudes when it comes to drinking. The alcohol when used properly can help you relax, but it can also worsen your athletic and academic and even sexual performance when it is used too often. It can age you a bit faster. What woman wants to age faster?\n\nTrump and kids do not drink. It gives them a edge over the competition - they have more productive time. Jocko also stopped drinking. A lot of overachievers do not have time for alcohol in their lives. You probably want to experience it a little bit for cultural reasons.\n\nDrinking is kind of incompatible with parenting. When you are pregnant or are raising a child, you are responsible for an innocent and fragile life. Drinking only makes it more likely that you will fuck something up. Little kids aren't smart enough to avoid risk so you have to be there for them and be sober.\n\nGet it out of your system, do not do too much of it and then just stop altogether. For maximum liver protection (alcohol does damage your liver indirectly every time that you drink) you want to consume something bitter like chicory root extract or dandelion root extract. Not only is it good for you, it is fucking delicious.\n
1	It's ok to have a drink here or there.  As long as you don't do it in excess or in too often of a frequency that is is a habit.  People DO do stupid things when under the influence, but ONE (true serving) should not throw you over to the point where you lose control of yourself.
1	No real reason to not drink at all unless you try and just don’t like it, try it and find you have a problem with stopping, or have a family history of alcoholism. I’m surprised at how many teetotalers and prudes there are among this subreddit. That said, 18 year olds tend to make poor decisions when they drink to excess, so be thoughtful about it while you learn your limits.
1	Don't drink, do you really want to lose control of your bodily functions and do something you'll probably regret tmrw?
1	Drink a bit when stressed so you can relax better like my Mom say lol
30	If you want to be effective is a group-project, being a dick won't get you anywhere.	Face it. Unless you can brace yourself for the breach of unfathomable amounts of solowork, you must concede some points occasionally. Constantly getting your way on irrelevant things will slow down and destroy the momentum of groups.  \nWork to properly gain advantage, work where you are strongest. If the time spent arguing about which road is faster is larger than the difference in time between the roads, you end up being ineffective either way.
11	Water wets, fire burns.
7	Yeah. People tend to listen better if you’re nice. If you’re working with someone who’s just awful, don’t express frustration in an intimidating way, just tell them bluntly and calmly and make the entire presentation in Comic Sans from someone else’s account. 
1	Not a dick most of the time.  But when I do...
1	There’s a difference between using te and using te against people/hitting people with te over the head. Yeah, one is pretty neat the other just isn’t cool. Learn to keep te in check and use charm and persuasion. I can be very te when leading but leading and being a jerk, well there’s a clear line between the two. 
1	I'm a professional painter who works for different contractors. Was running a job that was in a time crunch. One of the slower guys asks to leave early to pick up his kid. No problem, except he left 200$ worth of paint and tools out in the sun, sticking me with the mess. The next morning, the other guys were waiting for me to ring his neck. Instead I was compassionate, calm, and respectful. Guy beat himself up for the rest of the week, and his performance actually improved. 
1	I knew an ENTJ in highschool, extremely unhealthy underneath though. He was really fun and funny on the surface when I first met him. In an important groupwork with his 3 other classmates, he single-handedly declared that he alone would do the whole project, because it would be more "efficient and effective that way" (LOL sounds like the typical ENTJ) When his classmate said everyone should pitch in instead, they broke out into an argument, with him SCREAMING at her and *throwing tables across the classroom.* I have no idea how they manage to glide along the project for next 7 months, but did not get good results eventually. 
1	I must intrude on your post. \n\nDon't be a dick as in don't "manage." Managing is trying to get people do something your way. It's an "okay" method as in it is a working way of controlling and getting work done especially when one has monetary or any other extrinsic power over the other. But that's all it is, an okay method, one that is especially popular in corporate America.\n\nBe a dick as in tell what you really think to the other person. Yes, don't butter someone about something that isn't good. That's manipulation: Don't manipulate through conceding. Instead, be charming, talk with the intent to help the team and I mean really help the team. Inspire people to do great work and doing great work means not conceding unless you are certain that it will in harm. Don't settle for mediocre if you know there is room for betterment.  \n\nBe willing to argue and fight your stance and do so with logic to defeat any argument that comes in you way. And be willing to give in when you logic is fallacious without any emotional attachment. Efficiency is crucial but more so is the execution. Don't just be efficient. Execute.    
1	What do you think is a good direction for a future market giant?	Something that's been on my mind lately(i'm an INTP by the way) is how one would become a competitor in a natural resource market...like steel. If you wanted to out-innovate them you are gonna have QUITE the task on your hands, as they have millions to potentially billions in resources that can hire people much smarter and who will have access to better research methods. It seems unlikely that you would outmaneuver a major corporation like this.\n\nThat being said, you should be able to play a sort of checkers. If I were to start a business of wrench production, then fridge production, then car production, then not only would my business have more funds to compete with but also there is a higher incentive to be vertically integrated than just a normal business. It'd also be easier to get into cars if you're already buying large amounts of steel for cheap(simply lower startup costs for businesses related to your current production line).\n\nYou should also be able to achieve this by working backward from some predefined long term goal but this long term goal is REALLY hard to define from me. It's like...there are so many variables I have no clue where we will be in 50 years. Right now I'm kinda just working backward from the ideal VR future and things people would do in that VR future. I.e. what are the components required to hook someone's nerves up to a machine and have them play a game. The program would not be difficult, but hooking their nerves up would be. Then what are the components necessary to make the components of the nerve machine ad infinum until you reach where we currently are with tech. Then just invest in the areas closest to the current state of tech and build the components slowly towards your long term goal(the VR machine).\n\nI think this is too far out though(maybe 100-200 years tops). 50 years from now what do you think will be the best investments and biggest market contenders? What do you think is the best way to achieve market control apart from a brilliantly over the top innovation. What resources would you want control over 50 years from now( Steel? Carbon fiber? Etc)?
6	As far as tech goes, I'd control think rare-earth metals and semiconductors. Besides silicon, there are so many more elements that go into chips and with new advances in computing and the upper limit of silicon efficiency getting closer, scientists are looking for different materials to trick into thinking for us. 
5	I think the most important technology in the near future is energy generation (clean). Probably nuclear
3	>If I were to start a business of wrench production, then fridge  production, then car production, then not only would my business have  more funds to compete with but also there is a higher incentive to be  vertically integrated than just a normal business\n\nThese markets are saturated and the entry cost counts in hundreds of billions. Not gonna "have more funds" before decades, in the best case.\n\n>It'd also be easier to get into cars if you're already buying large amounts of steel for cheap\n\nIt won't reduce the cost of the gazillion technology, algorithms and captors that makes today's car what it is. Steel is a trifle in comparison.\n\n>I have no clue where we will be in 50 years.\n\nNobody has.\n\n>50 years from now what do you think will be the best investments and biggest market contenders?\n\nNobody could even answer this question for next year with certainty, you know...\n\n>What do you think is the best way to achieve market control apart from a brilliantly over the top innovation.\n\nThere are strategy books on the topic written since the 50's. [Basically you differentiate (including niches), you do cheaper or you focus on a few things to do them better](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_advantage).\n\n>What resources would you want control over 50 years from now( Steel? Carbon fiber? Etc)?\n\nEnergy, food, construction materials... This answer was, is and will be the same as long as the economy runs.
2	Improving human mind. The source of all our tech. \n\nAnd invest in your self. Your self is with you no matter what the future. 
2	Wherever demand is...
1	Read about JTBD - jobs to be done- theory. It's less about "prediction" and more finding underserved markets you can really own right now. A lot of companies fall in love with the tech, but without a real problem being solved, or deep knowledge of the customer, it's hard for a "tech first" company, to get any traction.\n\nYou can knock an established industry off it's perch (like Uber did), but you gotta have a product many times better, have a good strategic go to market plan and grow fast. The other option is to create new markets. Which requires exceptional UX and sales/marketing on top of a killer product. In the long run, it's probably a better option, but may be very capital intense at the start.\n\nI look for problems over solutions (tech). 
3	Are you interested In fashion or would you consider yourself fashionable?	So I saw this post on the INTP subreddit (I think) and I was wondering what the ENTJ-view on fashion is. \n\nAre you interested in fashion? \n\nAnd if so, what kind of fashion do you prefer wearing?
9	I consider myself fashionable (glamorous even), but not terribly interested in fashion. I often just recreate looks I see elsewhere that appeal to me. I have a sense of what is trending now, and have a finger to the wind of what’s coming. My INTP boyfriend isn’t fashionable at all without me, he couldn’t be less concerned with things like that (which part of me likes because he is so free from the confines of society, and that mentality rubs off on me for the better). There are times I use fashion more as a form of self-expression, but most the time I just want to look sharp, feel good, and be taken seriously. 99% of patterns on women’s clothing don’t appeal to me at all. My boyfriend absolutely hates corporate logos.\n\nContext and mood matters. What you’d see me wearing at a music festival is a lot different than how I usually present myself. I’m not over-the-top, but I do like to add some designer pieces just to wield influence over the superficial masses. Plus, they’re cute and quality. I love Chanel.
9	Yes. I consider fashion to be an indispensable element of civilized society. I wouldn’t call myself particularly fashionable, but I like to look good. Mostly suits, gym clothes, and some casual clothes. At a later stage I’ll be building a travel wardrobe. Shoes are always relevant, and I love my shades. Haven’t gotten into watches though. \n\n\nMostly keeping it simple but with high quality materials and design. Brand can be a factor, though it usually isn’t. 
4	I like to look good/ presentable, but I won’t sacrifice too much on comfort. \n\nShirt/tshirt and chinos instead of sweats when going out the house.
3	I work in the fashion industry and have always been known to look well put together. I prefer to look glamorous and even overdress sometimes - makes for an interesting and good first impression and makes me feel good!
3	Haha! Not really. I am not ugly and unfashionable and just unpresentable. But I tend to be more about comfort. Not a big fashion or aesthetical person.
2	At home I'm in gym clothes.  Outside sometimes in gym clothes or slacks and shirt.
3	Comfort > conformity. Flexibility and privacy > self-expression.
1	I make myself presentable, but don’t really keep up with whatever weird stuff is trendy. If I had my choice, I’d wear all black everyday but my mom (ESTJ?) says no. \nI am uninterested in fashion more myself to wear because it all looks uncomfortable and isn’t as conservative as I would be comfortable with, but as someone who likes to draw, I take an interest in what colors look good together and what textures/ patterns clash in good or bad ways. 
32	Thematically what it's like when ENTJs and ENTPs join forces and decide to work together.	
2	Oh fo sho.
1	LOL OK
2	I don't get this... at all? 
4	Fellow ENTJs, what gives you fulfilment in life?	What fulfils you when you’re at your best? What fulfils you when you’re at your lowest?
12	Transcendent moments of human connection that are greater than the sums of their parts. This occurs often in music for me personally, but also in deep conversation, romance, and elsewhere. Any experience that is the result of beautiful human decisions, especially the ones that would have been impossible to predict, or ones that are unique to the individuals involved. Any time I am involved in a moment like that, whether I spurred it or am just witnessing it, I feel filled with meaning. Moments like this add to my consciousness, and they make me feel significant, like this current timeline would not be possible without the specific events that unfolded in which I played a part.\n\nWhen I'm at my best, I feel fulfilled after extended periods of "flow state." When I'm at my lowest, it's hard to find fulfillment. Significant relationships, like best friends, family, romantic partners can offer a sense of warmth to remember that they care for me. When I'm down, I try to remember that I am observing life from a point in time, and I think about where I was a year ago, two years ago. Acknowledging the progress I have made can help bring my spirits back up.
4	Bringing forth order and leadership (Te) aligned to deep spiritual truths and creative solutions (Ni) to impact the ordinary world in an aesthetically pleasing way (Se) according to my highest personal values and in my own unique approach (Fi). \n\nThe counterintuitive bit is that it only works as well as the weakest function in the process. \n\nRemove any one of those critical pieces and fulfillment is unlikely. \n
3	Meaningful work. Meaningful connections. 
3	Meaningful conversations.\n\nThinking and applying knowledge and being able to talk about them.\n\nBeing productive.\n\nLearning\n\nGetting stuff done.\n\nPlaying intellectual type games word games, trivia, and stuff of this nature.
2	Knowing my cause effects.
2	Giving birth to things.\n\nNot much. Remembering that there have been and therefore will be better days. Just trying to lose small and then compensating it by winning big.\n
2	When I'm at my lowest? Remembering what life is all about, being close to nature and seeing that my problems are trivial and temporary and that I don't need much to survive. I like to go hiking with a small group of friends, it's very grounding and takes your mind off problems.\n\nAt my best, I have these running streaks where it feels like everything I touch turns to gold. It's exhilarating and I keep bouncing off the energy from the last win and using it to get even better results in other facets of my life. At these times I'm my best self, my most outgoing, effective, and everything feels electric. I don't live for these moments though, they're sort of an unexpected bonus. 
6	Comprehensive article on Affective Eye Contact	[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6121038/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6121038/)\n\nEye contact is probably the most important non verbal communication technique.  I was wondering how much eye contact is most effective.  Found a nice article.  Thought I'd share.\n\n**TL;DR**   Although longer periods of eye contact may be disruptive for cognitive performance and may lead to gaze aversion (presumably to decrease cognitive load, e.g., [Doherty-Sneddon and Phelps, 2005](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6121038/#B37)), shorter periods of eye contact could, indeed, trigger positive affective reactions, thus leading to improved cognitive performance and facilitation of social interaction. A particularly interesting issue relates to the possible effects of eye contact on therapeutic change, via positive affective reactions. In the field of psychotherapy, positive affect has been suggested to play a role as a generator of therapeutic change by facilitating cognitive flexibility ([Fitzpatrick and Stalikas, 2008](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6121038/#B48)).
15	ENTJ's that love their job, what do you do?	
22	I'm a consultant and tell people what they should and should not do. 
18	I work in renewable energy as an asset associate. I make sure solar power plants are running as efficiently as possible because payments are tied to power production. I love looking at blueprints and energy data and figuring out why certain power plants perform to the degree they do. \n\nI’m super passionate about climate and the environment and I love being able to tie that into my work. 
13	Attorney. Toxic tort litigation mostly. I represent individuals who have been occupationally exposed or exposed in a rental to very harmful substances (asbestos, mold, silica, talc, etc.).  Mainly I do asbestos and sue \~40 companies for each plaintiff and litigate against them.  I get to argue in court, in depositions, in briefs, in memos, in negotiations... it's quite fun.
10	Im a psychiatrist and I study people and help them
7	I work in revenue operations at a quickly growing start-up. I lead projects that don't require dev resources, perform analytics, do occasional data entry/day to day functions, and try to make things as efficient as possible.\n\nI love to be constantly challenged, held accountable, and involved in new opportunities. I wouldn't say I'm passionate about the industry I'm in, but each of the above needs are met so I'm happy.
7	I'm a director of engineering at a software company.  We just had a successful exit, though, so we'll see what's next.  I might stay on or I might start something new.\n\nI love creating products that people love and can't live without and I love leading teams of smart people to do it.  
6	Real estate development. I love playing a part in (hopefully) creating sustainable and positive communities and improving the way people live. I love watching things come to fruition and obstacles be overcome and then knowing that I've changed the very fabric of not just the suburb but by virtue of the number of projects I do, the city is my tapestry when it comes to creating improvements in the world.

7	Efficiency vs Morality	I was having a debate with an associate of mine today over Steve Jobs, trying to make the point that his impact on modern life is unrivaled (figuratively of course, I know there's people who have had a bigger impact). He didn't code, but his leading skills were in a tier of their own, and he kept his eyes on the big picture. Because of him, Apple has become the most profitable company in history, and no one could rival his talent when it came to making technology appealing to the common man. He was amazing at getting the world to embrace the new, which is crucial since most people are cautious of technology by default, it seems. No one could have handled such a level of macro and micro-managing regarding an entity like Apple, and he single-handedly brought it back from near-bankruptcy, to become the greatest company ever. Apple has almost become a religion for the youth.\n\nBut my associate says all of this doesn't matter, because Jobs was an asshole of a person. He says his workers were increasingly disgruntled with Jobs' leadership style, and that Jobs' personal character nullifies any of his accomplishments. I say that his leading style was ***needed*** to produce such a high level of effectivity as it did, and his impact on the world crushes any significance of him not being a "nice person". \n\nIt's not just with him though, I've noticed it's the social norm to nullify the accomplishments of great historical figures just because they were "morally bad". To me, only losers concern themselves with morality to such a high degree, because they can't rely on concrete achievement as an arguing point. \n\nWhat are your opinions?
7	He did what he had to do and he got it done efficiently.  Morality is relative, results are reality.  He was the one getting shit done and left the discussion of morality to the sideliners, oh and your associate is probably using an iPhone lol.  Am I right?  
4	His leading style wasn't necessary to produce the results he's responsible for, nor does his character nullify his success. The accomplishments a person achieves go beyond their personality.\n\n>To me, only losers concern themselves with morality to such a high degree,\n\nThis is wrong. See Unit 731 and Hisashi Ouchi.\n\nEveryone draws a line somewhere, it's just a matter of tolerance.
2	I don't think this is a question of efficiency vs morality. It's a question of vision. Jobs had a vision that most perceived to be grandiose at the time. It's one of those things where, if you don't actually get it working for others to see, people may not "get" it. There are some things where you can "convince" people to get on board with but there are some things where coercion and being an asshole have to be the way to make headway. Jobs was not just convinced in his vision, he had to make it happen and if he would be branded as an asshole, I doubt he cared: To him it was the cost of implementing something so transformative. People can hate Steve Jobs but they can't deny the respect they have for his vision. In retrospect, getting your feelings hurt to be a part of developing something historical is not going to matter in the long run but history books will bring him up in a bad light anyways to morally preach right vs. wrong to their audience. I agree with you, without his attitude and his absolutely control over the micro details and macro vision, Apple would have never become the paradigm shifting company that it became.
2	Steve Jobs who didn't believe in showering and died from trying to cure his highly treatable cancer with fruit? I respect his accomplishments. Him? Not so sure 
1	His employees were free to leave and the Brooklyn communists were free not to buy Apple products thus bankrupting the company. Neither side did that.\n\nI would also argue that Linus Torvalds, an asshole that he is has done A LOT for this planet. You can do without a Mac or an iPhone but Linux is vital, even if you don't know it.\n
0	it's just two sides of the problem, that's life. You cannot pick both. No one is wrong here. Some choose harmony (Fe), some choose efficiency(Te). Both have ups and downs that the opposite doesn't have.
-1	Sacrificing morality for achievement is never ok. What good is it too be successful if everyone hates you for being an asshole? Besides, was he really that successful? His company is no longer the most valuable. The iPhone is losing polarity. Apple is making less profit with every passing year. A truly successful visionary creates a self sustaining company that continues to run even after they're gone (Sam Walton 😍). Jobs failed to do that. When he died, the people closest to him could only talk about how much they hated him. Is that the legacy you want to leave? How about instead, you be kind, loving, understanding, and self sacrificing? Leave the world a better place, not just a more efficient place. You can be both a great and a great person. Don't compromise on one over the other. Find that balance.\n\nI'm an INTP despite my post sounding like that of an INFP 😂
3	Do you believe emotions are choices?	I've had major mental issues in the distant past(20 years ago) that were only cured by the 'realization' that all of my emotions were a choice. However I've recently been confronted with some emotions that I can't attribute to choice (specifically love). It's extremely terrifying and it's kind of rocking my world right now. I'm curious what you other entjs have experienced or might have thought about the choice of emotions. I always thought it was a hallmark trait of being entj.
11	The choice is your reaction to emotions. Then you can condition yourself more or less.
6	Proceed with caution.
3	No I don’t think it’s good to trivialize emotions like that. I believe feelings and emotions are natural to us all. We just decide if we choose to think about them or act on them. I think minimizing your emotions is dangerous. But I think acting rationally is a better idea but you can’t stop yourself from feeling. You’re not a robot and will never be, humans feel and think and this is just natural. Even if you prefer to think, all of us have feelings, and very deep ones as well.
3	You can't train your mind to love someone, so if you found a person you want to share positivity about living with then thats great and I think you should pursue. I do believe we can train ourself to stay away from negative emotions though.
2	I think these types of addicting relationships are more hormone/sex-based than the love and wholesomeness that one needs from a partner. Of course, a great partner will have that physical chemistry along with compassion and eventually love. \n\n\nIf he's nice and you're comfortable (...and if it's legal...), you should bang. Sex while you're feeling this kind of energy is pretty excellent.
2	Confused as sh*t Help	I've been browsing through google chrome for the past damn hours to figure out my personality type and I still got nothing, no information that are accurately correct. I've been digging up my grave since in school, doing research doing test/quizes and sh*t. Now I get a headache 2 AM in the morning. I am suprised my Mom didn't kill me yet. After searching up for hours, a website said that none is accurate including Myer-briggs, people get 4 letters based on what they want to be and not what they are. Unless you got tested by a perfessional. \n-\nI got results like: Entj, Entp, and Estj but first of all, I do like being sociable sometimes with other people. I can be humorous and loud, hype with in with people like me and like but I moved from Brooklyn to Pennsylvania months ago but I still haven't accept most of it. I just feel myself kinda change here. (ENTP) \nAnd, I do not pick decisions just because I have to.\n--\nSecond of all, Idk what is Estj\n--\nThird of all, I think I am a Entj (Edit: or ENTP ;-;) and I keep getting different results. I want it to be sincere with the results. but I am the kind to be disorganized but I don't think that got anything to do with it. I personally is not as organized but likes to be organized type in between. I like to choose my decisions with facts and information to proceed. I don't get offended easily nor I am emotional but emotionless. I do not like inrelevent people proving me wrong dumb facts. (Actually made another instagram account to prove my friend that her fact is invalid and I dont care about how she feels about it, facts are facts)\nI usually don't like to be in charge or notice but naturally unconsciously I do order people sometimes or help people with work like do half half so he or she won't get tired or overdo herself with all the work. I have logical explanation to things, I like things my way. Sometimes I like to independent by myself, other times I like to be social with other people. I respect people but not ones who are wrong with facts and try to persuade people into believeing their nonsenseness. I only do things if I feel like to, I do not like to be forced or rushed. And honestly, I feel better and superior than other people, I do not know why but I always think I am better than dumbness around (Not trying to be rude lol) . Also, I have high level of confident  and couldn't care about what other people thinks. That's all. \nEdit: I am desperate that I am a Entj-a. ;-; I legit searched up things like "How to know your a ENTJ or not" and other stuffs. I can kinda relate to it. \n*Edit #2: I don't know but I also somehow feel kinda connected to ENTP. It's just so confusing. Is it me or what I want to be?* 
5	I don't know so I will guess based on your words.\n\nYou sound like an ENTJ who is attracted to your shadow functions (INTP is your shadow) but you are sure you are an extrovert which makes it impossible for you to be an INTP so you end up on the neighbor personality, ENTP.\n\nTo sum up: you're a highly curious ENTJ\n\nNow, go out there slave some folks!
2	Just hang out at the different subreddits for a while, you'll find your tribe 
2	I can try to type you if you’re really serious you can try coming over to r/nononsensembti and we have an extensive survey that you can fill out to try to parce it out for you. Don’t be so stuck to a type all types are pretty neat and n over s doesn’t mean too much honestly. Both great but different strengths. One does not mean special and the other ordinary. That’s not what it means at all.
8	ENTJ loops	Just pasting from a friend's pastrebin. Idk the source. \n\nThe Driver/10-Year-Old Loop \n\n"There are three ways an ENTJ experiences the loop, the echo chamber–like relationship between the Driver and 10-Year-Old functions. The way to get out of a loop is the same in all cases: focus on developing the Perspectives process. \n\nShort-term loop. \n"When stuck in an emotion and unable to get out, the ENTJ may get caught in a loop of aggressive behavior or “monkey mind” for a few moments up to a few days. In the first case, the ENTJ is reactive to the situation, upset, and unable to think things through. They may become violent and hostile, and even start to throw objects. Alternatively, when experiencing monkey mind, the ENTJ may become unsettled, restless, indecisive, and uncontrollable. They may feel an intense need to escape a situation. \n\nLong-term loop.\n Compensating for insecurities, the ENTJ will focus on their image. They will see superficial markers, such as the social clubs they’re able to gain access to or the cars they drive, as genuine examples of success. In the loop, the ENTJ will convince themselves that they are deep and able to see things that others miss, but in reality, they avoid introspection out of the fear that they are not enough. Superiority covers their fear of inadequacy, and the ENTJ may keep the people in their lives from meeting each other so no one has the full story. \n\nHabitual loop. \nA less intense loop than the first, and far less offensive to others than the second, an ENTJ may stay in a loop of self-indulgence for an entire lifetime. Eating to mask emotions, binging on TV shows, following the path of least resistance…the ENTJ will fully embrace the monkey mind, chasing whatever is interesting to them in the moment, lacking any type of life plan, and drifting from one thing to the next. In this loop, the ENTJ hides from their real feelings and removes any meaning from their life.
6	This made me feel like I'm in a habitual look, but really I just think life has worn me out.
4	How to resolve the loop(s)? That's the important part.
1	Idk about your guy's loop, but with INTP's Ti-Si loop, the solution is bringing in new ideas and information.\nMaybe you guys need to bring in new people?
6	Awed by the ENTJ talent in here	Have met all sorts of people. We meet to get organized and help each other out
11	Yo my ego can only get so huge
3	You should be part of at least one Mastermind in real life. They help a lot.
2	How do you propose?
1	Jung...How are you so unbelievably smart????	\> When Faust exclaims “feeling is everything”, he is expressing merely the antithesis to the intellect, and therefore only reaches the other extreme ; he does not achieve that totality of life and of his own psyche in which feeling and thought are joined in a third and higher principle. This higher third, as I have already indicated, can be understood either as a practical goal or as the phantasy which creates the goal. This aim of totality can be recognized neither by the science, whose end is in itself, nor by feeling, which lacks the faculty of vision belonging to thought. The one must lend itself as auxiliary to the other, yet the contrast between them is so great that we need a bridge.\n\n\>This bridge is already given us in creative phantasy. It is not born of either, for it is the mother of both nay, further, it is pregnant with the child, that final aim which reconciles the opposites. If psychology remains only a science, we do not reach life we merely serve the absolute aim of science. It leads us, certainly, to a knowledge of the actual state of affairs, but it always resists every other aim but its own. The intellect remains imprisoned in itself just so long as it does not willingly sacrifice its supremacy through its recognition of the value of other aims.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOmg Jung please....PLEASEEEE jerk me off harder. This is literally things I have written as deductions from his theory. Jung is so god damn brilliant it is unreal.\n\nImplications: Unhindered thinking becomes increasingly specialized until he no longer represents anything that matters to life itself other than the enjoyment to the subject. In other words, by continuing down the path of specialization into irrelevance, the subject arrives are the conclusion of the self's love of thinking itself.\n\nFor Te:heaping of empirical facts into infinity\n\nFor Ti:heaping of mathematical facts which no longer represent reality in any way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA feeling baby who has no thinking simply feels intensely. A thinking baby who has no feeling simply thinks.\n\nThinking inherently serves feeling, in the farthest breaches the feeling value attained is to the self purely(altruism doesn't exist so in all actuality all feeling is purely for the self, but some happiness of the self can be or possibly be intrinsically derived from the happiness of others. Perhaps them smiling is intrinsically beautiful to you).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSensation and Intuition give rise to thinking and feeling in the form of phantasy, derived from the intrinsic chasm which intrinsically exists between both extroverted functions and introverted functions(Te->infinity=/=Ti...Fe->infinity=/=Fi). Phantasy then is not a request for a change in information, but rather a feeling desire to achieve harmony between the self and others(as conflict is created by extraverted and introverted function differences). Phantasy is produced by intuition and sensing as an ideal goal in which feeling has found value, but relies on thinking to reach.\n\nTi and Te dominance is characterized then by a goal and enjoyment of reaching said goal\n\nFi and Fe dominance is characterized by an intense relatedness to feeling and an enjoyment of experiencing feeling(the ideal being to solely experience happiness).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFeeling is the end goal. But since more happiness is intrinsically the goal of feeling, and feeling goals cannot operate without thinking to influence its surroundings in the form of a practical goal, it cannot exist independently. The goal is then settled by intuition and sensing perceiving ideals which coincide with feeling. Feeling is not solely produced by perception functions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo put it more simply: Phantasy comes from perception functions, thinking serves fantasy in the form of practical goals, practical goals are chosen by feeling, and feeling without thinking can't achieve the phantasy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQuestions that remains: What are intrinsic strengths that arise from having a perception function as dominant and a judging function as dominant? I would assume a greater fortitude in seeking a goal, as a goal is not the primary drive of either perception function? Unless the perception function is only satisfied by the realization of the ideal(for extreverted functions?) I'm not sure. But marking the strengths of a judging dominant versus a perception dominant seems do-able(I have tended to label perception dominants as "creative" and judging dominants as "problem solving).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAdditionally, Jung writes "phantasies are also valueless since in the form of raw material they do not possess a realizable worth", i.e. without doing they are useless. To take it further though, if we extend where we are currently as a species, phantasies themselves are valueless entirely. In other words, thinking is useless as a subsidiary of phantasies(thinking achieves the feeling designated goal granted by phantasies), i.e. you arrive at thinking's uselessness in the long term(i.e. nihilism at "max happiness").
44	How does an ENTJ find a partner to love?	Being an ENTJ is very lonely.\n\nI cannot feel a deep emotional connection with anyone.\n\nThe main issue is that everyone feels stagnate and unwilling to evolve.\n\nI am constantly doing something, furthering or developing a current or new skill, and going down deep rabbit holes.\nBecause of this, who I am the next week or day changes constantly.\nI  learn and piece together a random collection of skills and knowledge to compose who I am.\n\nI find it odd how my peers waste time on their social media feeds, they have the internet, they never go out and search through to find intresting things. At the end of every day I always have a fascinating collection of images and some odd random information I learned.\n\nI get really bored with just about everyone as a result.\nI feel if I spend 5 minutes with someone, I kinda know who they are, and how they will react in any situation. That makes it boring. I want someone who changes all the time and subverts my exceptions sometimes.\nThey do have other parts to them, but they do not feel complex enough, not enough layers to them, to comb through and learn from.\n\nWhat is your advice to meet someone like me?
20	You're looking at people very shallowly.  5 minutes is a judgement of someone, you don't really, 'know' them.  Be curious, however realize too, that people aren't there purely for your own entertainment and use.  It sounds almost as if you want to see if someone is useful and if they aren't useful to YOU, then you want to write them off, people can tell when you are doing this, so you are very likely sending off these vibes very clearly to othrs. \n\nThe way you worded your last sentence, "What is your advice to *meet someone like me*?"  Why did you word it that way?  You make it sound as if you are someone that OTHER people would want to meet, and you are somehow at a higher status.  If you truly had an open mind you would have asked, "What advice do you have for someone like me to develop meaningful relationships?"  Your arrogance is showing.
12	If you teach me where to find female ENTJs, I'll teach you where to find female INTPs :3
10	Are you like...24 or so? Plainly, I think we take longer to develop emotionally than other people. You need to learn to care about yourself if you want to have a deep emotional connection to someone else. My guess is you subvert your brain thinking about who you are, why you got there, and how to fix yourself so you don’t actually have to think about it. Don’t drink, don’t smoke, don’t take on a new project. Take some time to be alone with your thoughts, even though it sucks, and actually process some of it. Just a guess.
14	Date someone in your Quadra (yours is gamma: ENTJ, INTJ, ESFP, or ISFP) and you won’t have communication problems. You share all the same functions, everything is natural and fun.\n\nIt took me way too long to realize this, so I’m saving you a bunch of wasted time. 👍
7	I found an amazing INTP online
3	Are you me??
7	INTP here. I want an ENTJ because I have all these ideas but no will to solidify them. I think an INTP would be a great match because I describe INTP's as "infinite people". I like to think we go on forever, inward, whereas, I hope ENTJ's go on forever, outward. To me it's important to have someone to take charge of life and real world situations while I guide them. Essentially "you be the captain, I'll be the compass" type of relationship. So maybe ask yourself what you value most in a partner, because you will never get it all. Is it intelligence? Kindness? Integrity? Compassion? Humility? 
2	I'm an Entp and all I can say is that make it a game. Gamify it. Ask a random stupid question that asks a person to make a decision that is indicative of what you want to find out. Ask why next. Then go and go and go.\n\nInteractions are boring if you make it boring. As a person who constantly feels bored, I suggest find a way to not get bored. Tho a forever love is kind of hard if you often get bored. Just look for interesting ppl don't look at their mbti but look at their interests. Interesting ppl don't always look or seem interesting the first time. Unless they're entps, then we're just naturally afraid of getting bored. 
2	If you are looking for partner whom will help you to expand, challenge you in totaly new ways and perspective, I’ll recommend you an INFP. I made huge progress on many levels important in the relationships in 1 year, more than I did in my past (boring/not challenging partner) for two decade.\nMy INFP found way to bring my soft nurturing side out and I’m relly enjoying it, I have feeling, first time in my life that I’m completely devoted to someone without any restraint and that is lovely.
2	I have dated an ENTJ, ESFP, ESFJ, ENFJ, INFJ, ESTJ, ISFP, and am currently now dating an INTP. You gotta know yourself to know what you want from others, especially in an intimate relationship. Communication is key. And so is being with someone who challenges you and feels strongly about you. \n\nDon’t confine yourself to specific types of people. You are a very complex creature and you should explore who you are as in depth as possible. Doing so will help you immensely with finding someone right for you 
2	Are you restrained by ideology? \n\nEx: You're a conservative and refuse to date liberals or vice-versa, maybe you're religious and refuse to date outside your religion...\n\n&#x200B;
2	Infj!!!
1	I read the first three sentences of your post and instantly thought: oh my god this is so true. \n\nI am still struggling and have still not settled with anyone I find to be a good match to spend the rest of my life with (I‘m turning 30 this year). So I can only give you my two cents on this: \n\nThe closest I came to find some sort of true fulfillment in personal relationships is with a person who wasn’t the same as me, rather an introverted version. He was an INTP btw, even though I believe that only going after a certain MBTI is ridiculous. \n
1	You have to keep trying and date people past what they show you on the surface or you’ll never have a deep connection. These things don’t happen instantaneously for the most part, they’re developed over time and mutual effort. Most people aren’t going to show you their “depth” early on depending on the age group you’re dating in. 
1	Everyone is complex and constantly changing. A lot of people, like INTPs, are private and keep that stuff to themselves. Just chill out and take care of yourself. Don't assume things about people's inner lives. It's ok to slow down and enjoy were you are in life. You don't have to be achieving something 24/7.\n\nI know this sounds ignorant, but y'all ENTJs should really try it out 😂
1	Haha interesting.  Thank you.  
1	Jaja, our pace is hard to keep; I’ve seen descriptions that ENTJ’s find hard to get a partner.\nIn my case, I look for someone to love, and share my passions, to have common passion and intelligence, so that I can make that person the happiest person ever. I think you should get out of your ego, and go and find someone you find interesting and intelligent, that actually will stimulate intellectually, and love you as you are; it’s hard, but not impossible. Try meanwhile to develop yourself and get to be a very interesting person. Once a person told me: “Don’t go and haunt butterflies, until you find some easy and not so hard to catch butterfly, they are generally not good quality; instead, get a beautiful garden, with beautiful flowers, so that the butterflies come to you and you’ll have the ability to choose”\nI know sounds like making women an object but in any shaper form, this assimilation is intended to show it. It’s more to explain, that on your path of succes, having a goal, a carrier, having a great life, girls will come automatically, and want to be part of that awesome adventure you are in, being contagious about your drive and desire in life, trust me, you’ll make your partner happy and viceversa, because you are worth to get the girl of your life.
1	Adolescent female ENTJ here. I feel your pain. I feel almost the exact same way. One things that is I found has helped me is trying to spot the INTP's and INTJS. When you research how to type them, it begins to get really easy to spot them. I have been able to identify friends/ suitors this way. I don't know what kind of ENTJ you are, but I have found some of my most rewarding connections to be very intelligent INFJ's, and INFP's. Some of them can be really annoying, but when you find a unique one, they are amazing listeners, and are able to give really good advice. I find it really easy to read people, as well, and am able to judge them within our first interaction. What works for me, is doing things I'm really passionate about, and watching people come to me. It might be worthwhile to read the 48 laws of power, it might help. What are you passionate about? Are you in college?
1	You gotta find a type that loves you for all the things that make you an ENTJ, like, say, an INTP :D Seriously, before meeting and falling head over heels for an ENTJ, I thought I was asexual or something. You guys bring out the romantic side of me that I didn't know existed. 
1	“I feel if I spend 5 minutes with someone, I kinda know who they are, and how they’ll react.” \n\nI get this feeling often too! It makes it seem unnecessary to engage in conversation because I already have a general idea of what they’ll say... so actually putting in effort to converse is a waste of energy... but if you come out and say that then you’re “pretentious and conceited.” \n\nBut it’s true. Most people really aren’t that deep. I’m not trying to say I’m “deep.”  Like the majority of people don’t “think” that much about their daily conversations and activities (me included). So it’s easy to mentally construct how any given situation would unfold... \n\nThe way I’ve overcome this is by getting close to REALLY weird/strange/interesting people. But there’s pros and cons to those relationships. Yes, they surprise you. But it’s not always in a good way!! \n\nBest of luck on your journey to love! 
1	Find an INTP, but they're really hard to find...probably because they're at home reading.
1	For me, dating has been the answer because I have new people to meet all the time. I don’t get bored and I feel like I grow as a person knowing others. 
1	During my "dating phase" I felt this extreme boredom when dating some people. However, I think that you can find interesting people regardless of their personality type.\nHaving said that, I'm currently in a 2 and a half year relationship with an ISTJ. We both love planning stuff (trips, holidays) and we are both extremely rational and, in my opinion, this works really well. \nHowever, I especially like the fact that he is extremely trustworthy and steady: I can always rely on him and I'm sure that he's loyal to me. In addition to this, ESTJ are extremely good at executing orders: I also have ESTJ friends and I love being around them, as they are as efficient as me.\n\n\nSo, to sum up, even if you feel like people are boring, I can assure you that, regardless of their personality type (ISTJs are depicted as the supreme incarnation of boredom), it's just a matter of finding someone who you think is interesting, according to your preference (for example, I admire someone who is passionate about their job).\n\n
8	Hello. ENTP here. I have a life goal that has constantly been at the back of my mind for well over 3 years now (maybe even longer). So i thought, "what better place to get advice on how to accomplish goals than from the masters themselves?" Do you ENTJs have any advice on achieving goals?	
12	If you’re a completer-finisher, you will achieve them yourself. If you’re not, utilise the people around you who are and offer value to that dynamic (don’t just take). 
5	Create daily habits that support that life goal. Do not deviate.  Track your accomplishments and milestones, even if they seem minor and celebrate them. Good luck. 
5	Sometimes big goals can seem too hurculean to accomplish, so many find breaking a big goal down into smaller achievable sub goals to be easier to accomplish. This gives you the chance to feel a sense of accomplishment along the way to the final goal, and make the goal seem reachable. 
3	Find the right people for the journey.  People who'll be realistic but supportive. I find my path to my goals falls apart more often over settling for someone on my support team when I can't find the right person as quickly as I wanted. I have learned to be patient putting together my team. 
2	Keep going at it until you complete it. 
2	David Goggins
1	Great Advice already!\n\nFor me I know truly if I will finish something before I start it, i also dont take on more things during say studying until I've finished what i started. Dont overburden yourself :)
1	Start slow, adding new healthy habits that will apparently help you reach your goal, then add on and on :D
7	What do you do when everything breaks, inducing yourself?	Things in my life have fallen apart in the past 3 months. \n\n* Got injured on the job, but Workers comp found BS reasons to not pay out (no lawyer would take the case either)\n* While I was bed bound, Work redesigned all the projects I was on\n* Was fired from work on Christmas eve\n* Injury prevents me from doing the Job I went to College for\n* Medical bills and Student loans have all but eaten away my savings\n* Unemployment are dragging their feet. \n* Depression and pain prevent me from working on any meaningful personal projects.\n\nI’m having issues finding a solution to this question: What do you do when everything breaks? Do any of my fellow ENTJ know how to redirect a life from rock bottom, or maybe a direction I can look for answers (that preferably don't involve divine intervention )? I’m not looking for sympathy, Just a direction. \n
5	For me? The first thing was to realize that none of it made me a failure, and this was probably the hardest thing to do. I was so sure I'd screwed up somehow, and the anger at myself eclipsed everything else. \n\nI think toxic positivity really is a thing, and does a whammy on ENTJs. We get so comfortable not feeling that when there's simply too much emotion to box up and stick in the mental attic, we turn all our external frustrations on ourselves, because if we're feeling, it's because we're weak.  We don't give ourselves room to feel anger, depression, self loathing... anxiety is pretty normal for many of us. \n\nThe first step for me is to actually look at myself and fix where I can, identify what I can't, and ask for help with the latter. List out what you need to survive, and add a few things you need to thrive.  Put them in order of importance, then look at resources line by line. Forgive yourself for needing help. I promise it's ok. 
2	Come hell or high water, stay calm.  Start with a To-Do list and start fixing the smallest issues first.  Go back to the basics like sleeping early, waking up early, creating a routine and start working on your To-Do list.  
2	What did you study in college and what was the injury?\n\n> While I was bed bound, Work redesigned all the projects I was on\n\nWhat does this mean and why is it relevant?\n\nIn the short term you could e-beg on the internet.\n\nYou could also try making a ton of stink on say Youtube in hopes that the video goes viral. Most of the journalists are liberal. Michael Moore ought to jump on your case. I'm only half-joking. You have to have solid evidence on your side though.\n\nIf you can type, you can probably code. That's what I do but I learned it relatively young. A lot of people work from home these days. Not all IT work requires a lot of training. There is also a lot of online marketing to be done for ok $ but I do not understand this stuff.\n\n> Depression and pain prevent me from working on any meaningful personal projects.\n\nCan you get on disability? There are a ton of separate govt programs out there. You can always get off them.\n\nAre you in the US? Protect your downside ASAP by e-begging in the short term and having govt to pay for your very basic needs. Then hustle for online gigs, preferably using cash payments. Once you have stabilized, go up from there.\n\nYour health is probably \#2 priority after solving the cash flow problem.\n\nDo not get addicted to painkillers. Maybe weed can help you. If so, save a ton of $ by growing your own. It is going to be legal in just about every state soon.\n\nYou have a bag of dicks stuck in your ass right now and you've got to pluck them all out ... one at a time. They need to be prioritized though.\n\nThere is nothing cool about giving up on life so you might as well pretend to be a movie hero who overcame obstacles.\n\nYou need a variant of https://www.huffingtonpost.com/matthew-ricketts/aviate-navigate-communica_b_3563570.html except that asking this question on Reddit was a smart move and technically it is communication.\n\nP.S.\n\n* Workers comp filed and rejected because 'pre-existing injury' and they 'can't tell i was hurt at work'.\n* I didn't know I had a pre-existing injury till after I was fired.\n\nWhat pre-existing injury are we talking about? How could you not know about it?\n
1	Capitalise on the internet and pitch yourself as a virtual worker (like a VA), freelancer or consultant which you can all do from home or in bed. Getting back up as soon as possible helps, when life has been unfair and it all goes wrong. Makes you feel empowered and confident that it couldn't "kick you over". I can't say i've been messed around by work as you, but i've had some awful work experiences that knocked me around, and that's when I decided entrepreneurship was for me and I discovered there's a whole world of people working from home who charge good money for their services.   \n\n\nI'm an infp, but I hope this practical advice helps. I definitely empathise with you \*e-hugs\* 
1	I would say get a long time plan. Do you know when you will be cured? If you do, take loans or any job from home you can. Don’t waste your time (although that depends on the disability of course). \n\nSo, if you know when or around what time you are getting well, start looking for options and maybe even call those future jobs. Tell them, “listen, I have this disability right now... is there any possibility in getting there a job when I am cured in....).\n\nThat’s about all I can advice, but remember, do not waste your time. Regardless (almost) of your illness, there must be something you can do.\n\nOh, and also, of course, do whatever you need to get well. This is your life and yours alone, so if you want to make it good, you have to put effort.\n\nFurthermore, there is nothing wrong with getting an illness. I myself was in a death-risk one and still am living my life normally just two years after it happened. It’s just a normal incident, anything can happen to anyone; that’s out of our control. But what IS in your control is what you do about it.\n\nAnd also, about the jobs and them firing you, I don’t really know what exactly happened but - TOO BAD FOR THEM, they lost someone they shouldn’t have lost. And in any case, this can be the opportunity for you to take an even better job with a better salary and more fulfilment.\n\nOh yh, and I would suggest, talk to people who have gone through the same thing as you and how the overcame it (although normally they don’t give any good advice, but at least it’s good to socialise).\n\nFinally, don’t worry, this things happen but there is a lot of beautiful things in the future waiting for you - and only you can make them happen.
1	Turn your major into a niche. Become an expert on one or two big problems people have in the niche. Find these people, one by one at first, using phone and internet and help them solve their problems. Learn everything you can from the process. Acquire testimonials. If you have the funds, invest in marketing and develop a personal brand as the visible expert in the field. Make sure your cost to acquire a new client that needs your consulting services is less than what they pay you for the solution. Keep reinvesting the income into improving your marketing. Keep connecting to more clients and continue to master your niche. When you Improve your expertise, you improve your service as a consultant. Very straightforward. If you build enough momentum the engine will keep running and you will have more wiggle room to scale your consulting agency and turn it into a personal media platform, where the cost of entry is low for potential clients to get to know you and the value you provide, at their own pace and on their own timeline. Use your experience and expertise to develop an online course that provides your niche with a framework to solve their own problems. Set the course as a premium product for those who really need the extra help. Hire someone to close for you while you continue to invest in your superior expertise and wisdom in the niche, invest in your marketing and scale further by training “coaches” or “leaders” in the community who can assist all new potential clients with the online training without you needing to be there. Hire someone to run the company while you step into the next phase as a Celebrity Authority in the community and host events where you pass on your wisdom, do public speaking, write multiple books, etc. Whatever interests you most. At that point you’re probably making 6 figure income (or more, if you’re into that). You can retire comfortably if you invest your bonus income wisely. \n\nWhat you don’t know, you can pay to learn. \nWhat you don’t need to know, you can pay someone else to do. \n\nAbove all, commit to increasing your clarity just a little every day. 5 minutes in the morning or in the evening. Clarify what you need, what your goals are, what interests you, and the challenges you face. \n\nWhen you can describe your goals with great specificity and conviction....well I’m sure you’ve been familiar with that kind of headspace before! It’s just a matter of getting back on the horse. \n\nI’ve been rock bottom, man. I kinda started there. \n\nI’ve suggested an option for you to become an Internet consultant. It’s one of those kinds of opportunities where continuing your self education pays off Big Time. It’s where having a strong sense of clarity about what you need, what you want, what you like and what you must face positions you to lead others who are similar to you. It is rewarding work if you do it for the right reasons, and has long term viability that very few college degrees can ever promise, if they offer anything at all. It also is a way for you to get more value from what you studied, because it gives you a big head start and there is no pain about lost time. \n\nSolving One problem for One person can be evolved into a world-class skill if you work harder smarter and NOBODY has the unique experiences you have. Hence becoming a Visible Expert via your Personal Brand. Social media is very conducive to this. It also helps by making it easy to form communities and groups and targeted marketing, perfect for an ambitious expert consultant in ______....well you know your niche. It’s you, the problems you’ve solved in your field, and especially what most ignore, neglect or don’t know how to solve. \n\n\nUp to you what to do of course. I’m not an internet consultant, full disclosure. I don’t really have a niche, so the system won’t work for me. I never specialized in anything until recently and I went for developing a different high income skill. \n\nConsulting is a great high income skill if you have a niche. \n\nI’m a high ticket closer. Another possible option to look into. \n\nIf you like writing and have a way with words (and even if you may not) Copywriting can be pretty lucrative (bonus if you can corner a niche you love to write about!)\n\nProgramming is a high income skill, but to get it there you still need to learn the consulting skill. So that’s something to keep in mind. \n\nPublic speaking and event hosting are some more examples of high income skills. I don’t know as much about these. \n\nI recommend anything on the internet, anything that requires (and is missing) good leadership, improving communication, or anything using your powerful analytical skills (Te) and deep archetypal insight (Ni) to impact the world (Se) according to your authentic values (Fi). \n\nI apologize for the disorganized response, I’m a bit pressed for time so I’m just unloading what comes to mind that I think might be useful or helpful somehow. \n\nYou are experiencing a wicked problem in the system. Nobody should have to find themselves in such a situation. But who will do something about it? I think it’s obvious that major problems are solved by the people who suffer from them the most. Maybe that’s a good thing...I don’t really know. \n\nBest to you. \nKeep going 💪
1	Relax dude, in an infinite(Or at least really really large) world I'm sure there's something you can do. A little more information would go a long way though. What did you study in college? Do you have any hobbies or such that you are good at? What injury did you get on the job? What was the BS reason that was given to you?
5	How do I approach an ENTJ? (INTP asking)	Hi everyone. I've read that our types are  compatible but I've never really met one of you guys to test it out. Here is the next best place to find you, so I have a few questions that I can't seem to figure out on my own. Please be gentle and objective.\n\nHow do I spot one of you in the wild?\nHow do I approach one of you without turning you off?\nWhat turns you off anyway?\nWhat would you look for in a relationship?\nY
12	What turns me off the most I would say is incompetence,  when a discussion of ideas becomes overly emotional, or when I can sense someone backing out of a discussion for fear of saying anything controversial.  I like people who have the balls to put their ideas on display, but more importantly, people who also have the ability to defend their ideas from criticism and demonstrate they have actually put some thought in to where they stand.  I also love it when people aren't afraid to challenge me and my ideas and try to find flaws in my thinking.\n\nIt's hard for me to say how to spot us in the wild, I havent met many other ENTJs, but when it comes to approaching us, just be sincere I would say.  Avoid meaningless small talk as well.  I dont give a shit what you think of the weather, or about the Oscars.
3	As a general rule, I’m friendly and approachable. I do like people despite my lack of initial conversation. I think personally what I can’t stand are questions about ‘the weather’ or how my weekend went, I struggle with the mundane and want to know more about the other person first. If you’re interesting, or funny, I’ll find that out pretty quickly and give you more of my time. Introvert or not :) 
3	I’m adding a contrasting voice to the comments I’ve seen here so far. \n\nI don’t mind small talk. Building rapport can be sketchy and it’s a neutral talking point to get a feel for each other. I LOVE the sky, so I’m always looking at it (Se) and it affects how I feel (SeFi). So questions about the weather are fine by me 😏. But it’s become such a cliche icon for boring conversation that nobody really wants to talk about it anymore. \n\n———\n\nMy advice for approaching an ENTJ is to know exactly what you want from the interaction and then just come up and say it to your ENTJ. Yeah we can read between the lines and decipher all of the implicit meaning of what is said and what is not-said, but who has time for that? 🙄 Straight up, honest and sincere is the way to go. \n\nAnd if you’re looking for an ENTJ life partner, the nonverbal communication always develops over time, as you establish the set of memes you both readily understand and can use to communicate. All the more important to be straight up, honest and sincere in communication at the beginning. 
3	With me you have to be super engaging (as a female ENTJ) and really fun to be with. Show interest for me and I will show interest for you - It’s a give and take for me. Also, show me you are intelligent (of course don’t brag) and just be yourself and let your charm come through. \n\nOh, and also, be able to respond to everything I say, because if it’s only me pulling the conversation, I will become bored
1	Subtle and engaging 
1	"Gentle"? From an INTP? Are you a girl? I(ntp) am put off by this "gentle" let alone my shadow beasts.
1	[deleted]
1	I'm a straight shooter, so someone with clear intention is the best approach to me. 
1	•How to Spot: Go to a college classroom (Tech or Business careers) the most awkward yet respected (also intelligent) and with great leadership/body language skills... That’s your ENTJ (88%sure, 12%:may also be an ENTP or ESTP)\n•How to not make us run away: Be yourself!!! and challenge us with rare ideas with some need of problem solving.
1	We as ENTJ’s like challenge; if you once for all offer yourself as super available, we’ll get bored because of your easiness to conquer. Instead, if you tease, and show as you aren’t as available, and you are loosable, and not available 24/7, It’ll caught our attention, and see in conquering that person as a new goal in mind. We are tough, we don’t like easy or no effort stuff. Idk if you’re a man or a girl, but if you’re a man and you want to approach an ENTJ girl, try to be super natural, just showing interest, being high value, but being able to loose if they don’t hurry up. Imagine this, you offer yourself on a gold plate, either she receives it or not; if she accepts you and gets your attention, good for you, but if she is just not that into you, don’t loose your time and move to the another one; there’s nothing more exhausting to any person in the universe, but mostly for we ENTJ’s to be chased, we get soooo overwhelmed. It isn’t that you’re unattractive, or somehow low value, it’s just that there isn’t chemistry enough to get into something; you aren’t her type man.
1	I guess you can find us throwing people with facts 80% of the time lol
1	Don't be boring, engage, be competent, direct, & willing to take direction and advice. Don't necessarily start by asking me a bunch of questions about myself or something simple (boring), talk about you, let me pick out tid bits of info that allow me to further probe your mind. 
0	Half-naked
9	Question from an INFP	One of my best friends in an ENTJ, which has caused us to have some trouble in the past. However, we've both grown & matured as people, & generally get along pretty well now.\n\nHowever, I wanted to ask all of you ENTJs if there's anything that inherently annoys you about INFPs? I want our friendship to continue to go smoothly, & would attempt to change any annoying habits you've noticed in INFPs around him. Anyway, thanks for your replies & hope you have a great day!!
16	I like the username.  \n\nEmotional without taking actions to solve the problem.  
13	As far as INFP goes, the "Manic pixie dream girl" stops being cute very quickly.\n\nAlso sulking. Nothing annoys me like sulking does.
10	Making requests or bids for attention in an indirect or non-specific way.
9	playing the victim card 
6	I think I have encountered and been in community with both healthy and very unhealthy INFPs. The more healthy INFPs I know are people I look up to greatly. The advice I would love to give to unhealthier ones pertains to how oblivious they are to how their action/inaction affects others. I have known a couple in particular who don't recognize the hypocrisy in their expectations of others. They can let little things bother them but don't afford others the same idiosyncratic accommodation. So, I don't know if this applies to you, but if you encounter friction with other people -- and especially your ENTJ friend -- take extra time to consider the possibility that you might be more responsible for the friction than you realize.
6	As someone in a relationship with one who has known several healthy and unhealthy INFP, what's most annoying is how common it is for them to have poor emotional intelligence. INFP and ISFJ score lowest in EQ and it holds true in my experience that they tend to be lacking when it comes to relationship management, self-management, social and self-awareness, etc. When they aren't, they're great.\n\n They can cause friction with others, often lack skills when it comes to dealing with emotions. At times rely on others to help them in areas they're lacking, but aren't good if others need them whether they care or not. Sometimes won't see how they've messed up and blame someone else for it, but yet still feel bad that it *is* messed up, and have little idea how to practically solve it. Or annoying blame *themselves* past the point anyone else even cares.\n\nOften disorganised and bad at doing what's most efficient or practical with their inferior Te being really poorly developed (causing them to make poor judgements without realising it), and can easily get hypocritical and have expectations of (and criticism of) others they don't do better with themselves (like u/blahprath says).
1	A bit more technical, but INFP have Fi dominating over Te, and ENTJ has the reverse, Te dominating over Fi. \n\nI believe that in a healthy relationship this could be a wonderful combination. However in most cases I’ve encountered it, the flip flop causes a great deal of miscommunication. \n\nI recommend connecting your extroverted perceiving functions first. Use Ne to highlight your ENTJ’s Se experiences when you are having fun together. The more you can get your ENTJ to relax and enjoy Living In The Moment, the closer you will get to their least conscious function, Fi. \n\nYuuuuup. That’s the INFP’s most conscious function, which can really, really suck if you push the wrong buttons your ENTJ might say goodbye and never look back. \n\nSomething else from the flip side, Te. If you can learn to appreciate the “brutal honesty”, you will improve as an individual and develop trust and respect between each other. If your ENTJ has to walk on eggshells around you it is only a matter of time until they grow weary of you. \n\nPerceive together. Ne-Se, when you’re leading the fun. ENTJs like for someone else to take the lead once in a while too 😏. Ni-Si could work too, though I’m not familiar with how that kind of dynamic would play out. Maybe you reminiscing about old times and letting your ENTJ weave a yarn about it? Or writing a fictional alternate history together, if that’s your cup of tea. \n\nThe important part is, do whatever is fun for both of you and let those moments of connection be your anchor for the times when things aren’t going so smoothly. 
1	1. Laziness\n2. Bad planners\n3. Poor communicators\n4. Sometimes, I don't want to talk about my emotions with you\n5. Non-confrontational\n6. Don't understand why ENTJ's get angry so quickly\n7. Getting drained really quickly, and then not talking when we hang out\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry these are super duper blunt. The INFP I know is quite immature, and I don't know you, but these are just some things to keep in mind.
15	Why arr ENTJs so formal online?	I'm a big fan of watching tv shows and then trying to type all characters in the show. The one type I consistently get tripped-up on are the ENTJs. Because truth be told my ENTJ aquintences are all coworkers on their best behavior. As well as people I bump into online. But what happened to the brash, sassy, sometimes delusional, sometimes overly arrogant and cocky leaders who **do troll people irl**. At least online you all seem so "put together".\n\nI'm wondering about some traits that seem to show up in certain characters that tend towards significant confusion for me. Namely where there are the ExTx traits. ENTJs seem to have similar shared traits to ENTPs, ESTJs and ESTPs. But for whatever reason the level of sassy humor seems to fall behind these other three types in practice.\n\nWhat I mean is that I don't see many meme posts in r/ENTJ. I rarely see people labled ENTJ giving any sort of creative answer or quip. And the discussions here seem pretty tame for the most part. \n\nNow I'm not saying that you all should be joking 24/7 or calling each other rude names but I was under the impression that there was at least *more* underlying cocky or even arrogantly playful attitude within the ENTJ with their tert Se.\n\nSo I'm wondering if anyone noticed this and finds it peculiar. And two, do you guys think that in general you're more dull online than you are in person? I mean for the type that is **consistently considered to be a leader of men** (second only to ESTP) I would expect more personality than I see here (no offense to any of you)\n\nThen I figured that perhaps the ENTJ Se is just something that doesn't manifest itself via text or gets too many downvotes and buried most of the time. But honestly whenever I see a buried post it's never a Te-DOM. And people downvote those who speak against tye group or are too blunt/rude. But for some reason it doesn't happen with you guys.\n\nNow I'm sure you all know that INTJ forums and ENTP forums are a bit of a cluster and have an abundance of personality and edginess. Good for you r/ENTJ for not devolving into that sort of shitfest. But I almost never see bad apples among this group and if there are it's generally some downvoted INTJ or xNTP making some kind of controversial (or just plain dumb/trolling) statement.\n\nAnd I can probably say the same for ESTJs. It's no nonsense. Yet, going back to my original point I can think of some ENTJs at least in fiction who would certainly be downvoted if they had reddit accounts.\n\nJust off the top of my head:\nOlenna Tyrell\nDennis Reynolds\nEric Cartman\nNick Fury\n\nSo this got me wondering...are the ENTJs and ESTJs just on their best behavior? Are you guys trying to respond to comments in ways that ensure upvotes? If you disagree with someone's comment do you just ignore them? It seems like the modus operendi is only respond when you know your comment makes sense and isn't controversial. \n\nYou may argue this is rational and pragmatic. And 100% I agree. But my understanding has always been that Te-DOMs love their debates and like to critique and make jokes, **even at the expense of being likeable whereas the Ti-DOMs keep the peace due to their Fe** You see all the ExTx do this but for whatever reason online the Te users just opt-out. Thoughts?
39	Being an ENTJ is horribly isolating.  No one in real life gets you, the Te is horribly offputting for people, so you spend all day controlling it so you don't offend someone you need later. You're always asking "did I accidentally asshole this convo or are they just having a bad day" or trying not to say "the reason I don't like you is you're a lazy shit who can't ever do anything right." The real world is a minefield of potentially pissing people off, and humor maybe helps us avoid a few. \n\nThis forum is, for many of us, the ONE place we make sense to other people. If we have a serious ENTJ moment, it's understood and doesn't traumatize/offend anyone.  We can actually let the Te out for a serious stroll in this forum and it's a damn relief. 
22	ESTPs are leaders of men? Are you exercising your humor in this post? \n\nI think you’re serious about your claims, and if that’s the case, then you jump to conclusions without having a holistic view of the phenomena. I don’t think you’ve mastered anything in your life yet. If you had, you wouldn’t make such strong claims without backing them up, or without a qualifier. \n\nFor instance, If you had said - “I think ESTP can be great leaders”, you’d be taken more seriously.  \n\nThere’s your brash, abrasive, arrogant response. 🙃
9	Why do ESTPs talk too much?
8	Imo the humour of ENTJs is very dry and quick whereas memes are usually a little cheesy and brash. \n\nI’m an ENTJ and if people tell me I’m funny it’s usually after an offbeat or irreverent comment, which is rarely how you’d describe a meme.\n\nMy ex was also an ENTJ (apparently - though I suspect ESTP that’s misdiagnosed) and he would only ever use humour as a putdown or to make himself superior, so maybe the isolation that the other comment accurately described can sometimes push E_T_s to use humour as a defence?
6	On sites like forums and reddit I tend to write way more formally than I normally do since I use them for discussion when I'm bored and have nothing better to do, and to lurk and read whatever I see that looks interesting. I tend to argue with people if I see something I think is incorrect, put thought into what I write, etc. I also generally enjoy debating, writing formally, and so on to begin with but obviously there's not many outlets for that sort of thing unless you do it for a living or enjoy acting like an asshole (or both).\n\nIf I wanted chit chat, memes, or to joke around, I'd hit up friends rather than post somewhere like here. I don't consider myself very serious or formal at all, but I just don't care that much to let loose on a place like reddit around strangers. mostly sounds boring and pointless to me.\n\nSometimes I make quips replying to people, but I rather link a friend the post and make it, + then I don't have to pay attention to the overly sensitive rules most sites have these days. If you let Se out it gets you banned easily. I've been warned and told it's "insulting" someone and to even call them *ignorant* (how harmless is that?!) and explain why, let alone express the sarcastic remarks, dark humour, or "offensive" jokes I think of.\n\nand on a place like r/entj you'll get selection bias. Almost all the threads are serious, and often non-ENTJs asking for advice or talking about work, there's not very many "creative" or less serious threads. You get a thread like that ENTJ appreciation post the other day and it's just a non-ENTJ saying how much they like *working* with ENTJ lol. Maybe if people stopped treating us like we're so serious and expecting it, and encouraging the stereotypes, we'd have more opportunity to go against it.
11	Let’s try this. An ENTJ inherently sees other people’s flaws and often he/she believes that people should be always seeking to perfect themselves by all means necessary. Online, we have time to think and to scrutinize. people often welcome the analysis and scrutiny because it’s about serious discussion. We move the conversation forward. \n\nQuips and funny comments are great and all, but, the typical ENTJ will see a person who’s contributed those quips as nonsensical, unable or incapable of contributing something worthwhile (due to our experiences with seeing that same flaw in many people) or as someone who doesn’t care to help the subject along. We, typically, believe that learning is a worthwhile pursuit and those who don’t care to achieve that are particularly waste, and awaiting natural selection to pick them off.  \n\nI as an ENTJ am usually pretty serious in general. I love to laugh and I have an incredibly wide sense of humor from deadpan to utter morbid as fuck. But, if I’m not queued up to play around, and instead start with something of interest to me or something that I want to gain some insight in, I will not generally make those type of comments you mentioned before. Get me in a row where we make fun of each other or making up jokes or stories, I’m game. But start me in a conversation of interest, and I’ll put that aside and get annoyed at others who try to distract the conversation because I’m dead set on getting the information I want. \n\nSo it’s not that we parade ourselves on reddit as being serious all the time, or that we can’t or don’t like to joke around. We insert ourselves into conversations we are genuinely interested in and we love helping others to achieve the same insights we gain or sharing that even, like I’m doing right now. \n\nIf you want to talk about other MBTI’s, you will need a lot more experience with them, and correctly identifying them to boot, before you start to compile your own conclusions. I have a group of friends that love the MBTI and we share our thoughts and conclusions with one another constantly. We are ten in total, and each of us are a different type—we met online. From that we’ve been a little better at typing others and keeping the temperaments separate but we’re still far off from getting it perfectly down. \n\nTo correct your ESTP mishap, ESTP’s tend to be very showy. They like to perform for others to then gain their admiration, respect, and in somewhat more observable cases, attention. They quickly seek loyalty from their acquaintances and try to protect an image that they care to mold and shape for themselves. Now, this could be a reason for why you’ve typed some an ESTP as someone who likes to take charge, but that’s not nearly what’s happening there. They’ll usually act out enough to give you that idea and then they’ll move onto the next person they want attention from to think the same of them as you do, but they won’t actually perform in that way for themselves. If there’s no social value in acting, there’s generally less incentive for the ESTP to act.\n\nAn ENTJ on the other hand is not focused on the attention and almost always act on self-interest until more emotionally matured, after which an ENTJ will focus on the benefits of others so that both the ENTJ and the other are benefited. \n\nSo, as a direct answer to your question, and if you thought TL;Dr fuck yourself, we’re not formal, our way of speech online is just direct and to the point because we want information returned to us in the same way that’s just as easy to access and comprehend. 
4	I mean I wouldn't mind if others posted relevant and funny memes in here. 
4	Of all types, we're the closest to the prim and proper English Tea Party scene. 
3	" modus operendi is only respond when you know your comment makes sense-"  \n\n\nThe only thing that really jumped out at me.   \n\n\nDo you make comments that you know don't make sense? 
3	I haven't read any other comments, but I will just say that it is *EXHAUSTING* to attempt to educate every goddamn moron I meet irl, not to mention online. It's a big waste of time, especially if I've already debated their viewpoint with someone else. And most people cannot help me evolve my argument, because they get stuck on things I deem unimportant (like "how it's always been"). \n\n\nOk for instance, before gay marriage was legalized, I gave a persuasive speech that marriage should no longer be recognized as a "thing" by the government, and rather we should recognize all elective domestic partnerships as having the same rights that married people have now.\n\n\nSo a mom and daughter that have lived together for over 50 years can share health insurance and stuff.  Anyways gay marriage is legal and that above argument is therefore uninteresting, but when I would try to explain it to people, they got so upset. I told them that they could still call their partnerships "marriages" and they would still sign a document, it's just that that document would be inclusive of other types of domestic partnerships that may need the same rights.\n\n\nAnd no one understood. Ever. \n\n\nAnd so after a while, unless I hear a truly unique position, I just won't respond. It's not worth my energy to debate a possible Russian operative. \n\n\nAs for the art and stuff, I mean I see rooms in r/AmateurRoomPorn that I am sure are ENTJs. I have a painting I'm working on right now, but I don't feel very motivated to post it here because, while it might be just "nice" to see art here, my brain is looking for *ideas through words*. I wanna read about people, and I assume others with my type are similarly inclined. We are comparing and contrasting our experiences, while also giving each other life tips and generally trying to be helpful and caring. It seems like a warm community to us, but yeah we could decorate. 
2	You guys aren't really formal if you're talking with someone you're comfortable with.\n\nJust my 2 cents.
1	We are known by having good sense of humor, but when we are on serious mode, we get super annoyed when people don’t get serious. \nWhen I’m arguing about some serious topic, and suddenly someone gets a joke off, I just make eye contact of “Wtf dude, get serious”, and sometimes people ask me to not be so serious in life but i don’t care, that’s us.\nThough, when we are on our chill mood, we don’t take life seriously, like, nothing. I’d agree saying that ESTJ’s are much more serious and nonsarcastic than ENTJ’s, they just don’t have that flirty or charming vibe that we ENTJ’s have.
7	Hi. So just out of curiosity, what do ENTJs mean by winning?	
14	When nothing has authority over me.  
11	Benevolent domination.
3	Being right.
6	Just out of curiosity, what are you talking about? 
4	Two chicks at the same time.
2	Winning is getting the result I want.
2	Being the best, at the top and commanding everyone beneath
3	Freedom Not to Act	
1	If you are going to brainwash people, then shorter clips like this one would do better.\n
12	Outside of video games and board games, what do you like to compete in?	I'm looking for predominantly intuitive areas of competition that involve problem solving and analysis. Video games are great...so great in fact, that I got nerve damage. So now I can't play them.\n\nBoard games are next. Is there any other competition based activities similar? ENTJ and INTP are very similar in what they enjoy, so I'm wondering what you enjoy competing in. Maybe something a little more movement based/bodily?\n\nOf course there is always the competition of the marketplace too.
16	Dick size and income, of course.
6	Wait do most ENTJ’s like games? I swear I am an ENTJ and I agree with you guys on almost everything except this. I’m not competitive with things that don’t hold any long term value. I couldn’t care less about winning games and I often times don’t even start the game!
5	I know you said video games but I don’t know if this includes the competitive scene, as in eSports. I am into competitive Smash and take it very seriously.
3	I do GORUCK events, team based endurance events, which teach practical leadership and problem solving under stress. \n\nThat being said. Not exactly what you were asking for, but it’s one of the many things I do. 
3	Sup Frank
3	Magic the Gathering and debating.
3	Chess is fucking amazing. I'm always happy to introduce more people to this fabulous game. I especially love mentoring others into becoming better players because it seriously helps me improve as well.\n\nKeep in mind that I'm only an intermediate strength player, I have a long long way to go, but I'd be more than happy to teach you chess.\n\n
2	Cash, money, hoes
2	It’s more our intuition.  If your boss looks like a tool and then acts like one, and is just there to fill a role for their image instead of getting the job done.  That will get under my skin.  At that point all respect goes down the drain and that person means nothing to me.
2	For Board Games, i would destroy anyone in Monopoly. Otherwise I love having debates about life, politics and technology
1	Advanced Badminton because it's as if you combined chess into a sport. Been playing for 7 years and became a coach.
1	basketball, debates, videogames (videogames come in many shapes and sizes.. u can play turnbased - not sure what the nerver damage limitations are)  
1	Sword fighting 
1	I once was in a high level training program and was forced to take this mtbi test (didn’t know what it was at the time).  I answered as less aggressively as possible because I didn’t know what they were looking for and I didn’t want to raise eyebrows.  I got INTP lol.  I fooled them because I fucking hate authority.

1	I want to hear/read other opinions from people that seem to have put a lot of thought into their opinions so I can better create my own opinions. I want to be aware and check my biases and convictions because it makes me a better person.\n\nOf course I will ignore most of those that use insulting language or who have very obvious and dominating prejudices. I will and have blocked people I think are trolls or who cannot face any sort of civil discussion.\n\nI want my views and opinions challenged as long as it's in a respectful manner (and depending on the situation, even if it's not).
1	 > i think people can change\n\nThey can but many do not, and you can't force them. People inherently change as part of life, but you can't control how. You can try to influence by presenting perspectives and facts and just hope for the best. At the end of the day, you can't force thoughts into the other person's gray matter. And if they don't want to actually listen to what anyone is saying, your words won't change their mind. \n\nI do agree though, we'd all do a lot better on social media if we stop in-fighting and focus on presenting well defined goals that groups can agree on. So much of the gross and petty behaviour online in 201X is two groups both claiming to fight each other, but are actually fighting strawmen that hardly exist with a nameplate of the other group hastily glued on.\n\nEdit: PS, the block button is your friend. Don't block someone for disagreeing, but readily block anyone that wants to spit venom or argue. Arguing gets you nowhere, discussion is progressive. Changing someone's entire outlook on life or personality/instincts is beyond the scope of your ability. So, block and move on.

37	ENTJ appreciation post	I‘ll be sharing my experience with an ENTJ in the following. I‘m an ENTP myself.\n\nWorking on a project with an ENTJ is the best experience ever. And I think the combination of ENTP and ENTJ can really be a **powerful** one.\n\nSo here‘s the story:\n\nI was worrying about something, and told my ENTJ friend about it. She gave me advice about what we could do about it. I found the idea quite good, so we started brainstorming about it. Within 15 minutes, we had already come up with an extremely good strategy &amp; plan. She was kind of giving an outline to the idea, and I was elaborating on every point she was making with my ideas. The more we talked the better our plan got.\n\nAfter everything‘s been said and done, I would usually forget about it and don‘t take it seriously enough and postpone it to next year or so. But then she actually told me „So when are we going to meet up?“. I was shocked, since usually I don‘t ever get to that point. I thought she‘s talking about starting in a few months after our semester is over or so, but then she asked me „How about next week?“. I found it quite crazy, but since I was pleasantly surprised I agreed. I mean why not?\n\nSince then we‘ve been meeting up every week, and unlike every other person I‘ve been working with up until now, I don‘t have to be the one always reaching out first and having to get the other people‘s asses moving and the only one contributing with value/input. She was equally dedicated as me and it went extremely smooth. Since usually that part exhausts me the most, that‘s why I avoid working with others.\n\nAlso usually with other people, I‘m the only one generating ideas and trying to make some progress. But with her, we‘re equally involved in making good progress every time, and she also contributes with amazing knowledge and gives my ideas some sort of structure and suggests ways to implement them, which I never got from other people.\n\nThe only downside where I felt the difference was, when she brought an outline of a previous project, and told me we should stick to those instructions/structure. I found that limiting, since I think one cannot freely brainstorm if we have to stick to a plan. I suggested we brainstorm first, then bring some structure to all the ideas. She then went along with my opinion. But that‘s about all disagreement there ever was. We now have come up with a plan for a project which will continue for probably 30-40 years. Since we elaborated so much on it that it became quite a serious idea. \n\nConclusion:\n\nI love working with her. It‘s amazingly productive and not exhausting at all. We‘re making lots of progress every time and we‘re both giving equally much and qualitative input when we discuss about it. None of us have to drag the other along.
19	It’s what we do. You ENTPs aren’t too bad either
14	Dang where can I find myself an ENTP? 😏
9	I Love ENTPs, you guys are awesome.
7	Working on a start-up with an ENTJ. The ENTJ-ENTP combo is lethal, together we are invincible
3	I’m an ENTJ married to an ENTP. It works. We’re a good team.
3	Glad to hear. :) 
3	My right hand man is an ENTP and we come up with solutions on the fly.  It's very rewarding.  \n\n\nIt's because they complement our TeNi with their TiNe.

4	What is the comparative advantage of diving deep(Ti) vs patchwork	I've written a post here about INTP problem solving:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/aqp7o9/an_explanation_of_intp_problem_solving/\n\nInside the comments I explain it more simply as well for someone who didn't understand.\n\n\n\nWith these posts in mind I would ask: what is the relative advantage of diving deep into cause and effect vs doing surface level patchwork?\nTo explain this a little better imagine you have a system of:\n\nA->B->C->D with "->" representing "causes."\n\nFrom this system I want high amounts of variable D. If my input is low A then it causes high B which causes low C which causes low D. \n\nIf my input it high A then it causes low B->high C->high D which is good.\n\nMy question is that even if A is the fundamental causation factor, it doesn't necessarily imply that the cost of "fixing"/altering A will be any higher or lower than the cost of altering any of the other middle variables. So yes, fixing A will cause all of the other variables to fall into place, but what if fixing A costs millions while fixing its biproduct "amount B" costs only hundreds? In other words, while yes within "A->D" A is the problem input, it doesn't mean you can't alter B or C or even D more cheaply than A.\n\n\n\n\nIs diving deep simply allowing someone to have these options available which increases problem solving capabilities?\n\nI compare it to Te because I have heard Te can be VERY good at temporary patchwork solutions on the effect variables within a cause/effect system.
4	You're basically talking about law of diminishing returns.  However time is a major factor IRL situations.  How much time should you allot to fixing this issue?  In competitive environments, one can only choose the best option within a time constraint and thus it may look like patchwork.
3	Yeah I like INTPs, the meticulousness, the robotic nature, detailed solutions, and no need to cater.  A dream come true.   
2	Hoo lucky you! Someone already went through all of this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n INTP: Logic of anti-synthesis, of finalized stable systems. Finding the counterweight, the opposite pole. Isolation of "pure", non-overlapping parts. Anti-conjuction. And-not function. Denoted by upwards arrow ↑ \n\n ENTP: Logic of isomorphism, analogies, transfer of structures from one area to another. Lets denote this logic function with sign of identity: = \n\n ENTJ: Logic of choice between two alternatives. Mutual exclusion. Risk, which leads to success. The logic of finding a way into oversystem, formation of emergent properties. Or-or logic. Strict disjunction. Lets denote it with <+> \n\n INTJ: Logic of parallel progression. Branching. Disjunctive logic that separates the opposites. Logic of safeguards, of spare exits. Lets denote this logic with sign / \[Disjunction: The statement A / B is true if A or B (or both) are true; if both are false, the statement is false.\] \n\n&#x200B;
7	Developing Intuition? A social weakness as extroverted?	Found this:\n\n“What could cause a naturally confident person such as an ENTJ to feel a sense of low self-worth or self-esteem? When it happens, it’s the result of their strong personality traits backfiring on them.”\nAnd this:\n\n“Although ENTJs have the “N” (Intuition) personality trait, they take a very rational and logical approach to life. They prefer to rely only on concrete facts, even though they have the capacity for intuition. They use their intuition to come up with new solutions or imagine a better way of doing something, but they don’t trust their gut instincts.\n\nIf you have not developed your intuition, you risk making decisions too quickly, before you have a full understanding of the issue and all possible solutions. Oftentimes, ENTJs believe that their view of the world is the only correct one, since they arrived at it via their logical, rational thought process.\n\nHowever, ENTJs who develop their intuition will greatly enhance their capacity for leadership, awareness, and change. When ENTJs learn to trust the quiet voice in their heads, they are more able to include input from others into their decisions. They develop a talent for addressing social issues and helping people get past difficult life situations because they are more aware of the needs of others.”\n\nWhat do you think about this? I felt identified when the text presented the lack of intuition on life approaching. How do you think I can develop this?\nI’m frustrated, because I feel socially awkward with people I don’t know; feeling weird and uncomfortable; I believe this is what this talked about, developing intuition and trusting gut instincts; basically trusting your instincts. Do you think this is the case? How would you develop it?\nThanks!\n\n\n
5	"Oftentimes, ENTJs believe that their view of the world is the only correct one, since they arrived at it via their logical, rational thought process."\n\nI agree with this however we believe that our views are the only correct one because we have also added our intuition and analytical process with this, just like any xNTJs.  Our logic does come first, **however that doesn't mean our intuition is any weaker**, just the sequence.\n\nYou feel socially awkward because the people you're surrounded by haven't intellectually stimulated you and therefore you think you're wasting your time there.\n\n&#x200B;
2	just wondering how ENTJs would respond to this	[u/throwaway3n1p](https://www.reddit.com/u/throwaway3n1p) and I are currently working on gathering answers for how thought processes work in different MBTI types. This is just out of curiosity, not an attempt to stalk you according to how you think of grave crimes. All replies are appreciated!\n\nIf we count judgments of *moral obligation* out of the equation, \n\nQuestion 1: How is murder logically fine?\n\nQuestion 2: How is murder logically wrong?\n\nNOTE: Feel free to write down whatever thought you have, whether it is emotional or just plain retarded.
3	What kinda murder we talking about ? Police killings, abortions, death sentence....?
3	1. First define murder. I would look up legal definitions from my own jurisdiction.\n2. Think of situations in which you might think murder is justified: i.e. self-defense, war,  euthanasia, capital punishment (abortion depends on how you define a person). \n3. Look for case precedent, consider influential arguments for each. \n\nI personally think that allowing subjective justifications for murder would lead to more murder. People are very good at justifying their decisions, so it's good to have external boundaries in place to preserve life. I could logically justify most types of killing, so it's better that I don't, if everyone did that we'd end up with The Purge and vigilante justice. This is why society decides upon an agreed-upon code of conduct.
2	It's logically sound of the logic is sound. This doesn't make it right. \n\nThe good of the hawk isn't necessarily the good of the field mouse. 
2	I think you're conflating logic with morals in this instance. I'm not sure if one can answer either question using logic. Pure logic = if A cannot exist without B, but B cannot exist without C, then logically A also cannot exist without C. \n\nTo function properly in society, we are taught murder is morally wrong in most circumstances. Murder as fine vs wrong is just a social construct based on morals - morals that have shifted and changed across different societies over time. Not sure if logic fits in here. Maybe I am overthinking?\n\nSo, to answer both, I suppose it is simultaneously logically "fine" and "wrong" at the same time, if you look at it through the lens of morals and ethics (i.e. it is logcally \[i.e. morally\] fine to murder one person to save hundreds of other people, but murder is logically \[i.e. morally\] wrong in most circumstances).
1	Is the study for scientific and educational purposes or just for fun? Cause if it’s the former then someone could really come for the legitimacy of the study. \n
1	I'm proud at the fact that this thread only has rational replies.
1	Ehhhhh what kind of question is this. So basically murder is logically not fine due to you getting yourself in prison and a sentence but I guess it's fine if it's the person you rlly hate LOLL
5	Figuring out an ENTJ's motivations	I'm a (male) ENxP and, true to my type, I generally have a good grasp of people and their motivations.\n\nAt my office, a high ranking ENTJ exec recently pulled me aside after I worked closely with him for a day or two and *lavished* (really, he pulled all the stops) me with tonnes of praise, then offered to mentor me.\n\nI was dumbfounded because I didn't expect that high a level of praise. And after such a short time working with him, how would he be able to develop such a strong opinion about me? I'm also super low ranking compared to him so I have no idea what he wants to get out of this relationship.\n\nI felt like something is off, or I am missing a vital piece of the picture.\n\nSince you guys know more than I do about ENTJ behavior I'm wondering if I can get at least some insight or at least ideas to what he might want. He is notoriously charming yet direct, and he is very strategic in dealing with people - and I think I've somehow become a tiny piece of his grand strategy.\n\nSo what do you think his motivation/reasons for trying to win me over might be? Or do you think he's actually being genuine - nice as that might be I still have no idea how he came to such a strong positive reaction on my character within such a short time frame. Better yet should I just directly ask him? Or should I try to find out based on my own network?\n\nI know I sound like a paranoid shit but I am really really confused about what he wants and where he stands. I'm also quite new to the corporate world so I'm trying to figure out how people tick here. Thanks.\n\nUPDATE: I had a self image crisis which caused the doubt. This guy is fucking amazing and all the good stuff you said is true. 
17	Congrats protege.  You won his respect somehow.
15	I can usually pick out who has talent and who is a waste of my time pretty quickly. When doing corporate training, I could tell you if it was a good hire or a crappy one by the end of the first day. I picked my star talent quickly, and invested in them immediately. \n\nHe saw something in you. Take it as the compliment it is, because few interest me, even fewer are ones I'm willing to mentor. 
9	He sees potential. I can spot talent pretty quickly, but talent will only get you so far without technique. Take his advice, he will probably put your name forward for roles, and put you on people's radar for opportunities. If I like someone I'll take them under my wing, I'll promote them to others, get then help with their projects and push them towards their goals. What I get out of it is seeing them flourish, and getting to say that I picked and trained a winning horse.
1	Yeh it's hard to tell with them. Just don't make any Te related mistakes and you should be fine. 
1	It’s very rewarding to me when I have the opportunity to mentor someone. I would be personally very grateful to have a mentor at this point in my own career, As long as there’s no ulterior motive- not trying to date me or anything 
1	I'll play the cynic here. I am guessing you're a ENTP. First of all, ENTJ's have a natural talent for spotting talent. Within five minutes of meeting someone, we can basically read them. ENTJ's have trained their whole life to read people within minutes based on their actions, clothes, mannerism's, speech patterns etc. To be quite honest, sometimes ENTJ's are refreshed by low ranking people. They have good ideas, but don't have the bullshit. This sounds kind of horrible, but ENTJ's like to mentor people, for their own narrcasistic benifit. He might be trying to be nice, or he may be nice to you, because he needs to look kind, to somebody else. ENTJ's hate bullshit. If you're really curious, just ask him. But always appeal to his ego. Don't try to find out behind his back, ENTJ's know when somebody's trying to dig up info on them. Even if he trying to trying to use you, just go with it. He might have some good stuff to say.
-3	NTJs dont care about existing status much. People are non-linear. Some can produce 10x the results.\n\nI think you should tell the guy straight up that while you appreciate his willingness to help, the praise came across as over the top. That you are not used to that. That you would be happy to continue providing good value to the company, but you want to do it whilst playing by the same rules as everyone else.\n
3	Tips for ENTJs to learn math?	I am a typical ENTJ. I personally love subjects like law, economy, psychology and languages. However, English is not my first language (actually, I am a beginner in English learning), and I am going to need to choose courses for university. I want to push myself to learn math, since this is the easiest way for me to achieve the status I want in the future. I am currently facing tons of problems in learning math, and most people cannot understand my unique way to learn math and the problem I am facing. Many suggests me to do as much exercises as I can, but I think overload practices kills my creativity, thus negatively affect my mark. Also, I feels like I have no trouble in comprehension, but I am always lost in doing massive calculations. So, do you ENTJs have experienced such situations? Do you have any tips for improving math marks? 
5	Math tripped me up until calculus. Suddenly, I could put it in terms of physics and then I was fine. Practical application made sense to me, but math for the sake of math drove me clear up a wall.  It's not that I struggled so much as I found it a pointless waste of time. \n\nTry to put in real-world terms with a practical application. It helps give those massive calculations more relevance. I also break down EVERY step of the individual problem. \n\nWhich math are you taking? 
3	If you are comprehending the logic fine, and losing your way through very complex equations, the best trick I've found is to make a map as you go. You want to write notes to yourself as you go. Similar to "show your work" when you were a child. Don't let any of it be work in your head. So in a calculus problem, I will write out what every variable is and what I'm trying to find. I will what I'm doing in every step. If I need to at some point replace something with a standard identity (say that cot(θ) = cos(θ)/sin(θ)) I write that next to where I replace. Then you can't get lost, if the answer stops making sense you can easily find your mistake and back up to there. You can't find your mistake if you made it in your head five minutes ago.\n\nBut also, while the logic, creativity, and intuition for higher math may be talents (which I believe we tend to have) computation is a skill. If you don't do the exercises, and lots of them, you have just as much chance at succeeding as in learning to play the piano well by looking at one, reading some music theory books, and then saying "yeah, I totally get how that works". You have to practice.
2	Use video tutorials like Kahn academy or books with answer solutions with step by steps like Chegg.
1	I almost failed Pre-calculus in high school... Calculus was easy. I got a 5 on the AP test and also barely passed the class(knew I was going to cc so "fuck it"). I studied for the AP test for 4 hours the night before. The one thing that I remember that triggers me from precalc is partial fractions. I'm still confused by it today.
1	I don't understand. Can you elaborate on how doing more exercises is detrimental to you? People advice doing exercises for understanding and applying what you have learnt in class. First you get the jist of the topic and solve basic questions. Then you work your way up to tougher questions. Eventually, math problems will start to get really creative  so you gotta make use of two or more topics you have learnt to solve them.
1	I'm like you, English is my second language and never really understood math even though I got As all the time. How I did it? I just figured out how to get an answer by memorizing solutions. Always set of questions in academia. I figured out the pattern and never cared understanding how to do it. As soon as I read a question, pull out a solution from my head, and output the answer.
17	The sandwich technique	I really like Toastmasters. You get a good amount of opportunity to practice speeches and leadership, and you get a nice little certificate saying that you're competent. Who doesn't love that?\n\nThat having been said, the Toastmasters guide to conflict resolution is generally full of advice on how to wimp out of confrontation. They are generally less than direct, and usually feel a bit trite. \n\nNevertheless, there are little lifehacks that we can learn that make our criticisms more palatable. One such technique that you might be interested in is the "sandwich technique."\n\n~~The idea being that if you bribe someone with a sandwich, then they'll have no choice but to agree with you.~~\n\nBy sandwiching criticisms between compliments, you catch their attention, trick them into accepting your criticism, and leave them feeling happy again because of the compliment.\n\nI like your haircut,  \nYour work was shitty today. \nYour shoes are nice too.
11	The problem with the sandwich technique is that its so obviously contrived. Sometimes things are bad and it's both kind and helpful to the other person to just point it out. Imagine a teacher/TA/lecturer writing feedback for an obviously bad assignment:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n"Thank you for handing your assignment in on time. Your arguments were irrelevant and a thesis was lacking. You're handwriting was nice."\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think it's just better to preface criticisms with a simple "Hey, I'm not trying to cut you down but here's what I think you should improve on." It's a lot more genuine and you're not trying to "trick" people into feeling a certain way about you\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S. I'd totally take a sandwich bribe ;)
8	People say they can see through this, but we are all so much more gullible than we want to believe.\n\nDuring your formal evaluation, you're expecting to hear the sandwich and so you hear it.\n\nBut as a group, we ENTJs don't engage in meaningless social niceties. And the problem with that is that those niceties exist for a reason - that is that other people really hinge on them. Softening your criticism is important, and the bigger the criticism, the more you need to soften it. \n\nAn example I learned was bringing in cake to work. Every time I do this, everyone loves it, and they're much more tolerant of my not-giving-a-damn-about-your-bullshit.
6	It's all in how you phrase it.  "You excel at x, and I think we can build on that success by working on y. As a bonus, working on y will also build on your strengths in z." 
4	Also known as the "Shit sandwich". Are there still people who don't know this is a thing?
4	This is genius. Should I join toastmasters?
3	It's also known as the, "shit sandwich."  I was forced to try this technique at my last workplace dealing with two particular people (ESFJ and ESFP) who could NOT take ANY feedback at all, even when things that went wrong were blatantly their fault, they acted as if they were so mystified as to why and of course refused to take responsibility for it.  I think that others were aware of the technique and understood what I was doing, but it was bc ALL of us were just sick and tired of dealing with the two whose focus was always based on how, "nice" people were to them.  If the message was not delivered with sugar sprinkles and rainbows they'd get really bent out of shape and vindictive.
2	It works wonders. 
2	An ENFJ friend suggested something similar to me and I think you might like that one, since it's less about empty compliments and more actionable: *Continue, stop, improve.*\n\nSo one thing the person does really well well (or a compliment, if you find them completely useless), one thing they need to stop doing, and one they show potential for and should work on.\n\nYou only need to compliment them once (which can come off as contrived), but the "improve" part will come off as positive to the receiver even though it's technically criticism.
1	I am also a Toastmaster. The sandwich method is great, but in a longer discussion you can layer criticisms between compliments and positive feedback like layers of a cake. Great feedback tool.
1	Hahaha! I just don’t know about it much of this is really not my thing. I don’t need toastmasters to tell me I have leadership skils or speak correctly. I can already do this! Hahah!
0	Why not Trump technique?
19	Do you gain more energy around people or alone? ENTJs	The only difference between us and INTJs is the primary cognitive function that is used first, but the cognitive functions are the same.\n\nENTJ: Te – Ni – Se – Fi\n\nINTJ:  Ni – Te – Fi – Se\n\nThe point is both INTJs and ENTJs have external thinking capabilities and introverted intuition.\n\n**This doesn't tell us where you derive your energy from.**\n\nI am very curious to hear from you guys because this would explain a lot about myself and things that I have read in other people's posts.\n\nI personally derive my energy from being alone whether in the office, or at home, or out in public.  I have a few close friends that I do enjoy stimulating conversations with.  I hate group activities unless it's for a specific goal, then I end up leading.\n\nIs anyone else like this?
22	It depends on the people and situation. My friend has told me that for an extrovert, I say that “I hate people” a lot. And there is a pretty popular ENTJ meme floating around that says that we get confused for introverts since we hate hanging around idiots.
16	I think it’s more about the stimuli for me. Overstimulation in that environment can send me haywire, but if I’m somewhere quiet and the energy is built around the people, I can be there all night. 
15	Popping in just to comment on the theory. Which is, that you gain energy when you are able to use your dominant function. \n\nTe demands intelligent and useful thoughts from others. If you can’t get that from the people in your environment, you may very well end up preferring books or other activities in solitude. 
7	It really also depends where I am with other people. If it’s a loud party with music you can’t hear over, then yeah, I think I’d personally do better alone. But maybe at school or a calmer social gathering I could do well. 
6	Depend on type of people we are  around, if i have to play very formally i would better be alone than be a strict robo. 
4	Both
5	INTJs are Ni - Te - Fi - Se. The patterns in MBTI always rotate extroverted and introverted functions. This is important to correct because it suggests that INTJs may be more in touch with values/moral code (and creates the NiFi loop that unhealthy INTJs often find themselves trapped in).  \n\n\nTo answer, I identify with you somewhat. I like to work alone, but I definitely am more energized by people. I'm happier with people but I think I'm less efficient, so I try to balance that as best as I can. So far my solution is to spend a significant amount of my free time with friends doing a hobby so that I can benefit from the energy for solo academic study/work. I don't know if this is cheating but it's worked well so far. 
4	Both. In places with lots going on i can feel my batteries draining but the same happens when I’m alone for too long 
4	Around people. Large groups of people are great for me, I love feeling all the energy.  When I was young (18- early 20's) I loved dance clubs and raves so much! Then I started wedding planning large weddings, running large groups of volunteers (50-75 people), and volunteering for large projects (like Habitat for Humanity). I prefer upbeat, positive environments. Great concerts (esp. outside cause nature makes me happy), art/wine walks and all that kind of stuff is enjoyable for me with all the positive energy. Being with people definitely give me energy but I have to be careful of negative emotion. Protests, emotionally difficult meetings, my kid's school functions with other parents and other emotionally charged situations are very draining for me and I will need alone time after to cope. The last few years there have been some difficult times and I've found I needed more alone time than ever. On the flip side of that, I'm so glad I finally understand that I gain energy from other people; for a while I got stuck in a downward spiral and kept myself away from people until I felt better. But I just couldn't get my energy back up and was floundering with no idea what was wrong. Read on Reddit about the energy gain/introvert/extrovert thing and bazinga I'm back baby. 
3	Like most comments, my answer is both.  I work in an entertainment type field and need other peoples energy to preform well. But it takes a lot out of me. I often come home drained.  When I'm home with the family I have a good  balance of energy  But when I'm alone during the day I find myself being lazy with very little energy or motivation. It's like I need my kid and husband around so I can feed off their energy. Its odd.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo in social settings things get crazy. I don't like loud place because I overstimulate easy. It's also hard to hang out with small groups. I drawl from them and some people I just can't take. Like my best friends husband. His energy is sky high I can feel his energy run through me. I have to take extra deep breaths when he's around. I  like a  chilled out vibe. 
2	I posted a similar question a few months back. For a moment I confused myself with being an introvert as well because gatherings, networkings and parties just drain the shit out of me. Furthermore, I enjoy my alone time reading books and working so much that I don’t bother hanging out with people. But then again, a number of introverts answered my questions and shared their perspectives: they can spend weeks without talking to people, something which is unimaginable to me. So my guess is that our extroversion is usually under-estimated: we don’t see introverts often because they spend most of their time at home, and in social contexts, everyone tries to show his extroverted side. You can also check our description on socionics. I was amazed about how much I resonate with the description.
2	I think you are asking the wrong question. It’s not whether or not there are people, but rather, what are those people doing?\n\nThere is a massive difference between leading a team for work, or to complete a project, in which case we can work tirelessly. (True if it’s a solo project as well) \n\nVs. frivolous social occasions, if I don’t have a specific reason to be there I’m still amicable, and if I have lots of energy I can be very charismatic, but I find that much more draining. \n\nSimplified, are the people feeding my Te? (effectiveness). No? then they are draining. Yes? I can go all day, all night, and still keep going. \n\nAlso INTJ cognitive stack is Ni Te Fi Se
2	I work in a very people-oriented industry. I find this exhausting.\n\nI have also worked in a very data-oriented industry. I found the lack of interaction exhausting.\n\nWhere I get my energy is different question to where I want to spend my energy.  As it happens they are both more E than I.
2	I need both; if I get too much stimulation in a week or day, I'm gonna want to sneak off on my own to relax and unwind.\n\nI don't have a ton of close friends; with the ones I do have, I get a lot of energy out of their company. I also am energized by motivated, hard-working people I meet on campus.\n\nI don't hate group activities (I'm on an executive board for a student organization and I volunteer in a large group). BUT, I hate the people that don't have that ambition to succeed, whether it be for a group project in a class, a student organization, or whatever. I just think that if you do something, there has to be some sort of an effort. I mean fuck, 75% it if you're not gonna give 100%, but don't just give 0%.
2	In my case most people think I'm an extravert, but there's some who see me as a weird person, not to say they're antonyms but to point out that some see me as a wacky extravert.\n\nRegarding your question, I feel like I get most of my energy by being alone, with some exceptions. Thing is, I don't really enjoy partying or spending time with people I don't know. That being said, I get a lot of energy when I can spend a quality conversation with 1-2 people, even more than by being alone, it's actually one of the things I enjoy the most too. \n\n  \nWhen I was in junior year I remember spending a lot of time talking to girls, and I enjoyed it so much I crashed my grades lol. After learning my lesson I kinda went back to my former self.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSummarized, I'd say my energy comes mainly from me being alone, but depending on who's around me, I can gain even more energy from being around others.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
2	I’m putting order back into my life and that’s doing the trick.
2	I always have a moral debate with myself if I'm actually an extrovert or not. When I meet that one rare person, I am able to exchange ideas with them, and I get to fully savor the gained energy when I'm alone after talking with them. It's like they fuel my mind, and I take what I need from them, to process what they said, and come up with new solutions. However, these people are truly rare. I mostly find people lagging and draining. 
2	Around people sometimes myself lol
0	Erm. Did you see the first letter in entj it’s called e! Yes. E n t j that’s right. So yes I get more energy with people? Maybe that helps?
3	Survey on personality and Flirting behaviors	Hey I am a doctoral Student at a University in the South. I am studying flirtation behaviors, specifically trying to catalog specific flirting behaviors taken from several experimental studies. I was wondering if I could post to this community as it seems relevant to my topic. Thank you in advance for taking the time to take the survey there is an opportunity to win a gift card if the entire survey is completed. You can back out at any time.\n\nHere is the link to the survey\n\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JMQP5PJ
3	Please post back when you have the results of the raw data!
2	Please write out your theory how entj might be different. 
2	That's a long ass-survey.\n\nI think you'll start losing validity by around question 140, but you'll lose a lot of it by question 210.
1	There’s no reference to entj
1	Did it! (ENTJ) Entered my reddit username for the giftcard. DM me if I win. 
15	High functioning successful ENTJ needs friends	I'm male, middle aged, a doctor, very smart, highly successful but I suck at relationships. I'm even physically fit. Anyone want to be my friend lol :( I guess I'm too driven and insensitive!!!
14	Welcome to being an XNTJ... work on being more sensitive. You only get what you work for in life i.e. good diet plus gym keeps you fit, working smart and hard gets you ahead in your career, being sesnitive to otjer people gets you connected with them.
9	Be my friend. I want you.\n\nCurrently on an ENTJ binge in my life, literally seeking and absorbing into my life any of you I’m fortunate enough to find. I’ll probably reach social capacity at some point and slow down, but I’m nowhere near that now. I heard you guys are supposedly the highest in all types of compatibility for an INTP, so I am currently verifying that theory personally. So far, it’s dead on. \n\nMe - 26 years old, entrepreneur. Just went to hell and back over the last 2 years, with me bankrupting my first business by overaggression, losing everything I built and worked for, causing nearly a million bucks worth of economic damage, and losing my 2 year old daughter to her mother taking her and moving to a different state after 5 years of living together when I could no longer provide economically. Filed Chapter 7 and started my new business. \n\nPhone, Skype, emails only, I’m fine with any. My account’s not anon, but I leave it to you whether to remain anon while talking. Also, you play dota, cool, I’m plat trash in League of Legends. Also, I used to be pre-med, and my best friend just started residency. \n\nI hear Fi couldn’t care less about other people’s feelings. Good, because Fe doesn’t care about my own feelings. So no time wasted there. Only rational perfection. 
4	I feel like just being insensitive wouldn’t limit you completely. What else is going on? 😋
3	Befriends with ENTPs we go with everyone 
3	Hey!\nI (26F) am also a high functioning ENTJ! I decided to go the engineering route though.\nIt was really hard for me growing up because I had (still do) a very different way to see/think  things. Throughout the years, traveling and meeting more people, I gathered data on social norms etc and it's been working out really well. Take the time to know yourself and how you interact. It will greatly improve your social/relational skills :)\nDon't hesitate to DM me if you have questions,  I always enjoy making friends.\n
2	study vulnerability. especially when you get triggered. read some books, the conflicts are endless   \nalso understand what attributes and values you seek in a man, so you get virtue around you which makes it easier to *behave*
1	Well I'm probably you just like 10-20 years in the past?   \n\n\nCurrently a med student. Feel free to HMU
1	Sure INTP, pre-med, any tips ?, and did you meet any other NT/NF doctors ? 
1	I don’t know if you’re entj but okay. Hahaha! I am one confirmed pretty much professionally so feel free to send me a message?
1	Yeah ok. You sound alright. Let’s be friends 
1	I’ll be your friend! \n\nAlso- smart to post in the F subs - they seem to know all the people. Getting an F best friend would probably do more for you than we ever could!
1	Are you fine being friends with a ENTJ a decade away from your age LOl
19	ENTJ Personality Type Description	
3	AMAZING. First really great breakdown i’ve watched 
3	Solid video, I like the social examples and the equal positive and negative elements discussed outside of "good leader" "hurts peoples feelings"
2	We use introverted intuition lol.
2	i really like that thumbnail with his pursed lips and joyful eyes.\n\nvery enticing and makes me want to click!
0	I am sitting here like "yup, yup, yup, whoa feeling personally attacked here, yup, yup"
0	One of the few people who have touched upon how Te and Se look alike (evidence, rationale), but how despite that, the N "appears" in NTJs (Te/Ni users). 
0	"Quite nice, if they need to be"  made me chuckle\n\n&#x200B;\n\n"Overestimating"  can see that.. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNice video
8	What do ENTJs do for fun?	How do we incorporate more fun into our lives? What do you do to lighten up?
34	Lord that’s the million dollar question. 
10	I think doing what I'm passionate about is fun. Music is my favorite thing, so I try to play music every day. I also like to write, so that is fun to me. If I'm able to create until I'm mentally tired, I will feel fulfilled. Creating is often fun and interesting. Even if the process of creation is painful, the feeling of fulfillment afterwards is more rewarding than fun. If I feel fulfilled, sometimes I don't even need to have fun. I can just meditate or stretch to relax after a long day.\n\nI recently got into podcasts as well, which has made chores and busywork more enjoyable.\n\nBeing with people you like is fun. In my experience, it is hard to find people who I really click with, but those few people are typically really fun. I will often participate in their hobbies, like bowling, disc golf, hiking, because if it's fun and meaningful to them, then it's the same to me.\n\nI like music, so going out and seeing local live music is fun to me. In particular, live jazz will always be fun and interesting because of its emphasis on improvisation and the tension and emotion that goes along with that.\n\nSex is fun.\n\nIf it's a week night and I don't have anything to do, I'll play video games for an hour or two. Strategy games like XCOM and Darkest Dungeon are fun to me, and I have enjoyed playing Apex Legends recently. Reading is really great as well, if you have the patience for it. After those initial 15 minutes of struggle, I find I can really get absorbed in a good book, whether it's an autobiography, sci-fi, fantasy, satire, classic lit, etc. Listening to full albums or other longform music is also one of my favorite things. If I have a lot of time to kill and I really need to decompress, there will be weed involved with any of these downtime activities (judge me bitch).\n\nHope you find some time to have fun, OP! Carve out time for yourself if you have to!
7	For me:  \nI genuinely enjoy working at my job. I enjoy playing with my kids.\n\n  \nOther hobbies:  \n\-Photography  \n\-Baking  \n\-Running   \n\-Shopping\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI guess I do generic things that everyone else does for fun.
2	I balance what most consider to be leisure 'fun' with things I feel I 'need'to get done and at the end of the day what brings me the most satisfaction is progress and "getting shit done".
4	Read, gym, and meditate. 
4	Win
3	I too love my job like most people here, but I wouldn't say it is *fun*, although my job and most 'not fun' things I do in my life are very much satisfying. Things I consider *fun* are most of the time very unproductive and it doesn't make me feel satisfied in life, but yet, somehow, it is worthwhile. Things I consider to be fun: music concerts, theater shows, visiting theme parks and zoos, going to the movies, building a pillow fort in the living room etc. etc. \n\nThe real question is - in my opinion - if you are someone like me for whom 'fun' is mostly 'unproductive' and therefor 'unsatisfying' (but enjoyable nonetheless!): how *much* fun do you incorporate in your life at the expense of productivity? What's the right balance?
3	Simulate murder with my friends in our pajamas... or as others call it, jiujitsu! Also, strength training, collect vinyl, a lot of DIY projects, and work on my car. 
3	...Fun?
3	my coworkers and friends have told me I am probably one of the dumbest smart people they know.  I've written a lot of very complex, software that is on millions of machines, and am working on my 4th startup in 15 years.  I basically go hard like crazy at work trying to make things happen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn the weekend I may be at a concert dancing while either drunk or high, watching absolutely stupid stuff like , fast and the furious move level dumb.  I have found shutting it all off , really helps recharge your crazy ambitious go getter attitude for when you are trying to get ahead / crush / eliminate the competition.  Its a good balance.
2	I think finding things we like to do is definitely essential. I do a lot of reading and research for example outside of work and school. This for instance. I like community service for example I am part of the greeting staff at my church. I also debate politics and read the news for fun. Find someone to talk to that you can handle a discussion with on something like political topics or current events. I play with technology and different apps and just how they can all be used.\n\nSocial media is a large part of fun as well. Having a bit of a social life in real life, making friends and talking to others. I also do quite a bit of talking to friends online having friends all over the united states is definitely interesting.\n\nI like playing word and trivia games.\n\nCollecting music and music trivia stuff like this.
2	I just opened my phone to do *something* with my time because for the first time in a long time, I have time to do *something*.\n\nI came to Reddit, came here, and then I see this question. And I realised I'm fucked.
2	It took me until I was 23 to start really having fun, and I'm 24 now. Before then, outside of a vacation every so often, I was grinding during the week/ resting during the weekend. \n\nNow I frequently go to concerts and comedy shows and all sorts of events in my city. I take dance and fitness classes almost every weeknight. I've gotten comfortable with going to things alone if I don't feel like interracting and just having a good time with myself. I like the experience of feeling "silly" and don't think we should just reserve that for childhood 
1	-Work out\n\n-Listen to music\n\n-Watch basketball (mainly professional)\n\n-Read (online sources, actual books, etc.)\n\n-Watch YouTube let's play channels (Game Grumps, SuperMega, OneyPlays, etc.)
1	Homework, school, practicing driving, walk the dog
1	8===D~~
1	Work.
1	What fun ?
1	For me, I find ‘fun’ in the small spaces between work doing things like watching complete and utter garbage TV (do other ENTJs do this??) reading/having some decent quiet time, walking, music and playing games with my son. He’s into Lego at the moment, perfect! \nBut for me, work is also fun. So win-win. 
1	Browsing through the internet for fun but likes to correct idiots with facts in the internet too
27	How much does your childhood play into your ENTJ personality?	In my case, I had a...less than stellar childhood, to put it simply. For a lot of it, my parents were emotionally abusive toward one another in front of me; they even turned on me a lot of times too. They won't even own to the fact that they fucked up... \n\nThere was a period of time where it seemed like nothing I did could make them proud of me; when I was a sophomore in high school, I was named the fourth chair for the violin section (out of 15 people). I didn't even get a "congratulations" from them; they yelled at me about how a kid who was younger than me got third chair. \n\nI dealt with undiagnosed ADD from when I was born to when I was 18; even when people were cunty to me because I was an impulsive and moronic kid, I didn't sit and moan and bitch about it. I took it all on the chin and kept moving.\n\nThere's gotta be something there that built my personality. Anybody else have things similar to this?
25	I think it's a mixture of genetics and extreme childhood expectations.  
15	Hi ManSoldWorld, I have heard a few times that ENTJs (and Enneagram 8s) tend to have childhoods that were extreme. \n\nTo add ancedotal data, I also had a really sh\*tty childhood. In my case there was frequent physical abuse, child protective services involvement, and my dad is still on my hometowns most wanted list. I grew up really early and always had to be independent. I struggled to connect with people into early adulthood. \n\nNow I really like what my personality has become even though conditions were extreme and negative to get here. 
7	wow surprised to see so many ENTJs with crap childhoods here. I wonder if the way the post is titled, its specifically drawing those of us who would confirm the theory into the thread. \n\nI also had a crap childhood, my parents loved me but I was never enough for them. I was always getting scolded and criticized and hardly ever praised. And when I bring this up to them, I just hear "do something worth praising". It has seeded a deep sense of inadequacy in me which drives a lot of what I do and how I behave today. A lot of approval seeking behavior, etc etc.\n\nWhile I do love who I am, I hate where I am. But anyway let me know if you want to talk about this more. 
5	Had a pretty normal Childhood, no abusive shit or else.
4	My dad was in the army, I went to 9 different schools growing up, always the new kid, the nerd, kind of chubby, not very girly... got teased a lot, didn’t have many friends, ate lunch in the bathroom... now people don’t recognize me by either my looks or personality, I am totally fine with my own company, and I connect with people very easily.  I totally attribute my personality today to the conditions of my upbringing.
5	Smooth seas don't make for great sailors...
3	This is thought-provoking. 
3	Honestly...a lot. I'm firmly ENTJ, 8w7.\n\nI'm the youngest of four kids, with the other three being extremely similar so I had to do everything faster, smarter, and better just to keep up or even just to get some attention.\n\n>They won't even own to the fact that they fucked up...\n\nI've felt some resentment towards my parents/family like you feel here where I just wanted them to admit some wrongdoing. However, over the years and with lots of therapy, I've come to the conclusion that I am proud to be who I am (ENTJ) and while it may have hurt growing up and may be lonely sometimes as an adult, I think every personality type (and thus every human) have aspects of ourselves that we struggle with. And as ENTJs, we are maybe the best positioned to actually make peace with our past, and use it to our advantage.
2	Childhood traumatic experiences unlock the Sharingan in us. 
2	I highly doubt that any childhood difficulties (bullying) played a part into my being an ENTJ - I've always been like this, though it has likely made me more cynical and skeptical.
2	I don’t honestly know I don’t think it has to do with it too much. I think in a sense it has more to do with how you develop as an entj. I don’t think crappy childhood makes entjs. I think we do better dispite of them but it doesn’t make us. No. 
2	None? Personally I raised myself because my parents had absolutely no idea how to be parents. They provided a stable home environment and money, and nothing else. So I guess... my childhood wasn't extreme in any way, and probably didn't affect my MBTI type that much
2	I don't think type is determined by trauma, etc. Not by genetics...\n\nIn socionics, though, they say your Super Id block, corresponding to the 3rd and 4th function (in the mbti stack) is affected in its use by your environment/childhood. \n\nSo your SeFi for you ENTJs.
1	It didn't. Interesting topic, however. 
1	I had a good childhood. But I can never understand how I turned to be an ENTJ.\n\nMy life at home was better than life at school. I always ended up being bullied in school. I'd be friends with people who didn't have friends because I felt sorry for them. Or I would be friends with someone the popular group hated and then eventually I'd be the outlier. Ended up being bullied. I had to get transferred to a different highschool in my first year because my mother picked me up one day with a huge 3 inch bleeding cut on my face. My mother was/is very alpha and dominant. I was reserved but very passionate and still am this way. I think I just hated highschool. When I graduated highschool and met some friends a few years later in University, they kept telling me I was incredibly popular in highschool. TBH I always though I was reserved and quiet. So this always suprises me.\n\nI did have a strict upbringing but my parents distributed my time to a range of sporting events. My parents were the generic Arab parents of general yelling and hitting but I think Arab children have strong characters and we all get past it lol. Every Arab child remembers getting hit with some shoes and wooden sticks. I was quiet and reserved in school. I didn't have an interest in people. I've always loved the news and foreign relations from I reckon the age of 8. I took part in team sports and extra-curricular acitivities and started working from the age of 14. Sports is fun but I was the only Arab girl in a group of White girls. They'd do all sorts of things because they didn't like my identity, move their bodies to cause me injuries, if I was throwing a lay-up in ball, they'd put their legs up so I'd trip, throw dirt in my water bodies. But I never said anything. So I get surprised why I turned out to be this alpha woman today.\n\nI think this is when I changed; and I changed because of one man.\n\nWhen I got a pretty cool office job at 19 while studying full-time. I met the 60 year old CEO, a  6σ blackbelt. He worked in civil, mechanical and chemical engineering facilities worldwide, in europe, asia, middle east, australia and canada (this organisation wasn't in engineering though). He really changed my character. He threw me into quantitative thinking and the power of logical thought and rationality. I was able to systemise my thoughts. I grew intellectually and emotionally underneath him. I cringe when I think about it, but I would sometimes go to his room and ask him a question. He would talk to me all the time. We have a great mentor-mentee relationship. I became very confident. At the same time, I was already articulate and taking charge in many situations but I think it just became more definite? When I first met him, he'd look at me and say, "you, you are a catalyst for change. you will be a leader one day. I see it".\n\nI took lead in projects later on outside of work. The CEO, even though he wasn't my line-manager, got me to work on a major task with international benefits by communicating with particular national stakeholders. It was just a test. I think he was trying to let me learn about myself, and he was learning about me too. I was able to influence someone using particular behavioural and logical technqiques to lodge an international program like it was their own idea. Both the CEO and I wanted this program but it had to come from the national team. I'm quite likeable and have a thing with clicking with older or mature people. It worked out. But I got very scared at what I did and considered it manipulative and that was a long time ago and I never did it again. I work again in leading teams on a small basis for very short-term projects. I have a friendly and warm leadership approach. I believe everyone has a gift and has potential. I've trained people. Faciliated workshops. I guess I've changed a lot. I'm confronting. Easy to talk to. Reliable I guess. Something he told me once was, "eye contact is your weakness". And we worked on that for a few weeks. \n\nTo answer your question, he, he was the person that built my personality. I think he saw the pot with all the ingredients and he kept mixing it until separate capacities fuelled to become a single entity.\n\nDid you have an older person in your life that could've influenced you? Perhaps a mentor? A teacher? A boss?\n\nAn external experience/individual in your life may have supported you to recognise your internal abilities?\n\n&#x200B;
1	I don’t really know, i have older siblings and my parents had a lot of dinner parties I had to sit through. I guess I learned about adult mistakes and adult speech quickly....i don’t know maybe that propelled something 
2	"Selling" Ayn Rand's Ideas	
2	I use to be a fair bit in to radnism or Objectivismm. And use to play in that ball game. I am a conservativve for whom observing politics has taught me a fair deal.\n\nThere is a point I never got the logic too. I think the way she is describing love doesn’t work.\n\nI think the idea of owning your husband or wife is an interesting notion for sure. I have always thought that her concept of what romance and love is has always been a bit odd. It seems very unrealistic and very much like she doesn’t know what a relationship is.\n\nFor me, Objectivism is a non-solution. It has some interesting libertarian ideas in there for sure. I think that it focuses too little on how actually the world works. It comes off as to animalistic in a sense. I think the fact that the end result is this pure self-interestedness and that ultimately drives everything is to simplistic. It is just not how it works. I think it is too irreligious and also don’t realise that capitalists goal can be a bit more realistic then that.\n\nI also think the government structure is a bit to simple in randism idealism can’t work in the united states. Yes, I am a conservative. I agree that there needs to be a smaller government. But what she believes is basically this nonexistent government who only keeps laws, and keeps the police force alive. Enough to defend the country and that’s about it. The more I study politics and why it works that way it seems absurd. There are many departments we can trim the government for sure, but to have the extreme of let’s just basically have such a limited government, that it is almost an anarchy doesn’t work either. What about the factors that this is a large country with a huge population. And government has been growing even during the 19th century for a reason. I think many of the offices are necessary to fulfill the duities of this country’s needs. I think that we have seen that the lack of these systems have caused issues. the truth of the matter is everyone in the united states whether they are conservatives or liberals have issues they run to the government for their solutions. So there have been some. I think cutting large parts of the government is going to cause issues and havoc. For instance the FDa. It is important to check food sanitation. We have had such good results with markets and safe food practices because of such heavily checked and regulated food industry. The government hhas no business teaching you what to eat, but because of their regulations food sold in the united states and served in the united states is clean, and safe generally. If there is a problem there have been many times where it has been caught and contained and situations handled. Now imagine if the government was as small as rand has imagined it. Many of these useful services that is provided will not be provided anymore. Should we mention drugs are sold more safely because of the fda? I am not talking about the black market. Those drugs are not subjected to the fda and not even known by the federal government. I am talking about medication. The fact that many of these medication is now controlled and made sure to be of a high quality and safe is another service the government provides.\n\nAlso even if it is not going as well as possible the truth is that there are laws to govern civil rights. Is anyone here disabled. In rands government the ADA is not allowed and neither is much of this progress we’ve made in the courts concerning civil rights of other minority groups. Integrated universities, the rights of a woman to vote and work. It’s funny because the women in her book are powerful. We have to remember that if we had not had court systems which helped the civil rights revolts of the woman’s movements first and second wave feminism. I don’t know how far it would have honestly gotten. Much less have anyone run a company like dange Taggart. That is wishful thinking. \n\nI think yes many department can be shrunk to some degree but to have such a small government as rand wishes for is dangerous. I think it is especially dangerous with such powerful nations and enemies around the globe. It may have worked in the beginning of this country but honestly, this is why the government expanded, because they found that it wasn’t pragmatic.\n\nI think idealism is interesting but as a intuitive we have to be very careful with our intuition. There is indeed a dark side to it. 
3	Fuck Ayn Rand and her infantile pseudo-philosophy. One would hope that people would outgrow such idealistic and selfish points of view.
-1	Richard Stalman > John Galt\n\nChange my mind.\n
10	INFP here. My ENTJ best friend is upset at me and I want to send him this message. Does it come off crazy to you?	I posted in the INFP subreddit but I figured it would be wise to post here too, given that my best friend is an ENTJ. \n\nPlease give me your honest thoughts. Is this too long winded and intense? If so, what are some ways I can get my point across more effectively? My best friend is upset at me due to complicate reasons. We were long distance but had somewhat of an intimate component to our ‘friendship’ that felt romantic at times. However my main motive is just for him to feel comfortable being my best friend again because he truly was mine.\n\nThe message is as follows:\n\nNo matter how physically far you were, you always felt so close. Human emotions are volatile, but human bonds are hard to break. We are more than our emotional reactions. I don’t want to lose something I know is real to such fleeting forces. \n\nI know I hurt you and it has become ingrained in my purpose never to hurt you again, nor to expend energy on those who don’t deserve it. I’m hurting because I’m afraid I’ve lost my best friend. Lately I’ve been looking at the bigger picture. We are so much more than two physical bodies, a brief fling, or a complicated friendship. We are souls that are here to learn from each other, grow, and heal the world through our inner healing. We have both helped each other in different ways and I know we can continue being that for each other despite this hiccup. I know this isn’t a comfortable discussion but no growth can occur from a place of comfort. We can get past this.
48	This is the most INFP apology I've ever read lmao\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's a bit much for someone who is potentially mad at you. Makes it seem like you're placing blame on the universe and the circumstances. I would make it more concise and say "I'm sorry about how our current relationship stands. You were my best friend and I miss that. I know it might take time but you are too important to me to let go of your place in my life. I just hope we can move past this and go back to the way things were."\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMuch more concise yet you still get to insert your feelings the way you like.
33	If I was mad at someone I think this would just piss me off even more.
15	Look I'm just 1 person who knows nothing about you, but as an entj, here is my reaction (as a reader). Bear in mind - I'm just chillin on my couch and not emotionally invested. I don't know your situation, I i won't try to read into it:\n\n1. I stopped reading your message (I went back and reread it) \n2. This sounds like a problem with you and not me. It sounds like you need the reader to support you, not like you're apologizing, or accepting something that went wrong, or even explaining. It feels like begging. It honestly is really not engaging.\n3. You sound like an infp. Words have weight. Many words have little meaning. Be clear, be consise, limit it to 1-3 sentences. I think of it as a courtesy to the listener by the speaker. It's confusing and loses its weight when you go on and on about something that's already not landing well. \n4. I mean yes you are absolutely saying a lot of things I appreciate and understand, but it sounds more like you rationalizing this to yourself, not doing something for the me/the reader. Saying "we can get past this" and "I need you to x" is a huge turnoff. My perspective, you are having some problems and asking this person to fix it for you. It also reads like a speech in a grocery store romance novel. \n\nI can totally empathize that you're having a hard time, maybe this person is too, but have you considered thinking about the other person? The other person's perspective? \n\nHere's my "edit" - basically, apologize for whatever exploded (if that's the case, you also don't need to excuse any wrongdoing of his but accept and identify how you've contributed to the situation - that's important (or accurate)), explain that he's important to you, and (importantly!) *ask* to reconnect. Don't demand it. Finally, be a good friend - you want to be good to him, not use him because you're codependent. Express that. \n\n"Hey - I'm sorry things have gotten out of hand between us. I'm know I... (insert brief apology, e.g. I lost my temper and started yelling). But I just want you to know how important you are. You've had a profound impact on my life. I hope I make your world better in the same way you do for me. \n\nThis is difficult for me and I probably overreacted, but I get that you're upset too. This isn't just about me and I want to do the right thing for you. If you want to talk, I'm listening."\n\nAlso... Don't lecture an entj on emotions. Just don't.
23	Ugh.
10	I can only speak for myself but this a lot. Just send a straight to the point apology that lets them know that you miss them. Sometimes less is more.
9	"I'm sorry for \[insert transgression here\] and I hope we can move past it"  This is usually all that needs to be said as far as I'm concerned.
11	>No matter how physically far you were, you always felt so close. Human emotions are volatile, but human bonds are hard to break. We are more than our emotional reactions. I don’t want to lose something I know is real to such fleeting forces.  \n>  \n>I know I hurt you and it has become ingrained in my soul’s purpose never to hurt you again **(can you guarantee that? I don't think so.)**, nor to expend energy on those who don’t deserve it. I’m hurting because I’m afraid I’ve lost my best friend. Lately I’ve been looking at the bigger picture. We are so much more than two physical bodies, a brief fling, or a complicated friendship. We are souls that are here to learn from each other, grow, and heal the world through our inner healing. We have both helped each other in different ways and I know we can continue being that for each other despite this hiccup. I know this isn’t a comfortable discussion but no growth can occur from a place of comfort **(Don't put this here. Seriously)**. We can get past this. I just need you to believe in me like I believe in us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy problem with this whole apology is the lack of responsibility and owning up to **your** part in it while quickly trying to brush it all away with blaming the universe, and justifying what you did. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nReally doesn't come off as genuine. Though I can see an ENTJ possibly being okay with it, but it isn't a healthy way to move forward. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou've hurt your ENTJ friend, and instead of making it better - **you're asking for more.** 
5	Waxing poetic makes this seem like self-indulgent theatre,  when what you need is a simple, humble apology. I see an acknowledgement here, but no "I'm sorry, please forgive me". 
5	It’s a bit condescending.  \nThe best apologies are short and real.   \nJust say, “I’m a dick and I’m truly sorry”.  \nMean it.  \nThen, stop being a dick. 
2	It would be better to call and talk. But given the level of precautions you have been taking you have messed big time and this will just push it. 
2	Do you still need advice on this. If I am upset at you I’ve probably stated why. There’s a solid reason. I guess I would send you back a message that would read as the following.\n\nI am wondering if you understood the core of the issue here as to why I am upset at you. I stated (said reason before). These are some interesting thoughts you have but I think you need to try to understand the issues at hand.\n\nI would elaborate again. I usually deal with problems usually swiftly usually get addressed that day so I don’t know why it would carry on to the next.. with me I would assume you didn’t reply to my last message so I would probably say something like did you read my last message I have been trying to resolve this problem with you can you please respond directly to that please?\n\nCan you tell me here or message me as to your problems with this person maybe I can try to help in more detail? Why is he mad at you?
4	ur vocabulary sucks. use pragmatic terms, not poetic metaphors
3	>it has become ingrained in my purpose never to hurt you again \n  \nPretentious to an autistic degree.
1	But what did you DO?\n\n&#x200B;
1	Just keep the last sentence.  "We can get past this."
1	ENTJ's hate nothing more than weak emotional messages. You are giving him the pass to unfriend you. 
1	As an ENTJ here's honestly how I would react:\n"Wtf is this"\nJust being brutally honest.
0	Not crazy. I like how clear you are. Consider excising everything past “... we can continue being that for each other.” The emotional message you’re trying to get across might be compromised by the more detached/impersonal language used in the last sentence or two.\n\nEdit: spelling
22	How do you beat procrastination as an ENTJ? Please help!!	I'm a sixteen year old ENTJ and a sophomore in high school. I'm extremely ambitious and I seriously love learning, but I have a huge procrastination problem. When I'm working on something for a class I'm passionate about or a project I'm leading, I can work tirelessly for hours with complete concentration. However, when faced with something I'm not passionate about or uninterested, I physically can't get motivated. I also have a huge fear of failure. This means a HUGE procrastination problem. To make this worse, my battle with procrastination is very unique. While most procrastinators are slackers and procrastinate because they simply don't want to work, my procrastination stems from my intense fear of failure. Often times I can't work because I'm too scared to fail. My school is hard but the coursework isn't challenging and I take extensive notes; so I know I can succeed, but I still struggle with getting motivated and being able to do my work with optimal effort and receive the grades I want. Does anyone have any advice or means of getting motivated and getting shit done? I need help asap so thank you :)
14	Avoidance due to anxiety. Super common. Lots of good life hacks for this one. \n\n* Commit to 5 minutes. You can go back to video games after minute 6 if you want, but commit to 5 minutes. Repeat as necessary.\n\n* Get interested. Relate it to something you care about, or get someone you care about to help you.\n\n* Up the ante. Set a deadline, reward success, and make failure hurt.\n\n* Realize that you don't have to do it. It's an option, and you're ignoring that option. Acknowledge it, accept it, and consider the value that "doing it" brings to the table. Chase after positives, or decide it isn't worth it.\n\n* Confront your feelings, give them names, and figure out why they're there.\n\nAlso see if you think your problems may be ADD or ADHD-related. It's over-diagnosed, but if you have it you may not need medication to manage it more effectively. 
9	1. Make a list of what you need to do\n2. Make a list under those titles of the steps you need to take to accomplish it.\n3. Allocate time slots/time spent for each step.\n\nMake everything into a game (or whatever you find enjoyment in).
18	**1) Create specific goal:**\n\n\- Bad: Start working out\n\n\- Good: Run 18 miles a week over a 6 day period for 10 weeks. \n\n**2) Focus on goal.**\n\nThat is it. Even if something is uninteresting I find having a defined goal is enough to stop procrastination.
4	I shared a similar problem when I was your age. The best advice I got is not to stop procrastinating, but to procrastinate smart. Procrastinate in a way that makes you more pressured to do the work, but not so pressured that you're overwhelmed. Take this example: you have 2 weeks to write a 4 page paper. You know that it will take you at least 6 hours to complete, and you can give at most 2 hours per day to it. I would wait and start work on the paper 4 days before: 3 days to work and 1 day to be flexible and to review/edit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nENTJs have a tendency to be planners - use that tendency to your advantage. Plan out your time like this, and I think you'll see huge success. Also, a large, physical calendar on my wall/desk has made a huge difference in my organizational abilities. LMK if this helps and feel free to ask any questions.
4	I think that’s a pretty typical thing for 3s and entjs to do or if it’s in your stack. I usually prioritized what I feared most and got it out of the way first.\n\nI would think that I’ll pass over that I would fail. Keep those thoughts out of your head. Have a more can do attitude.\n\nI am a 3 by the way. So I know what that feeling is I fight the feeling quite often.
3	The thumb rule of overcoming a 'fear of X' is to bloody well do X. If you fear failure, go out of your way to fail first. Just condition your mind that the first attempt will be a failure.\n\nHow will your brain fear something if it knows it's around the corner? You wouldn't be scared during a horror movie if I already told you the plot beforehand.\n\nSomewhere along the line, (you won't even notice) you have already started the task and the momentum tides you over. \n\nThese days when I sit down to study I almost ensure that I get my math wrong or write some gibberish explanation. It's hilarious but thereafter I just get on with it.\n\nI know this advice comes across as too strong but it worked for me.
3	What happens if you fail?\n\nIs failure a bad thing?\n\nHave you ever failed, in your life?\n\nI'm guessing you haven't, or at least not much.\n\nElon Musk, Warren Buffett, Bill Gates— all of these guys ***failed***. Multiple times. However, the amount of times they got back up was one more than the times they failed.\n\nWhat separates most people from them, isn't an inability to fail. It's the ability to keep trying.\n\nIf you want to succeed, shift your mindset from "I can never fail" to "I can never stop trying". Because, trust me, you're going to fail. A lot.\n\nI look forward to seeing progress updates. You've got this. 
3	Think about happy you will feel when you succeed. Work towards that. \n\nTake some time off to relax though. Don’t burn out 
2	Kung Fu or Karate. 
2	Is it just fear of failure, or have you been pushing so hard you burned yourself out?  I found that, for me, fear of failure and anxiety tends to dramatically increase when I've worked myself into burnout. 
2	Ehh, I am a 14 year old ENTJ often said to be "Too mature" but I guess I can sent some tips for other Entj's who procrastinate a lot or stressed. ☆\n--\n1. You can try to confront yourself and make yourself do it.\n\n2. Watch YouTube relax yourself, put on music and get in the mood.🎳\n\n3. Try to prevent yourself getting off tasks, get confident and sober yourself up.🥋\n\n4. Ask yourself do you want to be successful? Do you want to improve and do better?🤺💓\n\n5. Don't fear failure but fear of not trying, don't work yourself out, release the intensity.🙅‍♀️🙅‍♂️\n\n6. Eat some food, drink water! 🍐🍵\n\n7. Relax yourself from too much stuff going in your head, organize your thoughts.☕\n\n8. Take deep breathes ⭐😤\n------\nHope it helps! :^) ☆☆☆☆
1	This is classic.

53	ENTJ emotional behaviors	In my years of lurking/modding here, I've seen some trends that resonate among us. \n\nStereotypically, we're paradoxically both cold and understanding. Fearless leaders with terrible anxiety. Incredibly popular, but devastatingly alone.\n\nI've noticed that people with ENTJ tendencies tend to do four things:\n\n* Adopt technical skills quickly, especially when they have a wide perspective\n\n* Become more enthralled by technical things than by people, but still get energy from people. Learn people skills slowly, and fuck up their way up to proficiency (fake it till ya make it)\n\n* Develop serious anxiety issues due to constant social fuckups, but either power through them (and have them still) or actively try to die a little inside. Emotions are a tricky subject because loneliness is a major source of literal, actual, physical pain. \n\n* Look for the top, and ignore or underestimate all of the people, skills, and hard work that they need to do to get there. This leads to unearned arrogance and selfishness, which can be a serious liability.\n\nMy point is many of y'all need therapy. We all bottle up emotions one way or another. But you don't need to raw dog reality by yourself. \n\nFind a professional that you respect that your insurance will take, and just talk through your emotional problems. Anxiety is a bitch, so make it your bitch.
19	I've got anxiety but it's a weird kind that I'm not even sure is really happening when it is. I'm trying to say I don't have anxiety, but I look back often and wonder, "did I have anxiety?"
10	I feel obliged to remind you all while we're on a typology forum that your enneagram is not just something you write on your tinder profile. It holds the keys of your personal happiness somewhere in there.\n\nIf you're 3 and your fear is to be worthless than learn how to fail. Start things, all of them and fail at them miserably. You're an image focused type of guy? Then make a clown out of your self. Hell play the whole circus.  A fear is just that at the end of the day. Eventually along all of your failures you'll learn that it's not the end of the world. That it's part of a process. And that it doesn't hurt all that much.\n\nDon't wait for the tsunami to hit you from behind rather and go face the tides until they're nothing but steady and predictable waves if you want a picture. \n\nSome of you practice stoicism. Well that's basically what it is. You make yourself tough so that when shit comes your way, you don't fall on your knees like a little bitch. \n\nI might add that as a 3 your point of disintegration is 9. You lying around, spacing out, doing nothing is no bueno. You'll loose yourself a lot quicker than what you may think. \n\nYour point of integration is 6. That's when you learn how to work with your team. That's bueno. Do it.\n\nBe the Naruto of your story. Good luck champion. 
8	>My point is that many of ya’ll need therapy \n\nSo everything leading up to that was just you buttering us up for an intervention, huh. Seriously tho, I agree with the sentiment. Most people in the world could use it.\n\nI don’t experience constant social fuckups, my anxiety (both healthy and unhealthy) arises more out of a perfectionistic drive. A lot of people these days are extremely hard on themselves for things that weren’t actually a big deal and/or things they cannot change, and an excessive fear of those experiences is pretty much the definition of social anxiety. I recommend finding a specialist in CBT, as it is the most effective form of treatment for this.\n\nOne useful technique for when your mind is blowing painful/annoying experiences out of proportion goes as follows: create a mental image of the event, then shrink it down to the size of a pinpoint in your mind- because that’s how much space it should be occupying. 
8	The existential anxiety you refer to is your intuition and logic trying to tell you that you're wasting your  time.  And you're not being completely authentic to yourself.  Find some more productive activities like going to the gym, I go twice a day and that existential anxiety and loneliness has gone away.  We are driven people 24/7.  \n\nSecondly if you're going to go out to places like bars (you mentioned feeling anxiety in your other comment) you need to be direct and network as much as possible and get numbers when you're there.  Otherwise you will feel anxiety if you start feeling it's not worth it being there.  We don't think like others and "hanging out with the bros" is a means to an end. Don't kid yourself that you're there to relax.  \n\nAnd lastly, the anxiety is there because you have way more potential than you're owning up to.  I.e. there is something in your life that you truly feel you can improve on and have not done so.  Dig deep and find out what that is.\n\n
6	I relate to all of that. In therapy. Do recommend.
5	Jordan Peterson is my free online therapist, which helps.
4	I’ve never felt more understood by a Reddit post...damn
5	I know it sounds really dumb, but knowing other people are going through this helps.  Someone messaged me because they hadn't seen me in a few days and just wanted to make sure I was ok.  I'm in my 30s, and no one has EVER just checked in to make sure I was ok until last week. It is insane to me how much that tiny little thing meant. And then I realized someone cares enough to want to check on me, and how do I handle this? \n\nI tried explaining the loneliness to someone once, and the response I got was, "But you're so popular! Everyone wants to be in your orbit." You can't explain that you didn't understand people and never fit in as a kid because of it.  Because you never acted out and were always the star student, the adults gave you credit for being mature even though you could never fit in with a peer group. And never fitting in means you ended up with the adults, so you REALLY never developed social skills.  What they saw as maturity was actually developmental delays that the adults never thought to help you with.\n\nOdds are you're a young adult by the time you understand WHY you were an outcast as a kid, but you're so socially behind it feels like you'll never catch up, so you throw yourself into being successful.  Suddenly people want to be around you, and you don't know what to do with it. You missed the entire part of childhood that's about building friendships (most of my friends through school years were fellow outcasts). And the leap from outcast to "it girl" is... What the fuck do you even DO with it? All I wanted as a teen was to know what it is to be popular. I'm surrounded by people all the time, and the more people end up in my orbit, the lonelier I get. \n\nI never know which friendships are genuine, and who just wants something from me. Outside of family? I can count on one hand the number of honest, close friendships I have. 
3	I must admit I have messed up once or twice on the social fuckup scale. What you said is totally correct, I don't think I have been able to forgive myself completely or have my own closure, so "actively trying to die inside" or pushing through it rings true. Others have forgiven me, but I am "perfect", and as a child I was told not to show emotion (dad yelled at me whenever I cried or shown any negative emotion). So basically I have always repressed emotions as a result of childhood. 
2	Im trying to quit therapy but I’m not sure how it’s gonna go. 
2	But what if you're too busy winning to have anxiety???
1	Have you ever thought about how in the grand scale of things in the universe we're nothing with all that we'd achieve will be for naught when we dissipate in 100+ years. We've been born in a period where the percentage is still a whole number in humanity's 2000+ period of intelligence in that we still haven't seen the full extent of humanity's potential. For all we know we're heading into a society akin to The Culture and we've missed it by a few percentage points by being born in an earlier period than optimal. That's the type of anxiety I get, alongside with what it means to be useful in your lifespan. I need a therapist with some gin. 
1	Oh lord much of this is true for me. I definitely need therapy but have never been. The only time I came close was offering to go to save my relationship. My anxiety is a monster.
1	"Incredibly popular, but devastatingly alone." Couldn't have agreed any more my friend- my problem isn't that I am not in a social circle but rather that I am in every single one of them. Last 4 weeks I felt lonely for the first time in a long while. I became so good at talking it was almost like an instinct, I didn't even care about hearing people out. My body almost on its own crafted responses and I watched my body talk in almost third person for ever interaction.\n\nSame agreement goes for  "we're paradoxically both cold and understanding." I can feel emotions of others in a profound, grasping manner but at the same time be so rude that I would be considered a "dick/a-hole".\n\nI disagree with  "Fearless leaders with terrible anxiety" since I personally don't feel like anxious, merely fearless(almost to a dangerous extent but not completely). I rationally tell myself that if something isn't in my control I mustn't worry- my work should speak in itself and if I fail, it is a collection of all my errors which can be fixed. I do dislike insecurity but believe that it is my control what happens next.
1	Lmao definitely me, if u look at my recent post titled 'ANXIETY ANXIETY' I legit went nuts or having a emotional breakdown from too much researching, test, and quizzes I do for fun and to fulfill my curiosity lolol.

1	ENTJ emotions and dating	As an ENTJ what are your experiences with heart break? Almost a year ago I was in a relationship with an INFJ male that ended rather abruptly, though not entirely without warning since intuitively it seemed like our relationship wasn't going to last as long as I wanted it to last. However, I also have realized that I have an almost absurdly high desire to think that people can work out anything as long as they are able to do the dirty work to figure things out.   \n\n\nI did, however, see some extremely weird behaviors come out towards the end of that relationship.  \nFirst, I cried an insane amount, so much that it freaked me the heck out because I don't cry over anything.   \nI also realized that despite the norm that ENTJs think emotions instead of FEEL them, I actually FELT every possible emotion over the course of my relationship with an INFJ and I'm not sure if it's healthy for an ENTJ to have that much feeling--it definitely was not typical ENTJ as far as I'm aware, but I have not been able to figure out quite what was going on at the personality level.   \n\n\nI do know my ex slacked off more than I would have liked when it came to working through some issues, and eventually it brought out a tiger in me and I was basically ready to attack anything and everything--it was very weird. It was almost as if I was perceiving him as the biggest obstacle to our relationship because I was doing a ton of research and studying to try to see if we could find common ground and he mostly seemed overwhelmed by the sheer amount of dedication to making something work, though part of that could have been the ENTJ/INFJ combo.   \n\n\nAnyway, tell me what you discovered about your emotional make up when you dated or were in a relationship with a very different personality type--if you want. :)  \n
6	I don't think you had more emotion than an ENTJ should have. It is unfortunate but what probably happened is that all of your feelings came to head at once. It can be scary to feel so many emotions all at one time, especially when you're not used to it. \n\nI am sorry about your breakup and that it left you feeling the way it did.
2	I’m an ENTJ. Your experience is similar to my own. I was (and am) also in a relationship with an INFJ male. The problem on which we couldn’t reach an agreement was an instance of infidelity on my part and it resulted in our separation. I tried to find common ground, offer assurances and therapy for my fuckup but the next half year was a toxic hell. We eventually started speaking again once I was adult enough to own up to my mistake without any blame at all for his reactions, and we have been back together for four years and couldn’t be happier. I learned that I was thinking too much, not feeling enough, and almost lost my soulmate because of it. It became a contest of who was more wrong because of his terrible reaction to what I had done, but I eventually snapped out of it and realized that was unfair because none of it would have happened if not for me. Anything can be worked out... but you both have to be willing to try. There is nothing preventing ENTJ/INFJ from having a happy and healthy relationship if they both work hard enough and don’t expect things the other can’t give. I’ve had friends tell me we’ll never work because of our types but, other than me fucking up, everything was perfect. My fucking up had zero to do with types as every type does it. To this day I believe it was an attempt to sabotage because I was so anxious about the relationship.

1	(Warning: INFP not ENTJ) - It sounds to me like you finally hit "emotional overload" and it just all came to a head. Like, it was all too much for you to handle and finally your brain just dumped all of those feelings on you, but since it doesn't happen often to you, you weren't entirely sure how to respond. Your normal coping skills were just not cutting it in the face of the situation. Make Sense? What I'm really getting from this is that you felt an intense emotional frustration that you tried so hard to fix this, but you felt  your ex just bowed out. Sounds incredibly frustrating and heartbreaking to me. Understandable that your brain would hit full emotional capacity and you'd act differently than normal.
1	I dated an isfp. And it was an interesting experience to say the least. I am not a really emotional person and dating isn’t really my thing. I dated an esfp and then an isfp. I broke up the one with the esfp which I am friends with still. The isfp told me he was done. My ni was telling me this wasn’t going to work. I wanted it to work desperately. He was a pretty immature isfp. In society’s standard he was also you didn’t need mbti to tell you he was interesting. I guess I was sort of mothering marshalling him for the very longest time. Haha! People actually asked me why I dated him. Haha! It’s like I expect better of you. Haha!\n\nBut I think it was this want to care, this shock and numbness which was overwhelming.
1	I personally think the INFJ/ ENTJ combo is really great if they’ve both had time to mature and are ready for commitment. My ENTJ guy balances me out. Maybe infj isn’t the problem it just wasn’t the right infj for you <3
34	ENTJs sexual gods. Thanks.	Just came to say that after sleeping with a second ENTJ, you guys are literally the best at it out of all the types, like ever. You might be full on but that translates well into the bedroom. That is all. 
22	So this guy must be your 17th 
14	Life tip for young men: 99% of guys won't ever admit they never learned to make love, and hence won't learn anything about doing it well. That means a big share of guys are counting on natural talent while there is valuable material out there teaching you how to please and enjoy your time with a woman, a thousand different ways.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n"There are two things a man will never admit he cannot do well: drive and make love." - Sir Stirling Moss
15	As the long term partner of a female entj, I have to agree. She is forward and open, and shares herself with me in every way. It is as though there are no boundaries between us. And I really appreciate how hungrily and unabashedly she goes for my chicken wings. OOOWWEEEE!!
9	meanwhile, a month ago... "[Why do ENTJs rub me the wrong way...](https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/a8u9o7/why_do_entjs_rub_me_the_wrong_way/)"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe wonders of hatefucking, I guess.
7	Can confirm, turned professional.
3	Aww shucks\n\nIt's nice to be appreciated
4	What's your type?\n\nOh and please describe what you like specifically. Dating an INFJ currently and we are slowly getting more serious. 
1	Another one bites the dust.
1	Ok I just wanna stop by to say I don’t know if they’re as great as they think bc foreplay doesn’t seem to be on the top of their priority list lol

7	Unrequited love	Anyone have a solution for this? Please?
12	Will excessive exercise fix it?
9	\n> Anyone have a solution for this? Please?\n\nOut of sight - out of mind.\n\nIt is a numbers game. Go on 100 dates. Spend a month on Tinder or a year on dating sites.\n
4	An INFJ friend (master of the door slam) gave me excellent advice when I was fixated on a man I needed to forget. Infatuation is essentially a chemical addiction. Your brain is giving you a little kick every time you fantasize about that person, and you need to wean yourself off. She literally told me to put them out of my mind when I thought of them. Forcibly avoid thinking about them and considering them at all, turn your mind to other things. It's amazing that this actually works, after five years of a fraught emotional relationship I no longer feel anything for him after just a couple of months. Now I see him as so unexceptional I don't know what I saw in him in the first place. Give it a try.
3	This wasn't the one for you. Someone who values you will return the time, efforts, words as they are able.\n\n  \n\n\nKnow your worth.
2	I have a great boyfriend and still crushing on this same man for over a year whether I see him or not. I have dreams about him. It’s totally bizarre and insane and illogical.
2	Could be birth control pills messing with your brain chemistry. Its crazy that you cant expect the dude to wear a rubber every time.\n
2	I feel like I’m on the verge of working it out and can’t quite get there.
2	Yes! I listened to [this meditation](https://soulrises.com/meditate/12-minute-meditation-to-relieve-sadness) twice, sobbing in the car, trying to get it together before going to pick up my daughter from afterschool. I realized that all the things I love about him are \*in\* me already, or how could I appreciate them. I realized that he is just the lesson. I listened to this meditation twice, and picked up my daughter and we went home and had a joyful evening at home. Obviously, I had to do more meditation over several weeks, but I swear to you it will heal you if you give it a chance. <3   \n \n\nAnd, from Rumi:\n\n“Stop acting so small. You are the universe in ecstatic motion.”\n\n“The wound is the place where the Light enters you.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
2	Any reasons? A way to get closure?\n\nMaybe a good reason was they didn't want you and going for someone that doesn't want you is stupid. How'd your rest of life look like? Crap!\n\nBur even without negatives: cleanse yourself from them i.e. pictures, contact anything and assume they don't exist for a while and in the mean time do things that make you happy, be with people who male you happy and just let it go.\n\nYou know there are a million people in this world and many of them you don't love and you have a right to decide that and similarly those people have a right to decide too. It's just as simple and nothing personal. The only time it really sucks is when you're a little blindsided.
1	It’s not working.
1	I don’t think that’s it. I think relationships are inherently flawed. I need to find some as semblance of peace of mind because without it I am not living my best self or stepping out of my comfort zone.
1	Somebody has this figured out. There’s a book out there or something that has a road map to fixing this. I can’t seem to find it though.
1	It’s a simple solution. I move on. If he wanted to go out with me, he would ask.
1	Thank you
1	Bull shit only 5% of the population is experiencing limerence. I am trying to detox from feelings and every darn song on the radio is secretly about this guy that never asks me out. I sent him a text at lunchtime and then had to disconnect my stereo. If 5% of the population is experiencing limerence, then 70% of the population is with the wrong person and in denial, and 25% of the population is either healthy or incapable of experiencing love. Screw you radio.

2	Increasing Human Energy: Where we fit into the world.	How do ENTJs fit into the world?  Why do we have this deep seated burning desire to succeed?  We are the human powerhouses and it's important that we hone our skills.  But why?  Is it an evolutionary advantage for us to be ruthless individuals stopping at nothing to win and how does this translate to the whole?  Why do we have a need to always bring our A-game? You're probably already doing great things but just incase you feel confused as to why you have this deep urge and desire to succeed while nobody else cares or understands you.  Hopefully I can bring forth more clarity for you fellow ENTJs who want to turn it up a notch or early ENTJs just trying to learn who they are and develop.\n\nIt all comes down to what Tesla describes in his book "The Problem of Increasing Human Energy".  Here is the excerpt I urge you to read.\n\n\[See *Nikola Tesla: Colorado Springs Notes*, page 334, Photograph X.\] \n\n^(FIG. 1. BURNING THE NITROGEN OF THE ATMOSPHERE.Note to Fig. 1 This result is produced by the discharge of an electrical oscillator giving twelve million volts.  The electrical pressure, alternating one hundred thousand times per second, excites the normally inert nitrogen, causing it to combine with the oxygen.  The flame-like discharge shown in the photograph measures sixty-five feet across.)\n\nWhen we speak of man, we have a conception of humanity as a whole, and before applying scientific methods to, the investigation of his movement we must accept this as a physical fact.  But can anyone doubt to-day that all the millions of individuals and all the innumerable types and characters constitute an entity, a unit?  Though free to think and act, we are held together, like the stars in the firmament, with ties inseparable.  These ties cannot be seen, but we can feel them.  I cut myself in the finger, and it pains me: this finger is a part of me.  I see a friend hurt, and it hurts me, too: my friend and I are one.  And now I see stricken down an enemy, a lump of matter which, of all the lumps of matter in the universe, I care least for, and it still grieves me.  Does this not prove that each of us is only part of a whole?\n\nFor ages this idea has been proclaimed in the consummately wise teachings of religion, probably not alone as a means of insuring peace and harmony among men, but as a deeply founded truth.  The Buddhist expresses it in one way, the Christian in another, but both say the same: We are all one.  Metaphysical proofs are, however, not the only ones which we are able to bring forth in support of this idea.  Science, too, recognizes this connectedness of separate individuals, though not quite in the same sense as it admits that the suns, planets, and moons of a constellation are one body, and there can be no doubt that it will be experimentally confirmed in times to come, when our means and methods for investigating psychical and other states and phenomena shall have been brought to great perfection.  Still more: this one human being lives on and on.  The individual is ephemeral, races and nations come and pass away, but man remains.  Therein lies the profound difference between the individual and the whole.  Therein, too, is to be found the partial explanation of many of those marvelous phenomena of heredity which are the result of countless centuries of feeble but persistent influence.\n\nConceive, then, man as a mass urged on by a force.  Though this movement is not of a translatory character, implying change of place, yet the general laws of mechanical movement are applicable to it, and the energy associated with this mass can be measured, in accordance with well-known principles, by half the product of the mass with the square of a certain velocity.  So, for instance, a cannon-ball which is at rest possesses a certain amount of energy in the form of heat, which we measure in a similar way.  We imagine the ball to consist of innumerable minute particles, called atoms or molecules, which vibrate or whirl around one another.  We determine their masses and velocities, and from them the energy of each of these minute systems, and adding them all together, we get an idea of the total heat-energy contained in the ball, which is only seemingly at rest.  In this purely theoretical estimate this energy may then be calculated by multiplying half of the total mass is that is half of the sum of all the small masses with the square of a velocity which is determined from the velocities of the separate particles.  In like manner we may conceive of human energy being measured by half the human mass multiplied with the square of the velocity which we are not yet able to compute.  But our deficiency in this knowledge will not vitiate the truth of the deductions I shall draw, which rest on the firm basis that the same laws of mass and force govern throughout nature.\n\nMan, however, is not an ordinary mass, consisting of spinning atoms and molecules, and containing merely heat-energy.  He is a mass possessed of certain higher qualities by reason of the creative principle of life with which he is endowed.  His mass, as the water in an ocean wave, is being continuously exchanged, new taking the place of the old.  Not only this, but he grows propagates, and dies, thus altering his mass independently, both in bulk and density.  What is most wonderful of all, he is capable of increasing or diminishing his velocity of movement by the mysterious power he possesses by appropriating more or less energy from other substance, and turning it into motive energy.  But in any given moment we may ignore these slow changes and assume that human energy is measured by half the product of man's mass with the square of a certain hypothetical velocity.  However we may compute this velocity, and whatever we may take as the standard of its measure, we must, in harmony with this conception, come to the conclusion that the great problem of science is, and always will be, to increase the energy thus defined.  Many years ago, stimulated by the perusal of that deeply interesting work, Draper's "[History of the Intellectual Development of Europe](http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/diglib/books/A-E/D/draper/draptoc.htm)," depicting so vividly human movement, I recognized that to solve this eternal problem must ever be the chief task of the man of science.  Some results of my own efforts to this end I shall endeavor briefly to describe here.\n\n**TL;DR**   "Man, however, is not an ordinary mass, consisting of spinning atoms and molecules, and containing merely heat-energy.  He is a mass possessed of certain higher qualities by reason of the creative principle of life with which he is endowed...What is most wonderful of all, he is capable of increasing or diminishing his velocity of movement by the mysterious power he possesses by appropriating more or less energy from other substance, and turning it into motive energy."  **Tesla is not just referring to velocity as a physical speed but metaphysical speed of the progression of mankind.**\n\nIn conclusion why is it so important that we always bring our A-game? **To fulfill our existential purpose.  That is to move the human race forward,** and as ENTJs we are all about leading and efficiency.  We're perfect for the job.\n\n&#x200B;

8	ENTJ stuck in pointlessness	Hello\n\nI am here, 20yo, to describe my situation and try to see if anyone here has any experience on how to get out of this struggle.\n\nI used to be a younger wannabe successful entrepreneur, and had projects and ideas but nothing truely came out successful. Then I had some mentor that totally changed my approach and had me learn many new stuff (I'll forever be thankful for this and will definitely return the favour) but this hasn't brought me anywhere.\n\nNothing, from personal finance to physical health, stamina, and actual skills have improved during these years. I'm yet to be ready to achieve anything (so far out of a dozen of projects, none came to fruition)\n\nOnly failure, reliance on someone else's will and passivity has been the new things that came into my life. I'm saddened and desperate for a solution, to regrow something resembling talent, will and confidence. \n\nI haven't been listening to myself during these years and knew i could have done so much more if this hasn't been the case.\n\nWhat do you guys see in this, and what would you propose me to do?
9	Failure is part of life and very normal. You only become a failure of a person when you give up and stop trying.
2	Invest in yourself (read, travel) and chase novelty (pick out a new industry, a new job, new hobbies and activities).  Can't tell you better, that's what I am doing since high school (though I studied in university) and so far it's broadening my knowledge of myself and the world, aiming to a point where I'll be able to create something by my hands and make it grow. Personal example: currently positioning myself for a job in a foreign country and in an industry I have yet to discover, and passing time by learning about ice hockey, Magic The Gathering, and blockchain. Reading LOTR also. Just constantly broadening horizons, learning stuff.\n\nFor mental and physical conditions, the Four Horsemen of Well-Being : eat well and reasonably, sleep tight, exercise, meditate every other day. Get at least 20 minutes of exposure to the sunlight per day (even if cloudy) so you get vitamin D in your metabolism (betters mood, harmonize emotions, regulate sleep).
2	Have you read any books on psychology? Positive psychology is totally worth learning about and can improve your well-being simultaneously! Let me know if you want specific ideas or examples. 
1	Don't give up.\n\nHere is a start. Follow Dan Lok, then Dan Pena.\n\n[How To Become Rich - 3 Steps For REAL + LASTING Wealth - with Dan Lok](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qY7xzGUYIhY)\n\nIt should give you ideas.\n
1	What exactly are you trying to achieve? \n\nIt is unclear. \n\nIf your aim is unclear, then the feeling of pointlessness is more likely. \n\nThink of it as not placing the coordinates in your GPS. You'll just end up going in circles. \n\nThe amount of failures any individual has doesn't equate owing of success. \n\nWhat makes you, you, is how many times you can stand up from failure. \n\n1. Stop counting your failures and see them as lessons. \n\n2. Define clearer goals. \n\n3. Define mini/daily goals. \n\n4. Set milestones. \n\n5. Define a measuring system. \n\n6. Keep reconfiguring your approach after every lesson. \n\nEventually, you'll get there. \n\n
1	Find something you can be passionate about you can do and not be uninvested in. University is good indeed. I think ntjs can easily do university.\n\nI know the stereotype is business, ceo, start a company. But that’s a stereotype. Not all entjs are that way or so inclined. Maybe you’re destined for some other fields. I know about one who’s very popular and successful who is a christian apologist. I am studying to enter government work and to hold offices. Find your fit.\n\nMaybe it’s really not to own a venture or a business. Maybe that’s just not it. Maybe that’s not for you. I’ve thought about it a few times I know this guy who is in to it and wants me to as well. He’s some sort of unhealthy lonely something need to think about it more. But the point is maybe it’s not for you. As it isn’t for me. I’ve thought about it but seriously start a business. Maybe not me, work in corporate as a manager I just... don’t know. I am really happy where I am now I think. Could be wrong but I hope I am right.. 
1	Spend more time on reddit.
1	Are you attending college? Get a college degree
0	(Probably) Stupid 'CAN I BE ____ AND ENTJ' question	I have always been more of a 'stand at the back of the group' person, I strategise well and I want others to implement my strategy to succeed, but no one ever fucking listens to me and I'll feel anxiety if I speak to a large group. \n\nI'm good with smaller groups but for the ones with more than 25 people, I'll never be good at being in charge of them. I don't have a commanding presence and people always elect ESXPs as the leaders but most people on here state that you generally get good support when you lead.\n\nI'm considering INTJ now, I know that typing is based on functions, but this has been a trend that I've been noticing and I can't not avoid it. Thoughts? 
3	Yeah, probably intj. Then entj. I think most of us don’t like standing at the back of the group.\n\nCan you relate to ni and te?
3	Based on the other comments, you’re probably just young and growing into your abilities. Socialising won’t come naturally all of sudden, so you have to keep making small efforts to improve at networking and meeting people, but you’ll eventually learn to love it.\n\nI was like you and always watched before doing. Sometimes for too long and I’d miss good opportunities to dive in and just have a first attempt and see where that got me. Eventually I learned to be okay with making myself look silly and that has done insane shit for my confidence.
12	How do I help my ENTJ BFF (INFJ M 30)	He's 30, male, and the most determined human being on the face of the planet. He's been insanely stressed recently. He just bought a condo, and even though there is no timeline for when he needs to finish decorating/furnishing he feels like he's behind and it annoys him. He hates his job, has been in tons of interviews lately for a new one and always gets to the final stage before being rejected. He's a serious mess emotionally, but he won't slow down. Sometimes he'll just stare at his phone for a half hour and then declare, "There, 15 more jobs applied for"  \n\n\nHe'll talk to me for extended periods about his problems, saying the same things over and over again. I'm more than happy to just listen, and he says it helps. I support him in his evaluation of his circumstance and encourage him, reminding him of how capable he is (seriously though, his stamina is remarkable). Ultimately I want to do something more, what could it be? Even when he's complaining and telling me how awful he feels he's smiling. I'm used to letting my NFP friends cry it out, but that's not his style.  \n\n\nAny suggestions on what else I can do to support/uplift him? 
14	Be there to listen and occasionally encourage. We typically work through our problems in our mind and just need a trustworthy ear to vent to. If he goes too far(which most ENTJ’s don’t) that’s when you slap some sense in him. He will bounce back. We always do 
9	We ENTJs get caught in these loops. On the one hand they are productive and earth shattering. You can bet he will eventually find a big job. On the other hand they are destructive and we forgot about what is important. Take a leadership role. Help him to take a break from the loop. Tell him to turn his phone off. Make him do feely perceptive things. Take him painting or to a salsa dancing class. Make him get out of his comfort zone.
5	This cracks me up because I can relate.... If I'm being honest, I'm the most happy when I'm chasing something or working towards some goal. It's a stressful and overwhelming situation to be in, but the payoff is going to be a phenomenal high. Don't let him lose that perspective. We like to talk about our goals and future, we like to bounce ideas off of other people. It's not necessarily a cry for help. I think that what you're doing now is perfectly fine, just let him ride it out
3	The best thing for him is to get into a position where he's in control. Help him start a small business? Or conmect him with entrepreneurs? This depends on his skill sets though.
2	Tell me more about your friend. \n\nWhat kind of jobs is he looking for? \n\nWhat are some of his repeat problems?\n\nWhat is his greatest pain/passion?\n\nWhat was the motivation for buying the condo?
2	nothing conceptual, as you have zero perspective. take care of the material stuff and emotional stuff.   \naka in an interraction his input 90%, your input 10% conceptually. which mostly would be a few questions about feelings to move things forward, or rephrasing and other listening strategies  
2	I think that someone has sort of covered this, encourage him to slow down.
1	Interesting post. During one of my most stressed times recently, an ENFJ helped me out immensely. I don't think there was much he physically/actually *did* other than spend time actively listening to me complain/whine/rant/stress, but his positivity was infectious, his optimism was extremely uplifting and **that** was what mattered.\n\nIf I have to summarize in a way that absolutely doesn't do his charisma justice, it was a lot of positive messages - things might suck now, but all bad times lead to great ones / examples of how hard work pays off / stories of famous, wildly successful people doing through tough times and struggling/failing. \n\nFi tends to make us dig ourselves deeper and deeper into a ditch. If it's being negative, we can't stop the spiral. What really helps is to "trigger" our Ni again so we remember there is a bigger picture, and then an even bigger picture beyond that. Then, Fi gets rewired into positive/motivated feelings and our Ni+Te can take care of the doing parts (they're very good at it, no worries). \n\n*Don't be afraid to tell ENTJs how to feel*. We take stuff at face value.
1	To me what would help me the most is straight up constructive advice. \n\nTell me what I’m doing wrong, tell me why it’s happening this way and suggest me a way to tackle the problem.
12	How to get out of this Fi stuff	This is one of my worst days. I'm stressed out with work, none of my friends respect me enough to listen to what I have to say, none of them believes in what I can do (I'm starting to doubt myself now), and my ISFJ friend continuously fires morally degrading comments at me or sometimes ignores me when I talk to her. She's the only person in the class I can talk to well, and I don't have the energy to interact with new people anymore.\n\nWorst of all, my messed up emotions decided to appear and I had a breakdown in the restroom. I cursed really loud in class and got called out by the professor, and another two in other classes. I felt useless, stupid and inferior to everyone.\n\nThis all happened after a really bad dream saying how I killed my family and that I'm going to have really bad luck soon. I'm paranoid about everything and emotional over every small fuck-up.\n\nI know this may not be Fi, but I figured that someone here may know or experienced something like this. Anyone had this once? 
11	1. Limit/stop the exposure with your ISFJ. She's doing nothing for your mental/emotional health right now. (This helps the spiral)\n\n\n2. Take a breath. \n\n\n3. Talk to someone you trust/can feel safe without judgements and/or someone that will actively listen. (This allows you to feel deeply how you feel and so you can move past it)\n\n\n4. Take another breath. \n\n\n5. Identify how you got to where you did. Work on preventative strategies. (Re-engage your Te)\n\n\n6. Take a breath. \n\n\n... If it doesn't work. \n\n\n7. Tire yourself physically and channel your emotions into something physical. (engages Se and endorphins as bonuses)\n \n\nDon't be so hard on yourself. Find someone to have a laugh with. \n\n
7	1. Avoid the ISFJ.  Next time she throws bs at you cut her off by walking away.  They're good at gaslighting, effectively removing all your logic and intuitive thinking.   Realize what they are throwing at you is nothing but emotional triggers.  They are the epitome of Brownian movement.\n2. Hit the gym asap.
5	Jesus ...this is happening to me rn .i know how you’re feeling. it sucks to feel useless
3	Maybe you can try some mindfulness practices. Emotions can exaggerate things out of proportion and devastate someone so these practices should help you calm your nerves a bit. Since you say that you're stressed out, I'd say you need to catch a break too. 
2	You need sauna
2	It sounds to me that this is far less about your cognitive functions and more about the fact that you're surrounded by people that aren't good for you. I read through your comments and since removing these toxic people isn't an option right now I suggest coming up with a strategy to deal with the toxic behavior that is having a damaging effect on you. \n\n>I'm stressed out with work, none of my friends respect me enough to listen to what I have to say, none of them believes in what I can do (I'm starting to doubt myself now), and my ISFJ friend continuously fires morally degrading comments at me or sometimes ignores me when I talk to her. She's the only person in the class I can talk to well, and I don't have the energy to interact with new people anymore.\n\n1. For stress at work I recommend doing something to channel that stress and get it out of your system. I deal with this problem through exercise (healthy use of our third function, Se). Even just going outside somewhere where you can have some time to collect your thoughts and tap into your Ni can also be incredibly helpful for this. \n\n2. If your friends don't respect you enough to listen to what you have to say and don't believe in you? Then they are *not* your friends. End of story. Never waste your time on people who don't respect you, it'll save you a lot of grief in the long run. \n\n3. This ISFJ is a nasty piece of work. As another person here astutely pointed out, toxic ISFJs tend to gaslight people and I can tell this is what she's doing to you. Given that she likes to fire morally degrading comments at you, you have a few options but what I recommend is the good old fashioned silent treatment when she starts up with this nonsense. ISFJs can't stand being ignored when they get up on their moral high horse. If you stop giving her the reaction she feels entitled to? She'll cut it out eventually though she'll sulk about it for sure, and quite possibly embarrass herself by throwing a temper tantrum (if this happens, absolutely do not react and get away from her ASAP, preferably by suddenly becoming violently ill). Anything you say to her about it will be like throwing gasoline on a fire. Sometimes the best response is no response at all. Also, by taking this route you'll also be giving her a taste of her own medicine seeing as she also ignores you for no good reason. \n\n4. You're not stupid, useless, or inferior to everyone. That isn't how life works. Remember this: the only person you're ever truly competing against is yourself. 
0	Am I an ENTJ?	Hi everyone.\nMy test results are ENTJ, in some ENTJ with Loop.\nWe know that the tests are not completely reliable so I have studied the various functions, I have made my own idea and now I write here to get some confirmation.\nI am 23 years old, I did Scientific High School because as a child I wanted to be a doctor, but after seeing that the hospital is not my environment, probably lack of empathy, I opted for Business Studies.\nI have made this choice because I am interested in the "position of control and power", have more knowledge because I am mainly interested in starting my own business, or, if it goes wrong, being hired to play a senior role (if you have thought of the CEO congratulations you’re right). \nAlways aim to have a main role in a group, organize, say what to do and I can’t stand that others are too relaxed, slow or don’t take things seriously, but at the same time I also know how to be humorous to ingratiate them.\nI tend to be among the most organized and I want things to be done with principle.\nPrinciple that often turns out to be my point of view in fact I tend to do things “on my way”.\nYes, I‘ve been defined arrogant or as a "I do everything" or "what I say is law", and I don’t like others told me what to do.\nDespite this I like to discuss ideas and theories, but I always tend to the pragmatic side of the thing and hardly change my mind if I'm not totally convinced.\nA black or white situation.\nI am quite "future oriented ", but at the same time I’m interested in the present moment and act for what I want.\nI make decisions quickly, but if it’s very important, I prefer to have as much information as possible.\nI’ve been called selfish, unable to put myself in others shoes, I'm not good with my emotions or those of others, but I'm ready to help when you really need, even without being asked.\nWhat makes me doubt I really am an ENTJ?\nThe procrastination in the study: I ​​have always done and I continue to do it at the University.
6	What makes you think internet people will be more reliable than the test?
2	You claim to have problems with empathy, arrogance, and selfishness. I've been in this frame of mind before, myself. It's possible that you're an ENTJ that's on the underdeveloped side.\n\nA note on power.\n\nThe more power you have, the less control you have. That control is all happening on the ground.\n\nYou need good people skills, you need to know your business, and you need to know your competition. Developing empathy (or at least good sympathy) helps build these skills.\n\nAs you mature, slow your roll and develop some humility.
1	It does come off as a stronger Te and a lower Fi. \n\nHow did you cancel out ESTJs? \nHow do you perform under stress? \nWhat happens when you're under stress? \nWhy do you procrastinate? 
1	Take the test again in a few months. Continue to do this. 
0	ESTJ?
6	Trying to figure out my career path and I need some input from my fellow entjs!!	I am 24 years old and here are my past experiences:\n- market research analyst + business analyst for my university’s finance department\n- lead market research analyst for a marketing club\n- 2 research assistant positions\n- Volunteer work: (1) I have worked with children with autism as an assistant to an occupational therapist (2) I worked as a playground specialist: I promoted problem solving methods and played a few sports with kids K-6  \n- I have tutored kids K-6 \n\nI would say I enjoy being a market research analyst but I also really enjoy working with children. I would say one of the happiest moments of my life was when I volunteered to teach children with autism the basics (write, read, pronounce words, use scissors or anything that was difficult for them to grasp). The issue is that the pay isn’t that great and I know most people would say do what you love because it wouldn’t feel as if you’re working a day in your life... although I do need a higher salary to support myself financially. Here are my options: \n\n- Entry level market research analyst salary: $45-$50k \n(No extra schooling or certification needed) \n\n- Applied Behavioral Therapist: $12-16$ an hour.. \n(Need a certification) \n\n- Occupational Therapist: average salary - $75k\n(4-5 years of school) \n\n- Psychology Teacher for High School Students: $55k\n(Need a license to teach + certification) \n\nChoosing the market research analyst position is definitely the best option in terms of salary although I’m not sure if I’m extremely passionate about market research.\n\nTLDR: Not sure what career path to choose. The best pay with no schooling necessary: Market research analyst although I’m not sure if I’m passionate. I enjoy working with children although the pay isn’t that great unless I obtain a master’s degree which would require an extra 4-5 years of school..SOS \n
3	You're at the start of your career path. Do what you love for now and see how things pan out in a year or so.\n\n  \n\n\nSave. Put a little something aside now and make a habit of it. Live within your means. There will be time for you to advance your career and earn more money.
2	Make 3 lists.\n\nList a: A list of all the activities you enjoy\n\nList b: A list of things you are good at / current skillset\n\nList c: A list of jobs / business ideas resulting from combining each item in list a with list b.\n\nThen sort list c in descending order for highest expected income, or whatever other metric you choose (i.e. timeframe, suitable locale, realistically achievable etc.)\n\nSoon as youve done this it will become pretty clear to you which path(s) to follow. But be warned: try to focus on one or two outcomes only or you will overwhelm yourself and just wheelspin. Common entj issue.\n\nMake sure your list a and b are as exhaustive as possible and go wild, dont hold back or reproach yourself for any ideas, you might very well surprise yourself with the ideas that come out of that.
2	Why not combine your passion for research with helping children?  For instance, get a job at the National Institute of Health's (NIH) NICHD.  One of my friends from college interned there, and she basically ran studies on children playing.  The parents would drop their kids off for free childcare, and psychologists would study various aspects of how the kids interacted with one another.  Just one example of the many studies they ran.  After working there, she ended up getting her teaching credential and taught elementary school.   \n\nOne of the benefits of working for the gov't is great retirement and other long term benefits, like federal holidays and vacation/sick time/step raises, especially if you plan on having a family (or whatever floats your boat).
1	Medical doctor / child psychiatrist\nOr\nPhD psychologist\n
1	Keep doing what brings in income. I would then suggest that you pursue your interests (working with kids with special needs) in a way where you could do more. Example, starting a small organization of people that find joy in working with these kids. You could build up this into a fully functional nonprofit and feel accomplished as an ENTJ. \n\nThis is my hot take as an ENTJ with ambitions.
1	All sound like crappy options at least to me. I write code for a living and I don't need any of the stinking papers though my BS degree did help. Ugh, why can't you just teach? What a retarded system. Maybe work for a private school or teach kids of wealthy clients?\n\nAlternatively:\n\n1. Start a YT channel.\n2. Find a husband who brings real money as in > 100k\n3. Make love, make kids\n4. Do what you love\n\nAlternatively:\n\nGet a well paying (as in 100k+) job at a hedge fund. Make your own babies. Pour your heart into motherhood.\n
8	Jet's MBTI - Cast Podcast	Hey Reddit, my name is jetplane48 (ESTP 7w8 sx/sp) and I am starting up a podcast in relation to MBTI. Fundamentally, the goal of the podcast is to educate the viewers of several Typology systems through a series of one-on-one's with others who are interested in the same topics. I have been conducting interviews for many years (MBTI related) and this is just an extension of that, however, I want to discuss topics that the audience wants me to cover. Naturally, I'll come up with my own material but I would love to explore topics that others have in mind. I am busy with school for the next few months but when I finish, the goal is to eventually be more consistent with these podcast uploads if this turns out to be popular enough. I'm very excited to get this started, and let's see some questions!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAR20eDTSOg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAR20eDTSOg)\n\n&#x200B;

50	The Super ENTJ: Trick list	I was curious what other ENTJs learned through their growth and development.  Please share your insights.  I've listed a few of mine.\n\n1. Stay reserved.  People already are intimidated by you, when you argue with someone it will crush them.  Use silence and body language more often than words.\n2. Focus on one goal that matters most to you and let that be the basis of everything you do, never forget the main goal and see how everyone fits into that one goal.\n3. Read as much as possible to equip yourself with knowledge and strategy.  Especially The Art of War by Sun Tzu.\n4. When you interact with people, realize that everyone has a skill and admire that skill when you speak with them.\n5. Stay sober, you have way too much confidence and have no problems being sociable and you're too focused on goals to be distracted by drugs or alcohol.\n6. Hit the gym everyday.\n7. Meditate on the goal you want to achieve and envision it coming true.  Usually I do it throughout the day, but it's most effective when I dedicate time towards it.  There is always an answer to a question after these meditations but I can never seem to put into words the question or the answer, it's abstract.\n8. Spend time in nature to fulfill some emotional need that we lack from human interaction.  Again this one seems like a waste of time before getting there, but once you're there you understand there is some part of you that is missing, the Sensing or Feeling side and nature takes care of that pretty well.  Especially basking in sunlight.\n9. Sometimes doing nothing and/or walking away is the best move.  "If it is to your advantage, make a forward move; if not, stay where you are." - Sun Tzu from The Art of War.\n10. To-do lists are your bread and butter.  Check them off on the reg.\n11. Minimize, simplify, and consolidate as much as possible.  You have lofty goals and not enough time.  It's as simple as deleting phone numbers, downsizing your wardrobe, getting rid of unnecessary monthly subscriptions.\n12. Delegate often.  We are tempted to micromanage everything (because we're so god damn efficient) however your employees will hate you for it and this will cause disturbance in the harmony of the team, which will effect the bottom line and the quality of the product or service.\n13. Master learning the other MTBIs in order to recruit the right team players and communicate more effectively.  Also can be used to help others achieve their goals.\n14. Use your NT to hone in on indicators of emotions because you obviously cannot feel them as much as others.  But to get by and not come off as some cold blooded ruthless asshole, you can learn to react and set someone at ease by using logic.  Making people feel good helps you in the end and you gain more support to further your cause.\n15. Good work needs to be inspired, encouraged, and nurtured.  It doesn't hurt but actually helps saying "Thank you" or "Good Job" just a bit more often.\n16. The last and ultimate one is to accept that it is lonely at the top.  Realize that YOU are your own audience.  Your job is to lead and move your cause forward.  Relaxation is when things are going according to plan.
18	Listen to listen, do not wait to talk. Assume the other person knows something that you don't.\n\nGoing to reinforce the gym part too.
8	I’m a young ENTJ. This is like gold to me. Great post!
5	The number 4 is a very powerful social tool that many ENTJs seem to never have discovered.
6	Entj 3w2 here.\n\nControl your power and learn to control your te. Use charm instead of power.\n\nTalk about others rather then your own interests and topics. Ask them what they are interested in and talk about it.\n\nVolunteer build a base.\n\nLearn to take charge when delegated to you. Earn your way up. Ambition is good though. Ask for more opportunities.\n\n\nHoney is sweet so use it. I don’t mean that literally. Be nice to people. And you’ll get what you want. Be humble about yourself. If you are not you end up like r/iamverysmart not cool at all.\n\nBe able to do some self reflection, it is healthy, have time for yourself.\n\nLearn to mentally organize and keep a list of what you need to do.\n\nyeah.....
4	All of these are great. I may need help with letting others in however as I am a sp/sx 8w7/ENTJ.\n\nI distrust others, push them away, and I suppose it is the incompetence and the lack of payoff from allowing them to funnel my emotions until it spills everywhere (so to speak). \n\nBut that’s why I add this:\n\n16. Remember that 9 times out of 10, people want something and they will hurt you to get it. 
4	14. Figure out your Enneagram as soon as possible.
7	I agree with all the above 1000%, especially the gym part. Over the past 2 years, I have recently been more consistent with working out and it has only done wonders to my productivity. The benefits flow well past the physical/health aspect, into the emotional, social, and mental as well.\n\nFor ENTJs here that still have not made this a part of their lifestyle, all i can say is this: the sooner you break that barrier keeping you from working out consistently, the sooner you can reach that new, better, higher level of you.\n\nJust my $ 0.02 :)
2	Completely agree with this; Started doing number 6 about a year ago and I feel incredible, I have so much more energy and feel like I can conquer the world. \nI would add; Reflection - spend some time each day or week to reflect on the actions you took and their outcomes, understand what went wrong and how you can improve on them. \n\nBonus point ; - Routine - my old house master at school would always say “Get into your routine & stick to it”. Years after finishing high school and into my first job I still follow this principle and it does wonders with getting things done. Switch it up every now and then so you don’t get bored
7	What is your view on ESFPs?	Hey! \n\nSo i was wondering....I have this ESFP friend and the more I get to know her the less I like her.\nShe is really cold sometimes and hurts our ISFJ friend on a daily basis. \n\nBut at the same time she is hurt sooo easily.\n\nFor example: I was talking to a person and she apparently said something to me but I overheard her.\nAnd then she got really sad and said that I ,,ignored" her on purpose and stuff like that.\nI apologized over and over but she didnt seem to understand.\n\nAnyways, now to my questions:\n\nDo you have ESFP friends/family?\n\nIf so, what do/dont you like about them? \n\nHave you had similar experiences?
6	ESFPs like shiny, flashy stuff (and people). They are usually people-people (waaaaaay more extroverted than me) and will 100% use people for their own ends. They may not admit it, but they will always assess how their friends/lovers/etc make them appear to the outside world. They are not particularly honest and are good at recognizing what outcome would make them look best. They tend to have an incredible, soothing bedside manner when they decide to put their mind to it (I've known ESFP doctors). They are highly sensitive to criticism of any kind, but they eat up compliments also. Their mutual love of biology/animals makes them pretty interesting to talk to.\n\nI'm curious why this ESFP is freezing out your ISFJ friend - ESFPs are very social and aware people so I suspect it's intentional. On the other hand, ISFJs can be a little overly sensitive to not being trusted/part of the group... And finally, maybe they are playing tug-o-war over you: your time and your attention. Especially since they are complaining about each other to you.
4	My mom is an esfp...fucking sucks I know.
3	Depends if they are healthy or not. I tend to get along with them, but I usually hang out with them a few at a time. I think ESFPs are good if they are mature.
1	lowkey shitty people, but love them. bring out the best in me
