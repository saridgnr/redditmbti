28	How to Keep Your Posts from Getting Removed	You've posted something brilliant on the sub, and you can't wait for it to get comments. But after a few hours, your inbox is empty. You go back to the post and find that it's been REMOVED!!! Ye mods, WHY?!?\n\nHere's how to keep your posts from getting removed:\n\n* Make sure your point is clear. If you're asking a question or asking for advice, make sure your readers know what you're asking. \n* If it's a meme, you **always** have to explain why you're posting it. Even if it seems super obvious.\n* If you have to ask, "Does anyone else __?", they probably do. If you have to ask, "Is this an ENTP thing?", it's probably not. If you're asking for advice, just say what the problem is and ask how to solve it. If people can relate to your problem, then they'll comment. No need to ask if anyone relates.\n \nIn general, the best posts encourage discussion and challenge us to think critically.\n\n…And when in doubt, read the rules. They're on the sidebar.
28	Explain a meme? Ew. What a good way to kill the fun of a meme.
14	This is really heavy-handed and completely tone-deaf for ENTPs who rebel against frivolous rules.  \n\n\nThe description of the group reads, *"Home of the ENTPs, as described by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)."*  It doesn't say anything about a specific purpose like advice-seeking.  Let the people post what they want as long as it's related.  Just my two cents.  
8	Wow, entp sub is quite strict. 
7	There's no way an entp would institute that many rules. 
6	Who actually wants these rules? Absolutely nobody, that's who. 
4	Y u do dis
9	Good luck! I think it’s great to have reminders of rules so quality content can improve! 
4	God, I feel here like on r/istj 😅
2	Can you create a flair that says 'memes'
2	  **she-NTJ more like it!!!!!** 
2	Your rules can be summarized as Ti = good, Ne = bad. Excluding the output of our dominant function is both illogical and toxic. ENTPs need to play as well as think. 
34	10 life commandments for ENTPs	Of course, this is applicable to everyone, regardless of MBTI type.  I just think these commandments are so, so helpful for ENTPs.  Keep in mind, this is just my own interpretation of life based off experiences and analyzing patterns I've realized within myself.\n\n1. Just fucking do it.  Whether it’s the mundane administrative shit needed to achieve a goal or just lame everyday tasks, they’re all MUCH easier to begin and finish with MOMENTUM.  Stop procrastinating, just fucking do it.\n2. SUFFERING, DISCONTENT and DOUBT are needed for true change and improvement to ever occur.  Diamonds are only made under intense pressure and heat.\n3. Accept and let the little things go.  Whether this is by engaging in something interesting or just accepting life how it is, don’t hyper focus on irrelevant shit\n4. Make peace with people.  You’re not inherently right or better than anyone else.  Be happy to have people you can even talk to and share your thoughts with.\n5. Be grateful.  Think of all of the ways u have changed within the past year, month, etc and the new achievements and insights you’ve gained.  Be absurdly grateful for a house, friends, health, food and every other little thing we tend to easily forget about.\n6. NEVER NEVER NEVER consciously or subconsciously rely on substances as a source of happiness, motivation or as a final goal.  Even if you’re not psychologically or physically dependent, believing drugs are your optimal source of happiness will cause all other pursuits, hobbies, experiences and conversations to feel bland and dreary. \n7. Limit yourself to 2 cups of coffee a day!  Never let yourself get so addicted to that caffeine rush that you rely on drinking 6-7 cups a day like I once did.\n8. Try to activate introverted feeling.  Of course, we all automatically analyze ideas and arguments with brutally yet beautifully honest Ti.  Just consciously try to remain aware of your true values, and make sure your actions align with these values.  Be kind, stay true to yourself and from there let Ti take over.\n9. Be in the moment.  Chill out, have patience and try to tune out the whirlwind of Ne thoughts that our minds automatically revert to.  As best as you can, focus on the beauty and sensual appeal of the present moment.  This is why I absolutely need soccer in my life.  It lets me thoroughly live in the moment (and also activates Ti)\n10. “I’ll be satisfied when I finally get to…” No, this is an excuse.  Life is *now*. This ties in to being happy with the present moment.  Don’t just wait around for happiness to come to you.  DO something, READ something, TALK with someone to see if it brings you joy.  If it doesn’t, awesome! You tried something new and learned what *not* to do in the future.  Of course, if you love it (and it’s non-self destructive), keep doing it!

3	This is all excellent and relevant advice that probably doesn’t show up here very often. Thank you for posting it.
3	In response to number 10, I can't agree more. I did so much in 2018. I progressed so much and made so many great memories. Wanna know my favourite part of 2018 though? It was a nice summer day, and I was sat in my back garden (yard) by myself drinking a glass of orange juice. I was so present in the moment, no worries, just enjoying to sweet tangy juice and the hot sun beaming down on the back of my neck. honestly one of the best days of my life. I remember that day more profoundly than any drug experience I've had. 
3	This could be relevant to all types. Very sound advice. \n\nThank you. 
1	#4: I'm not inherently right or better than people, but there are some people who are just so wrong. I've learned not to tell them so, but damnit when they have to get in my face with their wrongness, I have to enlighten them to their utter universal wrongness, especially when they were arrogant to start.  \n\nI was willing to let it go, but _Justice_ had to be served.
36	Strength of MBTI (appreciation post)	So what I find funny is that appreciation posts in here are mostly written by non-ENTPs, so I decided to do this against the rule and as ENTP, add in here a couple words of appreciation.\n\n\nOne of the most amazing thing about MBTI is that you're truly able to find people who deal with similar problems to you - it's not about strengths, it's about weaknesses. Working on improving yourself in any way you can. Finding people who can offer some insight is really helpful.\n\n\n\n I've noticed that the same thing goes on the other subs. INFPs dealing with emotions and receiving support. INTPs sharing ideas of beating procrastination. ISTJs giving advices about adding novelty to your life.\n\n\n\nSame goes on ENTP sub. I love how people here aren't really judging each other. Seems like "you do you" it's generally applied in here, and I'm happy about it. It's not something that I see often, so cheers to that! \n
8	This is a good point. Mbti and really the cognitive theories have helped me tremendously in dealing with my mental health and personal weaknesses. It's a nice organized guide that makes sense to me. Almost like a shortcut of insights. \n\nI've also had better relationship and perspectives about other people through mbti. Otherwise I get real judgmental haha. 
5	Actually from my point of view, MBTI is supposed to help you know your possible weaknesses and deal with them not embracing it.  \n\n\nFor example my Si is super low - I have to be more organized.  \nMy other weakness is not caring so I don't do anything overcome my weaknesses :/.
1	Yeah, MBTI is realy cool thing. Especialy when you go deeper. I have one thing, which I found like ENTP. \n\nWhen you are trying to be more carefull and improve your descipline and planning skills, without loosing your natural creating of ideas you become ultra strong, because your type some kind transform into entj and in the result you're taking strong advantages from both types.\n\nWhat do you think about it?
1	MBTI is mainly about awareness. That's like the main point, where everyone benefit.\n\nAwareness primarily around both strengths and weaknesses. For yourself but for others as well. How good understanding you end up having and how you handle the information is a bit individual, but thanks to the awareness it can be significant easier to take necessary steps into strengthen the strengths and ultimately understand why this is you/another person and increase happiness, success and meaning. Even confidence, you do not need to act like your someone else and feel like you are a failure because you have your own qualities which others do not. It's about use them in a best possible way. Note, success is not necessarily about money and fame. Weaknesses can be reduced, but only to a certain degree.\n\nTo that, I would like to add that family, friends and life-partner can potentially help you with who you are, what you want to become and in general how you can gradually become a better version of yourself. As of myself and INTJ, we do a lot of things on our own, at least me, we are quite independent like that, but that's certainly not for everyone. Even as an intj, I do not stand all alone. Love and human-relations are a very natural beneficial things with the right people and mindset.
1	definitely check out the enneagram if you want to know more about your weaknesses hahaha
3	Besides being an ENTP, what are some other incredibly unique and special traits that you have that are clearly superior to literally everyone else?	BRAG! What are some other things that you think are unique about yourself?? SPIT IT OUT SPIT IT OUT! 
4	Being able to find bathrooms whenever I’m outside in a very efficient manner. I got to a point where I can deduce the most probable location of a bathroom in times of need. Saved my life a couple of times. 
3	I'm able to stack up alot of chips in a bowl. I learned this skill because back in the day me and my sister were both allowed only 1 bowl of chips on both days in the weekend. It was never specified how many chips. Well, children do what children do. Soon me and my sister were able to fill the bowl to twice its hight by strategically stacking up the chips so each chip would support the one on top. And this skill never really went away. So if there is ever an unlikely situation where I have to stack up chips in a bowl to survive... I got it covered.
2	I had one migraine in 8th grade and that’s pretty much all I’ve ever had related to headaches. I thought something was seriously wrong until someone explained to me what it was. I genuinely didn’t realize people had headaches/migraines so often and always thought that it was just something people would say they had out of stress. 
1	Insane people reading skills and knowing how to act upon them accordingly.\n\nAlso extreme boredom.
3	Any ENTP in the military here?	Has your time in the military made you a more proactive person by developing your Te or Si?
3	Me, I don't like it but if you become a lynchpin authority backs off. They can understand that without me there shit will hit the fan so let me  do my job instead of throwing your "power" around.  \n\nAlso if you are frank with your NCOs and tell them your reasoning they'll respect ya. Just pick your battles and get some grit if your left in a shit hole because there's no running. ;*
2	interested to see the responses bc i cant think of a type who would recoil more at subjugating themself to authority. 
2	I think the military did a lot to develop my Se, but not much of anything else. function wise.  \n\nDon't join the military expecting it to change you into an ESTJ, or ENTJ, or whatever else you aspire to be more like.  At least in my case, it did not build strong habits that lasted past my leaving the military.  In fact, I was counting the days until I could regain my freedom and control over my life. \n\nIt wasn't all bad.  I liked my actual job, and at least while deployed, my small team had a great deal of autonomy (helped having a fellow ENTP as a team-leader) and didn't have to adhere to such strict, regimented regimes all the time.  But the three years in training/garrison?  Those sucked.  How many suicide prevention classes could you sit through before you want to put a 9mm round through your cerebellum?  \n\nI remember being skeptical of everyone telling me "Oh, this is going to be great for you Vince, you're going to learn discipline, and routine, and blah blah blah."  There is a small element of brainwashing when it comes to the military and what is expected of you.  If you're a strong personality, I doubt the military is going to have you rolling your socks and T-shirts for the rest of your life.  \n\nSome guys do get out and keep those routines going, and they're fucking weirdos.  They always seem frozen in time, wondering why they ever got out, and wishing they could be back at the Diamondback DFAC eating sand sandwiches, falling asleep to the sound of poorly aimed mortar rounds.  \n\nIf you do join, understand that it's not a normal environment, and that you will not likely feel you are being treated like you're valuable, or in some cases. like a human at all.  The laws you have lived under until this point, those still exist, but now you have a new layer of rules and regulations that apply to you 24/7.  You have no personal freedom while you are in the military.  You are government property.  Government meat.  \n\nSome meat is well taken care of.  Do you fly billion dollar jets?  You're some USDA prime human meat!  Your military life is going to be drastically different from say, an 88M (truck driver) who is asked to roll over roads that haven't even been cleared by EOD yet.  \n\nSo if you do join, choose wisely.  If you're planning on being an officer, understand that 90% of enlisted folks hate you, and the other 10% are idiots.  100% of E-5 and above know more about leadership and their jobs than you do as a fresh butter-bar LT, and you should show them the appropriate amount of respect.  \n\nUltimately, I am glad I served, and actually happy (for the most part) that I came out much the same person I was when I got in.  My technical experience has been monumentally helpful.

3	Has the Interned changed politics or has it just showed us how they have always been?	Basically, the Internet takes something from real life and shows it as concentrated as possible. One example would be humour, you can visit websites with more humorous content than you can view in your entire life. Or for example forums, where you can discuss a single topic with many other people who are also there to discuss the same topic.\n\nSo, from that point of view, social media is where you can see society as concentrated as possible. Millions of people who are there to interact with each other. That means their views will also be concentrated in single points as innevitably they will form groups with individuals who hold similar values and ideas, so in the end you end up with huge echo chambers that radicalize themselves by staying in their own ideological bubbles.\n\nThe problem comes when politicians see those groups and join them trying to please them to get their votes. When the group inevitably starts radicalizing, the politician is already publicly associated to it and has to keep that association, because the only thing that looks worse for a politician than radicalism is hypocrisy, so they end up in a position where, even if they disagree with some sentiments of the group, they still have to completely support it.\n\nMy question for you is the following:\n\nDo you think politics has always worked this way and now we can just see it publicly or has the Internet actually created a new system where this is a necessary step in politics?
3	>That means their views will also be concentrated in single points as innevitably they will form groups with individuals who hold similar values and ideas, so in the end you end up with huge echo chambers that radicalize themselves by staying in their own ideological bubbles.\n\nThis has always been the case, even before the internet became a thing. There's not much of a difference between /r/liberalism and a group of college liberals (or Silicon Valley as a microcosm) banding together and intellectually jerking each other off.\n\nThis: \n\n>The problem comes when politicians see those groups and join them trying to please them to get their votes. When the group inevitably starts radicalizing, the politician is already publicly associated to it and has to keep that association, because the only thing that looks worse for a politician than radicalism is hypocrisy, so they end up in a position where, even if they disagree with some sentiments of the group, they still have to completely support it.\n\nhas also always been a problem. You don't need the internet for the following situation: \n\n1) Political group becomes popular because it's pushing for reforms that are in accordance with the zeitgeist.\n\n2) Politician A either agrees with the group or sees an opportunity to distinguish themselves from their competition and signal that they're in touch with the populace and current issues. \n\n3) Political group radicalizes. \n\n4) A is tainted by association. \n\nThe internet seems to accelerate the process. Momentum is faster gained online than offline. So the best move right now is to very cautious when it comes to anonymous online movements. \n\n------------- \n\nThe difference lies in accessibility and non-locality. The internet acts as a layer above the nation as a political entity -- a liberal from Texas can completely avoid political discussions in conservative Texas and just join DemocraticUnderground.com instead. So politics is no longer local in the geographical sense, it becomes local in a virtual sense. You can travel anywhere virtually (I can go from Reddit to BBC to Breitbart, etc.), but most people won't because they prefer to stay in their own bubble, or rather have information delivered to them (instead of doing the virtual odyssey from BBC to Breitbart). That's probably how ideological bubbles get created. Confirmation bias meets "you might also like" algorithms. \n\nI don't think the internet has changed political discourse completely, but it created a new arena, a new forum for political thought that influences the national discourse in traditional media and actively competes with it -- why wait for the 8 pm news when you can get notifications right here and now, as it happens? The downside is that the speed of political discourse has become so accelerated that the resolution of individual news articles decreases -- the focus lies on speed, not accuracy. \n\nSo we have new players joining the game -- Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, etc and politicians that jump ship. Howard Dean was a milestone candidate because he was one of the first to use the internet. Next is Obama, who also ran a partially virtual campaign. Then there was Trump, the Twitter president. I think the next milestone is some grassroots candidate who runs as a virtual candidate -- he or she avoids the physical public as much as possible, and only appears in the virtual. \n\nI think the internet definitely influences politics. Political writers and campaign specialists have to keep the formats of social media in mind -- how can I write something that sticks out in 140 characters? Can I meme a candidate? What about video chats? Fuck visiting Iowa, let's do hangouts across the nation! \n\nRight now we have the virtual and the non-virtual which are intertwined but also competing with each other, with the virtual influencing the non-virtual even though the main focus of the campaign are still non-virtual. We still have debates in person, we have politicians campaigning in states, yada yada. It will be changed completely when campaigns are 100% virtual. Instead of streaming a debate on YouTube, the debate takes place on YouTube. Every candidate joins in from their home, they don't meet in person. 
2	I think there has definitely been a shift in how politics (and other social discussions ) is practiced and I think it surely relates to the internet.  \n\nWhen I was a kid, there were four TV stations (with news 3 or 4 times a day) and the newspaper came once a day.   That was your only source of news.  That means everything that was reported happened with a delay.  And that delay allowed for the actual practice of journalism — people investigating stories and carefully writing up a report to minimize bias.  The political news was *boring* in that regard.\n\nToday the political news gets reported as it’s actually happening.  The news responds to posts on twitter within minutes.  There’s no time for a reasoned response.   Everything has become clickbait as the explosion of “news sources” all try to compete with each other for clicks.   They have a pressure and profit motive to attract your attention.\n\nInstead of 24 hour news channels filling up their time with a diversity of news, they focus on “political entertainment” — roundtable mobs of propagandists and polarizers.  \n\nThe quality of news is at an all time low, even as the availability of it is easier than ever. \n\nI think social media is to blame.  Places like Facebook allow people from all over the country, and indeed, all over the world to have a voice in American politics.   It gives every person a loudspeaker.   All you have to do is say something inflammatory enough to attract attention (and hence ad revenue) and you’ll virally get worldwide attention.\n\nIt allows for the formation of virtual groups which multiplies their influence.   For instance, maybe there’s one woman in your town who believes that vaccines are harmful.  In the past she would be an isolated freak, only talking to other believers perhaps via some mailed newsletter.   The lack of easy communication meant that such fringe viewpoints stayed in the fringe.   \n\nBut today, she can find a million other lunatics from all over the planet which support her view.  She can inoculate herself (😉) from reality by surrounding herself with a virtual church.  A bunch of fringe lunatics suddenly have the voice of a movement — and that voice can exercise political power by steering the public discourse.\n\nIn a way, they are short cutting the tiers of government our system is based on....towns report to counties which report to states which report to the fed.  They’ve made the entire nation (and the world) their soap box and hence draw attention out of proportion to their actual constituency.  And by inflicting their discourse on the nation as a whole, they engender political division.  \n\nSo the antivaxers, by leveraging support of the entire world, can effect the politics on their local level and get laws pushed through.  \n\nEven worse, because of the instantaneous and reactionary nature of Twitter, time and time again, it turns out these viral events are non-stories or completely misrepresented in the heat of the moment.  (Like the kid in the maga hat and the Indian). This is because of this instantaneous reaction to events by the public, instead of reporters actually finding out what really happened.  And once the “story” is reported, the damage is done.   Even if you retract or correct it, there are still perhaps millions of people who believe it.  And with some news shows being decidedly incendiary, they often present these things in a very biased, accusatory light.  \n\nIt’s ridiculous.\n\nInstead of giving a voice to our leaders and experts, we’ve downed them our with the shouts of idiots.\n\nIt’s amazing to me that the voices of bonafide idiots — anti-vaxxers, flat earthers, political conspiracy theorists (pizza gate), etc.  have a voice at all.\n\nThey only have this undeserved influence because of social media, and the hand wringing and pearl clutching of Facebook and Twitter has gone on for too long.   They’ve transcended their original conception as places to follow your favorite celebrity or share photos with your friends.  They’ve benefited enormously (financially) from what they’ve evolved into, and it’s about time they start taking their social responsibilities seriously, or be legislated, regulated and controlled as any public utility.  \n\n
1	https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/07/business/economy/07view.html\n\nGame-theoretically it doesn't matter the level of polarization, we can have a bimodal distribution of voter policy stances (on ℝ) and politicians will still default to trying to converge onto the median policy position (it (both parties choosing the median policy position) is the only Nash equilibrium).\n\nPolitical parties are still strategic players. The median voter theorem https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_voter_theorem is still valid even in the information era. If you doubt it, then look at the DNC. The Democrats have always produced candidates they think are "safe" and center and won't dissuade too many voters, an exact manifestation of the strategic consideration of the goal - winning the election, the most recent being the feud between Bernie and Clinton supporters...like a few weeks ago not 2016. So I would cast doubt on some of the assumptions behind your question.\n\nIt's fairly obvious to see why the median voter theorem intuitively works. It's not a complete model however. In particular the calculus can quickly shift due to information asymmetry, voter willingness to turnout, moral considerations etc. 
1	It’s definitely let people pre-select content and live in their little isolated bubbles of confirmation bias. It’s also allowed “fake news” to spread further than ever before. \n\nAt the same time it has opened the doors to so many other viewpoints and perspectives that are right at your finger tips.\n\nSo, the internet is benign. It’s just a tool which can be exploited for good or ill. It can exacerbate political division, or even create more harmony. It’s a reflection of society, but also impacts and changes society. It exists in a sort of dialectic with human behavior, the same as all mass media and communications has done for millennia.\n\nSo, I guess my answer to your question is: it’s both really.

3	Can I turn myself into an ENTJ ?	Look don't get me wrong, ENTP is fun. But let's not deny that ENTPs are comparatively lazy when it comes to making plans and sticking to them. Besides, I'm in the medical field and I'd like the opportunity to be a surgeon one day and I don't think as an ENTP I'm qualified to be a surgeon because I can't stand the idea of 8-12 hour surgeries, spending that much time doing a single activity would give me a boredom-induced heart attack.\nSo is there any way or certain exercises that can help me change myself into the more executive details-oriented ENTJ ?
7	That line of work is not something NTPs typically find appealing, but I'm sure there are plenty of ENTP surgeons in the world, just like there are ESFJ astrophysicist and ESFP philosophers. You don't have to change your personality to do something.\n\nBut to answer your question, it's akin to asking "how can I make myself love ice cream if I don't?" Sure, you can list the pros of eating ice cream and you can try to convince yourself that ice cream is great, but it probably won't help. ENTJs are Js because they get a kick out of getting something done instead figuring out new ways of doing something.\n\n
7	 To become an ENTJ. First of all you'd have to switch you auxilary function to become extroverted instead of introverted. And you would have to make it your dominant one. Then your dominant Ne should become Ni and become your secondary function. Your demon Si would have to become Se and become your third function. And your Fe would become Fi and become your new demon. So you'd go from Ne-Ti-Fe-Si to Te-Ni-Se-Fi. But all of that doesn't matter because you can't change the way your brain works.\n\nInstead what I think you actually want is to train your Si which is your organizer.
3	I think your personality type is fairly rooted and I don't think you can really change it.  You are who you are.  However, the beauty of MBTI is being cognizant of your strengths and weaknesses.  You have the opportunity to capitalize on your strengths and work around your weaknesses.  I'm fairly toward the middle regarding judging versus perceiving, but more often than not I fall on the perceiving side.  Becoming a parent, however, made me much more organized and proactive.  You simply have to be.  So it is possible to work on your weaker points for sure.  But you'll always be you.
3	Sorry but it will be hard. I'm also in the medical field, just finishing medical school right now and being ENTP it was pure hell and one I would not have survived if I hadn't picked up programming, webdev and statistics in my free time. \n\nI discovered I have no patience either for the mindless masturbation about details of medical specialities or for the long duration/details/lifestyle of surgical specialities.\n\nWhat I also discovered is that you can always find a speciality that fulfills your desires instead of changing your personality or following the crowd. I like solving problems, doing diagnosis and thinking about the bigger picture so I probably will go towards Public Health, Pathology or Radiology. I won't get rich for sure but at least I think I will find enough stuff to be creative about :)
3	As difficult as turning a gay man straight.\n\nFear not, you can become a surgeon regardless. Anyone can learn discipline and no one corresponds to the unhealthy description in most websites.

112	Why You Should Stop Overvaluing Your Intelligence	A lot of the younger ENTPs on here talk a lot about how smart they are or how they have a super high IQ.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd then correlating this to guaranteed success.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYet, the higher I go, the fewer ENTPs I see but plenty of INTJs, ESTJs, ESFJs, ENTJs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIQ has been shown in some studies to correlate with success but it's not the only requirement for success.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are guys out there with an IQ of 100, who are rich, have power, are ripped AF, have a big dick, and your girlfriend would secretly love to get fucked out by them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMost of society doesn't value IQ on the surface level.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMost people value what they can see vs what they can't.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can have a lot of success by dressing well, being physically dominating and working hard than by having an IQ of 150.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you want to be one of the few ENTPs that succeeds, start understanding what society values, and play the game accordingly. 
79	Doesn't matter what personality type you are if you're a weak little bitch 🙅 
79	Yeah exactly, who cares how you destroyed that whiny INFP in a debate with your LOGIC and REASON when you’re 35-year old fat neckbeard, living in your mother’s basement. Joking aside, there is some merit to OP’s post. IQ can take you only so far.
23	> start understanding what society values,\n\nSociety values usefulness. \n\nYou can be as smart as can be, but if you don't make yourself useful to others then you won't earn anything. \n\nBeing useful takes hard work, and being "ripped" is a great indicator of someone capable of the dedication needed to become wealthy.\n\nIQ is important, but only insofar as you use it to come up with useful things. 
20	The smartest person i’ve met had an iq of 160. He’s currently in prison for possesion of an illegal firearm and a large amount of weed. 
16	Does anyone actually believe that intelligence means guaranteed success? 
13	This is very true. IQ only gets you so far. IQ, if nothing else, demonstrates that you have the ability to recognize patterns, and do critical thinking at a higher rate of success than others. That is just theoretical however. Applied practice is what leads to success in life. I have a genius level IQ but found myself unmotivated and unhappy in past career choices. It was only when I applied myself at a job I love that I was able to reach levels of success that were effectively impossible before. I was a failure until I focused my energy on something I actually cared about doing. I have a feeling that most people with high IQs have similar dissatisfaction in life until they find that thing that can continuously motivate them. That dissatisfaction leads to failure. For ENTPs and/or people with high IQs, that dissatisfaction is effectively Intellectual depression. Depression has a destabilizing effect on any success you have. 
9	I'm not quite sure an MBTI board is the place for a tough love bro-speech about nutting up.\n\nI HONESTLY thought I was in a RedPill sub for a moment there.\n\nYou should head over to /r/ElephantDiscussions and be like "LISTEN BROS, elephants are overrated!!! Meanwhile your girl is fantasizing about a macho moustache dude with a third leg and a passions for CAMELS!!!!"
8	"A man is a success if he gets up in the morning and gets to bed at night, and in between he does what he wants to do." - Bob Dylan
14	Good job! Idk how these ENTPs didn't use their fucking Fe to know how the society works.
10	Why do you always\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStructure your sentences\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLike this
10	Fuck off with your success cultist bullshit, your basic point is right but for completely different reasons, you shouldn't be an asshole and you should learn to commit to things but telling people to be more superficial so they can "play the game" is reinforcing some of the most toxic attitudes our society has to offer. This is not how you lead a fulfilling life and I genuinely pity you if you think it is
3	hard work is key. efficient hard work is the most powerful thing you can learn
3	Am fat, average looking, but got 96th percentile on my medical board exams. IQ+ Hard work alone can get you quite far
3	Isn't it actually a well known fact that intelligence barely correlates with (financial) success? I mean it has been like that since School. The moderately smart but hard working students get way better grades than very intelligent but therefore sometimes disinterested kids 
5	Wow so much flame in comments. To be fair, most of us don't correlate high iq with success. Most of us know we are not good at follow through which hurts our success. We do claim being smart, but not necessarily high iq either. Honestly, success is pretty overrated. Ironically, those who find they have something to prove tend to value it more. And honestly most ENTPs know success isn't what determine how smart they are\n\nAnd to OP, ENTP sure as hell knows what are the game rules. It's jst most of us don't rly care. \n\nBesides, IQ is jst one small part of being smart.\n\nNot sure if u are trying to help, but the way OP types sounds way too aggressive and seems more like hate. U don't seem to know ENTP well either. 
8	EQ counts a lot more than IQ.\n\nHave a high EQ and IQ and you'll kick ass 
2	Or you don‘t even try to succeed in this shitty world
2	Though I did overvalue my intelligence as kid, I think got over that illusion when I started working. I would say I have, at times, been over-reliant on IQ and I've had to learn and re-learn the lesson that no degree of intelligence can make up for a lack of sustained, deliberate effort. \n\nNo one factor predicts success. Every competent person has a combination of strengths they leverage to be successful. Intelligence *is* a factor correlated with success but only up to a threshold level. Above that, greater intelligence, as measured by IQ, does not predict for greater success. \n\nThat said, I do place great value on intelligence as a factor of attraction. I am interested in highly intelligent people and definitely seek them out as friends and allies, whether they are ENTPs or not.
2	Only IQ gets you fuck all in the world. Routine, character, an open mind, and being interested gets you somewhere. Learn to listen to people. Even the dumbest one in the room has something to teach you.
2	ENTP here and we do know the rules. We can play the game accordingly but..... why? Lol. \n\nWe can be notoriously known to be a rule breaker ;)\n\nAnd if you are defining success as in physical/material possession or correlated with that ... I.e. Money, fame, sex, etc....  then you really don't know what ENTP values. Success is so relative to individual basis... you should be more specific in what success means to you.... oh wait, you already kind of stated it already :/   Sigh. Is money, fame, fucking hot chicks or dudes really that successful?  \n\nI mean.... rules are rules but do you have to abide by them if it goes against your belief/morals and ethos?\n\n For example: you are hiding a Jew... and if a SS squad knocks on your door and asks "have you seen any Jews? And are you hiding any Jews? It is considered according to the law as illegal if you are harboring any Jews"\n\nThen let's stop here and ponder: do I play according the the game of the societal law/rules? Or do I break those socially constructed rules/law? If I say yes I have seen Jews and they are hiding at my home.... I just sent assumingly innocent people to their death due to the law deeming them as law breaker and not playing by the game/ rule.... but how can they play accordingly to the game or the rule when they are not even included in those set rules? Then.....Do you break the law because fuck the rules and why should I kill innocent people. I would break the law if it means my beliefs/conviction seems reasonable sound/right.\n\nIf you see rich people..... umm some people don't even pay taxes and don't play accordingly to the games/rules. Why? Because they can get away with it. The reward sometime outweighs the consequences for them to do so. \n\nAnd do people actually believe that intelligence correlates to success? I'm skeptical because one should poccess intelligence AND among many other factors/variables in order to be "successful" in their own definition. \n\n
3	I enjoy the presumption that everyone subscribed to the same idea of success as you
2	Also, IQ is something that is not fully understood by a lot of people. IQ is supposed to get up as you get older. You may have a high IQ when you're 18, but if you are not cultivating that and increasing the knowledge you have, and then putting action behind that knowledge, then you are losing IQ each and every day.
1	Maybe I'm weird. I don't value my intelligence. I think that focusing on either usefulness alone or pure smarts is pretty shitty. I mean what is success without intelligence and intelligence without success? What we should be pursuing is a constant growth mindset and a WHY. Like why be smart if you're doing nothing. Why be useful if what you're doing isn't soemthing worth your love. Why why why. We should work hard to keep life interesting by allowing ourselves to be more than what we define ourselves and what society defines ourselves. Bc once we conform or settle, it gets so boring it's shitty. 
1	You can't stop me. 
1	Read “grit” by Angela Duckworth. You’re welcome
1	Could not agree more. My weakness is the sensing attritube, which is why I surround myself with sensors. They teach me how to keep up my grooming and appearance, my physical traits and this helps me climb the social ladder. I teach them how to think of the bigger picture and imagine various possibilities. Law of equivalent exchange. 
1	TL;DR: the OP wants us all to become ESTPs and EXTJs.\n\n&#x200B;
1	Somebody's triggered they don't have a high I.Q :/
1	Hmm, i conflict with 2 main things here, maybe I'm not an ENTP as my test came back. \n\nEverytime someone starts talking about their IQ and how smart they are I get chills of distaste and boredom simultaneously. As a rule I feel that no matter how smart someone is, they are still much better than me at something (it could be anything) and I could always learn from them in some way.\n\nI have also been told by many people that my drive to achieve and hyperfocus on goals is one of my best qualities both in my personal life and in the workplace.\n\n\nMaybe there is a skew on this forum due to keyboard warriors and just general teenage cringe and ENTPs aren't all logically debating neckbeards as it looks like from the observations on here.\n
1	Seriously. Nothing scares me like meeting brilliant mailmen
1	Great post, this can't be said enough.\n\nI like to think of IQ tests as a measure of Ti (a bit simplified, but Ti is very relevant to the sorts of questions you get on traditional IQ tests). Ne seems to help, what with all the patterns. That's why INTPs tend to score the highest on IQ tests, and us ENTPs only a bit behind.\n\nHowever, just because you view the world through or aided by Ti, doesn't mean you will be successful. However, it's a great asset (a bit biased of course, but)— just apply that Ti to finding out what truly correlates to success, and pursuing it.\n\nI think it can greatly help to invite a little ENTJ alter ego in for some tea. Just let him chat with you and get directions from someone with a very different mindset to ours. In fact, you can do this with any type— the more you start accommodating, accepting, and *understanding* these different mindsets, the more you grow.\n\nTo be more direct, when you're just starting out on your continuous path of self improvement (this applies to the aforementioned Ti, Ne types), start prioritizing ***action*** and ***results***. Start placing ***real*** things higher than things in that ether-worldly limbo that is your imagination. As soon as you start doing that, I guarantee you'll start seeing success, failure, ***something***. And that's much better than nothing.\n\nKeep grinding, folks. We've got this. 
1	Intelligent post!
1	“What society values”.\nNo\n“What your surroundings value”.\n\nMost of us are not celebrities, most of us are not going from social environment to social environment.\n\nWe go to work, we have a family, maybe we have a hobby.\nSociety is our immediate surrounding.\n\nIf I go walk around in a suit at my work, people will not appreciate the effort.\nI work with smart guys who wear t-shirts and hoodies to work.\nAdapt to your social circle.
1	Eh, which industry are you talking about? Most of the higher-ups I’ve seen or met (leading a group of 20-400 people, depending on the person) are pretty average-looking, not unlike the rest of the population. I think ‘success’ requires a combination of intelligence, ambition, conscientiousness, good connections and other forms of luck. Successful people have it in different proportions, and just because you see a successful person without intelligence, doesn’t mean that it isn’t an important ingredient in general.\n\nI think that there is a recognition that the body (and mind) needs to be healthy, so that it would not cause ‘downtime’ from work. So yeah, maybe they look more physically fit than the average person in their age group. \n\n>There are guys out there with an IQ of 100, who are rich, have power, are ripped AF, have a big dick, and your girlfriend would secretly love to get fucked out by them.\n\nIdk what my girlfriend thinks… But anyway, how did you know their dick size? ;) (Is it your industry, or…? Proof is required.) \n\nAs an aside, I agree that from an individual perspective, hard work is more important than intelligence. The latent capability is more or less fixed, so there’s no point crowing or lamenting its presence/absence; the thing that can be changed is how much hard work one is willing to put in...  
1	I've been unsubbed from this sub for a while and just thought to peek at it but it seems it just got even worse than before. I agree with the spirit of what you are saying though empirical data shows that IQ still remains a significant, and often better predictor of achievement than other factors like household income during childhood: https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/36853322\n\nENTP's second greatest asset isn't Fe or Si. It's Ti. To be quite harsh ENTP's tendency to knowingly vomit useless ideas and egotistically derive intellectual superiority out of it despite being a nobody is not only nauseating but also a travesty. Ti is there for a reason. People need to learn how to use it instead of setting themselves on the path of the substance-addled random idea generator. ENTP at its worst, to me, isn't that of an uncaring narcissist but someone destined for greatness ultimately ending up at a mediocre spot when half their life is over. It's not very surprising to me that ENTP actually earns disproportionately low income for a so-called "intelligent" personality type. The tendency for ENTPs to not care about it is whatever and I already know the various counterarguments (I am an ENTP too after all, I know how to debate myself). But I still think we are a net loss to society. Endowed with high "intelligence" but providing low ROI, if a machine were to optimize society it might start by pruning ENTPs.\n\nI love being an ENTP. I'm perpetually energetic, talkative, pretty sociable, and I can come up with tons of fun ideas. But it has to be supported with rigor (Ti) and dedication and organization (Si). If ENTPs can't get over the fact that they can't unleash their potential if they don't realize that their undeveloped modus operandi is useless to society then they'll never really succeed - sometimes they probably don't even care. But I know a lot of ENTPs desire a specific type of validation though. The way to get intellectual validation from your exterior is to prove it, with records and titles. Plants are unlikely to say your ideas have merit, and a boss won't listen to your brilliant ideas if you're below average in productivity. Young ENTPs can debate this all they want but I've moved past this phase and I don't want to end up looking back and thinking I've accomplished nothing. A lot of the posters on this sub conflate *laziness* with the best personality in MBTI. After all it takes mental work to use your other functions. It's so easy for ENTPs to just daydream ideas all day.\n\nJust an addendum though: your criteria for worldly success is very narrow which is why I only said I agreed with the spirit of what you're saying. If you look at the most influential people in history, a lot of them are average-looking scholars. But it really doesn't matter because the ENTP is ill-equipped for any type of success on its natural trajectory, unless they take the pains of developing other functions.\n\nAlso to some of the ENTPs here:\n\nNo, you're not intelligent, you're just good at convincing yourself and some others that you're intelligent because you like "intelligent" things. Get a grip and work harder. Intelligence is earned.
1	IQ can help you get through exams etc much easier than other people. It probably comes with its own sets of problems too. I think over the years I’ve tried not to overvalue its usefulness too much and just take for granted that it helps me in many ways - personally and professionally.
0	Society can suck a fatty. I didn't come here to lick boots, maybe you did though. You do you.\n\nAlso PSA, once this shitposting gets to -5 votes it disappears
1	a low iq made this post
-1	Not only that but IQ has an inverse relationship with creativity above 120. You really don’t want to have a high IQ if you want to be successful. 
0	Success is a relative term which is up to the discretion of the individual. What you personally find as a signal of success does not translate to the next person.\n\nPersons who brag about higher formal education typically come across to be as being practically stupid and lacking in other areas. Sure you have a masters or doctorate, but at what cost? How much of your life did you waste to get it? How many opportunities at other ventures which would have lead to greater overall happiness were turned down? Not saying across the board this is true because there are certainly balanced people. But I always correlate the disproportionately book smart sense of success with a determent in multiple other areas. 
0	Here is where you are wrong. Most great inventions, ideas, and solutions come from the influence of ENTP'S. Even if not directly, always indirectly. We stir the pot and bring many things to the surface inspiring others. You are right IQ does not equate to success, but ENTP's are the visionaries. Every type needs an ENTP as their advisor. We run this show anyways. Who the hell wants to actually do the work. 
4	Debate: Is the FBI wire tapping a NCAA basketball coach a serious overreach of the Patriot Act?	
3	I had to read that boring article just to find that it's a specific instance of a "basketball scandal" that the FBI was investigating. Still wasn't sure what the Patriot act had to do with this. So I had to dig up an actual [informative source](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017–18_NCAA_Division_I_men%27s_basketball_corruption_scandal)\n\nAnd.. i still don't know what this has to do with the Patriot Act. Then it hit me. OP doesn't know what he's talking about — this has nothing to do with the Patriot Act. This isn't about terrorism, and as far as I can read, the Patriot Act isn't cited in any of these cases. These cases seem to be about systemic fraud, money laundering, bribery, etc. \n\nSo how do you think this is about the Patriot Act? Is it because the FBI is on the case? While the FBI does handle terrorism, its core domain is investigation into federal crimes. You know... like the ones these basketball coaches are accused (and many convicted) of.\n\nThis is well within the FBIs jurisdiction. As far as I can tell, the expanded scope of the investigation is a consequence of a discovery that this problem is systemic. Wire tapping is a standard approach here, I don't see what's wrong. 
6	Recently I found out that I may have actually been an ENFP this whole time	Sometimes I can’t tell if I’m just overthinking things and my impulsive ass is going along with whatever bs my mind comes up with but this time I think I might actually be right for once. Could I get some advice on how to tell whether or not you’re a really thinkery ENFP or a really feelery ENTP? Like what are some signs that I’m using fi-te or to-fe?
8	funny, this is something I've thought about for few weeks now, too.\n\nam I secretly an ENFP? Maybe even an INFJ? an ENTJ that because of his parents were INFP and ENFJ  behaves like an ENTP?\n\nIdk so for now I'll just continue to call myself ENTP =)
5	I think if you think you might be an F you are an F. \n\nI tried to find this out the hard way with an obvious ENFP and it didn't go over well, so (as to not offend anyone) we'll just say if you think, you probably are. 
2	>Could I get some advice on how to tell whether or not you’re a really thinkery ENFP or a really feelery ENTP? \n\nHow about we play and we find out?\n\n&#x200B;
2	ENFPs are filled with self doubt and passive aggressiveness in my experience. They are prone to mood swings and I also get confused as to whether they are introverted or extroverted sometimes. Most importantly they get upset/think about injustice in the world.
1	Took the cognitive functions test about 11 times total. This is the result:\n\n3 ENFP\n\n3 ENTP\n\n4 Unclear\n\n1 INTP\n\nIt seems like my Ti and Fi are both equally prominent for some odd reason.\n\n
1	You are probably an ENTP in a Ne-Fe loop.\n\nEasy way to differentiate Fi to Fe. Do you focus on making yourself feel good, eg doing what you believe is good and right, following moral principles, looking for people who make you feel good?\n\nOr do you focus on making others feel good, eg being funny and comedic, being agreeable and trying not to offend anyone, giving others compliments etc
1	Congratulations

4	Regardless of your type - you've invested *way* too much into this. Therefore, I assume xNFP
3	ENFPs are filled with self doubt and passive aggressiveness in my experience. They are prone to mood swings and I also get confused as to whether they are introverted or extroverted sometimes. Most importantly they get upset/think about injustice in the world.\n\nYour test scores suggest ENTP
2	Ok the difference between ENFPs and ENTPs can usually be narrowed down to the differences between having Ti/Fe and Fi/Te as your deciders. The big differences we would focus on here is the differences between Ti and Te and then Fi and Fe.\n\nTe vs. Ti: It's not logic, that's a bullocks theory that makes lead Ti types feel superior to everyone else. It's reasons. Introverted thinking would mean that you have your own reasons for things regardless of everyone else. You know what works for you. Te would be a desire for all of the tools that people use throughout the tribe so that your can find which ones you value (Fi). Te would also focus on *validation* for your values from the tribe. It also comes down to a difference in HOW you think. If you picture your mind like a map with nodes and connecting edges, Te is a very broad way of thinking, bouncing from idea to idea that Ne notices a pattern between, and can make us seem like we're rambling about unrelated things (if the person listening doesn't see the connections we do). It'd be like from jumping between cities that are not connected by roads on the mind map. Ti is more of a deep thinking that retreats inwards and pulls something back up to stay on track. This would be like going to a neighboring city on our map, adding that to the conversation, and then moving from there. Next time you're in conversation, be mindful about the connections that your mind tries to make.\n\nFi vs. Fe: Fi is deciding things based on your own personal values that are not separate but uninfluenced by the tribe. Why does it matter what the tribe values when you have your own values to stick to? <-- that's what Fi is. It's also a direction of emotion inwards, where alone time is spend ranking your own values and how you feel about things. Fe, which is third for most ENTPs, is a focus on *acceptance* from the tribe. A lot of time will probably be spent analyzing what things people value/how other people might feel towards you instead of how you feel about other things.\n\nExample: You are asked why you like or have the lawn-mower that you do.\n\nFi/Te - It was my grandma's and it gets the job done, get off me.\n\nTi/Fe - The brand is universally recognized to produce good lawn-mowers, it has good gas efficiency, it's easy to use, it has different height options, etc.\n\nNow an ENFP or an ENTP could give either one of these responses and are oversimplifications of the functions, but it's hard to convey without generalization. Basically ENFPs communicate their own values as reasons whereas ENTPs have their own reasons for things and usually know where those reasons fall on the spectrum of societal values.\n\nWatch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up0mk3YTQus) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MY1sBJYdc6M) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GX-2EZnUCII) if you're still unsure. Typing yourself can be work but it's well worth the understanding it brings.
1	For lazy people: Long story short - I don't know if I am ENTP or ENFP, bcs I dunno my cognitive functions and my tests show both :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks again! Just be nice to me and tell me if I wrote something wrong or understood something wrong (: Have a nice day! 
12	Afraid I won't do anything worthwhile with my life	So the thing is, I need to pick college major and university this year. Even if I will, I may not get in. I have no plan for life, I don't know what I want to do, but at the same time I'm scared as hell of being mediocre. Any advice? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are moments when I don't give a shit about it and want to just stay at home, alone, with no people bothering me with everyday stuff. And then I start to panic,because nothing is under control and I'm truly lost among all those things. 
6	Recognizing that you're scared is a huge accomplishment. It doesn't' feel like it, but it shows maturity. Bravo.\n\nYour next choice doesn't define your life. I went to school for video and my main source of income is through book sales. My buddy went to school for animation but he ended up becoming a voice actor instead. Our school / major didn't define our lives. It doesn't have to for you either.\n\nPick something that feels the most interesting / fun for you. You're not magically LOCKED IN to what you do.
6	Currently having somewhat similar issues.\nMy advice is to go get a bunch of books and start reading. You will make zero progress doing what your doing right now! Take it from someone who has wasted 2 YEARS thinking about stuff like this! \n\nIf your going to do college, pick something that will give you financial freedom and something that interests you.\n\nYou have to take the first step towards action. Action is key m8! 
3	1) Take a breath\n\n2) as I told my 3 kids way before they were in college.\nWhen in doubt, Minor in your passion but major in business... Make it up later in a Masters program if you need to...\nThis is also based on my own experiences as a professional photographer and later high tech sales in Metrology.\nMy passion will be consistent, but will I know how to capitalize on it when the time comes?\n\nAt your age, The fact that you are even concerned is an awesome testament to your intent & desire. You'll be fine 😉
2	It really depends on your definition of worthwhile. For some that means starting a family and living a happy life. That's something most of us can accomplish. If you want to change the world, then don't worry. Try your best to change the world and if you fail you are in good company. 99% of humans who have ever existed did nothing worthwhile in their lives. 
2	I'm about to graduate, and let me tell you, I had the same EXACT fear when I started out. Now I'm on my 4th year, and I'm going for my Master's in CompSci right after this. \n\nYour first year should be more about the experience IMO. Make friends, try everything. Focus on your schoolwork, but don't make that your sole priority. \n\nAs for a major, you are definitely not alone in that fear. Tons of people get into school not knowing what to do. The solution for this (from a friend of mine that went through this) is to major in something like business, minor in whatever you like to do (your passion). Take a majority of GenEd classes first, so then when you finally discover what it is that you want to do, you'll be able to focus more on those courses. \n\nBasically, just understand that you are not alone in any sense. Do not compare yourself to other people (it can be hard to do this, I know) and don't worry so much. \n\nAnd if you don't get in? Then get a job, earn money, and focus on something that interests you. A different friend of mine wanted to be an anesthesiologist (the one who puts you to sleep in surgeries) since high school. He got into college, hated it, and dropped out. He took 2 years off working at a restaurant to make money, but he didn't give up. The whole time he lived at home and searched for a passion. Now he lives in an apartment, has money, works a better job, and is going to school in biology. You are young. You don't have to have everything figured out now.\n\nSince I was young I wanted to make video games, and in college I never thought I would make it. Now I'm graduating and I have opportunities waiting for me when I get out. You will find something. And if you start something and then decide you don't like it, you can change it. Don't worry about being the odd one out, don't worry about being mediocre. Everyone, and I mean almost literally everyone, has/had these same fears. The fact that your applying for college means you already made it this far in life. You can and and will keep going. \n\nTrust me. I literally asked this same question years ago on this sub, scared I wasn't going to get it all figured out. You will be fine, I believe in you :)
1	I'm in the exact same situation. I swear the feeling is so shitty. I tried thinking about what makes me so afraid/'down' of going to university.(because that's definitely the cause) I think it's not that I'm afraid I won't do anything worthwhile, because I'm sure I will. It's that I can't imagine myself doing just about anything really. Which is especially weird, because I believe I can do anything if I'd really want too. It's that unknown space in my vivid imagination what scares me most.\n\nIt's such a weird feeling as it is very illogical. If I try to describe it, I get stuck halfway trough the thinking process. \n\nThe only advice I can give is to accept that the feeling is there and nothing will suddenly make it dissappear forever. It won't kill you.\n\nAnd above all: it doesn't matter that you don't know what you are going to become. No one really does. \n\nAnd for what to study: I myself like keeping my options open while in the process creating more. I'm planning on studying economics/business. Although I believe I could end up somewhere completely different.\n\n
1	Pick something that interests you. Don't worry about picking a major as a freshman. You can take most of your gen eds in the first 2 years. Throw in an elective or two every semester and see what you like.\n\nI wasn't sure what I wanted to study, but took an econ class my first semester and loved it. Decided to major in that and have done well.
1	> I don't know what I want to do, but at the same time I'm scared as hell of being mediocre.\n\nWhat's your definition of "mediocre?" What would that look like? Describe a day in the life of LawlessMind in the "mediocre" future timeline.
1	I had this same fear from the ages 19-26. I bounced around, going to a couple schools before getting my degree (and changing my major several times). I also had different jobs ranging from self employed photographer to being a compliance analyst in the investment industry. Each move I made, I learned something new and then I would get bored and look for something new / higher paid / more interesting. My current job is now very in line with my ENTP personality - and my superior (who has the same job responsibilities) is a ENFP. Which is amazing.\n\nMy point is that I believe this is something that ENTPs struggle with. There is a constant need for improvement and eventually I think it will lead you to the right place. \n\nYou just need to pick a path and go for it and then adjust on the fly. Doing nothing just creates anxiety. 
5	Are There Any ENTPs Who Stuck with the Jobs They First Went to College For? Are Those of You Who Have Happy?	My mom said I was being stupid for thinking that I was going to fail at life, and she told me to ask you guys, so here I am.
11	Did your mom really tell you to ask on the ENTP subreddit about your life decisions? Seems like an interesting household
2	Wait, what's the relationship between the title of your post and the body text?\n\nWhy do you think you're going to fail at life?
2	Your mom sounds cool. What's her phone number?
1	> My mom said I was being stupid for thinking that I was going to fail at life \n\nBecause you think you will if you don't change whatever it is you're doing that you think is incorrect. So, right the wrong.\n\n&#x200B;
1	I have part of an arts degree, then I dropped out for a few years, went back to Nursing in midwifery, switched after a year into mental health nursing, I have a masters now. I work for public health in addictions and mental health, most of my work is in homeless outreach.... It was a long road here, I did contract nursing for many years, I worked with MSF, in every hospital setting that exists and in palliation.\n\nI don't breath nursing in comparison to most of my colleagues at this level. I do other things on the side to keep me busy (I have flipped 3 houses). However I don't hate nursing either, nursing gives me the opportunity to work in so many places and fields, and follow so much different research around. Being at this level is nice because I can start a lot of my own projects and do grass roots work... (but honestly if I knew I was going to end up here I would have became a Doctor instead). 
9	Or maybe on the border with Mexico just make a laser wall?	just like that https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzbwsN4viU4 ???
8	I think they should pay mimes to permanently act like there's an invisible wall. Think about the jobs it would create.  
3	Or quit the war on drugs, abolish the for profit prison system and get rid of employers ability to hire based on criminal record if the record is based on a minor offense (especially if committed as a youth. \n\nThat way people can get... you know legit jobs and be contributing members of society instead petty crime, selling drugs,  or doing drugs to numb themselves from the pain of being segregated from society. \n\n\nOr... stop all incoming humans from all ports of entry, have all interstate highways blockaded with infantry, and anyone caught without American citizenship documentation gets stuck in a train and shipped to a "work camp". \n\n\nEither way, I'm not American and see the whole wall affair as patently ridiculous. 5 billion dollars could go to much more effective programs. Whichever way you guys go, best of luck.
1	[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gfGhVL3qs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gfGhVL3qs) it needs to function like this.
1	All we need is these for low prices so i can build such walls around my house and never have to see people again
4	Too much empathy?	Hi, just wanted to throw out that I don’t really believe low empathy to always be the case with ENTPs. I have waaay too much empathy and have had many emotional reactions based off of how people in my life are feeling at that time and it often negatively affects me. I have a lot of empathy for people that suffer needlessly around the world as well. Is this uncommon or am I just misunderstanding the meaning behind low empathy?
6	IMO...No you're not...the masses tend to get Empathy confused with Sympathy.\n\nThe former I have all day long and depending on the person I will help however I can...The Latter... Comes rarely but does come via empathy.
6	I don’t understand how any ExTP could have “low empathy”. Like low...er? I guess. But I have a ton of empathy and the needs of people are constantly on my mind. Sympathy though? Yea...I don’t really have much of that.
5	Empathy seems to be consistent with a really active imagination. Big thing is, is that empathy appropriate, and can you detach and compartmentalize in a healthy way.\nIf not, maybe question where you learned it. Childhood trauma perhaps?
2	Tbh, I think the reason that ENTPs can get a bad rep is because we have sufficient empathy- and for that reason we're brutally honest. We want people to make good decisions. I rather solve my problems than sulk in negative emotions. So for a while, I treated others the way I'd like them to treat me. I personally don't see much point in telling someone what they want to hear when I actually care about their well-being and the outcome of the decisions they make. With age, I learned that not everyone wants the truth, but its harder for me to empathize with those particular people because I end up beating myself up over not being able to help them resolve whatever they're dealing with. Sympathy- tougher for me to achieve, but not totally unrealistic. 
3	Username checks out. :p\n\nBut, like... maybe don’t start your post with “fags”? It doesn’t sound nearly as cool as you think it does. \n\nAlso, yes. ENTPs are not short of empathy. T does not mean emotionless. Just that it’s not a primary driver if our decision making process. 
1	i mean, Fe is the entp’s tertiary function. it’s very much there, just not a well-developed function. \n\nin my experience, an under-developed entp will do one of two things: over-rely on Ne-Ti (these are your stereotypical teenage entp shitposting edge lords) and let Fe manifest itself in uncontrollable outburts. or they will go into an Ne-Fe loop, bypassing and ignoring Ti. and this is when you’ll see entps with over-the-top people pleasing behaviors. they can’t say no, they don’t set boundaries, “everyone must be rescued” type behavior. 
1	>Hi fags\n\nI am a homosexual, this is true.\n\n>just wanted to throw out that I don’t really believe low empathy to always be the case with ENTPs.\n\nOkay.\n\n>I have waaay too much empathy and have had many emotional reactions based off of how people in my life are feeling at that time and it often negatively affects me.\n\nSo, you're a feeler then.\n\n>I have a lot of empathy for people that suffer needlessly around the world as well.\n\nI don't, and when I think about it, I think it's stupid to fixate on things like that.\n\n>Is this uncommon\n\nYes. The person makes the type and you are not exhibiting behavior similar to other ENTPs that I've met or myself.\n\n>or am I just misunderstanding the meaning behind low empathy?\n\nI never actually knew I had low empathy until professionals told me that I did, I actually refused the idea at first.\n\n&#x200B;
2	ESFJ has been taking advantage of my INTJ friend	edit:  I'm sorry I didn't phrase my question clearly enough. I'm not interested in resolving the situation or helping people overcome their own insecurities... I'm looking for ideas on how to casually exploit ESFJ insecurities for lols, now that I know she's a bad person. I am only loosely associated with the ESFJ posse.\n\nI know she's insecure about her grades and intelligence, but that's low hanging fruit. \n\nHow would you go deeper, entp?
3	***More importantly than my answer, what does that say about your character that you are going to unnecessarily belittle someone else for your own temporary pleasure. Quite honesty from one ENTP to another, this is an abysmal use of your natural abilities and you should think twice before the unnecessary, unprovoked social assault on someone else regardless of what the circumstances are. End of the day your image will take the greater hit than she will....*** Anyway now that my advisory message is over here's the other answer....\n\nESFJ seek social validation and will find it anywhere they can. If not with your INTJ friend, it will be with someone else.\n\nTactically speaking ESFJ are downright sloppy when it comes to anything less than exactly what they planned. If they don't get what they want or expect they become toxic. Furthermore they are probably the most affected by social rejection because they receive affirmation from friends, family, acquaintances, etc.
2	It's the INTJ's job to deal with this, not yours. Besides, if the ESFJ is as dumb as you say, she won't even realize why you're messing with her.\n\nBullies gonna bully. Your INTJ friend has to learn to stand up for herself. You can't learn it for her. If you've already talked to her about it, I think that's all you can do.\n\nIf you *did* stick your nose in, the INTJ would probably be mortified. She would probably resent you. It might hurt your friendship. It won't change the INTJ's behavior, and it'll probably just make the ESFJ mad at you. It definitely won't make her ashamed. People like that have no shame.\n\nSo basically, sticking your nose in would only make yourself feel better, and I don't think that's super ethical.\n\nedit: removed bad advice
1	Just tell the abuser that you talked to the administration and they are watching her now. \n\nBest case scenario, she tells the administration herself that she's cheating.
1	You don't sound like rational type at all lol, you'll be on the same level as her if you do bad things to her (:
1	Dont do that , its not worth yourtime \[if you not realize it yet\] .\n\nAlso why you say she is a bad person ? which of the observations defined her ?
179	ENTP thought process	
35	>you do you\n\nYeeeeep
30	I like that all the possibilities end in I'm still right. 😂 
14	This is spot-on.\n\nA fellow angry thinker has already commented his angry thinking on your post, and I disagree with him. This is how my brain has thought since the major changes and tragedies in my life that led to me losing my F and becoming an ENTP. ENFP's are not nearly this pompous about their thoughts.\n\nThis is definitely us. Great post. \n\n(made my own comment because i don't feel like arguing with the other guy. he seems abrasive. )
6	Nahhhh. No one is entitled to a wrong opinion. I will flat out tell people they are wrong if I need to. (Badass baby /s)
4	I just came here to have a good time and I'm honestly feeling so attacked right now\n\n*but really, this is too damn accurate*
3	This is genius 
6	Weird. INTJ is the same thing but flows in the opposite direction- towards the middle. It's why we're no fun at parties.
2	associatus type of an entp professor!!
2	None of this really matters anyway 😉
2	This is intp except delete everything related to proving or convincing others 🤣
2	And how do you actually take a decision and live with it? \nI experienced that even after the decision the thoughts-process continues. So there is no end to it I think...
2	I feel called out and feel simultaneosly affirmed and attacked.
2	You should have gotten bored and never finished the decision tree.
2	Yeah...no.\n\nSeriously what part of NT don't you guys get?\n\n'no one understands me'. \n'I need to reevaluate myself'. \n'what someone else might think'. \n'you are entitled to your own opinion'. \n\n ...and so forth\n\nYou know what you've diagrammed?  The shitstorm that goes on inside an FP (or ADHD) head.   And you know what comes out of such a thinking process?   Word salad + all the stuff you put around the edges which are just variants of the Fi-perspective of "each our own truth".\n\n\n\n
1	yep\n\n&#x200B;
1	Last bubble I read was "hold my beer" Solid win including that!
1	I never had a good way of explaining my thought process until I came across the term trans-contextual thinking. It nails it and I guess has been proven through neuro-imaging. \n\nLove the diagram though. Damn those known - unknown variables. Especially variable 2... Fuck variable 2. 
1	I’m can’t focus on reading this bc too my intricacies 
1	I especially like that u included known unknowns and unknown unknowns. I spend a lot of time there. 
1	Considering the parallel thoughts...
1	Inside, sure somewhat like me. Outside comments? Bullshit. I’m calling you out of you’re wrong.\n\n\nHowever the words.. “I don’t care, I don’t give a fuck, and whatever doesn’t mean you’re not a dumbass” are used more often in my case. 
5	What is the gift anyone has ever gotten you?	ENTPs seem like they’d be a little difficult to shop for...or at least to shop for for something that they won’t lose interest in. So, what has been the best gift someone gave you?
15	A friend recently gave me a key tracker to hook to my key ring. I use it...*constantly*. Even if I know the general location of my key it’s still nice to just pull out my phone and make the siren go off so I don’t have to look. This device has saved me numerous times, ha.
2	The love of a good man!
1	Pizza.
1	An experience. My family used to always go somewhere for my birthday as a holiday, no gifts, no birthday party, just going somewhere and enjoying the world. 
1	For Christmas a family member gifted me "23 and Me" and I was super excited. I like gifts that are more than just objects. IMO, the best gifts are useful, interesting, funny, or cute in a personal way. I love when I receive a gift and I can tell that the person giving it really thought about me and what I'd like to receive or what could be useful to me. Also like receiving money/giftcards for this reason, but that's less exciting. Other than that, I don't really like receiving gifts. I appreciate the thought, nonetheless.
1	We're actually pretty fucking easy to shop for, if you listen to our incessant chatter.\n\nI've gotten several amazing gifts from the close to me because they listened to what they heard me gushing and ranting and raving about. When you hear us discuss a brand, topic, fandom, movie, video game series, character, TV, show what ever the fuck we don't shut up about... 100/10 times if you get us something related to that we'll absolutely love it.\n\nIn my case, I went through a huge Pokemon phase, I was gifted the original 8 badges and stickers that made my 3DS look like a pokedex I geeked the fuck out.\n\nAnother year I was on a world of Warcraft high, I got a Horde wallet and some car decals.\n\nI had a conversation with a friend about how much I have always loved Sonic and they got me a Sonic game I did not own yet.\n\nI ranted and gushed about my favorite Sega Genesis game, my friend went online and she bought it for me.\n\nJust honestly fucking listen. Also it's all time sensitive, we go through phases of shit we're into.. Does not mean we won't still appreciate it but the closer to the addiction the better the reaction.
1	In general, experiences are better than things. If I need a thing and it's not too expensive to be a gift then I already bought it. On the other hand, having a unique experience to remember with a good friend or family member is something that only they can get me.
1	Mugs. I love mugs, especially the unconventional shape one or any mug with funny caption on it.

I could literally smash my head on my keyboard and it would be thought provoking. \n\nSee:\n\njuhiykl.-ñmj,knhgbhvfhmnjk.-ñl,lkmj<vgb vcd\n\nWhen you read this you think "what the fuck is wrong with this idiot" and "did he really type that with his head?" (Yes)\n\nWell, sorry but those are thoughts.\n\nSo my proposition is to change that rule to something more specific, like "If you can't come up with at least three different answers that foster more discussion on the subject at hand your post is probably shit".\n\nThank you for your attention.
26	You fool, now we can guesstimate the size of your forehead based on the peak separation between keys in your thought. I'm inclined to agree with you — the current content *is* thought provoking. This morning, for instance, it provoked thoughts of "why do I subject myself to the punishment of reading these?" \n\nWe can probably do with just removing that line in the Ne-rule. The rest of it, as is, qualifies under "post good shit". Even though good is vague. \n\nWait, are you suggesting you actually read the rules? What kind of ENTP does that? Aren't you supposed to have ADHD and are too busying snorting coke off a rusty nail? 
5	At first I downvoted and I was thinking you're a pedantic dimwit for being annoying about litteral shit like that but \n> "If you can't come up with at least three different answers that foster more discussion on the subject at hand your post is probably shit"
4	> uhiykl.-ñmj,knhgbhvfhmnjk.-ñl,lkmj<vgb vcd\n> \n> When you read this you think "what the fuck is wrong with this idiot" and "did he really type that with his head?" (Yes)\n  \nThe most thought-provoking thing about this is how you managed both "ñ" and "<" (characters that require simultaneous key presses) by merely banging your head on your keyboard.  \n  \nSide note: Way to attack one rule and completely ignore the others.  Banging your head on the keyboard (even if you had) would not be logical.  
2	Quality Content. ✔️
2	I think you're lying about smashing your forehead to get those symbols -  "<"  requires you to hold SHIFT and the symbol "n" with the Spanish line above it requires 2 steps.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;

1	I had to reread this a couple times
1	I am no Fi, it is clearly not. I am Entp who is tired of debating. And thinking how to use the devil advocate energy to something else. I must say you are young Entp. 
1	What even are thoughts?
1	Awesome. Thanks for the extensive post, man. Appreciate it. Haha You're right about learning code your own way. That's great that you find working on your projects that tantalizing. I think I can imagine being that passionate about something I make myself. Learning the fundamentals takes time, but I think it will pay off. \n\nHey, ENTPs check out Launch School if ya wanna code. If it takes ya a year, still cheaper than a semester at most colleges. Graduates of the Capstone average about $111,000. 😎 Founded by industry veterans, study at your own pace, master content (we should at least master something lol), no rush, and it's legit a good for-profit company in regards to schooling. \n\nI think it's the future of education. Why spend $50,000 at a university, when about $2,400 can get ya a job? They don't charge you for the Captsone up front, but get 10% of first year's salary. I did extensive research into it, but don't take my word for it. \n\n
14	A little message to anyone who is about to get into college	Hey everyone. I'm a sophomore in college and I wouldn't say that my college life so far wasn't eventful. However, there is a lot I learnt which could be of some help to you like minded individuals. Some parts of this post might seem like bragging or might be just a personal opinion but I hope you get a look at the tag before we get any further into the story of my life.\n\nSo, I was the smart kid in school. I know this might come off strikingly similar to most people but here's something slightly outrageous, my IQ is well above 150. Also my father earns quite a bit which puts me up in the richer section of society. So like every other normal (can't stress that word enough), I let it get to my head. I was really lazy to begin with and any of this didn't help. So came the time for the most prestigious college entrance exam in my country and I flunked, well not really but I didn't get into the best college and had to settle for the second best. I didn't really think much of it cause of how little effort I put in and the fact that I spent couple weeks before the exam in a hospital. \n\nThen I enter college. I'm all set to explore a new world and then I meet real life. Like everyone else, I get hit in the face with cold hard facts. At one of the best colleges in the country, every student was the best student in his/her school. This means that most people were floating high in the sky about how awesome they were and the bubble bursts. But my bubble was just getting bigger. Freshman year, I simply skipped every class, opened my books up an hour before my finals and got a perfect GPA. The people I once aspired to study with now seemed like simpletons to me and things got out of hand. Now everyone usually reacted in one of these two ways:\n\n1) Claimed I was bullshittin and that I was secretly cramming everything up\n\n2) praised me all the time and exclaimed at how jealous they are.\n\nBoth of these reactions invariably blew up the bubble.\n\nSophomore year starts and I get close with some seniors in my research group (and the hottest and sweetest girl that I'm dating but we will come to this one later). Research group being the place it is, was quick to understand my potential. They made me the key element of every activity and soon I was managing funds and how we would be spending them with the seniors. Involved in the decision making process, I was happy and so were my batchmates. Their happiness however, wasn't very long lasting. They started joking about all the extra work I had to do and I just played along. This however, left the wrong impression and I was now a devious guy who had given in his sanity to power. My arguments focused towards knowledge and finding the best solutions were now viewed as enforcement of my views on others and my bubble was as big as ever and what was waiting to happen did happen, it burst. \n\nWe were presenting a paper on our work to big shots from government agencies at a conference. A junior was representing the whole team and she blew it up. So now my superiority complex gets the better of me. The work we had been grinding our asses off for was now completely ruined by something that wasn't even her fault. I began to blow off some steam and all the small ridges that had been building up with my teammates began to surface and suddenly, I realised that I was alone. It hit me hard. I was the only one thinking the way I was. No one ever understood what I really wanted. I would always drop off hints but I wanted everyone to think for themselves so they could learn. But, things didn't turn up exactly as I had expected. The stereotypical "ENTP way" of making points and proving arguments had backfired. It wasn't that the people I was dealing with weren't smart enough, it was just that I failed to see that everyone doesn't have the same perspectives as me. I simply wanted everyone to think for themselves so they can improve but I never cared to listen to what they were thinking. I had failed the team and myself. I didn't leave them behind, I just took a completely different path all by myself.\n\nSo, hoping that you went through all that, here are my suggestions that the title promises (or does it?):\n\n1) Develop a habit to listen. Listening is one of the most efficient ways to learn. You don't always have to be in a debate to learn others' perspectives, simply having regular conversations would do. Sometimes it is better to not get people fired up.\n\n2) No matter how good you are or were at some point, don't let it fool you. Everyone is special and has something to offer. You will nearly always miss the finest and simplest details in life. Never isolate yourself just because everyone else seems simple and different. \n\n3) This is where the girl part comes in. Please fall in love. I'm not experienced enough to talk much about this point, but, I do know I'm in love right now and it has changed everything, for the good. It doesn't have to be a person. Just know that there's something you need to be at your best for, something that doesn't ever let you stop. \n\n4) Give some time to yourself. Introspect and question every aspect of your existence and purpose without fail and never forget your roots, the values you stand for. Whenever you go off track, fall back to this. Needless to say, this works pretty well in conjunction with the previous point.\n\nWell I could keep going but I need to stop somewhere. I felt the need to share this one incident with all of you so that you can get a headstart. We all strive to grow up and be the best we can be, don't let anything stop you and always keep moving forward.\n\nTL;DR: I didn't write this whole post for nothing if I can sum it up in a couple lines. So get your ass to the top of the post and start reading.
9	I couldn't get past the overly long explanation that involved you tooting your own horn. Maybe start with the suggestions. 
3	/r/humblebrag and /r/iamverysmart want a word with you.
2	>You will nearly always miss the finest and simplest details in life. \n\n>Whenever you go off track, fall back to this.\n\nAll I needed to read, thanks.
2	Same here dude, some people in my family said that college has made me blunt and straight to the point. Most people don't want to learn on their own so I said screw it not my job to teach them.
2	I showed your post to my wife. Bad move, she wants you to PM your phone number so you two can get to know each other a bit better. Neither of us can believe just how amazing and smart and wonderful you are. Quite honestly I'm jealous.\n\nThankfully you had a small misunderstanding with your peers. Really makes you seem more human and approachable - all without being a huge glaring fault.\n\nI don't know about anybody else here, but I'm thankful for your experience. Look at the sage advice that came as a result. I can honestly say that I am a better person for reading your post, and I SALUTE YOU SIR!
1	Good advice. I’ve found that having someone to be accountable to - my SO, father, and my dead mother - people I love with all my heart helps me from falling into some common ENTP traps. \n\nI completely relate to wanting others to come to their own conclusions and not control other people - even when your in a situation where it’s necessary. I’m struggling with this a bit right now. I’m managing a large project at work. I am great with the big picture - abstract vision but am less great with trying to manage people. I’m learning though.\n\n
1	Nice post 👍 agree with your take home points.
6	Feeling like your Falling Apart despite being successful	I thought I would throw this out to the ENTP community. At certain periods in my life, I have really come apart emotionally and begin to take unnecessary risks, my mood is all over the place, I’m far more scatterbrained then normal. \n\nIt’s caused some major issues when I was in college, and before I was on my current career but now i have better control over it now that my life has more stability (have a good job, make a good salary, have a stable relationship, etc.) it is exactly like what is described as an unhealthy ENTP. The catalyst appears to be late winter, stress and routine. I live in MN and this winter has been rough and before that I broke my ankle back in the fall and was on crutches / not able to workout or be nearly as active just prior to the winter weather. So it’s been a prolonged period of not being able to be myself. \n\nI’m back to my gym and getting back into shape but i am still having a rough time emotionally. I’m wondering if any other ENTPs experience similar difficult periods where you feel like a shadow of your normal self. \n\nI’m trying to decide if i need to make changes (I am constantly seeking the new and exciting) or if I should just stay the course and wait out the next couple months. Thanks and I love that there is an ENTP community - I feel that our type is one of the rare ones that has traits that are very unique to our type. I believe it is very valuable to have a community like this. 
3	Um like every day of my life?
2	ENTP's can never be satisfied. I achieved so much in the past 2 years that I could never imagine possible 5 years ago but I feel like I barely scratched the surface of my endless wants. This is good since it keeps you motivated to do stuff.
1	I think you should make changes and stay the course. Which is to say, yes - what you’re feeling is normal. But don’t throw out the baby with the bathwater, keep the things that offer you stability (SO, good job, exercise) and add in something new and shiny to help get over the blech. \n\nYou will always go through these cycles, some times worse than others. Sometimes it’s a matter of recognizing your triggers and powering through without changing much. Other times you need to add a little spice to life. Usually, both. \n\n(Speaking of triggers, you mentioned the bad winter - are you familiar with Seasonal Affective Disorder?)
1	Every 5 years or so.
1	I’ve learned my outdoor environment has a huge effect on my state of happiness. I lived in a place with harsh winters and took a leap and moved to a city with a year round warm climate and easy access to ocean and mountains. I finally have no more seasonal blues and it’s heaven. If you’re sensitive to your environment it might be worth traveling in winter or looking for a new locale. 
1	I think you need to balance striving for success with a healthy dose of si. Systems in place to make life easier. Your authentic self is the most important thing to preserve also. Remember those things that made you happy ... becoming successful ... the right friends ... the right environment.
1	ISFJs do that too!	
2	emm... actually I'm IFP, I was posting it on ISFJ for some reason.
1	Oh please.
1	Okay
7	Why do people use two cylinders in tractors instead of using a factory actuator?	so, Why in cultivators no are used simple lever mechanics to lift the drill, instead an additional cylinder from the tractor? like that https://img01-olxpl.akamaized.net/img-olxpl/652132459_1_261x203_ladowacz-tur-na-tyl-ciagnika-gostynin_rev002.jpg\n\nbut just like that https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gV6-JwnGDMo/hqdefault.jpg ???\n......\nin my case the lifting of the actuator is also controlled by one tractor actuator\n\nthe thing is that the lever position and lifting range can enable and control the drill and the unit\n\nit's like a double-out, but one with double action
3	The problem is we don't have enough wigi in the world. But on the other hand, there can only be one wigi. A wigi1, if you will. It's like being caught between a rock and a tractor 
1	Probably a load bearing or power issue. Having an additional cylinder may add more control. But I am no where near an expert in hydraulics
1	I don't know anything about tractors nor cylinders nor levers and I am not that sure if I understood correctly what you are asking, but my guess is with hydraulic cylinders most of the weight is supported by the cylinders and is distributed between all of them. However, if you use a steel lever, all the weight will concentrate on the point on which the lever rests and the steel will bend, so you would need more steel and one of a better quality, which would increase the price and weight of it.
1	Now *thats’s* the *most* ENTP question. (Assuming the OP doesn’t work in the tractor industry.)
9	What does an immature ENTP look like?	If you have the time, please, do leave an answer
37	Waking up at 12, spending the whole day watching youtube videos and browsing reddit, realizing you haven't done shit at 9pm, thinking "well, it's too late already for today so I'm gonna do it tomorrow", deciding to go to bed early so you wake up early and energized the next day so you can get your shit together, watching videos until 2am, realizig you did it again, laying in bed, masturbating because anxiety won't let you sleep, realizing you still can't sleep, fantasizing about what will happen once you actually manage to finish your awesome idea that will make millions and how it would solve all your problems until you fall asleep at 3-4am. Rinse and repeat.
18	bouncy and annoying but charismatic enough to have a large group of “friends”, inability to connect with others even though they thrive in a social situations, may appear as superficial or shallow, intellectualizes their own emotions (speaking from the perspective of an immature entp) 
6	Another INFJ asking this same boring question, color me unsurprised.
2	The ENTP I knew (cool dude) is now a drug dealer in Texas. Probably not the healthiest of ENTPs
1	Easily destructive to the people around them. Quick to burn bridges and gets a sick pleasure out of the aspects of confrontation. Piss off an ENTP and see what it is like to figuratively have someone look you right in the eyes, stab you and then turn the knife while getting evermore pleasure out of doing it. Even further if they really want to (been there and done that personally) they'll eat, sleep, and fuck your demise. They'll absolutely destroy your reputation, relationships, and credibility with the people around you. That's an immature ENTP but with zero filter. \n\nThere are other characteristic but I think that is the most tell-tale immature ENTP trait that would be most easily noticed. 
10	what entp character do you most identify with	someone asked a variation of this question not too long ago on this sub, but I liked the question and felt like not enough people answered, so I'm giving it another go. What  entp character, from literature or film etc., do you most identify with? I have always felt similar to Jim from the office, and to Juno, from the titular movie.\n\nWbu? explain!
10	Probably Gregory House. 
6	I think I'm somewhere between Claudia from The Dragon Prince and Veronica Lodge on S1 of Riverdale. \n\nI've also always felt a weird kinship with Ben Franklin, despite not being American. Not a "character", I know, but also - totally a character? Dude was cool. Lots of ideas; excellent conversationalist; unafraid to do things his own way.
6	**Francis** from *Malcom in the Middle* because of my extreme "don't tell me what to do or I will go out of my way to do the opposite" attitude.  I'm 35 and still haven't broken myself of it.\n\n**Q** from *Star Trek* because I like to poke people for a reaction.\n\n**Walt Longmire** from *Longmire*.  Not an ENTP (ISFJ?) but someone I aspire to be more like.  I do think I have a strong sense of honor and integrity that generally leads me to do the right thing.  And I have been described as stoic.\n\n**April Ludgate** from *Parks and Recreation*. She's an INTP but I share her dark sense of humor and am also a bit of a black sheep amongst my circle of friends.  I have a sprinkle of Jean Ralphio in there too.  The wooooorst....  :D  \n
4	Mark Twain i can feel his thought process!
6	Chandler Bing
4	Barney Stinson
2	I've always felt akin to Jack Sparrow from the POC series. 
2	Gregory house and Augustus Waters
2	I feel that I channel Sherlock's (Cumberbatch) take of Moriarty. 
2	Jim Halpert 10/10
2	Man for any ENTP who's lived a good life well aware of their ENTP-ness. Y'all HAVE to find this movie, I don't think I've found a more encompassing ENTP in such an old movie like ever. The movie *Once Around*, the character: Sam Sharpe, played by Richard Dreyfus. That's the a tale of the life and death of an ENTP. 
2	Mixed of Eleventh Doctor (Doctor Who) and a very cheerful version of Sherlock. Or maybe I am in tune with Moffat's protag.  
2	I do not relate to most of entp charachters, except for a few, like Patrick Jane from The Mentalist, which I relate to the most (not the the genius deductions part, but most of all the mannerisms and the way he interacts with people). Although I am on the whole a little more fun.
2	Jack Aubrey, who I think is mistyped as an ENTJ or sometimes even an ESTJ. I think that's because Aubrey's regimented behavior is assumed to be a trait when it's an adaptation. He went to sea as a child. He often hints at how much trouble he got into as a midshipman. Knowing his character, it's not hard to imagine he's severely understating how much of a PITA he must have been. So, I see an ENTP who has developed his own pragmatic approach to leadership, and whose unwitting abrasiveness held him back while lesser men were promoted. The Navy Way is the only way, unless Aubrey likes his way better. 
2	100% no hesitation without a doubt Jack Skellington from Nightmare Before Christmas.\n\nThrow in a dash of Alexander Hamilton from the play and it might as well be me.
1	I’ll have to check it out!
1	I'd say the closest I independently identify with is the 10th doctor, just without the irrational emotional outbursts. Put the 10th doctor, Tony Stark, Barney Stintson, and Mark Cuban in a blender with a dash of the Joker and that's where you find me.
1	Frank Gallagher is for me a fantastic ENTP .\nAnd people claiming he is ESTP have not listened to him or understood EN
1	[Manga Kaworu](https://i.imgur.com/Onk7duk.png). I don't really think that I identify per se, just know a pattern and think it's neat that it matches up with myself at times in media.
1	Tyrion Lannister 
-2	I can feel rick sanchez of rick and morty, though there's something about some versions of the joker that feel like home too.
9	Using ENTP Energy For Success	I've had two times in my life when I've felt overwhelming energy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne was when I was solely focused on just being a musician over 10 years ago, when I was around 18-21, which lead me to performing in front of crowds that I would never of imagined. I was obsessed. No one could stop me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe second is now, as I start my journey in the health & fitness industry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis abundant energy has already brought me success in a total new industry in less than 3 months.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I haven't had this energy, I've failed miserably.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoesn't matter how much money I've made, and I'm talking a lot. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just ended up losing it if I'm not living through this level of energy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRecently, I've been thinking about what this overwhelming energy is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd it's starting to become clear to me on how all ENTPs can use this overwhelming energy:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1) Seek out careers/ or a purpose that changes other peoples lives AND yours. That brings direct positive change and happiness but also can make you successful. Meaning you won't get bored\n\n2) Make it your mission to be different (not the best) through research and pattern recognition to find your unique position\n\n3) Say no to everything else, knowing that it is going to be better for many other people and for you if you say no to more\n\n4) Head into the unknown, knowing that something/the universe/God or whatever you believe in has your back\n\n5) Remove all negative people from your life immediately. Seek out people in the same industry or think the same as you. Ignore everyone else for now. And find your tribe.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnce you deliver on these five points, the ENTP energy is essentially unparalleled.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nENTPs are meant to show people the way. We are meant to help others see the future and lead.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe are the Shaman.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo find your own mission to help others, and find your own success along the way.
4	> Say no to everything else, knowing that it is going to be better for many other people and for you if you say no to more  \n>  \n>Head into the unknown, knowing that something/the universe/God or whatever you believe in has your back\n\nOr maybe do what you like as a side project while studying/working so you can get back on your feet if it fails. It's more work and more time, but at least you are not risking it all.
1	https://youtu.be/hYgF9vAX5ZM?t=11\n\nThey only thing i could think about while reading your post
2	Finishing the Job and other challenges/opportunities for the ENTP Project Manager (25M)	As a Project Manager in Construction, I know that I can bring unique perspective and the ability to think outside of the box when it comes to solving problems over the course of a project life cycle. \nAt the same time, I find myself struggling to get a project to the next stage, and wanting to procrastinate/avoid finding that “final” solution that ultimately closes a project or moves it forward. \n\nIs there anyone else out there that can relate or offer their own perspective on what they have done to overcome this challenge in their respective careers? 
3	I'm also a PM in construction and I have the same problem, mostly because I have to juggle so many responsibilities that I feel stretched too thin to focus attention on any single one for too long. That, coupled with the fact that I can never feel like I can fully rely on anyone to get anything done, especially the types of people in construction, makes it so stuff gets done slowly or not at all. What I have to do is force myself to focus on one single task and follow it through to completion. That is the only way to get it done without delegating it to someone else. It's not a particularly compelling answer, but it's the answer that I found.
1	I had the same issue until I learned a theory about team roles. I would initiate tons of ideas and then hand them off. The ones I didn't hand off were doomed to wither into oblivion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt sounds like you are a creator/refiner who would benefit from collaborating with an advancer and an executor.  Advancers are good at talking about the idea, getting people excited about it, and listening people to figure out if they really like it.  \n\nImplementers, or 'Executors', are people who love taking an idea, running with it, and making it work.\n\nExecutors don't like to build things. They want to get the plan, work the plan, and make the whole thing happen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://knowledgeworkx.com/articles/management/398/leveraging-the-z-process-in-teams](https://knowledgeworkx.com/articles/management/398/leveraging-the-z-process-in-teams)
4	He's just too good to hate him.	
13	Don't know who this is, but just from the thumbnail, I'm not going to watch it 😆
4	Who needs friends when you can have flight attendants
3	Why is this in ENTP? I must've missed the clue.
3	ENTP with almost exclusively ENFP friends	All of my childhood friends are ENFP. This group of friends was developed through secondary school and has stayed intact up until this point in my life (26).  I have had one on one relationship with other personality types, while still maintaining this core group. How has this happened?
4	You’ve mistyped them all.  
1	If the majority of your friends are of the feely variety, you probably are one yourself and this is why it has happened.
1	I'm an ENFP, dated an ENTP for almost 2 years until it ultimately ended because, well, eventually it became apparent we weren't moving forward in a deep way. \n\nNot all ENFPs are unstable or overly emotional. I'm a chameleon, so pairing that skill with my emotional intelligence of when to hold back emotional expressions, I get along well with ENTPs! They are fun, charismatic people who know how to get you out of your own head and just enjoy life in the present. \n\nDating wise I realized I need more intimacy with a partner than my former ENTP gave me, but we are still friendly and I still value the cool parts about him! 
22	Any musicians on this page?	Looking for ENTP types to collab with due to the fact that I’m great at starting or finishing projects.... just.. not.. both🧐
12	Haha that’s me! I can write the first part of a song but not finish it. The only thing I’ve ever been able to start AND finish is poetry. 
6	I'm a vocal musician.
4	I sing, write poetry, play guitar, piano, bass, harmonica, mandolin, and produce music. I have a really hard time finishing what I start, so I have about 127 unfinished projects. And oh, I’m a freshman in high school.
4	Currently in school studying music 
4	My favorite piece from the last 4 years was a short poem I wrote for a girl that I challenged myself to write in Spanish. I only speak a little bit of Spanish so it was in simple declarative sentences. That’s the one I’m going to look for. 
5	Vocalist and rhythm guitarist for a rock band
3	I'm a pretty decent bassist. I play some other things and sing a little, but bass is my jam.
3	No
3	I sing, let me know. 
3	I'm really into heavy metal/guitar. Also studying sound engineering. It's just the coolest fucking thing
3	I'm an orchestral horn player. finishing undergrad this fall then applying to grad school. 
3	Screwed around with violin, trumpet, guitar and mandolin
3	Present! 
2	It's an interest, wouldn't call myself a musician.
2	I'm trying. But I kinda suck right now. I'm decent at singing. But my tempo and rhythm is atrocious and I'm working on it. I got a busking license recently so I'm going to start busking in June. But in the meantime I'm working on my repertoire. 
2	Master of none of these: singing, piano, guitar, ukulele, drums, beatboxing. I'm saving up for a bass guitar, and hopefully I'll actually practice consistantly. I like the sound of bass a lot more than the other instruments I've tried, other than drums. Only reason I didn't continue practicing drums is lack of access to a drum set. 
2	Yes one of my active hobby is music soundcloud.com/alperozdil
2	Yup: https://soundcloud.com/vzkrv\n\nBut I really think you (we) should look for collaboration partners in other subreddits (r/isfj?), because a band of ENTPs is unlikely to get anything done ever 😁
2	Yes! I produce as well!
2	so a competition? I have started many instruments and also projects within but i never come out the other side with much material recorded or created. could be a good motivator 
2	I write songs
1	What kind of music / ican?
1	Have you ever heard of polyphia?
1	Are you playing yourself down maybe?
1	Nice using any daws?
1	The name says it. I also play Careless Whisper on the saxophone 
1	I tried leaning the flute, the guitar and the ukulele, but I wasn't able to get good. I always stopped practicing after about 2 months
1	Dope! I’m looking forward to it!
1	I write songs! I love the idea of an ENTP artist group. I am drowning in half finished songs and maybe the competition would force me to get serious.
1	What daw?
1	My voice got rapidly better tone and tempo-wise once I started recording on Logic Pro x and used Tex time and flex pitch to find failed patterns 
1	I love funky bass. Vulfpeck joe dart?
1	Art is an ongoing process where you present the best public a section of your work.\n\nSimply make a goal to make a 10minute song, actually make 5 minutes and use 3 minutes
9	How INFPs See Us	
1	insert picture of a devil
1	Pfft I’m boogie Pete on the dance floor without any alcohol 
4	I figured it out. I just might be an ESTP, but first, I’d like to discuss my reasoning, and maybe we all can understand a little bit better.	First of all, right, I know. ESTP or ENTP? People mix these up? Apparently yes, me being one of them. \n\nSo let me just get down to where the revealing moment was. \n\nI will have a guess about something, and then I will find the facts to support it.  Like I’ll get a wiff of blood, and like a bloodhound I’ll try to prove it.  I can great incredibly focused this way. (I love investigative work), but this can also be my downfall. Because I’ll work tirelessly to prove something that’s completely wrong, and it’s hard to give up.\n\nLet me give an example: \n\nThe other day I was thinking. “How much does being drunk behind the wheel, really affect getting into an accident?” \n\nWhat I wanted to know was: \n\nA. How can we even know how many drivers are drunk drivers are actually on the road? 1/10? We can never know. \n\nB. Is it the alcohol that makes the driver get into an accident? Or is it a bad driver just getting into an accident. We can never know, I mean we could say “alcohol probably makes you a worse driver”. But, what do the statistics say? \n\nC. Like let’s say right, “1/10 accidents are caused by drunk drivers” what if 5/10 people on the road are under some sort of influence of alcohol. What if it’s 8/10 people? \n\nI get it right, drunk driving is probably bad, but my thing is, is that I want to know for a fact just how bad it is before I can say “yeah drunk driving is bad”. Realistically I would never openly say, “drunk driving is not that bad”. This is an example folks, calm down. \n\nExample 2: \n\nEmployee texted me saying he forgot to clock in, he realized this half way through his shift. \n\nInstantly, I was like “he probably was late, and now I can nail him for time fraud, as soon as I get to work, I’m gonna check those cameras.” \n\nThe other think I realized is that, sure, I make lots of guesses about things. But I’m never confident about those guesses at all, not until I have the facts. \n\nFinal realizing my greatest fear: \n\nI don’t want to be forgotten, or casted aside. If I let myself, it’s almost like I look for all the clues to prove that it’s going to happen. Then I go into defend the castle mode.  Then meaningless things become proof that doom is coming. \n\nTell me what you think, I think I’m on the right track here. This definitely seems like an Se-Ni axis over an Ne-Si axis. 
9	You’re literally describing an Intuitive mindset.
6	*posts steam of consciousness pedantic Ne -Ti rant and calls self estp* \n\n\n
2	ESTP here... Se-Ni is worse than this. I'm too lazy to consider all clues or make guesses. If my Se can't get what I want now, Ni can come out of nowhere and ruin the rest of my day immediately.
1	That’s crazy - don’t have time to elaborate now but I’ve had that exact same thought. There has got to be a large number of people in jail for accidents which probably would have occurred without the driver being drunk. 
1	> I get it right, drunk driving is probably bad.  \n\n\nProbably??
6	In the event of a global war in our day and age, what do you think would happen to the circulation of information ?	Nowadays we have the internet, social media along with radio and television which is a huge difference with WW2. 
7	Some would argue that the emergence of a global, free for all web of information has transformed the nature of war. Why fight a military conflict over and with life, territory and natural resources when you can fight over and with what will be the essential commodity of the 21st century -- information? \n\nI think you have two options: \n\n1) Shut it down or install heavy censorship, see the Great Firewall of China.\n\n2) use it as a weapon and spread as much false information as possible so your enemy is either exposed to your war propaganda or the internet as a source has become irrelevant because determining the verity of a news story has become virtually impossible due to the sheer amount of information one gets confronted with in a short span of time.
1	It will be used to cause further chaos. Look at all the instances right now where sth like a „small war“ has happened. It didn‘t stay with the mishappening, even after they are manipulating people through media to have a certain opinion upon the happening. They can use media to influence their folks in such a way that they get a sense of nationalism and that all of them are involved and responsible for the survival of the country, back in the days the soldiers and officers came down to town and told these things directly to the families, where they wouldn‘t leave much of a impact on them. But through TV etc, you‘ll always see these things everywhere, and everyone will talk about it. \n\nOr another case, we will know what will happen before it happens because someone has leaked the information that an atom bomb is going to thrown to our town in March, 2020, evacuate.
1	In the future - unclear how far - trade agreements will include internet connectivity.\n\n\nGovernments (politicians) have only begun to scratch the surface of what's possible with the internet. 
1	Global war would be a bit different IMO. We're in the cyber age of tech, so I don't see global war being fought with nuclear warheads anymore. In the information technology age, I expect global "wars" to be "info wars", if you will. \n\nIt'll be control of media (*a la* the Third Reich). Some conspiracy theorists are already beginning to assert this exists via M A I N S T R E A M M E D I A or FAKE NEWS!™ There's talk of Russia interfering with the presidential election of 2016 in the USA. That's the type of global war we'll see.\n\nNuclear warheads won't matter as much, because the combat aspect will be fought with drones. I wouldn't be surprised if we already had Anti-ICBM drones and generic anti-Nuke drones that are automatically programmed to disarm/neutralize any warheads that are launched. 
7	Why do we dislike certain people?	You know when you meet someone new and (because we're human we make baseless initial decisions) but for some reason you just don't like them, not that they have done anything against you but there's something about them that is off putting and you don't want to hang out with them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyone got any ideas what could cause this effect? (or indeed the opposite)\n\n&#x200B;
12	I totally feel this. It doesn’t happen immediately, but definitely as soon as it becomes apparent that they no longer have the spotlight completely shined at them the majority of the time. For example in group settings, I’ll connect with those types people initially, and good vibes will be shared. However, the second that they don’t get the attention they typically get from the group because I am conversing with everyone positively, they will start to give that “look”. It’s just a bad vibe that they give off like they don’t want to be around you because you took away their temporary source of acceptance. When in reality it’s because they are as shallow as the basement floor of a house and people don’t find them necessarily interesting.
16	Bad vibes.
5	Intuition.  I can generally tell when something is off about someone in a bad way and can sense the manipulation and  malice coming off of them.
4	I think this happens to everyone, really. It's hard to speak for ENTPs generally, but personally, I immediately distrust anyone who is too immediately charming. If everybody likes them and tells me they're "OMG, THE FUNNIEST/NICEST PERSON EVER", I immediately assume they're a raging butthole and keep my distance. I just always think there must be something wrong with someone who is nice and friendly and charming all the time... which probably says more about me than them, *really*, but what can you do.\n\nBeyond that, I can tell when some random dude (or lady) is trying to play me. In my early twenties, the "negging" types, I guess. I still encounter them from time to time (albeit thankfully not too frequently), and it's *always* super off-putting. I think it's just all the insecurity oozing out everywhere. We get it; you're too uncool to relate to other people like a normal human being, so you need to try to manipulate everyone into thinking you're funny or "alpha" or interesting. I just - can you please go ooze elsewhere?
3	You pick up on certain cues, consciously or unconsciously. And based on a mix of experience and intuition, you feel a certain way about the person.
3	I hate those people that see right through me and my miles thick coating of bullshit. 
2	When I identify flaws in someone’s perception and/or judgment, I often speculate potential conflicts that it might cause b/t us, so I try to keep my distance. 
2	There is almost always a good reason (at least in my case) for trusting your instinct about other people. Your subconscious is really powerful, and (especially for Ne heavy types) is able to quickly put together connections and details indicating the "vibe" of someone based off of prior information even if we aren't actively aware of what that is. Ie if someone has certain mannerisms, expressions, a certain manner of speaking, it will compel you to react to that person in the same way as other people you've met that are similar, and if that person happens to be crazy or something, there you go.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn the other hand I also sometimes get really strong platonic attraction to others for the same reasons I feel. As an example, I'm a straight man but very rarely when meeting a (new, also straight guy) friend I will sometimes feel very emotionally connected to that person and trustful of them despite probably not having the best reasons to and these friendships have universally worked out for the good in my life.
2	It sounds like you are speaking very generally, which I don’t have a specific answer for. I’m generally pretty accepting of people, but I have a hard time with people who are “proud of being ignorant”. They have there view of the world and refuse to acknowledge that other points of view exist and also refuse to listen to logic or people who are experts in that area. \n\nAnother type of person who i really dislike are controlling people. Especially men who are controlling in their relationships with women. \n\nOtherwise, as someone mentioned - I think it is just general intuition. 
1	I usually have a reason for disliking people. Like i could always explain you why i dislike them. I don‘t generally dislike many people - i either like them or feel neutral about them, don‘t wanna be close to them, but for me major motivations are 1) their behavior reminds me of someone i‘ve got burned by before 2) their personality is so different and i don‘t wanna deal with them (this doesn‘t make me dislike them; just neutral; don‘t wanna be around them) or 3) and most common: when i realize someone is trying to leech off of me. In college most people i dislike are the ones that are  lazy as hell and want you to do all their shit. People that go „i‘m too stupid to do this can you help me?“ where I think 1st if you‘re stupid what are you doing here 2nd if you at least *tried* you might‘ve come up with a solution. But you don‘t even wanna try and make me explain it all to you like a private tutor like fuck off somehow everyone in my class wants me to tutor them even though i‘m not the best student either gdi
1	Our intuition tells us all.

6	Can't get a read on INFJ relationship	I've been (kind of) seeing this INFJ guy for a couple weeks now. He intrigues me because, unlike most guys I talk to, I can't get a solid read on him and it's hard for me to tell what he's thinking. It's refreshing. He seems to be above my usual tactics to get guys to pay attention to me (hard to manipulate!) which is frustrating but also presents an interesting challenge. \n\nAn attempt to quickly sum up the path of this relationship:\n\nWe hung out a few times and he never really pulled a move on me, but wanted to keep hanging out. Then he told me that he hooked up with someone else, bear in mind that we hadn't even hooked up at this point, and wanted to be honest with me and gauge how I was feeling. I wasn't \~happy\~ about this, but felt like it was too early to demand exclusivity, so I told him that it wasn't my place to tell him what to do or infringe on his actions. \n\nFlash forward to last night:\n\nHe tells me that the girl he hooked up with before is coming into town and he'll probably be in a situation where he'll see her. He says that his actions depend on how I'm feeling. Apparently the way I've expressed myself previously has led him to believe I either want something platonic or I just want him for sex, but I guess I'm just bad at expressing my feelings?\n\nFrankly, I've never felt as stupid as I did when he was trying to get me to talk about my feelings, but he weighs emotion so heavily that it seems like an important step for me to take. It's really hard for me to let me guard down and open up, but why would I if there's a remote chance of someone else in the picture? I'm constantly weighing the risks of becoming vulnerable in my relationships. \n\nI feel like I have two options: open up or get out. But at the moment it seems risky to put myself in a position where I don't have full control. \n\nDoes anyone have advice for talking about their feelings? Or relevant insight into the dynamics of INFJ/ENTP relationships? Am I being dumb? Why is it so hard for me to get a read on this situation? \n\nIndulge me in an outside perspective or any similar stories. 
8	Well if you are genuinely interested in this guy I would be honest with yourself and him about the way you feel. Despite your inability to articulate your own feelings. \n\nIf it's anything other than a sense of genuine connection, i.e. the thrill of the unknown, or chase. I wouldn't do it. 
3	[HE.WANTS.YOU](https://HE.WANTS.YOU).\n\nWhat's wrong with you people? Argh.\n\nHe doesn't want to be put at risk either, in fact I BET abajillion dollars that he wants you so bad that he's only checking with you for the same reason he didn't "bust a move" when y'all first met. In fact, without verbal Se confirmation we'll literally go down a rabbit hole of what ifs until we run ourselves arguably dry.... and then do it all over again. "Well, they did this... But they also did this....." and if you pulled away, even once, or gave some signal that you weren't digging it 100% - 1000000% - THEN GET READY TO HAVE THAT SPACE RESPECTED. We get better as we age, but.... We're terrified of even the slightest rejection because we want so much to respect you(because rejection means we did something fundamentally wrong in our heads because there were signals before but not now, what up with that, guess it's us) and of course don't even get me started on the whole mindset of "nothing changes" and the whole "Well now I have to do this and this and this since they said Nah." \*Smacks lips\* always having to pretend that you ain't breaking inside because they just don't get how much you actually care \*waves hands back and forth\* and don't even get me started on someone who is giving mix signals because in our minds it's not an option anymore..... it's already you and that's it - that's it. One sees the potential in somebody -  that's it. He was probably at his wits end with you and it seemed super extra reasonable to bring up that girl in order to get an answer because it might seem "rude" or "presumptuous" to bring it up some other time. He might be with that girl if you say no but know he'll never be with that girl.\n\nHit that man up with some, "Yo fam, you super duper intriguing, you set my mind ablaze, and I be duper super digging you for that." He'll initially wonder why you're talking like that, but then you tell him that another INFJ told you to say that; he'll instantly understand because INFJs run deep. Compton.
3	Ehhh.... on one hand I guess I admire his honesty and being upfront.  On the other big fat hand, I would never allow a guy to use another woman he's been with as leverage to get me to do something I might or might not be ready for.  I'd probably tell him to get out of here with that.  I would think that if he were really into me, he wouldn't keep some chick on the back burner like that and just see how things go.  I'm proud to a fault though and can be stubborn.  Your mileage may vary?\n\nEDITED TO ADD: I'm not sure how old you are, but when I was college aged, I might have been as torn as you are.  However, I'm a grown woman now (35) with a daughter and I'm going to tell you what I'd tell her (someday) and what I wish someone had told me.  You do not have to accept this kind of thing from a guy.  There are stand up guys out there who would never dream of holding another woman over your head to push you in a certain direction.  It's lousy and I think you should demonstrate to him that you have too much respect for yourself to put up with anything resembling what he's proposing.  
3	Personally, I wouldn't want to be with someone that wasn't all in on me. I had a similar experience a few years ago. I was hanging out with this girl and she expressed physical interest in me but didn't want to pull the trigger and be my girlfriend. She kept bouncing back to this guy. I was of coarse head over heals for this girl and was not mature enough to fully see what I should do. \n\nShe put me through a lot of shit and I finally got tired of it after like 6 months. She finally decided that she wanted to date me, but by that time, I realised that I could do better and told her to take a hike. I eventually found my wife and she treated me much better. Relationships are already hard enough. No need to make them harder by having all this shit at the beggining.\n\nMy point is, why should his actions depend on how you are feeling? If he was really into you, he would be into you and you wouldn't have to tell him to stop seeing other women. Especially since you have not hooked up with him yet after a few weeks and he has already hooked up with another girl. Why did he put a move on her and not you? If you did want him for just sex, why wouldn't you have made a move already? Something doesn't seem to add up with this guy. I would be hesitent to open up. This guy sounds very manipulative. The kind of guy that hooks up with other women but would get mad at you for flirting with another guy...\n\nPersonally, I would cut ties with him and find someone that wants the same thing out of you that you want out of him. This guy is just a tool that is trying to fuck as much as he can. I am not sure why he didn't put a move on you, but went after that other girl, but it's his loss.\n\nI would stop wasting time with this guy and try to find someone that has the same relationship goals as you. Besides, if this guy felt like you were worth it, he wouldn't be seeing other women. This should show you how much he values you.\n\nI say move on and take this as a learning experience. Maybe look back through your texts or think about your discussions and see how he got the idea that you might only want to be in a platonic relationship. Perhaps thefact that he is hard to read made you think you had to resort to different tactics to get his attention. Maybe this meant that you behaved more physically to him or acted in a way that he missinterpreted.  Maybe try different tactics in the future.\n\n
3	My wife is an INFJ. This is my recommendation to you. Drop all your normal tactics and just be frank. Just say what you think. This has helped me with my wife so much
2	be vulnerable. tell him exactly what you want and tell him what you lack the ability to explain, he’ll understand, i personally havent met an INFJ that hasnt made me want to run into a brick wall but if he’s the guy for you it wont take anymore effort than just being true to yourself. Probably. he definitely wouldnt make a decision contingent on you if you werent important to him in some aspect so consider that too 
2	>I can't get a solid read on him and it's hard for me to tell what he's thinking. It's refreshing. He seems to be above my usual tactics to get guys to pay attention to me (hard to manipulate!) which is frustrating but also presents an interesting challenge.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat is what I loved about my INFJ gf at first. I cannot say what the best course of action would be for you in this situation, because that guy could just be a dick, but generally speaking INFJs respond to rationality fairly well. If you were to say "I am interested in something serious with you", and you just said that simply and honestly, he would respond well to it, (generally speaking).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust tell him how you honestly feel as straightforwardly as you can, if it works out, it works out, if it doesn't, it doesn't.\n\n&#x200B;
2	Well I'm an INTJ and my muse of 7 years is an ENTP so I can speak to this some.  For your friend it's an "if/then/else" conditional equation and he's being straight forward wanting to solve it.  He obviously cares about what you think and how you feel, so for him to even deploy these strategies tell me he likes you a lot.  He just wants to know if the potential exists for a serious relationship or if you two are destined to always be friends and he doesn't want to get stuck in the friend zone.  How you respond may require you to at least internally debate the question, but it will set the stage for at least a friendship if not more.  But introspection and self-awareness it will require. 
1	Hmm, the only reason you got with him is because he was interesting because he was "hard to manipulate?"  \n\n\nI'm shocked he doesn't value you lmfao
3	Discussion: Is the person who wrote this post actually the asshole?	Hey!\n\nSo after lurking here recently and silently cursing at the edgy material being posted, this is something interesting I came across on the front page: https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/atver1/is_it_bad_that_i_got_this_girl_kicked_out_our/\n\nTLDR: OP gets into a political discussion with a girl in her class about abortion, said girl is sent home for the day then refuses to continue attending classes with OP, girl's parents blame OP for their kid being kicked out, OP asks - is she the real asshole here? \n\nIs this an incident where freedom of speech is being censored?\n\nWhat are your thoughts?
24	Most people misunderstand what Freedom of Speech allows. \n\nOnly the government can infringe on that right... by making speech illegal and by fining, imprisoning, or otherwise punishing people for exercising that right. \n\nHOWEVER, private institutions and businesses have the right to create standards of behavior for their students and employees. They are well within their rights to suspend or kick out anyone who violates their rules... or for any reason, actually, except discrimination.\n\nIf the religious nut was suspended because she expressed her religious views, that does actually sound like discrimination against her religion. Her beliefs may be ridiculous, but she’s as free to express them as anyone. \n\nIn a way, the OP set a trap for her by revealing “it happened to me” after the fact. She shouldn’t willingly engage in a topic she knows is triggering for her, especially if she’s going to weaponize her sensitivities against a person she’s set up.\n\nAt most, the girl should have been told to not discuss her beliefs in class... not kicked out.
8	I feel like we are not getting all of the relevent info here. There is nothing wrong with having differing oppinions on any topic. The topic of abortion really just boils down to what you think is a life. If you think life starts at conception, then abortion is murder. If you think a fetus is just a clump of cells, then abortion is not murder.\n\nShould somone be sent home for voicing their oppinion on abortion (for or against)? No. Should a teacher or boss punish someone for voicing thier oppinion? Should a teacher or boss favor a worker or student and side with them in an arbitrary debate based on nepatism or more experience with that person? No.\n\nThe way this is written it looks like the prochoice girl egged on the pro life girl and then complained that she was called a murderer. Then the Teacher (who obviosuly has a close relationship with the prochoice girl) sided with the pro choice girl and kicked out the pro life girl.\n\nif this is the case, then the Pro life girl is in the right and the prochoice girl and teacher are assholes.\n\nHowever, we don't get a good understanding of how everything went down based on this post alone. Did the pro life girl partake in any victim blaming (blame the girl for being raped) or did the pro life girl call her a murderer as an insult or use this intiment detail as a tool for bullying? If something like this happened, then I can see their being justification for kicking her out. But if not, then the teacher and pro choice girl are assholes.\n\nLet this serve as an example to avoid political or philosopical discussions unless you are in a propper environment. So don't talk about these issues at work or school. Only talk about these issues in school if you are taking a debate, theology, or philosophy class. Discussions like these in the workplace are pointless. People will rarely change another's mind, it is a distraction, and results like this often occur. \n\nWhen I have had people at work ask me about my political stance on x number of issues, i tell them:\n\n"I vote the same way that you do. In private."\n\nTLDR basically nobody should have been sent home because nobody should have been discussing this topic in this setting. The fact that they both took part in this conversation means that they both could have been sent home. The fact that one girl was sent home tells me that there might be more details that are not being shown here.
5	As a journalist it's unethical wrong to do 50/50 jounralism, where arguments are weighed equally against eacother. Some arguments are more valid than others not on a personal level, but on a logical level. \nTherefore you should always take a stand even in other contexts against opinions without value. \nHere in Denmark the problems with pseudoscience or religious fassicm is luckily rare, but it is often treated as such. \nFreedom of speech is not a hallpass for all opinions to be treated with equal respect. \nFreedom of speech just gives you the legal right to speaker freely. \n\nSince the girls are minor it is the teachers job to also pauy attention to the students wellbeing. The lack of empathy shown when someone decides to call another little girl a murder, that should be treated as such, is more than enough reason, and it doesn't necessarily has anyhting to do with the opinion it self. \n
4	OP should have known better than to discuss a topic she can't be objective and detached about. Regarding the other girl, calling a rape victim a murderer is a bit tasteless, even if you subscribe to the pro-life view (in which OP would rightfully be called a murderer).\n\nI don't see this as a free speech issue for the reasons already mentioned. FoS as a legal term doesn't apply to private institutions and I don't think you could build a solid case if this happened in a public school either because the parents pulled her from the class in the end. From how OP worded her post I assume it's a private institution though, so ultimately it's up to the owner to decide what's acceptable in her business. If calling a rape victim a murderer crosses the line, you're out.\n\n\n\n \n
4	They’re teenaged girls.  I’m fairly certain that makes them both assholes. 
11	>I said it’s not murder and I said plus rape and stuff happens are you saying someone who’s raped should have to keep it? And she was like well yeah, just cause someone gets raped doesn’t mean they should be able to murder a baby. This really fucking riled me up so I said to her you realise I’m a rape victim who got an abortion right? and she said, well I’m sorry that happened to you but I don’t think it’s right that you killed your innocent baby. I said so I should be treated like a murderer for it? And she was like, well yeah, it is murder,..I was like fuck you you’re disgusting and walked off.\n\nWhat was she expecting? To magically get a pro lifer to sway to the side of abortion? If it's a sensitive topic for her, she shouldn't have lead the conversation there. Yes, OP is an asshole there. \n\nLet's consider an analogy. I'm in a boxing class (provided via my job). Somehow the conversation of religion comes up. Another student says he believes in God and follows the Bible. Let's say I'm sensitive about this because my mom told me I'd burn in Hell for having premarital sex. I ask if I'm a sinner because I'm having premarital sex. He says yes. I go crying to HR about how offended I am. And he gets fired.\n\nThat's asinine. I'm the one who should get fired for provoking the situation. \n\nRidiculous that the OP is being showered with validation over that sheer idiocy. But I guess that's just "victim blaming" because she's the one who's got the liberal views. I'm sure the pro lifer isn't a victim at all, getting kicked out of a dance class. All because she thought someone who was asking questions can handle the answers. 
3	She asked a question, she got an answer.\n\nIf she wasn't planning to tolerate the answer she shouldn't have asked the question in the first place, I side with the kid that was sent home.
5	Y E S 
4	I mean, it’s no small thing to casually say, “Yeah, you’re a murderer,” to someone who’s been brutalized and then faced with a choice that will affect her financially, logistically, and psychologically FOREVER. If pro-life girl didn’t want the consequences of bringing up a controversial topic at school, she shouldn’t have assumed that everyone there were going to be brainwashed idiots like her and she shouldn’t have been talking about it in school in the first place.\n\nEdit: vague pronoun
2	Yeah but what the fuck is freedom of speech. It's a concept. Now I think it's an important one but it does not stop things from happening it does not dictate the way the world works. You can say something and someone can just punch you in the face. Now is that against the law. Yes. is that censoring Free Speech probably. But none of that has any causal power outside of human institutions.\n\nNow whether it's wrong or not is a completely different question.
4	No she's not the asshole. She expressed her opinion and experience on abortion and the other girl said she murdered her baby. That's grounds enough to be upset and cry to the teacher. The teacher asked the pro-life girl to leave for the rest of the day which seems like a somewhat just punishment for making a rape victim girl cry by telling her she's a murderer of her baby. It's not grounds to kick the pro-life girl out of the program, but that's not what happened. Her pro-life parents refused to let her come back. 
4	No.\n\nHere's why - religious girl brought up abortion. That's inappropriate to bring up. And then doubled down and called a rape victim a murderer, which is vaguely harassment-y. Freedom of speech and all but unfortunately there are consequences for her words and shitty opinions. She faced the consequences of being a bad person. Sucks to be her.
0	OP is the asshole. Don't start fights you can't finish. If you want to argue with people you disagree with I am in complete support of that, but don't go running to the authorities (in this case the teacher) when that person disagrees with you. \n\nYou are not entitled to good feelings in this world.  You must control yourself and your emotions to create good feelings. She will learn that life is going to be full of people who don't care about her feelings, especially when discussing exceptionally socially/politically charged topics.
1	It’s 100% the choice of the dance place. Their property, their rules. Everything else is irrelevant.
1	This entire thread is fucking toxic. So I'll throw my wrench at it. Murder isn't wrong.
1	Eh, I’m too lazy to read her drama, but if the girl doesn‘t want to attend classes anymore, then it‘s her own fault. I mean yeah objectively speaking she told her opinion, OP told her opinion, they should move on. If they get stuck up and that girl doesn‘t come to school anymore, how is that OPs fault? Unless she bullies the girl everyday, she could always come back to school. So the parents should teach their daughter discipline instead of blaming others first. \n\nFrom what I‘ve seen in the comments, it‘s kind of harsh to be so blunt about abortion being murder, especially because OP was put into a situation where she was forced to consider it. But nevertheless the girl used her „freedom of speech“ as well, and if she thinks that‘s morally wrong, let her be. It *is* insensitive, but it‘s her freedom of speech. \n\nI think what is really interesting here is the concept of abortion because of rape, and murder. If we‘re being attacked first, and due to self defense accidentally murder our assaulter, is that murder or self defense? If we get raped, since self defense wouldn‘t be raping the rapist back, is abortion considered murder or self defense?
0	So, i see it this way if you are Pro-life you see abortion as murder so if someone is adovocating for abortion it's like advocating for murder and yet by her own post she made it look like it was she (OP) who started the negative tention.   You can also understand that for a rape victim this might be sensitive, that does not mean that nobody can be be openly Pro-life when there in the same room as you which the OP thought was a major Insult\n\n&#x200B;\n\n" And she was like well yeah, just cause someone gets raped doesn’t mean they should be able to murder a baby. "\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOP,s response " This really fucking riled me up so I said to her you realise I’m a rape victim who got an abortion right?"\n\nYou realize that i'm a rape victim so how can you be pro life?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBonus: [http://100abortionphotos.com/](http://100abortionphotos.com/)   Graphic as fuck, tell me this shit ain't murder.
10	INFJ just started seeing ENTP. Advice please!	Alright, I know everyone has their opinions on INFJs. I'll very willingly admit we have our flaws, but not all of us are terribly unhealthy. I'd say overall I'm in a stable and healthy place myself. \n\n\nRecently I met a wonderful ENTP. We immediately hit it off and have a strong connection so far. I stayed with him this past weekend and it was incredible. We spent half of our time just staring into each others eyes and cracking the dumbest jokes. We are definitely complete opposites though and while it's exciting it's also a bit nerve wracking. He's into cars and guitars and I'm into Psychology, spirituality, and art. \nI always pictured myself with someone more in-line with my hobbies, interests, and over all kind of life style, but the connection here is too amazing to deny. Even with our differences there's always a strong feeling of understanding with one another. \n\n\nI'm curious about your good experiences with INFJs. Any advice for either of us on how we can better further our relationship and/or things we can watch out for in ourselves while exploring this?

I always pictured myself with someone more in-line with my hobbies, interests, and over all kind of life style, but the connection here is too amazing to deny. \n\nI’m sure you’ll have a long, wonderful relationship.   Having things in common, mutual goals and outlooks, or non-solitary obsessions you can enjoy together isn’t as important as having that magic spark and connection.  That’s why INFJ and ENTP are perfect together!
4	INFJ and ENTP have been known to have very successful, special relationships!! They are a pair that is commonly talked about actually.\n\nMy best friend of 8 years is an INFJ and I am an ENTP. It works really well because we balance each other other out. She is currently dating an ENTP as well. She says she actually ends up gravitating towards ENTPs in general.\n\nThat being said, we do have a lot of interests in common. My input would be that if it were anything to cause friction, it would be that your hobbies do not align, not that your personality types don't compliment each other. That isn't always a deal breaker though.\n\nBest of luck!
3	Speak up softly when he pisses you off, don't nurture your wounds. Tell him that you like his considerate way of hearing things out and you need that now.\n\nSet boundaries, but take the time to logically explain why said boundaries are being set up.\n\nAs a last resort, saying "I don't know why this makes me feel bad or hurt, but I know I don't want the person I (Choose your own adventure; Love, Respect, Admire) being a source for said negative feelings, please work with me on this.\n\nFinally, synchronize your alone time with him. ENTPs need alone time. Reading a book, researching whatever, playing a video game, etc etc. It usually all falls under the umbrella of exploration and reflection. Don't take it personal when this happens. It can be startling to some, just watch and observe and average out how much alone time he needs.\n\nGood luck. 😎
2	ENTPs like to debate and play devils advocate. Sometimes we like to debate just for the hell of it (even if we don't agree with the side we are arguing for. This helps us understand a topic more clearly and understand where others are coming from. Basically if he starts to ask questions about something you think is sacred or important, he is not attacking you or the concept, he is just trying to understand it better. Don't take it personal, just understand that this is how a lot of us ENTPs learn.\n\nI am not saying that INFJs are narrow minded, but other personality types often don't know how to respond to this debating from ENTPs. I have had several relationships go sour because of this. \n\nI think you can have a great relationship with this guy, but as you get more serious with him, there might come a time where he starts to question your spirituality, especially if he has different views on religion, philosophy, etc..\n\nI will tell you from my experience as a ENTP, we are constantly thinking and using logic. I think (based on this post and my experiences) that you might be developing feelings for him faster than he might be:\n\n> but the connection here is too amazing to deny.\n\nEverything is fine and dandy when the relationship is new. But what happens when the honeymoon wears off and you get to know eachother a little better. If you get overly attached to him, you might get shocked if he suddenly ends it. He might eventually notice a character trait or something that scares him off. He will use logic and end it. Don't get too overly attached too early. You will have a rough time as he learns more about you and discovers any significant philosopical differences. He will likely cut it off preemptively (before you might realize there is a problem).\n\nNow I am not saying to avoid him or not to pursue a long term or significant relationship with him, but just don't rush it, get your hopes up, or force anything too soon. Have fun in the honeymoon phase and take what you learn in this relationship and use it in relationships moving forward if you do eventually break up.
2	Don't know about romance, but two of my closest platonic friends are INFJs. We've been friends since we were kids. I think part of why we work so well is that they're emotional sponges, while I'm hyper-rational. They don't have to soak up my emotional turmoil, or when I do have it (of course I have emotions), I'm trying to reason my way to why I feel that way. They provide mindblowing insight and help me verbalize things. When they have problems, I let them explore that without taking it personally. We love talking to each other. We can also spend many silent hours together at a time. It's like companionable recharging. 
1	IMO I think as ENTPs we lack substance and are prone to existential anxiety. INFJs quell that if you make the connection.
1	How do you know he's ENTP and not ESTP
1	My biggest tip for you is step out of your comfort zone ENTP’s appreciate that.\n\nOn top of that show him that you can learn him something and that you’re willing to improve yourself.\n\nGood luck 
0	>I'd say overall I'm in a stable and *healthy* place myself.\n\nI'm going to create a drinking game based around how many times someone can count one of you using that word!\n\n>I'm curious about your good experiences with INFJs\n\nI have none, maybe one. My friends have none. Fun story! When I was little, my two friends' father found a garter snake in their backyard slithering around, I thought it was neat, but he said all snakes are dangerous because all snakes can bite. So, my friends caught it, and he took a hammer and bashed its skull in; he said that all snakes are dangerous, even if they are small. The INFJ is a small and pathetic snake, and logically it is dangerous regardless of its stature. The INFJ's bite is its well-honed Fe, its ability to believe every lie its saying and convince you that it likes and agrees with you, its ability to seem docile is remarkable, and slither away so quickly after hearing what it wants to hear is also very impressive and even unique. I personally like INFJs, when I can bash their skulls in using my intellect.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFun fact: I told my ISTP friend what to say to make one fall in love with him, too bad for him we found out she was a slut.\n\n&#x200B;

2	Very nice!
2	Great insight and new dichotomies that are consistent. Well done! 
2	That’s really interesting, I recognised a lot :). \n\nWith the INxx I’m not too sure on the ‘thinking systems’, as I understand what you mean but I would perhaps call it ‘feeling systems’ as an INFP. ‘Reminds me of...’ ‘resonates with...’ ‘has same vibe as...’ etc. I realise that might sound super vague, but to me it makes perfect sense and it gets filed that way. So there is a methodology but it’s quite subjective in how it gets filed, even if the results make sense objectively.\n\nI have no answer to your ISTP conundrum. I hope for their sakes they’ve got more going on than your analysis would suggest :D.
1	>capable of operating without any external structures of morality\n\nWhat constitutes “external structures of morality?” Peer pressure? Moral philosophy? Religion? And what do these have to do with “action heroes?”\n\n>sacrifice occupations to save hearts\n\nWhat do you mean by “occupations?”\n\nWill likely add more questions and complaints later.
1	> *(Meaning most of the people at the top 10%  of intelligence are Intuitives, even though most Intuitives aren't at  the top 10% of intelligence)* \n\nsource?
1	BUMP!
1	Very well then. Sight is gifted, not shared. \n\n*Let each fool be the conductor of their ignorant demise. Farewell~*
5	I need some of that sweet sweet clarification.	Ok. So I am a proud ENTP and at least according to 16personalities.com, I am assertive over turbulent. However, I keep hearing people talk about “Type 3 ENTP” or something of the sort. I frankly have no clue what that means. Based on what I’ve heard it has to do with the approach to situations, but it would be my greatest joy if someone could enlighten me. Thank you.
9	They're referring to enneagram. If you think MBTI has skeletons in its closet, then enneagram has the Catacombs in its closet. Take the vagueness of the typical Mbti type descriptions online, crank it up to 17, and imbue mysticism into it. That's enneagram. \n\n*Usually* you see people using it to justify why they're X despite having Y traits. For instance, I'm a circle, i just have enneagram type 5 which means I have some pointy ridges on me in a symmetric style.. see it only *looks* like I'm an octagon, but I'm really a circle. 
5	OH an ENTP with 3 nipples.
2	Have you seen The Master with Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Joaquin Phoenix? It's good, but the overall message, conveyed masterfully, by Hoffman is what's great.\n\nHe plays a pretty obvious fictional version of L. Ron Hubbard. Phoenix plays a rudderless, drunk,  ww2 vet who gets swept up by Hoffman's charisma. Phoenix is desperate for human contact and Hoffman is desperate to be somebody's master 😆\n\nPhoenix is put through tedious tasks as part of his regimen for becoming the best version of himself he can be. Sounds like the perfect movie for douchebag millenials who want to "live their best life."\n\nSpoilers for a movie that's 7 years old:\nAt a certain point, Hoffman's son tells Phoenix that his dad is making all of this up as he goes. At first he denies it. As the film continues, he realises it's true and that there is no precedent or scientific reason for what he is doing and he leaves.\n\nThis personality stuff is the same. Would you read your horoscope every day? I hope not, but it's basically the same. Hokey psuedo science. When you read a new term, and can't seem to make sense of it, it's probably b.s.\n\nWhen people go to psychics, the psychic reads the person and figures out what they want to hear. It's very entertaining to see. Very high level of con artist. \n\nWhen people go on the internet and take a short questionnaire, they're looking for something similar. But this time, they're doing the reading and trying to find what they want to find what they think fits themselves. Almost like conning yourself.\n\nDon't bother digging into this stuff too much. Find out who you are by living. Observe yourself and the way you deal with obstacles in your life. Taking a step back for some self dissection is 100x more beneficial than reading what someone else says about you.\n\nFor those who are pissed that i didn't link The Master to entp stuff, the downvote button is right here.
12	how do I tell the difference between a healthy ENTP and an unhealthy ENTP?	I have realized I may not know a single ENTP who I would consider psychologically "healthy"  
30	I'm a pretty healthy ENTP.\n\nWe control our need to argue. We think about other people's feelings - at least giving them consideration if possible. We are aware of our strengths and weaknesses and act accordingly.  We value honesty and positive relationships because we can accurately predict the outcome of our actions and realize that's a better recipe for happiness and success.  Healthy ENTPs are also VERY charming - if we want you to like us, you'll probably like us.\n\nAn unhealthy ENTP will just pointlessly argue and/or troll, will try to hurt people's feelings for no good reason, may be manipulative and lie a lot. Try to be edgy, do things for shock value without considering future outcomes or consequences that might be counterproductive to the outcome the ENTP actually wants.  Accidentally pisses people off a lot. Unhealthy ENTPs are still charming but also grating to many people.\n\n
12	I've never met a healthy INFJ myself.
8	One eats their vegetables, the other doesn’t 
8	There are plenty of us. We simply control our need to question everything “in your face”. We’re still thinking it, we just know everyone thinks it’s off the wall and intense.
5	I like to think I’m pretty mentally healthy for an ENTP, especially compared to how I used to be. Before I would argue a lot, and I would purposely try to hurt others while arguing. I would attack the individual instead of their idea. I was unaware of my own faults and would deny them if they were pointed out. I would lead on many people at once, and even lead people on while in a relationship. I was vain, and always thought I was right and everyone else was wrong. Thought I was better than everyone. I’d publicly call people out on things. Now, I would say I debate more than argue, if you’d even call it that. It’s more like a discussion. I hear out the other person and can agree with them when they make logical points I hadn’t considered before. I don’t attack the individual at all anymore, and now I think I’ve lost my touch and couldn’t really do much emotional damage if I tried. I’m very self aware, and I actively work to fix any issues I have, which has helped me improve in a lot of ways. I might immediately deny flaws when pointed out, but I typically consider what they say and think honestly with myself if it’s true, many times it is and I’ll fix my behavior. I don’t lead on anyone anymore, I’m in a relationship right now (INFJ) and quite frankly I talk to very few men other than him. He is very healthy as well. I’m still very confident, but a lot less vain. I think highly of myself without feeling above those around me. If you have any specific questions, feel free to ask. I’ll answer to the best of my ability. 
4	So what's the difference between a healthy and and an unhealthy infj?
2	Empathy, emotivity, stable identity, listening
3	How many ENTPs do you know?\n\nAnd what does “unhealthy” mean?
3	Healthy:\n\nPositive\n\nOutgoing\n\nEnthusiastic\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnhealthy:\n\nshows up to work 30 minutes late with yolk drippings all over their wrinkled shirt. their fly is undone. they smell like piss.
2	I've matured a lot in my years, however I don't think the desire to challenge or be there devil's advocate ever "goes away". Instead I use it when wanting to dig deeper into riveting conversation, or when I wanna learn how some *imbecile* dares to justify some backwards ass irrational bullshit, or to put *assholes* in their place who are full of themselves or being scumbags, petty or disrespectful without cause. I'm a lot more understanding and accepting of things dealing around feelings and emotions, however I stand my ground. 
2	Lol, what does "psychologically unhealthy" entail exactly? \n\nI think the first thing that comes to mind is that there is a mental illness of some sort involved. *If* that is indeed the case, then typing is irrelevant altogether (since the model is based on adult personalities with no known mental illnesses). \n\nBut, from gleaning through your comments in this post, it seems like you're attributing negative stereotypes to what constitutes an "unhealthy" archetype. Each type has its own strengths and weaknesses. \n\nFor example, if you met an ENTP, and they came off as *knowledgeable*, *charismatic*, and *energetic*, then you might say, "Well, they seem like a healthy ENTP". \n\nBut, if you met another ENTP, and they came off as *argumentative*, *intolerant*, and showcased *a lack of focus*, then you might say, "Well, they seem like an "unhealthy" ENTP". \n\nDo you see the problem? If you're making the judgement calls, then you're also highly prone to biases. By labelling types as "unhealthy", you're making it easier to convince yourself of that, because you're focused in on their weaknesses. \n\nSomeone may exhibit their strengths in one interaction, but show their weaknesses in another; people are not always consistent in their behaviour. Your conception of "unhealthy" has less to do with types, than it has to do with your own judgement, and how mature the individuals you normally interact with are. \n\nPsychologically unhealthy is definitely not the right label to use when it comes to what you're referring to. 
2	From experience under-developed ENTP look to be controversial for the sake of it, edgy, self-important and generally lacking in empathy\n\n
2	*I'm a unhealthy ENTP... AMA...*
1	Could you give some examples of why you find them unhealthy? \n\nI’m curious whether it’s objectively unhealthy behaviour or whether you perceive it to be so because it clashes with an idea on your side of what is ‘healthy behaviour’.
0	One is all like "....blah blah stuff with things and how does the things with all the stuff do the stuff with the things.. oh weird question... what does it mean when the things and stuff merge with the stuff and things? Maybe they thuff and sings. "\n\n\nThe other? They won't tell you because they're ghosting everyone while watching their brain eat itself. \n\nEdit: while in brain mastication mode, you may hear the voice of Gilbert Gottfried say something to the effect of: \n"PLEASE EXCUSE ME WHILE MY BRAIN EATS ITSELF"\n\nOr... i could be wrong. \n
102	The most anti-ENTP question ever...	
59	I don't understand how you guys live lol\n\n-the ISFJ poster from the linked thread
16	It's not like this sub never had regularly scheduled posts before. See the mentor thread that used to be posted once a month. \n\nActually, I think having regularly scheduled threads could be one way to improve the overall state of this sub, as long as they're open-ended enough. Something similar to the bioethics threads that popped up semi-regularly. \n\nThe problem is that whoever posts them (whether a mod or some regular member) is most likely putting in more effort than the rest of the community, i.e. it will sit at 25 upvotes with three comments. 
15	Structuring and scheduling is possible, maintaining it is a different thing altogether
11	Now imagine being a young woman and having one of those for mother.\n\n(I’m kidding. 10/10 Best mom in the world. I just ignore 100% of what she says and I’m good to go.)
8	I wish i could be half this organized in remembering to brush my teeth.
3	Why is this anti-ENTP?
2	I remember the last person who told me to slightly organize my scheduel, I REEEEEd in their direction and threw tendies. 
2	ENTPs with ISFXs are a solid pair. My ISFP and I leave the place a mess, but she always knows where stuff is and who has which social thing going on when. I just got out and make us new contacts all the time who I convince to hang out and give us stuff. I'm the set up, she's the follow through.
2	LMAO
1	I'm entp and I regularly mistype as a entj bc i lead a life that demands me to have a little more structure even if it means biting my hand until it bleeds so I actually do it lmao 
1	The fuck is this word “structure” you speak of? 
10	Lost my ENTP. Need replacement model...	33/F/INTJ here who lost my ENTP bestie to the swirling chaos of his existence. I miss the clever humor and intellectual stimulation. Any of you in the market for a friend? One who likes a debate and isn't easily offended...
21	what year models are you interested in 
21	Give your entp a good two weeks and then ask them for help on something and watch them revive yalls relationship 
15	Did you try turning him off and then on again?
6	um...\n\nunscrew the latch at the back near the anal cavity\n\ntake out old batteries and replace\n\n&#x200B;\n\nyour friend should be up and running in no time
4	Ya don’t want it. 
3	i ve never met any intj in my life , i am stuck with dead boring SJs , I really would like to talk to one.\n\nAs for your ENTP bestie , just give him a month or so , give him a call and you will be good.
2	Sure! 33/F ENTP that has her stuff “together” and that LOVES the perspective of INTx people and misses having someone like you to explore sensitive topics for fun! :)
1	33 M ENTP, love making friends, down to chat and have thick ass skin, bring on the new friendship let me pick your brain!
1	32 M ENTP. Let's exchange opinions and talk in a non politically correct context.
1	>Any of you in the market for a friend? \n\nIs that you, Rachel Green? Didn't you peak in like 2002? I'm in the market for more up to date models. 
1	26/F/ENTP model with faulty batteries. Ate my last INTJ snacks, gonna need to restock soon.
1	Wish you luck with that.\n\nI have an INTJ friend who’s a complete asshole with no sense of sympathy/empathy , is very insensitive, and extraordinarily funny... good ol’ INTJs
11	What role do Fe and Si play in your lives?	How do you experience these lower functions? Have you gotten better with them over time, or have you decided to ignore and suppress them? How have they affected your life and identity?
9	Fe is pretty major in my life. Ti is important and I use it a lot for work, but it's my Fe that likely sets me apart from my peers. I try to lean into it quite a bit. A few years ago, it felt a bit fake/unnatural/uncomfortable, but now I'm a lot better. \n\nI'm still working hard on my Si. Because my memory/recall/attention to detail aren't great by nature, I rely quite a bit on technology and *force* myself to take steps to ensure I'm going through all the steps correctly. For example, if I make an appointment with someone, I try to put that appointment into both my phone and calendar right away. I also keep a detailed to-do list that I check multiple times per day, because otherwise I'll get distracted and/or forget. If I need to be detail-oriented with some project, I'll either ask for help from either an ESTJ or ISTJ, or I'll do things like print a submission/presentation/whatever out and make myself edit line by line, by hand, as well as read it out loud. It is a tremendous effort and really tiring, and frankly I don't always have the patience for it, but... eh, I'm trying. Si is important. 
4	As far as I understand, Fe is the mouth that talks out my NeTi. It's what communicates my ideas, it's the thing that curates all the bouncing around my brain does into something that sounds really good and that other people can get on board with. It gets excited when it makes other people excited. It's the thing that gives me a carrot on a stick to get me to pick one (or at least one themed group of) idea(s) and focus on it for a while, because it can anticipate and really enjoy the positive input I get from other people once I can sit still long enough to slap all my ideas together into a thing that can be consumed and responded to positively.\n\nOn a good day, Fe is what makes me fun and sociable and mindfully present in a conversation. It can guide the rest of me to being more fun to be around, because it reads the room and gives good information back to me to work with and to adapt to on the fly. It comes in handy when you talk to strangers, especially when you need to make a good first impression— and it has to do double duty when you're, say, pitching an idea to someone who might pay you for it, and you want them to like both you *and* your idea.\n\nSi for me is like... the "oh yeah" in my routine, because honestly it could be stronger, even though it's so much more developed than it used to be. For me it manifests as like... "oh yeah, I haven't eaten yet. I'm kind of blood sugar crashing, that's why my brain is running at like 50% capacity. I was too distracted with what I was doing and was just getting mad at why I was suddenly so stupid." Or like... "oh yeah, I forgot about myself that if I don't write things down as they occur to me I'll forget them in favor of new exciting things, and I'll end up periodically forgetting things that I actually really wanted to do. Maybe I'll take this afternoon to make a really nice to-do list... yeah, I feel way better and less frustrated for a few days now as I follow this list." Or like... "oh yeah, I can't work for 3 weeks straight without taking a day off or I go literally insane, even if I really really really like what I'm working on and that's just as long as this shiny new toy lasted me to fixate on. I remember I like to do XYZ when I'm this thoroughly burnt out, so let me take a day to get in some me time and I'll feel better when I dive into work."
3	Fe is what made me the therapist of my social circle. I can understand everyone‘s point of view and can understand where they might be coming from, so I can give them advice because I can understand them in a way. Fe is also what makes me defend everyone all the time, I hate injustice so yeah. It basically made me a considerate and understanding and very tolerant person. I can also get along with anyone if I want to, because I know what the other feels,thinks, wants. It also helps me in my current management position, I know how I have to deal with every person so I can gain their respect thus make them cooperate. No I‘m not being fake, it‘s called being adaptable.\n\nSi makes me feel like I‘m lost in a time space continuum. My friends will ask me „so what have you been up to the past few weeks? You suddenly disappeared from the surface?“ and i‘m like .......what was i up to?.... i keep losing track of the present when I‘m absorbed in ideas or thoughts. I space out all the time and am clumsy as hell. It was difficult for me to keep a tidy room, it‘s getting better now. I have trust issues in my own memory because I don‘t remember any details, because of this I was accused of many things where I couldn‘t defend myself because I didn‘t remember at all and „why wouldn‘t i have done it?“ yeah I might not „be like that“ but technically speaking, anything is possible. So yeah. It‘s the anchor on my leg but in a way also shaped my characteristics  everyone knows of me now.
2	Fe is what allows me to manipulate people, and Si helps me keep all my lies straight. 
1	Silicon makes up my computer chips and iron makes steel which makes a lot of my spoons and forks.
-1	Lol they don’t 
8	If all jobs paid the same what would you do?	I'm really struggling with this question as an entp. The only thing I could think was I would choose the easiest job. I think I'm finding it tough because every job implies limitation. \n\nCan anyone provide any more wholesome answers and their reasoning behind it. 
7	Would hours be roughly the same as well? What about training/education/cost of entry/etc.? Similarly, what about prestige? There are so many factors to consider.\n\nIn any case, I would probably choose to be a food/travel blogger/vlogger/Youtuber/whatever. It'd be a super sweet gig - sometimes literally.
4	Dude I‘d go straight for all my low-paying hobbies. Suddenly majoring in linguistics/philosophy/archeology doesn‘t seem so bad anymore. I might also become a drummer. Great thought, thanks for the positivity
3	Same job I have right now: physicist. Because I want to uncover the way the universe works, and spread that knowledge to others (teach it)\n\nAn alternative is being a gamer. Because I'm lazy and am quite good at Vidya.\n\nAlthough I'd end up just working both jobs, that way I can teach online dorks physics while I crush them in smash. 
3	I'd be a cow impregnator.
2	I like writing for the creative freedom it gives me, including the fun of travel for research and the ability to switch genres if I feel like tackling new topics, so I’d probably still be doing that. I imagine there’s a lot of new media that has a similar lack of limitations— I agree with the Youtube comment, for instance. Theoretical/hypothetical guaranteed income is just a bonus at that point to think about.
2	I would be coaching young padawan to launch their own business and so they can go on and change the world! \n\nI know it sounds cheesy, but I’m good at challenging people and at thinking outside the box. I don’t like to build, I like to help people build stuff! \n\n\n(I’m actually trying to launch a business to be able to do exactly this. I’m struggling with how to make money doing this but I know I’ll find a way :) ) 
2	Professional Redditor obviously. I already spend way too much time on this site, might as well get paid for it.\n\nEdit: more serious answer: I'd choose something I want to do for the rest of my life. Money is no longer a factor, so it's not about jobs... it's about finding your "true calling".
1	You have to factor in the cost of education too. There are things I'd like to do, like be a doctor, but if I have to pay for all the schooling (and put in all those educational years) only to make as much as a cashier it isn't worth it.
1	Easy jobs = a fast road to boredom. I’m now in a role where I deal with very complex issues that come up out of nowhere and I couldn’t be happier with my job. I use my brain to solve complex issues and we have admin workers who deal with the mundane details. \n\nIt is hard work but very gratifying. I would suggest finding a role that offers a similar free flowing structure with complex challenges. \n\nTo answer the question though - I would probably be a travel photographer documenting the world in an artistic way. 
1	A NEET consultant, consulting NEETs to how to waste their time better (of course in NEET way, like playing games, surfing on internet, etc).\n\nor a lego builder, building lego for myself and getting paid.\n\nor a procrastinator, just wasting time to something unimportant and getting paid for that.
1	I am a loan officer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n *I was minding my own business when a friend*, an **ESFJ** whom I grew up with and cycled with daily wore me down over the course of 1 year. He offered an opportunity to take a 1 yr guaranteed salary + commission position with his lending company.  *( Primelending's Top Gun program,  basically they test your personality and potential performance in sales, spend anywhere from $80,000-$100,000 for 1 year of your time to teach you to become a top loan officer, even if they get 1 out of the class of 24 prospects, if that 1 loan officer is a top producer, it is a WIN)*\n\nThey provided a performance test and *unfortunately I tested well enough into sales that they hired me* and I left my part-time job at a bio-lab and school where I was pursuing bioengineering (brother is INTJ - structural engineer, seemed doable so I followed suit).\n\nI did have immediate success early on and abandoned the safety net salary for 100% commission with no mininum income, the issue is, I was easily overwhelmed with monotony. repitition, deadlines, and other shit. ***I suffered burn out after 2 years.*** Financially, it was lucrative, mentally extremely easy, but it is task oriented, people managing, and number crunching, relationship building (business partners aka realtors) which do not require much intellect to be honest.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**I verbally quit** to my manager and he said if it was my intent to resign, he would need to take my pipeline and pay me out commissions and **finally to send a letter of resignation.** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI left for vacation to Oregon, camping up the coast for 3 weeks. **Day 2 of vacation** (*just couldn't make a clean break :(* ) **I received a contract**.  I kept the contract but left my pipline of $2M with the previous company and restarted my business at a new lending company where the expectations were free and my manager promised I was producing on my own terms.\n\nI have never gotten back to the same level of productivity as my first 2 years, but got state licensed and increased my commission almost 2x. In the end, financially I was able to do less and make more, but the issue was the redundancy of the work, lack of challenge, and people managing/prospecting.\n\nIf you need more information, feel free to ask, I wrote this briefly because I have never been one to label myself, but it is clear I am an ENTP. The career is lucrative, it is possible, and breaking $100K shouldn't be an issue (go with non banks)... but resign yourself to understanding  what it is:\n\n  \nLead Tracking\n\nRelationship/Social Extroversion with business partners\n\nOrganized, multi tasking always, Easily up to 100 communications daily and at the same time.\n\nUltimately, it is also unchallenging for us, but I am doing it, and I financially well off, but I still feel that my full potential is unrealized, you will need a confident and hands-off manager. Best of luck. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\n\n If any of yo need to buy a house, hit me up.

1	I'd still be a software developer playing bass and writing music in my spare time, or I would be a bass player writing software in my spare time. I'm going to do both regardless of what they pay, because I am good at both of those things and because I find them to be *stimulating*.
4	Random question about Richard Feynman	Anybody know his Enneagram? I know it’s impossible to know for sure, but perhaps someone here has a reasonable guess?? He seems like a 7 of some sort, maybe a 7w8? \n\nMaybe any ENTP can vibe with his endless ideas, but maybe someone here really really vibes with him? \n\nIt’s just a random question I was wondering as I happened to come across his work, which led me to a documentary, which led me here. Thank you for your time
2	I've also thought he was a 7w8.
2	Need to diagnose a Tritype Enneagram as it can show different facets of personality better. I.E. I may get 7w8 or 3w2 alone at certain times. But I get 7w6/7w8 (head), 3w2 (heart), 8w9 (body) all at once. Tritype can correlate other behaviors to certain positions of the self.
2	You should read his book- Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!
1	> as I happened to come across his work, which led me to a documentary, which led me here.\n\nSounds more deterministic than random. 
7	Opinions on ENFPs [GENERAL]	Just got in to a relationship with one and wondered what the consensus was either in general or as a partner. 
8	Being an ENFP myself, it can go two ways depending on the ENFP. Since you're both extraverts it will probably be a very good thing. But immature ENFP's can be downright horrible to deal with. Overly dramatic, emotional (outbursts), too dependent/needy, very selfish, self centered, manipulative, etc...\nIf you're lucky and they're more mature, it could be a pretty good match. ENFP's will always be very caring, loving and affectionate towards you. I think they'd stop at nothing to make you happy, you'll probably become the center of their universe. But keep in mind they're really sociable and are a people person. I often see in ENFP relationship advice posts that the partner thinks their ENFP friend hangs out too much with their friends or doesn't text them a lot when they're out having fun. Just don't take such stuff personal, give them their space when they're with other people. Another thing is that we can be perceived as flirty. It can seem like this and some immature ENFP's can also quickly lose interest in someone. Being thickle can be annoying. But if you're sure she has genuine feelings for you, it will be great.\n\nEdit: If you do decide to go for an ENFP, please look past the fun exterior. An ENFP likes being the "entertainment" but especially in relationships they crave to be "seen", their true self. This takes time and trust though. It really sucks sometimes if people only like you for your "fun" personality and neglect what's behind the surface. 
3	You don't cover each others blindspots which will be a cause of conflict. ENTP will get pissed off with 'know it all' vibe of ENFP. ENFP will get pissed off with ENTP's childish need for social approval
3	The ones I didn't choke to death within five minutes of meeting them are great. 
3	The ones I have met were too over-the-top sweet.  It's nice to be around people who are thoughtful but the ENFPs that I've been around overdo it and now I feel like I'm expected to be that way so as not to feel like I'm taking advantage.  And it's not a natural state for me.  My natural state is "I don't want you to help me unless I really need it and I don't want to help you unless you really need it."
3	Needy. Sensitive, cries easily. Fun to hang out with though (coming from a Female INTP).  I could spend 24/7 with him. Got along flawlessly. Relationship was where we had conflict. Mostly due to how emotional he was. We had different ways of expressing feelings. Also, I felt like he was just a giant chameleon and had not true identity of his own. Could have been one of his own personal idiosyncrasies, or it was just his personality.  
3	They manipulate from the heart and expect reality to conform to their feelings
2	Oh lawd.\n\nI'm... not a fan. 
2	From my experience, when things are good, they're REALLY good. When things are bad, it can leave you pretty damaged. ENFPs can be just as heartless as they are loving.  They can raise you up so high, but they can drop you just as easily.  They are capable of both extremes, but of course what really matters is who they are as a person.  Whether or not they are capable of being in a healthy relationship.  Obviously that goes for anyone you date, but you should know the potential outcomes for this particular type.  Maturity (in all areas of mental development) is definitely key.  
2	I like ENFPs, but would have a hard time dating one, unless they're super mature (and even then, they're not personally my preferred type, as I'm most drawn to IxTJs). I find ENFPs to be one of the more volatile (and in that vein, drama-enjoying/causing) types, whereas I get *really* irritated when someone is at a 12 for too long. \n\nAs friends, however, they're super fun!
2	I only ever get into arguments with FPs, and they usually wind up thinking I’m an asshole,  I know because they say so, lol.  Good luck.  
2	I've been with an ENFP for a couple years. She cries sometimes and has lot of emotions, but she is unrelentingly affectionate and loves me for who I am, something I am eternally lucky for. She will usually let me talk my head off about whatever I want while providing ample conversation. Apparently thinks it's cute. \n\nIt can get grating and confusing, but she understands, and her usual solution when I am confused or kinda annoyed by the circular or lack of logic is just to simplify it and request affection and support, something I have no problem giving. \n\nOh, also, they're eternally grateful whenever you do something nice and love it when you do spontaneous romance things. They love the confidence of our normal selves, and also love the inner gooey center that's super lovey. \n\nSo yeah. If you find an ENFP you like and then turn on the charm, they'll often decide they like you. They make good friends, and in my case a great partner. 
1	Not to be cruel, but I find them generally annoying. Not intolerably so, but enough to avoid one-on-one. 
1	For me, I had an amazing ENFP friend as a child. Although when I got older and started to mature, our heads would butt in every opportunity they had. (Even though they were mostly- if not all my fault) Our beliefs were so different, but the main favor is I made a new friend (A rad ENTJ girl I still know now) In a way the ENTJ opended up my eyes? I wasn’t so naïve, and started to speak for myself, and started to realize how much I actually hated my ENTP friend. She would get so offended over the lightest of jokes (so often) \nSo I cut ties with them. We are no longer friends anymore, even though we didn’t go out with a bang like I wanted to, it’s nice to know that I don’t have to deal with her shit anymore.\n(Not saying all ENTPs are like that, just my only experience)
1	My sister's an ENFP. She's an intellectual opponent so don't underestimate them just because they are feelers. They could have a well developed Te like my sib. That's about the only thing you have to worry about I guess from my experience
1	Yikes I came in here (an ENFP) seeing how super judgey it is in here!\n\nMaybe that's what it will take to have ENFP ENTP relationship work out.\n\nAcceptance and gratitude.
1	Whites become less supportive of welfare programs when they are informed that a majority of recipients are black (vs. white). However, this racial bias disappears when they are informed that most welfare recipients eventually obtain jobs and exit the program.	
5	*I'm blotto and even I know this is not the sub for such discussion.*\n\nHow blotto are you?
4	I didn’t read the article, but from the blurb it seems that if you give people facts presenting racial differences (most welfare people are black) they’re going to make assumptions and conclusions along the lines of those facts.  \n\nBut if you give people facts about the program’s success — *which is all at really matters* — then people will judge the information along those lines.\n\nSo I question if such a thing is really demonstrating intrinsic bias as much as it shows that people think within the constraints of the information presented to them. \n\nConsider as another example, the purveyors of partisan news sources which always present a black hat / white hat view of politics.  So is it any wonder they’re all wearing,.er...red hats? \n\nSo maybe we should all stop talking about race and sex and all the other trivial differences and start worrying about the things that matter.  \n\nI fully admit I didn’t read the article, so I can be totally off base.
4	What
2	Wrong sub.
2	Very thought-provoking. This post reminds me that I need someone to feed me and that I too like free money.
1	I'm curious if others controls were done, or are being planned on being done. This current work address white views on black welfare (of which it seems 20% of black pop uses welfare and 8% of white pop uses welfare). Because whites outnumber blacks by about 6 to 1, I'd expect about 2-3x as many whites on welfare as blacks.\n\nSo I'm curious who blacks would respond to the whites on welfare. Or the Asians responding to blacks or whites on welfare. Or Hispanics on black, etc. Because currently, I suspect people are viewing this through a systemic racism lens of whites against blacks. But my suspicion is this is mostly a twofold factor: firstly it's likely an in-group out-group bias, which exists ubiquitously in most areas of life. The second is like what Azdahak said, whereby people simply think within the confines of the problem. In other words, its why out of the box thinking is so valued in jobs
11	As much as I love MBTI personality, lately I wonder what if these personalities are our mask we function in this world for the survival purpose.	After doing longer meditation this idea came to me. Not a doubt or worry it is just a form of what if? I believe our personality shaped by our environment more than DNA alignment. That is anoher argument but what if we created this personality mask at a very young age as a survival tool. And we continue to validated it through filtered view. What if we had a potential to be any of the personality but life hijacked us to be ENTP, not a bad thing😊.  but what if all these personalities are a result of childhood truama, hurt and confusion, not our true self.  Tell me what you think of this and can we flip  personaloty? 
8	>but what if all these personalities are a result of childhood truama, hurt and confusion\n\nWhat if I haven't been traumatized as a child? Would my personality still be a mere reaction to it then? \n\nI'd also say that if this were true, that is that our personalities are survival tools, we'd see intuitives trying very hard to become sensors because frankly, it's much easier to survive as an ST than it is as an NF. \n\nAlso what exactly is our "true self" anyway? What we were meant to be? How did this come into existence in the first place? Maybe selves are meant to be fluent? Or maybe they're not 'meant' to be anything. 
2	> What if we had a potential to be any of the personality but life hijacked us to be ENTP, not a bad thing😊. but what if all these personalities are a result of childhood truama, hurt and confusion, not our true self. \n\nWhat about twins or siblings who have *different* personalities? Trauma affects different people in different ways, and I think that's evidence for inborn personality differences.
2	>I believe our personality shaped by our environment more than DNA alignment.\n\nBoth DNA and environment. Mostly DNA.\n\n>But what if we created this personality mask at a very young age as a survival tool.\n\nFe making you appear cosmetically as an ISFJ would be the mask normally for ENTPs. To mask defiance, you would appear compliant; this protects the ego.\n\n>What if we had a potential to be any of the personality but life hijacked us to be ENTP\n\nPossible, but most unlikely. Too many mental ailments and quirks correlate to type. Intuition is especially correlated to right hemisphere dominance (big picture thinking) via brain scan research (Ne is right hemisphere, Fe is left hemisphere). For example, using myself as a model, as I am ambidextrous (better left-handed and was nudged righty as a child), me having Ne dominance comes back to that data. My Fi being weak (7th function of an 8 function model and Se being my last 8th function) comes back to "Ti represses Fi as an introverted judgment and Ne represses Se as an extroverted perception for example." So, yup - your brain is who you really are.\n\n>But what if all these personalities are a result of childhood truama, hurt and confusion, not our true self.\n\nInteresting theory, but I think that'd apply to people who choose answers that aren't actually honest when self-reporting. Also, if by personalities, you mean a 16p archetype that panders to people; yeah, that's just positive imagery to make people feel good.\n\n>can we flip personaloty?\n\nIn times of extreme stress, fear of death, hormones, and pharmaceuticals - but regardless of how long, it is false and not permanent. In the end, the real you and your brains natural allignment to certain functions is always going to be there.\n\n&#x200B;
1	Yes, everyone of my family has Fe, and from when I was only 3 years old, they used Fe to make humor, to tell me how I should do things. And I had to develop Fe to survive with them, or I would be peecieved as the black sheep, but why I became an ENTP and not an ENFJ? I don't know.\n\n
1	I understand what you mean but I disagree. I come from a very dysfunctional family myself with a wide array of siblings, and while I could attribute some of our characteristics to our placing within the family, there are some strong differing personality traits which have been there from very early on in each of us and which do not necessarily reflect the ‘hierarchy’.\n\nWhile you could say trauma shaped us, I think some traits are extremely resilient in the face of it :D. Those point for me to an underlying personality we are born with, and also knowing quite a few babies growing up into teenagers by now, those traits were often quite obvious from the start. Way before you could say experiences might have molded them into a certain personality type.\n\nNot saying we don’t get affected by our experiences btw! But I think the effects of it may even often point to our inherent personality type and not be so much a consequence, as actual proof of it haha :).\n
1	It sounds like you're close to enlightenment, friend. Enjoy the ride!
0	Our personalities are absolutely formed by our life experiences. One person can be different MBTI at different points in their life. I think I've had the same core personality my entire life, but that means I have not adapted at all. If I were to have adapted, I would be more of an xSxJ.  That's what everyone in my family is, and being an ENTP has made communication incredibly difficult. \n\nBut also, there are other things that affect personality type. For instance, I'm an ENTP, but I also have ADD and severe anxiety. I'm still an ENTP, but some of my personality is toned down because of other elements.
2	Your Attitude Towards the Use of Pathos & Ethos?	I'm being forced to write in these modes in school right now, and I'm so against it. When people use these against me I often feel insulted because it seems like manipulation. I think it's important to LEARN about these styles of rhetoric, but I think our goal is to see past them and master logos. I think it's important to teach people to evaluate information INDEPENDENTLY of how it's delivered or who it's coming from. Sometimes I think this leads me to think I'm an INTP, but I digress.\n\nI know ENTPs have a stereotypical reputation for being able to persuade people with speech, so I'm wondering, do you other ENTPs enjoy using these in your arsenal? Or are you morally against it, like me? 
8	There's nothing morally wrong with persuasion. Feelings and ethics are huge factors in most people's decision-making. It's only reasonable to appeal to them.
3	I (sort of) argue for a living. Depending on who you're talking to, ethos and pathos are incredibly important. I believe the best argument consists of a little bit of everything - you need to set out the logical groundwork for your conclusion, but you also need to remember that whomever you're trying to convince is also a human, with their own individual biases, and tailor said argument accordingly. Even if the person you're trying to convince is a judge, it helps to humanize the problem. The important thing is not to present an emotional argument in lieu of a logical one.\n\nPersonally, I'm not insulted if someone tries to make an emotional appeal to me. It's not as though I see the problem any less clearly just because somebody has professed an emotional attachment to it. I usually do take the pathos/logos of an argument into an account when I'm making a decision, but it certainly won't be a deciding factor. Moreover, it is incredibly useful in helping me to understand where the other person is coming from - e.g., why the "logical" part of their argument might not make any sense. 
1	Question: is this "school" you talking about high school?
1	Yes; to serve a purpose, to share knowledge, to connect with others on moral/personal grounds greater than ourselves, to entertain the "more" of the world that I don't see because I don't believe in it personally. \n\nThat being said, be critical of pathos & ethos
1	Lol are you a junior in highschool
1	Pathos is Suffering (it is literal definition of the Greek word)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPathos is also Experience (it is the literal definition of the Greek word)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut Pathos is more than that.  (It is a extremely nuanced Greek word with lots of meanings.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe get the words Empathy, Sympathy, Pathetic all from Pathos.  Note Pathetic did not have the original negative meaning of an adjective but words meaning-shift and new meanings can become the common.\n\n  \nPathos is about triggering mental simulation, to imagine something not yourself, and then to be anchored in this mental simulation by the triggering of the emotions.  Note Pathos is not just about suffering, pain, experience, and other emotions...there is also a sublime form of Pathos that cause us "to rise above,"  this Sublime form of Pathos is like an investment where it will all be worth it in the end, all our trials and tribulations, and thus we can feel but not be destroyed by the feeling.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj8QvMCVVf8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj8QvMCVVf8)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo yes Pathos is all about mental manipulation and manipulating another person's emotions, but it doesn't have to end this way.  Part of manipulating another emotions is to realize emotions are like a sea of liquids, a river, and it can be a torment, or it can be flow, or it can be still as in Ataraxia (Greek word for Tranquility) and its Sister word Apatheia (Apatheia literally comes from Pathos as a root.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataraxia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataraxia)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apatheia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apatheia)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is about Guiding the other person's emotions, to let them feel things, and yes you are manipulating them, but manipulating them gently.  Remember emotions are motivational states and you can plot motivations / emotions on a 3 dimensional axis for there are 3 components of an emotion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1) Level of Arousal\n\n2) Approach or Withdrawal Instinct  (also Neutral)\n\n3) Reward or Punishment, seeing something as Good or Evil but also other things.  And there is also a neutral in between.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThink of it as no different as manipulating a person's attention with a movie, much like Steven Spielberg does when he creates a memorable scene, a type of scene called a set piece.  Good use of Rhetoric is much the same way, no matter if its using Logos, Ethos, or Pathos to tell the rhetorical story.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWqyNE6ok14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWqyNE6ok14)
2	INFJ (25, M) looking for a ENTP date in London	Hello, \n\nLove you you crazy creatures! \n\nAs I spend most of my time deciding which book to get at a second hand bookshop and cuddling my teddy bear I don’t really have much time left to go out and meet ENTPs (f). And when I do go out I end up having a deep existential discussion that lasts several hours with an odd old man I’d meet on the street, which again leaves no time to encounter ENTPs...\n\nI wouldn’t say I’m shy but I hate the small talk and meaningless conversations and would rather discuss split brain experiments in neuroscience, how  we can amend the capitalistic model and the way our society works  to ensure a sustainable future and how humans are conditioned to perceive the world through the lens of their egos and how to try to get away from that to see the world more truthfully. Those are good starting topics to get to know each other! Or do you want to talk about what you had for breakfast, how much you hate your boss or that new pair of trousers you bought ? However if you want to come up to strangers and ask random unexpected questions together and see how they react I’m well up for that \n\nPsychedelics, philosophy, eastern religions, psychology, literature, poetry, contemplative neuroscience, mindfulness i guess are my primary areas of interest. I don’t want to come off as snobby or pretentious, I’m pretty clueless to be honest  and just love learning - and the more I learn the more I realise how little I know. I just love talking and hanging out with ENTPs! \n\n

2	Good luck, don't get yourself trapped with a murderer, update us!
2	to me this is funny because I think of MBTI as where I have the meta-conversation about People in My Life not as a place to actually meet people or begin relationships, lol. I prefer being the only one in my friend group who knows about MBTI so I can secretly analyze them and then complain about them on the internet than actually talk with em about how wonderful it is that they're intuitive like me or something lol
1	Which gender haha?
1	Mbti for relationships ? Are you sure ?
1	Good luck man.\n\n👍
1	NO
10	What are some ENTP stereotypes that you simply don’t relate to?	The title says it all, lol. I’m just wondering what are some stereotypes that you don’t relate to and don’t really understand? Maybe you do understand but just don’t relate?
24	Arguing/Debating. I did this a lot when I was a teenager but now I’ve come to realize that there’s no point in “debating” with anyone who isn’t an NT.  People get exhausted and over that shit real fast and no one is going to take your opinion seriously if you constantly argue/debate and flip flop from one thing to the next. I like having *discussions* with people where we can come to an understanding of one another’s ideas- I don’t like to argue. \n\nWhen people push me to the point that I’m mindlessly arguing, it genuinely frustrates me(happened sometimes as a teen. Not really anymore). I once had an INFJ friend who *always* felt the need to set me off and get me into this ranty argumentative mode. I disliked it but just couldn’t fucking stop because he would trigger (yes TRIGGER)  the fuck out of me with his silly idealistic absolutes and it would drive me nuts. You know that feeling when someone scrapes something against a chalk board? That’s what hearing an INFJ bitch and whine in Ni “this is the absolute truth” style and telling me I’m\nwrong with out explanation is like. He turned me into someone I hated whenever I was around him. \n\nOther NTs are the only types that I feel inclined to just verbally let loose on because I *know* they can take it and I know they’ll be on the same page as me or at least be able to understand my blunt perspective. Other types? Not so much. You really just gotta know your audience and figure out the best way of communicating with them.\n\n
11	Being easy-going, optimistic and easy to get along with.\n\nIt was true when I was younger, but nowadays people fucking drain me. I have no interest in getting to know so many of them. The moment I see something offputting in a person I discard them completely, sometimes even before they speak a thing. I can be a fucking party killer in worst cases, throwing shit at the group of fun-having people I just hate for having certain stupid interests.
12	Trolling and manipulative behavior.  I don't think it has much to do with empathy.  Rather, something more like integrity/honor.
11	Not remembering birthdays/names. I know it's not a big thing, but I usually tend to remember little relevant pieces of information about people, for further use. Most people tend to react nicely when you remember their birthday or their favorite color :)
10	Definitely manipulative behaviors, not having emotional depth, and "never being wrong"/ not capable of admitting when I'm wrong.  Those are all stereotypes that I absolutely hate, and they are also assumptions made by others who clearly don't understand me or even know me as a person at all.  Yes, I tend to read people very well, and therefore I can figure out how to work best with them. However, I dealt with some incredibly toxic, manipulative people growing up, and because of that, I am always taking a step back to make sure I'm not exhibited anything anywhere near this kind of behavior. \n\nAs for emotional depth, I have found that I am way more in tune with my emotions than a lot of people I've talked to. This is a developed skill, and although I hide what I feel from most people, I honestly feel A LOT and things really do affect me emotionally.  However, I only open up and share my feelings with people I really trust. \n\nLastly, what angers me more than anything is people who tell me "you never admit when you are wrong".  That is just false.  But somehow the act of denying a complete falsehood is evidence that I am guilty?  The people who say that are the people who never choose to listen to what the other person has to say, so this is a good way for them to trap that other person. It's really an awful thing to do. (And yeah, I admit when I'm wrong, but frankly, I'm not wrong a lot because I don't make a lot of absolute declarations; I just discuss things.) I do apologize a lot though, because I never want to make people feel uncomfortable or upset. 
8	According to the stereotypes ENTPs seem really superficial. But in practice I‘d expect them to be deep-thinkers.
12	All the focus on school, studying, learning.   All the sites say ENTP likes to think a lot about abstract concepts. I’d rather just get out, meet people and experience life than be stuck in a library reading some dumb book that isn’t even relevant. 
6	Probably the biggest one is being - amoral isn't *quite* the right word, but not really having a moral centre. I totally get why this is a stereotype and growing up, I did relate to it a lot more. However, I absolutely have a moral centre and care a great deal about the world around me. It makes me a bit sad that the stereotype of ENTPs is that we're so self-centered as to not care about issues like poverty, racism, climate change, etc., or to be totally agnostic wrt all those issues. \n\nHowever, I do approach the above-noted issues a bit differently from your typical Fi-doms, insofar as I tend to arrive at my moral conclusions via reason rather than emotion. Obviously, there's always going to be an emotional aspect of it - but what I mean is that some people seem to feel their moral convictions from deep in their toes or whatever, and it's not like that for me at all. I have to read a lot and go through a process of refining things before I can "confirm" whatever moral spark of a feeling I might have. Even then, I find myself much more easily swayed by opposing viewpoints. That's probably the more ENTP-esque spin on it.\n\nIn any case, I do try to speak up about issues I care about, as well as volunteer a certain amount of money/time/energy to them. My life would feel far emptier if I only focused on my own needs.
2	Doing poorly in school/not trying hard. I'm very determined to score top marks.
2	Being emotionally absent or that we somehow feel emotions less. \n\nNow, I realize that we can be immature emotionally, especially if they have underdeveloped Fe, but that certainly doesn't mean we feel less - I could argue that we feel more intensely than someone who knows to healthily deal with it instead of bottling it up, putting it in a box, and saying 'It's fine!.'\n\nBut I also think that anyone can grow emotionally, to whatever extent that they want. Being emotional and emotionally mature is an entirely different thing than making decisions based on feeling and irrational, biased preference. I also think that feelers can learn to think more with their head - what T vs F seems to mean is which comes naturally and which makes the most sense to you (correct me if I'm wrong though.)\n\n&#x200B;
2	The obnoxious jerk stereotype. I think that's a function of immaturity and unchecked narcissism. 
2	Procrastinating. Being messy. Debating, where I feel a little dirty afterwards, or uncomfortably testosteron-y. I do feel the itch to point out faults in logic or offer Ne-suggestions to people's plans/goals, but only do so if I believe they would appreciate the input, which is not that often, at least not IRL.
1	I am the LEAST outgoing ENTP. Don't get me wrong, I love talking to people. However, knowing the people around me, I just do not vibe with others easily. Mostly though, like many people, it takes time to know who I really am.
3	My journey through findind a will to live.	This is probably going to be a longer post and what I aim to do is summarize my life since a little kid and finding the meaning of all this non-sense.\n\nSo I thought about telling this story in an epic flashback cut to past - cut to present style but then I simply decided to tell it chronologically.\n\n5-6 years old: That was the first time the idea of "nothing matters. There's no meaning popped into my mind" but since I was just a little shit I couldn't really comprehend so I just shrugged it off.\n\nThe rest until 12 years old: I was a pretty good christian boy. Really kind, god-loving / fearing whatever. The meaning of life was pretty much chosen for me. Didn't really care much about it either. I remember that everytime I thought about existential shit like that I'd always get a dark/bizarre feeling like something was lurking in the shadows. Also I considered suicide as immoral / a sin/ a coward move basically all the christian morals.\n\n12 years old: After intensive research and meditation (not the literal one, I call mediation just overclocking my mind mind and thinking about problems/things etc. - kind of brainstorming but it's pretty hardcore ) I finally decided that I'm an atheist - I could make a post twice as long as this about this subject but since I want to go to bed early tonight ( gotta get tonight's work done tomorrow morning) I'm going to keep it short. My values took an 180 degrees turn and I realised two huge things. 1- What the hell is meaning of life then? 2. I got depression, but actually not - at least not in a medical way.\n\nSo these two goings go hand in hand and have shaped my life up until today. If I have no meaning, then I get "depressed" and If I get depressed I tend to notice people that are also "depressed". I say "depressed" because neither I or they were actually, maybe an irrational depression. And if I look at them, begging for attention and saying that they want to kill themselves some kind of feeling starts crawling up my spine. Something powerfully epic, like a will to live - a will to show all those fuckers that I'm better than them. That I won't be rolling on the ground begging for mercy. I will stand tall and flex on them. I call it will to flex - aka my only will to live. \n\nBasically my whole life I lived to show others that I'm great and they're less. I never bragged or actively did it loud. I also found that pathetic. I did it in silence because it's so much better when you show other how good you're without saying a word. You just do your thing. Now I'm not trying to brag because that's what idiots do. I'm just saying that the only thing that kept me getting out of bed was that other wouldn't and if I do it, then I'm better. \n\nThis gave me so much motivation I was ready to swim the English Channel if somebody came to me to brag about his gold swimming medal. Not that I'd be able to do it, but dying trying to achieve would've been better than hearing that person. \n\nAlso in my mind there was still no real meaning to life. Like I would've been alright with dying any moment now, it's just that I couldn't possibly give up. Not when there are 7 billion other people there. Dying before them would've been a big failure.\n\nNow this motivation kept for years and years. Well until this year. \n\nFor some unknown reason it all went away in December. I thought that was it. Depression finally cought up with me. I always knew I couldn't fight forever. It was time to accept my destiny. I still don't understand what happened. It's like I truly realised that life has no meaning and that nobody cares if you're better than them. That's where an identity crisis kicked in. Was I all this time begging for constant validation from people for being better? Now that nobody cares what am I supposed to do? \n\nI had a huge empty space inside me. But then when I felt nothing could go worse. I went out on a 3 days trip with some colleagues and I met a few new people. One of them was a pretty crazy ( in a good way) girl. By the end of the day she invited me to sleep together and the rest days were just as epic. One my craziest experiences ever. But then I got home and I lost almost all contact with her. It was pretty nasty, but at the same I also felt the flame fading out. The empty space that was filled by her was then emptied again and then... there was an even bigger hole left. That sucked and while I rationally moved on, there was still something in me holding on. Not the part of me that licked but something else. I would sometimes think of her and get a weird feeling. As if I was looking for reasons not to like her. \n\nWell life's pretty shit for next month, but then. I get some news, that changed everything. She got a boyfriend. And for some whatever strange reason that made the happiest I was in the past month. Finally a strong enough reason to move on, I guess. I was free. And on top of that, my will to flex came back. It was as if I was reborn. \n\nAnd now I'm a changed a man. My will to flex / live it's not as strong as before. But I can see it growing back with time. I know I can get it back. It's the only thing I have left and if I lose it I lose it all. 
3	I need to end my reddit binge so I'll keep it short. Try living for others. Be kind, stop trying to live your own life for you or what you believe. Get money so you can give and take away the worry from your family, loved ones, get them out on holidays, be the driving force for everyone to have the best, nicest, worry free time, maybe find something else to believe in as well, save the environment? Also your 'meditation' kinda sounds the opposite, it's not meant to be focused brain storming to solve problems, just let your mind rest, be in the moment, then you can let it wonder and if issues, things to solve, or solutions come up, just observe what your mind thinks, don't go into problem solving mode, don't cling to ideas that come into your head, don't make them be who you are, just observe. The brain in the background spits out 10 thoughts a second, you hear some of them, a lot of them are bullshit, treat them as news articles to checkout and think on, not who you are.\n\nAlso family friends, giving, love is very important, without religion you'll need to find yourself a new purpose, that and something else would be ideal, something fulfilling, something you care about, surely there's something, just try and solve that, whether through creativity, could be good for you, if looking to flex on people a lot take up some art form, music, anything. Or decide to help major global issues, like the environment, or something local. I don't think there's a meaning to it all as you say, you gotta find your own meaning, make everyone the happiest possible and tackle problems in the world. 
3	>The rest until 12 years old: I was a pretty good christian boy. \n\nYour life isn't so different from mine.\n\n>Basically my whole life I lived to show others that I'm great and they're less. \n\nHidden Agenda: To Be Loved.\n\n>It's the only thing I have left and if I lose it I lose it all. \n\nCorrect! In the end, we all only have ourselves.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
3	The meaning of life isn't to be better than anyone - even though you inevitably will be - it is to improve as much as possible from where ever you started. \n\nIn some ways, a life full of hardship and responsibility is the most precious and meaningful, because you and others can learn a lot from it. \n\nA baptism of fire if you will, can forge the best of us. Often the best of us are so **because** they didn't start from much and have an amazing perspective. 
2	Survey on personality and Flirting behaviors	Hey I am a doctoral Student at a University in the South. I am studying flirtation behaviors, specifically trying to catalog specific flirting behaviors taken from several experimental studies. Thank you in advance for taking the time to take the survey there is an opportunity to win a gift card if the entire survey is completed. You can back out at any time.\n\nHere is the link to the survey\n\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JMQP5PJ
3	That was SO long.
262	I​ bet this dude was an ENTP	
39	I disagree! 
7	Fi (ExFP): Teaching others by one's own personal relation to situations\n\nTi (ExTP): Teaching others according to logical truth\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is no logical truth here; but there is here.
7	https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4kvbhh/what_type_is_michel_de_montaigne/
3	I have two thoughts:\n\n1.  There's no conversation more of a waste of time than one where nobody comes to a final useful decision from it.\n\n\n2. There's no conversation more pointless than one where we don't mutually arrive at truth 
2	Sounds more like an FP type of quote.
1	He is not, but hes essais ar Awsome and u should read them, also big ass book, so it will keep u entertained for a while.
1	Imagine being the only republican in a liberal arts college film program - passively listened to many boring conversations, but when appropriate, took part in some of the most entertaining conversations. 
1	The word discussion should replace conversation in this quote, and it would work a lot better. Is it not a refreshing experience to find like-minded people in conversion? 
1	I dont think so what if the conversation went like a 12 angry men conversation ?\n
9	Take on Stoicism?	r/stoicism\n\nI’ve found stoicism super helpful and awesome way to overcome the fear of ENxPs. \n\nWhat do you guys think? \n\n
3	I think it’s suited to NTs especially since we naturally try to rationalize everything anyway.  And it is a true philosophical, thinkerly approach as compared to approaches which seem more suitable for Feelers, like meditation.  That is to say, it doesn’t require you mitigate your feelings , to relax and let things flow, to develop methods for calming yourself, to come to understand your motivations or “process” things.  \n\nIt just requires you to understand that you are the author of your own emotions. \n\n
3	[Isn't that the truth?](https://i.redd.it/bnm0q5w0tlj21.jpg)\n\nIf you like stoicism, check out Spinoza next. He wasn't a stoic but I think some of his thought is quite reminiscent of stoicism.
2	i've been practicing stoicism for over a year now. it's helped a lot with the emotional issues i have and with dealing with other people. it's helped me through a lot of trauma as well. It can enrich your life, if you let it to. lmao.
1	I like it if you can't tell.
5	IT auditor for entp?	What do you think of IT auditor job for an entp?\n\nGraduating this Aug, and I got an offer for IT auditor, but I also received offer for a IT consultant. \n\nWhich one is better for entp? \n\nIf I choose to go into auditing, can I still transition into consulting?
2	I am assuming this is for a cpa firm (correct me if im wrong). As an entp I believe IT consultant should fit you much better than IT auditor. I had an internship for IT consulting over the summer and I loved it. It included only a few boring work (documentation), but the rest of the work was very interesting. It has alot of out of the box thinking where your essentially trying to break the clients system and recommend them solutions. IT auditor is pretty similar but includes alot more documentation and is very more structured which would be boring to us ENTPS. 
1	IT consultant for sure... IT auditor sounds boring...
26	Not a single ENTP to be found on here. I’m so proud of this community rn	
33	You expect entps to stick with a hobby?
26	Maybe ENTP serial killers are too good that they never caught one ;)
11	I've picked up "murdering people" as a hobby a few times but I always move onto another hobby before carrying out anything illegal 
5	Dude, murder sounds like a lot work, and prison sounds even worse! I'm sure the online tools search will be one of the 80 unread tabs they have open, and probably end up closing browser for that chrome update they've held off for 2 weeks anyway.
5	I make people want to kill me, they don't make me want to kill them.
3	It's interesting to me how many sensing types are on this list. 
4	Ok kids stay away from ESTPs ISTPs ISTJs and ISFPs
3	Murdering people sounds like too much work and like something that would just make me paranoid about being caught for the rest of my life. No thanks, lol?
2	Holly Hayes from Quora doesn't know what she's talking about most likely
2	I would honestly say we're more of the kind to catch them, rather than becoming one..
1	> I also typed a few surviving victims out of curiosity (ex. Jaycee Dugard, Elizabeth Smart, Shawn Hornbeck). They were all xxFJs.  \n\nNice to know I have a fighting chance! 
5	Are you a Technical or a Domain expert?	As ENTP we enjoy being the experts but at the same time we are big ideas people that struggle with tiny implementation details. \nAre you guys more like a technical expert like a specific developer with years of experience? Or are you more of an expert in one domain like for example healthcare consulting? What do you enjoy?\n\nThanks I have to decide where to go with my career now...
2	I think being a domain expert is more natural for us (if we really can get to certain level of expertise), but technical career is just about do-able. I can easily see it as a struggle for an average ENTP, unless you take care of a couple things.\n\nI went for technical myself. Graduated from IT studies, but I almost tried to drop out once I got to know how a typical programmer work looks like. I was scared of routine working hours. I was scared of becoming just a small part of a large machine that cares only about working implementations, with very little creativity to be used.\n\nI didn't go to work for a regular company however. I went for mobile games business in a startup thing, with only 5 people involved. I immediately got the possibility to create, brainstorm every part of any game we tried to put out. I was as much a programmer as a technical consultant, with sometimes full weeks spent by the drawing boards, talking game design. It was, and still is, so much fun. Detailed implementation still is a part of my job, but I get through it just because these are games, you see the results in a fun way, and those are the results YOU proposed. Some days are harder, I still tend to have motivation issues when it comes to implementation. But not as much as I would have if I were to work for any bigger company, just coding almost brainlessly some big ass product I do not care about, and I do not get to design.
2	I used to do development as an app developer for a large organisation - wasn’t the greatest at it but best consulting back to the business and understanding the user experience.\n\nFrom there I moved up pretty quickly to consultant, followed by director - the reason for this jump was due to me focussing learning on cutting edge (mobile, ai, design thinking, etc) as each emerges and is yet to be understood by the majority of people and still need high level concepts explored by the market.\n\nI’ve helped form company direction off of this and invent whole new products / markets - my next move is to hopefully work for myself.\n\nAlways keep domain expertise on bleeding edge and you’ll be fine. Leave the already well understood systematised stuff to the NTJ’s :)
1	We are ideas people who have crush on technical people (NTJs).\n\nIn a way, we like to dream about being technical but when it comes to actually being one we are like "ew"\n\nSource: Lazy ENTP forcing himself to learn Technical Analysis
1	I do sales! Argue for your company nicely, grandiosity is a plus with our big ideas. Then every few years after you become an expert in one field you get to change jobs, get paid more and spend the next couple years becoming an expert in something else. \n\nIt’s especially awesome when you have a good product or service that genuinely helps people.\n\nCold calls are rough when you’re new, but Business to business sales can be really awesome. After 10 years you become an expert in a bunch of things :) 
1	What’s the difference?  Expertise in any form requires experience and knowledge.  \n\nDo you mean a one trick pony compared to a jack of all trades?\n\nIndustry wants one trick ponies.  Academia requires Jack of all trades.  
5	ENTP or just a Highly Sensitive Person? This article feels like it was literally written for me	
8	I think any Myers-Briggs type could possess these traits. They'd just manifest in different ways.

16	INFJ with ENTP best friend, how can I support you?	Hey so i’m new to this subreddit but I really need your guys help. I’m an INFJ (F) and have recently (past month) become REALLY close with this ENTP (F). The more i’ve begun to talk to her and the more she begins to trust me, she has started opening up a lot more. \n\nI’ll keep it short but from what I can gather I believe she has (or had) depression and has cut herself in the past. I feel the main overarching problem is she feels misunderstood and she wants someone to care and understand her even when she may not understand why she feels the way she does. I think the people in her life have been shitty and have betrayed her so she’s reluctant to open up and talk to people. Lastly, she thinks she’s an awful person, that how she thinks and feels is “bad”, that everyone thinks she’s so mean (which isn’t the case). I CAN SEE she really cares about the people around her AND THAT SHE IS AN AMAZING PERSON but she can’t see herself that way. \n\nShe’s kind of lost all hope on trying to feel better because “nothing works”. No one listens to her. She keeps saying that “nothing changes” no matter who she opens up to. She’s rejected the idea of going to therapy because she doesn’t want to open up to a stranger and she feels stupid. \n\nIt really really hurts me to see her like this. All I want to know from you guys is how can I support her through all of this, how can I help her trust me and get her to know that I won’t betray her and lastly,what should I suggest to help her deal with her problems? \n\nI know that is kind of a lot but any advice would be appreciated, I just want to understand her more and care for her :) \n\n*Sorry if this is a bit of a mess I’m very tired and I typed this on my phone 
8	Wife is an INFJ, I am an ENTP. Whenever I got extremely down. She would see me down and get upset. She would start to tear up and tell me how it breaks her up knowing that I felt the way I did. That killed me. To know someone had that kind of internal conflict given my emotions. I'm pretty black and white. I think that individual emotions are that person's burden so my wife throwing the care bear stare at me was truly different. I feed off arguments and debates, so when she just sits there and tears up, I realize I am being completely rational, but that doesn't mean Im not being an asshole. Hope this helps! Good luck. Listen to her and show her how you feel about her, that genuine interaction should help. Also I would tell her to focus on the positive relationships and for me, I just always research. I know that knowledge will succeed where people fail, and that excites me to share that information with everybody.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Spelling.
3	Try to be practical in your advice, get her out of the house and into places where there’s people and good atmosphere. 
3	First of all: you can't fix her, and it's not your job to.\n\nI'm a "fixer" myself, so I know how it feels. You know how wonderful the person's life could be if they saw things the way you do. You try to show them how wonderful, how capable they are. But they don't see it.\n\n> have recently (past month) become REALLY close with this ENTP (F)\n\nIn my opinion, a month is not long enough to become close to someone in a healthy way. Trust takes time. \n\n> She’s kind of lost all hope on trying to feel better because “nothing works”. No one listens to her. She keeps saying that “nothing changes” no matter who she opens up to. She’s rejected the idea of going to therapy because she doesn’t want to open up to a stranger and she feels stupid.\n\nIf she's chronically negative, and your relationship consists of emotional support, that's not healthy. \n\nIf you guys do fun things together, and you only occasionally dig into the emotional problems, that's fine. But if you're her therapist, that's not fine.\n\n\nQuestion: Do you have a normal friendship, or are most of your conversations about her problems?
2	First step, be awesome, I think you have that part covered, once we think you're awesome we will naturally seek your affection, step two, give said affection, but not so obviously where we have to obviously show affection back in order to accept this affection although that part does highly depend on how close you two are, we're not close with most people though, so you gotta play step two by ear, but yeah that's it, also we entp's are terrible with emotion advice even when it's about our own emotions... lol
2	she is lucky having such a great friend like you. i wish i had the same :')
2	great to see that there are people who still care about other people!\n\nYour question essentially is (correct me if I'm wrong):\n\n>How can I help my depressed ENTP friend?\n\nhehe, tricky question, one of my best friends (ENTP) has been depressed for years and I can tell you one thing:\n\nDon't even try to come up with arguments on why my / whoevers life doesnt suck.\n\nIdk about other types, but it doesnt work like that on ENTPs. "Show, don't tell" is btw a really great quote that fits here, too. If you want to help, make the life better, which you already seem to do. But don't try argue, not because it makes him / her upset (ok cant speak for other people here tbh), but because ENTPs usually a somewhat talented at finding things that support their point of view. Devils advocate etc bla bla. That was the way I tried it for the friend I was talking about and yeah.. didnt help =D\n\nIt eventually went from posting suicide notes as a WhatsApp Status (too see who would care?) to being a partly functioning human being by itself.\n\nGive it time, right now I'm once again in a depressed state, but I'm aware of it and cope with it mostly by remembering that it will get better eventually.\n\nDoesn't help my "feelings", but atleast my head is shutting up. Yeah, it sucks that I'm not doing anything productive atm but I just have to sit it out. Having negative thoughts and telling myself that I suck wont help and having this mindset of "it will get better" really helps with not having that happen.\n\nWhat actions of other people have helped ME the most?\n\nI don't want to sound like an asshole here, but I mostly got through depression and similar things by myself I'd say. What has helped me is writing down my feelings (yeah, it's embarrassing but I sometimes have these) or talk about them with other people. But it's very hard finding the right people for that. \n\nListening to me / my problems / my bullshit (=D) is what really helped me, but I understand that not everybody is willing to do that. \n\nHmm, my whole answer resolved around what I did (which makes me want to delete the whole roman and start all over lol, but going to stick to it now, maybe it helps), not really what someone else can do. I'll try again:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOk, what exactly can YOU do RIGHT NOW?\n\n\- and this is exactly where I stopped writing and continued to watch The Expense.. I'm sorry, ENTPs are really not that helpful lmao. My best advice is to just continue doing what you're doing already, you seem like a very supportive friend, which is great. Maybe she doesnt know how to show it, but I'm sure she deep down really appreciates that.\n\n\- guess this is going to end up at - 10 votes because there's literally nothing helpful in it, maybe it atleast was a nice read (the hope dies last). Guess I'll fuck off now, have a great evening! =)

4	My math teacher is probably brain dead.	So I have this math teacher supposedly a stereotypical ISTJ, but let's leave that aside since I hate judgeing people by some "type" that's more or LESS actually relevant. \n\nSo this guy probably around 65 years old is a complete moron that won't understand a thing I'm telling him. In math class I'm usually brainstorming for new ideas and methods of solving problems faster so of course I tell him about my "discoveries" - more of common sense things that I'm sure I'm not the first one to find them - to which he either seems unimpressed or tries to prove me wrong. I usually show him that I'm right and then he just simply acts like nothing happened and goes further. Once he was teaching a new way of solving problems ( a very inefficient one, not even in the official school curriculum not that it matters anyhow) and to prove / demonstrate how it works he calls me up to solve it at the board. I start solving it with a different - more efficient method, I also explained what I was doing but he sent me back to my bench. Apparently there's only one of solving problems now....\n\nToday we got into a pretty long discussion which he ended because he simply had no arguments left. He closed something along the lines of: "God I've had enough of these theoreticians!" Yeah, I admit most of my ideas are just theoretical, but isn't all mathematics theoretical? Like don't come to me and say that equations are so god damn practical. \n\nHe also emphasizes a lot on theories and formulas so that goes against of what he said. He expects us to memorize formulas without undestanding them first and when he asks me for formulas and I start deducing them from other formulas he starts telling to stop that because in the real life you won't have time to do that. WHY THE FUCK WOULDN'T I HAVE TIME TO DO A 20 SECONDS THING THAT SAVES ME FROM FRYING MY BRAIN CELLS BY MEMORIZING THINGS LIKE A ROBOT? \n\nOn top of that he emphasizes a lot on calculus. On a test in which I completely solved a problem he gave me absolutely no points for that because I messed up a little calculus at the end. Why? Because "In the real life the only things that matter are the results" well in the real life you can use calculators you dickhead. \n\nI feel like standing in his presence makes my brain cells die. A lot of my colleagues have the same opinion but I'm the only that's actively fighting against him. 
8	> I'm sure I'm not the first one to find them - to which he either seems unimpressed or tries to prove me wrong\n\nThat’s how math works ;)\n\n> I start solving it with a different - more efficient method\n\nWithout knowing the specifics, I can pretty much guarantee whatever method you came up with wasn’t better.  It might be better in some cases, but it might not generalize to other future topics.  You need perspective to see such things which students being students don’t have. \n\nSo even if your teacher is really run of the mill, I doubt you’ve discovered anything useful....because whatever math you’re doing has been well understood for centuries and all the good methods worked out. \n\nFrom a teacher’s perspective, you’re probably a pain in the ass...because in being a “special case” you eat up his time and distract the class.  \n\nIf you’re really interested in math, then you have practically infinite resources available to you to learn.  Since your school work is easy for you (right?) you can just quickly toss off the homework the way the teacher wants it done (which is how you get an A) and then use that free time to teach yourself something more advanced (which is how you learn).\n
7	As someone who's taught classes, I'm gonna want to hear the instructors position. Because students have a habit of straight up not understanding what the instructor is saying, and instead blame all their woes on the evil prof. 
5	So what do you want? Advice on how to deal with him or are you just ranting? \n\nThere's probably not much you can do. He's dead set on his own methods and apparently you can't convince them that your alternative approaches have any merit (whether that means he's close-minded or you simply have no idea of what you're doing is irrelevant). The best you can do is finish your course work and hope you get a better teacher next year.
5	Too bad this isn't r/amitheasshole, because I really want to comment "YTA" and move on.\n\nYou sound like you're a tiny child, and your teacher has every right to be annoyed by you. There's most likely a very valid reason *why* he wants you to solve the problems using a particular method. You found a shortcut? Cool! Good for you! Talk to him AFTER CLASS.\n\nFrom his perspective, you probably seem like you're wasting precious class time by making and sharing your "discoveries," and your behavior could also be interpreted as showing off. The dude's probably just trying to get through the lecture and teach the method which is beneficial to the most students. If he's actually 65, then dude's been around the block a few times. I'm going to take a wild stab and guess that HE PROBABLY *IS* TEACHING YOU THE BEST METHOD. For him to demonstrate a method of solving a problem and for you to go to the board and solve it a completely manner is just... disrespectful. Master the method he prefers, and *then* demonstrate your own method.\n\nEven if you're right, even if your method *is* more efficient, you should discuss your ideas/discoveries/alternative methods for solving equations during his office hours... not waste class time by confusing other students/going off on tangents with your ideas.\n\nI don't mean to sound like I'm discouraging questions. Questions = good. If you have a legitimate question, ask it! But don't try to *explain* your ideas during class time. Please. Both for your professor's sake, and for the sake of the other students who are most likely having a difficult enough time mastering just one method of solving the problem.\n\nSorry if I misunderstood your post.
3	Possibly, but there's also probably more than one perspective going on here.\n\nHe could also just not be interested.
3	One of my best friends is a teacher, and a damn good one at that. He happens to teach in an intuitive way, and loves it when students have their own ideas. I expect you would enjoy being taught by him.\n\nOn the other hand, some students can't stand not being told what to think, which is the reverse of your problem.\n\nThe reason why my friend carries on with his intuitive style is that he teaches mainly top sets at a good school, and often most kids can keep up.\n\nOn the other hand, to be an effective teacher to the majority of students (70% are sensors), the best strategy is to teach sensor style, and drum in the base level curriculum to get the grades.\n\nNow, I'm not saying that you are necessarily in the right in this case, or that he is a good teacher. What I am saying is that you shouldn't expect teachers to teach in the way you like. Even intuitive teachers may teach sensor style to help the majority of kids.\n\nI wouldn't want this guy as my teacher as a kid either, but this is how it is, he's just doing his job, and to him you're just a hungover tweeny throwing up on aisle three.
2	Any math that you learn in a class is just a tool for science and finance (thus the focus on calculus, and memorization). Trying to make it into something other than what it is, is likely wasting time. Time that can be spent on a legitimate interest in mathematical theory -- you have the internet and universities at your disposal to learn about such things.\n\nAnd as far as your behavior, You are being a dick to everyone else in the class who is just trying learn application and get their cert, and a giant distraction to them and your prof/teacher. If you think you have come across something new, write it down, talk to him about it after class, then if it is legitimate share it with your classmates.\n\nQuestions are good, but if you go into a theoretical field know that most profs will not allow you to interject in their class **at all**. Most of the time you will only be able to engage in exchanges with them through e-mail.
1	You may not like him. But just leave him alone. I agree with others that you don't have to waste time on countering his teaching methods. People are what people are. Like you, I would appreciate more if a professor or teacher acknowledge that I found my own ways of solving a problem. But that's all. It's not something I expect them to accommodate me on outside of homework and tests, where everything is solved on paper and as long as you have the right answer on that paper with a mathematically correct method, you're good to go (at least it's like that where I go to college). Of course there are many ways to solve a problem. Some you will find easier to follow and some others will appreciate more. Just let the teacher do his job to teach the preset ways to the class. It'll be over and you'll move on to other teachers. You don't have to like the way he teaches. After all, you can mold the information that the teacher throws at you in any way that's easy for YOU to understand. That's how you learn anyway. As for the rest of the class, that's how they'll have to deal with it too, as everyone is a little different in the way they learn. I always liked to solve math problems my own way, but would only offer help to those struggling to understand the teacher. Use what you know and learn to help others. That would be a good way to spend your time on rather than fighting with your teacher.
2	Onegin	Can you type Onegin (Puskin)?\n\nI think he is an ENTP/INTP or maybe an INTj, but\n I might be wrong\n
1	I don’t think he’s an N at all.  He’s a disaffected Sensor.  I would guess ISFP who has lost the hedonistic zeal with which they pursue life. 
113	hmmmmmm...	
30	Ergo: Fear of relationships.
13	You can find the same completion for all the N-types. This isn't because these fears are unique to N-doms, it's because people who make these searches (which google bases its algorithm off of) never identify as STJs, which is why those completions turn up blank. It's why the STP and SFJ and SFP results also don't turn up many auto completions (and when they do, it's one of the four your image shows). Don't believe me? Try "ISTJ fear of" and see what pops up\n\nIn other words, this is just generic teenage searches, where the teenagers are almost exclusively identifying as N-doms. It also explains why, at the moment of this comment, this post has 17 pts (with an avg of 100% upvotes...) This actually gives me an idea: I wonder if Google's stats holds the keys to identifying mistypes.
6	I think thats 4 which is actually 2:\n\n1.  The fear of intimacy is derived from the fear of rejection. \n\n2. The fear of commitment is derived from the fear of failure. 
3	What is this? A crop for ants?

2	I don't know, man. Don't recognise myself in any of these.
2	Yep
2	hmm, can't really relate to any of these

2	The more I’m on this sub, the more I feel like I’m not an ENTP, despite my friends reading the 16 personalities description and telling me I’m exactly what they’re describing... why...?
1	This is way too real 
1	........... Fuck.
1	Oooof I did not need this. 
1	My greatest fear is jumping spiders.
1	You see this a lot, but once you grow past it these issues turn into strengths, since you end up being relatively skilled at understanding people. 
1	Fear of even acknowledging our feelings have *some* relevance 
4	What are ways to increase your general brainpower, IQ and fluid intelligence?	Used to be ‚gifted’ earlier in my life and have skipped a grade, still in the top 5% academically now. \nHaving an existential crisis because I feel like I can’t grasp concepts anymore the way I used to. I have also become less creative due to the fact that I do 0 work and just copy shit from the Internet. \nAlso I have recently done an IQ Test, showing that apparently I‘m not that intelligent.\nBTW i‘m shitty at natural sciences as well :)\n\nsoooooo how can I change this? I want my performance and mental aptitude back :/
7	Read. Also expose yourself to ideas that are a little beyond what you can understand. Repeated exposure to big ideas is what's required for eventual understanding. Podcasts are one way to do this. Choose subjects that are genuinely fascinating to you. Otherwise you won't be able to motivate yourself to finish the book/podcast. Also, since you're an ENTP, watch debates on YouTube. Legit debates, not two dum dum youtubers debating lame subjects. 
6	Try praying to God. I heard He answers all prayers. 
2	Cause:\n\n> I do 0 work and just copy shit from the Internet\n\nEffect: \n\n> I can’t grasp concepts anymore the way I used to\n\n> I have also become less creative\n\nYour mind is a muscle. If you let it atrophy, don't be shocked when you can't run a marathon. \n\n-----------------------------\n\nedit: grammar and clarity
2	Isn’t that putting the cart before the horse? \n\nYou can’t like train at improving future training. It doesn’t work like that.\n\nYou just have to train at the thing, and you’ll only get better at that thing.\n\nThe only catch-all improver is probably upping your exercise and diet, just generally having your blood getting around smoothly, etc.
1	Might just be a problem of motivation. It's way easier to learn things you care about. Find something you care about, get really good at it, and hope that there is carryover from that area into a more general knowledge base. For example, you could learn different areas of mathematics or physics by studying a musical instrument, or a car engine, and getting into the details of how it works. This has the added benefit of possibly teaching you an instantly useful skill along the way, instead of just gathering a bunch of theoretical knowledge that sits in the back of your head collecting dust. 
1	From what I know, fluid intelligence peaks when you are 25 years old. Not sure if that isn't that way anymore though.
1	Lean a new language, get that pile o' proteins going again. 
1	You said you're a high school senior, right? Are you sure you're not just feeling senioritis? I promise it goes away... only to come back in full force later, when you turn about 25.
3	Curious as to how some of y'all deal with a loved one, friend or lover who's being emotionally irrational.	Much like the title, how do you deal with someone close to you acting emotionally irrational, me personally I'll wait till they calm down and explain until they accept or understand. Been dealing with this a lot n lately from different friends and people in my life. Just curious how y'all deal with it. Or if it's even an issue to some of you folks. Initially I'm at a loss because 1 someone being so emotionally irrational over something I would never baffles me, 2 I don't want to add gas to the fire if it's someone I care about otherwise I'd be cold cut to the point.
6	I could have written this.  I'm going through this with one friend in particular.  In a way, it's not fair.  Why do I have to be the mature one who never gets upset?  Why do you get to pop off and I just have to wait for you to get over yourself?  I would never treat my friend the way she treats me when she gets easily offended and then treats me like an asshole for weeks.  Just tell me if something I did bothered you and then we can work it out.  \n\nI hope you find a way to deal with it better than I have.
2	My way of dealing with irrational overly emotional people is by ignoring them until they calm down. There's no point in arguing with people that are unwilling to consider that their perspective is wrong ("feelings are always right"), so why bother? \n\nUsually, the best you can do is trying to make them explain why they feel a certain way. Guide them to the solution to their problem so they think they fixed it themselves. Usually works well for me. \n\nIf being emotionally irrational is their default state, I just don't argue with them at all. I have some friends that are like that. We get along well but there's just one topic you really shouldn't touch because they can't think objectively about it if their life depends on it. \n\nMy solution? Nod and smile, point out their bullshit and make it clear that I'm not wasting my time any further. \n\n\n
1	It’s hard to answer this. It really depends on the circumstance 
1	Agree with them, ignore them, or get angry. Trying to give reasonable solutions doesn’t work with unstable emotional people. If you want them on your side, choose their side on the issue and offer comfort. If you don’t feel like dealing with it, then just stay the fuck out of it. Getting angry and shutting people down can work but it’s just as likely to create more problems. 
1	I'm very blunt, but I try to be understanding.\n\n"It sounds like you feel this because that? If so I understand where you're coming from, and I think it's okay to feel the way you do. However, I think action xyz is irrational and likely contaminated by current emotion. I think consequences abc may arise, and my personal suggestions are to 123".\n\nBecause we're friends, I've never had an issue with this approach. It's pretty formulaic actually. Validate (I truly do understand why they feel the way they do, because I force them to explain the situation via questioning). Then I offer analysis (which they usually appreciate). I end with suggestions (and why i think xyz approach is preferred to abc approach). \n\nSometimes if they're still in distress I'll add a disclaimer that it's just my opinion, and I'll support them in whatever they do. Ive had situations like this where I've expressed disapproval over choices (which they respected), but I never thought less of them for these choices. so there must exist a baseline of mutual respect here. Gotta read the room before you give an "I told you so.." lol\n\nI've obtained a reputation for being extremely level headed, fair, and rational in helping friends under distress. Turns out I'm "socially dynamic" and a "good listener". 
3	ENTP mistyped as ENFP?	I've typed anywhere from INFP to INFJ to ENFP but I think I might be an ENTP...here's why:  \n\n\nI always seriously identified with ENFPs...I'm spontaneous...have 20 tabs open at the same time...mostly wikipedia usually. I fall for people in the course of 5 minutes...cry at movies...cry in general and all that jazz...I love helping people...I love memes and stuff like that...always been told I act like I'm on drugs (I'm not)...I'm fairly intense when it comes to personal relationships, both romantic and platonic...  \n\n\nBut my friend told me she thinks I'm more of an ENTP because of my quick wit, my love to just sort of be dominant and my love of arguing...and my ability to manipulate people if I want to. I was told when I was younger that I should be a lawyer.  \n\n\nI've always been good at manipulating people...which is a bad thing. I wouldn't say I'm a sociopath because I definitely have morals and I don't do immoral things just for the sake of personal gain or being immoral, but that doesn't stop the fact that I can manipulate people if I want to. Just because I can do something doesn't mean I like that about myself and doesn't mean I like doing it. I'm a good liar and a good actor.  \n\n\nThe other thing is that I love arguing. I can argue about literally anything simply for the purpose of arguing...I will also plow through peoples arguments with no regards to feelings if their argument has nothing to back it up. I will call out someone using appeals to emotions or basing arguments simply on emotion by presenting facts, even if it offends them and makes them hate me...I only feel bad after but during the time, I get so heated that I just don't give a flying puck.  \n\n\nI also think the world is pretty much doomed and everyone is shit until they prove otherwise and that most people are bad. I also am conservative which I was told isn't common for NFs. I do get along very well with INFJs though, which I was told isn't too uncommon for ENTPs OR ENFPs.  \n\n\nI'm also UBER competitive about almost everything, but I'm not a sore loser.  \n\n\nOpinion?
2	I think I agree with you. I’ve never known ENFPs to be manipulative, at least not intentionally. 
2	>I've always been good at manipulating people...which is a bad thing.\n\n>The other thing is that I love arguing.\n\nIn my opinion and my logic might be faulty but manipulation is not and should be assigned moral connotations. I know how its defined but I think that definition is wrong. As humans we manipulate each other and most of the physical items we interact all the time (with manipulation being defined as an action or "series" of actions that control or influence people and things.) Okay I got sidetracked my point is that you seem to use emotional and morally charged language \n\n>I can argue about literally anything simply for the purpose of arguing.\n\nI think as a T type you'd realize that most arguements don't come to any useful conclusions people don't go into an argument ready to have their mind or opinion changed people that are arguing are basically smacking each other with their opinions. Debate and discussion is more of what I believe T types should naturally gravitate towards because you go into those types of conversations open yo changing your opinion but more so you those types of conversation promote arriving to the most factual points, truthful or useful solutions opinions based on context and give you an opportunity to learn.\n\n> I get so heated that I just don't give a flying puck. \n\nTypically ENTP's aren't so attached to a certain view point that they get emotional about it because opinions have the possibility of being wrong or being flawed meaning that you have to remain open to being wrong and or corrected which typically doesn't happen if you get emotional about your arguments. \n\nIf some if things I say don't make sense tell me about it let's talk. \n\n\n
1	All of these things can be ENFP. 
1	Look at the functions, that solves everything 
1	You sound like an ESFP, not an ENFP or an ENTP.   At least I see more FiTe than TiFe.
1	Youre an ENFP. An ENTP wouldnt tell how and when he cries because it would make him seem weak. Also, ENFPs can manipulate too.
1	I don't think its uncommon to be on the border between two types, especially when its a single letter difference. Just say you're a bit of both.
5	Differentiating hypothetical future scenarios from “objectively” inevitable scenarios.	This is proving difficult for me to put into words, so bare with me, lol.\n\nSometimes I’ll fantasize about all of these great things I want to succeed in, all of these crazy cool things I want to do, etc. Some of which are clearly fantasy and truly are “Lol, that would be cool” are really just for kicks and giggles (even if I don’t think so in the moment). However, when I think of what will *realistically* happen based on how I’ve evaluated my personality, tendencies, upbringing, etc. I often see the outcomes not just as things I believe will happen, but things I think will inevitably happen based what I’ve realistically evaluated about my state of being.\n\nI often get intensely interested in weird hobbies that I get lost in because of a hypothetical life that I could see myself gaining from it. It gets to the point that it’s not just something I’m fantasizing about, but it’s something I *truly* think I COULD do if I threw myself into it...so I dip my toes in. However, while I’m thinking/acting upon about these crazy scenarios, I’m still going through the motions of what my “realistic” self will inevitability succeed in based upon what I’ve evaluated to be the “most likely” outcome.\n\nPersonal example: Based upon what I know about myself, what my tendencies as a person are, etc. I think it is inevitable that I will work in the entertainment industry- most likely Film/TV. This is already an inevitability in the making and has been for three years. I also think it is inevitable that I will do things related to screenwriting because I know myself well enough to know that this is what I would be best at and find the most interest in- all based upon “innate” curiosities stemming from my personality and past experiences.\n\nSometimes Ne takes hold and I get so focused and engrossed in a hypothetical scenario and it’s possibilities (Like idk...music) that I forget the inevitable scenario because to me it’s...well...inevitable. My mind basically says “Hey, this is gonna happen anyway...so I’m sure it wouldn’t hurt for you to try some other stuff out”. To me I *know* I will pull through in the end and even if I get caught up by something new, I will go back to the “inevitable scenario” by default since that’s what I think will realistically happen.\n\nOftentimes I will fail, do poorly at, or downright suck at the thing I hypothetically think I’d be great at. And while it’s disappointing and sometimes fucks with me mentally, I still find that my “inevitable” scenario has progressed to some degree anyway, thus affirming to me that it’ll happen just like I “knew” it would. \n\nBasically what I’m saying is that it seems as though while I get obsessed with novel, crazy things...I still succeed in my “realistic” goal by default even when I’m not focusing on it because it’s the most logical thing to happen based upon what I know about myself- and since it’s the most realistic thing to happen, I go through the motions of it while obsessing over some shiny new interest at the same time......\n\n....redundant but whatever.\n\nTo me, being a complete failure is as realistic as me thinking I’d be a kick ass world class botanist or something. I’ll obsess over it, see it as this crazy hypothetical that’s completely possible, but then sit back and go “Lol, nah. That’s not really what will happen based upon this, this, and that. I’ll probably just end up in film or something”. And what do you know? A month later I have two film jobs lined up and I’m just like “Wait...how exactly did I get here again?”. I’m trying not to make this sound like the most egotistical and narcissistic on the planet, but I don’t know how to explain it any other way- I mean, I probably could, but I don’t really want to restart.\n\nI’ve just noticed that some people always wonder why ENTPs wing it and do things last minute, and I think I’ve solved this question: It’s because we are truly, truly sure we will find a way in the end even if we fail time and time again because that’s just “What I’m good at anyway. So why not wing it? I’m still bound by my realistic self who I have analyzed as someone who will succeed regardless of what happens.”

A month later I have two film jobs lined up and I’m just like “Wait...how exactly did I get here again?”\n\nYou got there through grit, though, right? You got there because you hustled. Your inevitability is only inevitable because you worked hard to make it so.\n\nI think you should give yourself some credit. It's not like you've coasted to get where you are, unless I'm sorely mistaken.
1	Basically, you have faith in yourself, but then you worry about if you should.\n\nThe fact that you do both simultaneously **is** why you have such faith in yourself.\n\nI think it's generally better to have confidence than not. But the best kind of confidence to have is the kind of confidence which is kept in check by occasional doubt.\n\nNow, when it comes to results, confidence will help, but it's not the confidence that actually gets you results. \n\nConfidence is kind of like vitamins: you don't need to take them unless you have a deficiency, and they won't help if you take extra, they might even damage your health. The vitamins keep you in the game of life, but you still have to actually play it well to achieve something.\n\nSo what I'm saying is, congratulations, you aren't deficient in confidence. Now you need to actually do something without being hampered by lack of confidence. 
1	Ne is a funny little bitch. It will never stop. You know what's inevitable? Hypothetical cool scenarios coming in.\n\nWe want them. They're funnier to follow than the inevitable scenario. We already know the most likely scenario is going to happen, no fun in that. But wait! We actually can get lost in hypothetical future options, trying them out and losing time we could spend on ensuring the inevitable scenario to happen. The more we neglect the inevitable scenario, the more the inevitable scenario becomes an almost-inevitable. A hypothetical future. The fun scenario. Let's say it's inevitable to graduate from college, IT specialization. The most profitable scenario, and most likely to happen. Uh, no need to do anything, and it's so inevitable it's boring. But wait, there's a deadline tomorrow! We may fail! Our now-hypothetical future of graduation is fun again! Let's work a bit to push the already-not-so-inevitable scenario a bit closer to truly inevitable. Yay we succeeded! Well duh, again. Also, it's boring again. I am now certain to graduate and become a programmer. Let's now do other stuff. I mean, I could hypothetically be a professional League of Legends player now. Or a musician, or a supreme ruler of my own country where I give civil rights to dogs. The cycle repeats itself. We're having fun though.
1	Here a german saying, which I think fits here. „Everyone said: that doesn‘t work. Then somebody came who didn‘t know and just did it.“\n\nI think ENTPs are the types of people that „didn‘t know“ and just do it. For me I‘ve noticed many things I just winged because I didn‘t consider it a big deal, only after people telling me that I‘ve apparently accomplished sth big I realized what I did. Where I thought, why is it so weird for someone to be able to do this? Because the barriers most people create are just straight outta their imaginations. \n\nRealistically speaking why wouldn‘t you achieve your goals? I also beliebe i‘ll *just* achieve my goals, I just know it‘ll work out somehow, and if it doesn‘t, I always got a plan B, C, D, ... for my initial plan. One of them *will* work out. So I just focus on other stuff as you also said you do. What would keep me from doing both?
1	My life is exactly like this, lol. \n\nThe clearest example of an experience in my life is when I decide I’m going to go back to trading commodities or currencies. I’m really good at feeling the market if I just focus on one market and simply stare at the numbers as they come, no charts, no history, no news, just the last trade price. Unfortunately, this is soooo boring and my mind starts to try to figure out ways to predict the market movements by looking at anything and everything, soon I’m coming up with elaborate equations that need even more and more details, that never seem to work as well, or at all, as just paying attention to the last trade price, period. Luckily, I’ve recently started to understand this cycle much better in myself and don’t put any money, or very little, into these tangents of elaborated ideas. (Emotional investment can easily replace money in the above example, ie be careful investing too much emotional expectations into these tangents)\n\nThis cycle, that you describe very well, is common for us ENTP’s. Our Fractal way of thinking makes us who we are; ever exploring from our main branch, never completely finishing those tangent explorations, then coming back to our base branch, and luckily always being better off understanding the world around us and our main branch because of those tangent explorations.\n\nSometimes, though, those tangent branches of ideas actually become base branches. So you never should give them up...\n\nAnd now, if you would excuse me, I’m going to google up “fractal” & “mind” because I’m sure I just came up with a noble award winning idea that will change the world!!\n\nAs a side note: If you ever feel lost it’s because you are near the end of one of those explorations.... \n\n..,now what was I going to google....? Oh yeah, how to be funny at the end of posts....I think...lol or should it be lmao....is there something else other than lol&lmao....maybe I could invent something new!!!....
1	It’s funny how you post/comment some of the most retarded shit one moment, and then something well thought out the next moment.
7	Whats your guys' favorite drug, and how does it change your functions?	Weed:  Boosts my Ne and Ti to a ridiculous extent.  My boosted Ne gives me insane ideas and connections, then my Ti goes into overdrive hyper-analyzing each idea.  I think I actually get some Fi as well, as meaningful conversations/tv situations feel more 'touching,' I guess.  I'm actually high as I write this haha\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAmphetamine:  I'm prescribed 30 mg addy, and unfortunately, over time the addy high pretty much loses all of the euphoria.  Shit used to be so intense.  For me, Adderall destroys my Ne and Fe.  It significantly ups my Te and Ti, as well as a mild increase in Si.  Thus, addy means I'll be much quieter, intensely logical and actually sort of give a fuck about pointless rules.  Basically I turn into a non-impulsive, very productive ISTP.  Funny, because the other result I tend to get is an ISTP.  Tho, I bet a lot of ENTPs come off as ISTP when they're rly deep in thought.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlcohol:  Oh god, done some dumb ass shit with this one.  It destroys pretty much all of my introverted functions, aside from Fi.  It boosts my Ne *and* Se, significantly.  I can discuss dum ideas forever, but I'm just as likely to be found with the ESxPs dancing and playing pong.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCaffeine: When highly caffeinated, boosts Se.  I get an intense urge to sprint at full speed.  Makes me play *way* better in soccer games.  Also, I notice an increase in Fe, as caffeine makes me quite sociable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
7	LSD too keep me from becoming an asshole
4	DMT. I *love* debating with the clockwork elves. Usually they ignore me, sometimes they pass me to the next dimensional plane to get rid of me, but on those special times we just connect and the transfer of thought makes my logic feel completely irrational. Good stuff. I do it once a month 
3	I have written about this before on here... MDMA, it really helps me deal with my Fe, and with other peoples feelings in general. I have always struggled with the Fe being really opposed to my other functions, but on MDMA it is like they all work together. I have become much better at this an a adult without drugs, but I still have some issues with hiding my feelings rather than having them.\n\nI am a nurse I see a lot of death and have to compartmentalize it as part of my job, and while I have developed a good system for processing this part of my day-to-day, the yearly or so MDMA trip really helps me to get my shit out on the table that I keep deep down. 
3	LSD is my favourite drug. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot sure how it changes functions, still feeling the Ne + Ti when I'm tripping. I've had others say that they understand me more when they are tripping with me so maybe it amplifies the same in them. My Ti will always be analysing things, and looking for the logical conclusion for whatever I am experiencing whilst tripping. I don't really experience a connection to plants or anything like my Fi friends do, so I guess my type doesn't really change.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also like Amphetamine and use it on average once every 2 weeks. It definitely seems to draw my Si out, but not really my Te, I just feel like a more productive Ne dom that can now use Si lol, where generally my Si is dog shit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCaffeine again just makes my Ne crazy, and makes my Si a bit better.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlcohol is probably the only drug (that I have done) that seems to draw out what I would imagine Se to feel like. I do feel very in the moment and present, where most of the time I feel a bit scattered. I find alcohol is still more of an Ne + Fe combo when I am drunk, however.
3	Mushrooms. Gives a new perspective on EVERYTHING.\n\n"Why am i like... 50% legs!?"
2	Prescribed 30 mg XR adderall too, but I definitely think it makes me more INTJ or ENTJ. Ni is definitely pumpin
2	Cough medication, makes me really hyper aware of my surroundings but also sleepy, am an INTJ but become sorta ISFJ
2	Adderall turns me into an ENTJ. Same with Focalin, but I'm not nearly as mean as when I used to be on Adderall.\n\nLSD turns me into an ESFP and counteracts the after effects of being on the stimulants for too long. Microdoses preferred, normal doses are too intense.\n\nWeed turns me into an INFP, I don't really like it these days. I get too shy to function in an extroverted profession.\n\nBeing sober is probably the best these days. I usually just have a glass of wine if I do anything, or a microdose every once in a while.
2	I feel like weed, especially sativa stimulates Ne and introverted judging functions, alcohol and MDMA allow aspects of Fe to come more naturally/easily , caffeine boosts that Se game, coke still boosts the Se game but you also feel like a God and if you stay sober and responsible long enough you'll have a Si mastered 
2	Xtc in a good way. Speed in a bad way.
2	i used to have a major thing for ecstasy. i normally am a person who had extreme highs and lows and ecstasy made me really happy and feel super intense. 
0	Don't do drugs kids. Smh I get high off life itself
13	I have way too many activities	Dear fellow ENTPs,\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**I have way too many activities.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am 23 y.o, I have a degree in french and anglo american law and I've recently started a sound engineering school (I agree that they don't make sense together but I truly love both).\n\nSince I was little, I found myself being over curious about \*too\* many things.\n\nI compose music and master my own songs on softwares like Ableton, Logic, and more recently Protools. I record videos on a camescope and then edit them, I like to take photos and then edit them.  \nI've learned by myself how to speak english, german, spanish, I've learned how to use freelines, how to rollerskate, how to snowboard, how to play the guitar, the bass, the drums, the piano, how to sing, how to dj... recently I learned how to sew with a sewing machine, and now I've been creating my own t shirts and pull overs for two weeks. I like going to clubs, I like dancing, I like seeing friends at bars but I also have a passion for writing and reading and just pass time by myself. Of course I love traveling, watching movies and series, going to art exhibitions and museums, concerts, and I practice sports twice a week at least. I like drawing, doing my own little sculptures with clay, painting with watercolors.\n\nAm I bragging ? I don't know, probably a bit, but I post this because the problem is that \*each one of these activities is very recurrent\* (fortunately I didn't cite all the other little obsessions I've had in my life so far) and I am at average level in almost all of them (except I'm a little bit better in music). I feel like I'll never become a professional of anything and I don't feel "legitimate" for any of these activities.\n\nSome older ENTP with the same problem please tell me how you deal/dealt with that. What do you do in your life ? The others who struggle with the same issue feel free to complain with me haha. I feel like there are so many great things to do and that life is too short for all that. *And I don't want to give up things I like to do. Of course society asks me to actually be a professional somewhere, somehow but it's not the main reason why I want to master things. I want to understand things fully, not just the surface.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Am I condamned to just being average ?**
5	You know nothing Jon Snow. \n\nI am 38. I no longer struggle with that, I just love it :D \n\nIn early ages, I had the same dilemma but just because society confused me a lot at that time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI now clearly understand that I only struggled because I listened them. After ignoring the voice of my surrounding I started to feel happy with this "special talent". \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou will feel the same after spending enough time with this struggle. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n"Too many things" is awesome. Ignore people and have fun with "too many things." Use them to your advantage. I sleep only for 4 hours a day even for more things...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't listen people. They all are not ENTP. They cannot understand and relate. They only push you down. Resist !!! RISE NOW MY DEAR ENTP...RISEEE !!!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S I just want to mention all my **active only** hobbies since my fellow ENTPs will respect the most : painting, drawing, sculpting, dark ambient / electronic music composing, scaled model building, game & application development, singing. I also have "absolute hearing." etc... \n\n&#x200B;
3	Fellow aspiring polymath here, only 3 year your "senior". It hasn't gone away for me, although for a while I did struggle with it. Now I realise there's no problem to it all. The more knowledge you have in different fields, the more seemingly unrelated dots you can connect. Life's too short to not try everything at least once!
4	> Some older ENTP with the same problem please tell me how you deal/dealt with that. What do you do in your life ? The others who struggle with the same issue feel free to complain with me haha.\n\nChoose one that has sufficient depth to it, one which will allow you to easily get a job and make sufficient money as a career.   Then you do all the rest as a hobby until they throw dirt on you.   That is find the thing you can do well that *other people* find useful and will want to pay you to do.   When you don't have to worry about buying food or paying rent, then you'll have time for all your hobbies. \n\nAs for feeling legitimate?  Stop comparing yourself to others *except* as a way to learn more.  If all you take away from comparing yourself to someone else is a self-esteem beat-up then you're not doing it right.  You should be comparing your *work* and learning what you can do to improve it, not comparing *yourself*.\n\nI like to compose music, among other things, as well.  I know I will never be Beethoven and almost no one will ever care about my music other than me.  But you know what?  I do it because I enjoy doing it.  I don't have to pretend that it needs to be my 'life's work' or my 'passion' or other bullshit.   So I write music and paint and draw, and the more I do, the more I learn and the better I get.   That has given me some opportunities,  like getting the chance of having my music played in public and I've given people paintings that hang in their home.   Maybe eventually they'll toss it when they're cleaning house and want something that matches the new couch.  Maybe not?  In either case, it doesn't matter.  Someday,  perhaps in some distant future, no one will remember Beethoven or Shakespeare either. \n\n> Am I condamned to just being average ?\n\nAbsolutely.  Did you really think you were special and were going to change the world?
5	>Some older ENTP with the same problem please tell me how you deal/dealt with that. What do you do in your life ? \n\nI'm 27, so I'm not that seasoned. As for me, it just came down to trying many different things, the one I chose I had a knack for and it helped that experts commented on me both positively and negatively. I just keep on learning about it and doing it, sometimes forcing myself because I know that in the end mastery comes from repetition, learning, and correction. Talent is like a ferrari, doesn't really go anywhere if you never drive it. In the end, you need to want to be or want to know - both, more, something.\n\n>**Am I condamned to just being average ?** \n\nIf you keep on doing the same thing over and over, yup.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
3	If you enjoy all those things, what's wrong with being average?
3	yooooo ENTP audio engineers in the house! 
2	I'm 17 so I'm not the big guy with the fix you've been asking for but:\n\nI myself struggle with this but it's been getting better since I started kinda vacuum cleaning through my activities.\n\nI have always been a creator, ever since I first started playing with cubes, legos and colored crayons as a toddler I never ever stopped creating and exploring. I'd write a long list about my hobbies and interests but it would get too long, too quick and I'd probably forget some since they are so many.\n\nI don't think I'll ever stop having a lot of interests but I'll at least make sure that I'll dedicate my time to pursue those few things I see to be the most rewarding.\n\nI actually want to turn my polymath lifestyle into a business. Start a website and a youtube channel that is tailored for the creators. A channel of connecting dots from different areas of life, documenting the process of creating and giving people the tools and information required to create in a information packed, easy to digest format. I would also push my own creations by doing this. I want to show people that cool modular synth I want to build and my cool films as well. There are a couple of channels on youtube that do stuff like this but they are usually only tied to filmmaking only.\n\nI saw an article on Reddit about [Warren Buffett’s “2 List” Strategy](https://jamesclear.com/buffett-focus) and at first, it freaked me the fuck out, how can I give up everything I liked and focus on only 5 things? 5 is a small number you know? And as I thought of it a little more, I decided that, no, fuck that, it's bullshit. So I ain't doing that, **BUT**, it made me reflect on my interests and it made me leave behind some of my hobbies in order to focus on the more important stuff I want to excel at.\n\nI also listened to the *"The Life Changing Magic of Tidying Up"* by Marie Kondo‎ and that book changed my view on minimalism, which I previously thought is bullshit. I tried applying some minimalistic principles into my life and so far it's really nice and freeing. I'm not going too in depth about this since I'm at the begining of this and I still don't consider myself a minimalist, but at least, I'm making progress into decluttering my life.\n\nThese two helped me declutter my interests and I chose a broad area to invest my time in that offers so much stuff to learn and explore that I won't ever get bored. That area is filmmaking. it involves a shit ton of skills: video shooting and editing, graphic design, 3D VFX and CGI (Broad as fuck) marketing, web development, writing, audio engineering (broad as fuck as well), other stuff related to business and more. There's so much to explore in these areas and they go so well together in a business setting that It gets me super excited to learn and become good at all these. I would call all these hobbies "My career" and my "I want to take a break" hobbies would be the other stuff I decide to explore and spend my time on like: electronics, woodworking, longboarding etc.`\n\nAs a quick edit, there are a few hobbies that I shouldn't even consider them hobbies but a part of my life like: Eating healthy and taking care of my phisical and mental health.\n
2	I got no interest in anything, therefore I am interested in everything.\n\nI never met another polymath but I believe this is how we feel, gnawing at the known to see if there's more, much more.\n\nEverything is part of everything and how can we study just one side of it, where the left hand is not aware of what the right hand is doing? The days of sacrificing yourself for isolated breakthroughs are over, as there is only one breakthrough left lurking on the horizon, that of transcending ourselves onto a new plane of consciousness.\n\nStop giving a shit of what others think, because others don't really think as individuals, we're the many flagella of the repressed collective unconscious.\n\nThink of a big, loud, greasy engine without wheels or chassis, that's the self-important "humanity".
1	Relate a lot.\n\nThough I would remind you to keep the Dunning Kruger effect in mind while trying to be objective about your own skill sets.\n\nYou may be better at music than you give yourself credit for and worse at some of your more marginal hobbies than you think.\n\n$0.02
1	Read about talent stacking. 
1	I suggest you read [Essentialism](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18077875-essentialism). It's useful for issues like this. I'm sorry I can't be of more help.
6	ENTP author and directors	Anyone know of any ENTP directors and authors?\n\nWhat does a ENTP director or writer look like, as in style, focus, etc?\n\n
6	Quentin Tarantino is supposedly an ENTP, I like that Pulp Fiction flick.
3	Me! I work in film as a director / assistant director. 🤠 very Ti oriented and stories rooted in speculstive fiction  Focus on detail and world building, unConcerned with onset power dynamics and crew members. uNbothered by aesthetics thats do not enhance the key themes og the film  \n\nHoward Hughes is just about as ENTP as you can get. 
3	Alfred Hitchcock and Frank Herbet (Dune) are apparently ENTP's. 
3	* Hunter S. Thompson\n* Quentin Tarantino\n* Guy Ritchie\n* John Beebe\n* Robert Greene\n* Ryan Holiday\n* Simone de Beauvoir\n* Slavoj žižek​\n* Blake Edwards
17	Are any of you moral absolutists? Why?	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_relativism\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_absolutism
10	Not with the definition that wiki provides. Picking up a spoon off the table is morally irrelevant. Ergo, not all actions are right or wrong.
11	What about absolute relativist ? There is no God. Everything is permitted by Nature. Do what you want, *pay* for the consequences! Death shows no mercy.
5	I guess I think rape is wrong in every context. Does that make me an absolutist because that's the only moral thing I can think I take an absolute stance on. 
2	Absolutism is stupid.
2	There definitely need to be some absolutes, if only so that we can function. Because were everything relative, we could not make laws or define anything. I think a relativistic view of the world is great, although it can be limiting just like absolutes. A relativistic view would have to accept absolutes, which is a contradiction. And an absolute view would not have to accept relativism; we’d miss a lot of the subtleties if everything were black and white. So no, I’m not a moral absolutist, but I’m not a moral relativist either. 
2	I would say I’m not an absolutist, but I do think there is a science of morality or objective morality. There are peaks and valleys on the moral spectrum. I would compare it to nutritional science in that manner. A great read is “The Moral Landscape” by Sam Harris. He introduced me to a completely different perspective of objective morality
4	I believe in a gradient. On either end of the spectrum exist absolutes (right/wrong in this context). Most real life scenarios are in between though, having like 75%/25% split for example. I also consider intentions and actions together, not just one or the other. Not everything can be inherently right or wrong. Black and white thinking leads to lots of problems. And most things in life are spectrum. But i think it's import to note that even the spectrum contains the absolutes.
3	Yes. If morality isn't objective, it is meaningless.
2	I'm highly sensitive to to the logical extrapolation of moral relativism and absolutism from a given grand narrative, philosophical frame, or belief system. It irks me when someone claims a belief system like Atheism then pairs it with deep-seated moral absolutes like human value, dignity, special status, love, justice, etc. Those moral ideas are not commensurate with a strictly empiricist worldview.\n\nMore generally, I have a problem with hypocrisy and logical inconsistency. Eg, it can't be true that there is no difference between the sexes except the wage gap. You can't claim equality of the sexes without understanding how both sexes are oppressed in different ways. You can't say minorities are free while demanding they act, think, and vote monolithically. You can't ridicule the religious for their unscientific, religiously motivated pro-life positions then fail to understand the basic biological idea that a zygote is the first stage of human development--yes it's a life and a human one, let's look at it honestly. 
1	Descriptive relativist. Which I think largely plays into or (or perhaps off of) the Ne function, and to a lesser extent Ti. 
1	Not an absolutist but do believe in moral universalism. 
1	There is no action that is right or wrong only intent. 
1	Morals are relative.
1	Yes, look up Henry Sidgwick's proof of utilitarianism
1	I don’t know why an ENTP would care anything for morals. They’re literally just all labels. It’s your perspective that makes things good and bad but reality isn’t objectively anything.
1	Absolutist, since moral relativism can't stand logically on its own without any insidious absolutist assumptions. \n\nIf somebody asks "well then, what is the absolute moral truth then?", the answer is "it reveals itself over time". Not knowing what it is right now doesn't preclude its existence. We can infer it from manifest reality, and we're understanding more and more.\n\nThe kind of freedom we have in the west is clearly demonstrating itself to be a good for example. 
1	Yeah I am an absolute moralist. Relativism isn't a logically standing principle, due to the fact that its only principle says there are no principles showing a logical contradiction. Also I believe in the theory of forms held by Plato which means ideas exsist before a human thinks of it. There's the story of the cave. This is to say no one can believe or even think of something unless it existed in the metaphysical realm. \n\nThis means the idea of morality is a complete idea out there, this idea (regardless of God's existence or not) is something to pursue and that all men should seek absolute goodness. \n\nIn this debate its also important to make the distinction between prescriptive and descriptive. Or relativist look at the world and say that everyone does different things so we have to accept that. But absolutist would say the world ought to be a certain way. 
7	Songs that critique modern society.	Happy sunday wherever you are in the world. I'm creating a playlist of songs for when im in that "fuck everything" sort of mood preferably ones that are anti capitalist/western. If you have any reccomends please fire them over, examples include:\n\nGhandi mate, Ghandi - Enter Shikari\nHero of War - Rise Against\nArtificial - Martha Tilston \n\n
10	Too Many Puppies, Primus\n\nVicarious, Tool\n\nKilling in the Name, Rage Against the Machine.\n\nBYOB, System of a Down\n\nDay After Tomorrow, Tom Waits\n\nThis is America, Childish Gambino (video is more the critique than the song itself)\n\nGangsta rap made me do it, Ice Cube.\n\nMaad City, Kendrick Lamar\n
5	The whole album „ok computer“ by radiohead
4	Animals - Pink floyd;\n\nWelcome to the Machine - PF\n\nAenima - tool \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
3	Definitely Aenima - Tool
2	Ten thousand fists by Disturbed
2	Bulls on Parade - Rage Against the Machine
2	Lupe Fiasco- Put you on Game is one of the greatest songs to critique modern society [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBgSijwAtmQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBgSijwAtmQ)
2	R.E.D  by Tribe Called Red\nBuckets for Bullet wounds, and Invisible Hook  by Houese of Heros\n\nImmortal Technique \nRun the jewels \nSystem of a down (hard to understand but some songs have strong anti-imperialist themes)
2	Well, basically Enter Shikari's discography from Common Dreads onward...
2	Words I Never Said - Lupe Fiasco\n\nBitch Bad - Lupe Fiasco\n\nChanges - Tupac
2	American Idiot is pretty damn stereotypical, but still relevant
2	Maybe try ‘Humongous’ by Declan McKenna?
2	Just check out RATM's entire discography. It's only three albums. \n\nMost punk bands will have lyrics that criticize consumerism, capitalism and right-wing politics (hence why many American punk bands were so hung up on Reagan). \n\nIf you want a band that has been st it for almost 40 years and usually has lyrics that are a bit more cerebral than the usual "fuck everyone" four liners of most punk bands, check out Bad Religion.

0	How to deal w/ ENTP sister?	Hey,  as the title says my sister is an ENTP... And guess what I am.... ISFP,,,,,, it's a wacky adventure to say the least- anyways can I get some thoughts from ppl who know ENTPs or ENTPs themselves that can help me figure out how to deal with their non-stop harassment of ideas and how to get to their thicc brains on how some ideas or argument points aren't valid? \n\nDisclaimer: :'l I think she is an unhealthy ENTP if you know any traits of unhealthy ENTPs that would help alot
13	I'm not helping you because you radiate qualities that annoy me and seem like they would annoy other ENTP's
8	>asks for help with ENTP sister\n\n>doesn't give a single detail about ENTP sister
5	*with their non-stop harassment of ideas and how to get to their thicc brains on how some ideas or argument points aren't valid?*\n\nAh fuck off, if you yourself can't rebuke the arguments presented we can't help you with that, you've also seemingly judged her as unhealthy because you don't get along, despite not providing any context other than the above, which seems perfectly healthy from our point of view.\n\nAs for the actual advice you're looking for? Meet her ideas, present your case in a rational enough way that she sees your point, if you're unable to do so well you're shit out of luck.
3	Unhealthy ENTPs tend to act like ISxJs.  They fuck up and use Si improperly, by worrying about irrelevant shit they normally don't notice, become reluctant to try new things, and get quiet and generally anxious or irritable.
2	Sounds like she's too much for you. I'll take her off your hands. Thanks!
1	> their non-stop harassment of ideas\n\nWhat do you mean by that?
1	Give her a note book
1	Didn't come to the best place to complain about entps
1	You just have to make them feel. If you feel harrassed, make it known. If you don't want to be their metaphorical word wall that must endure their constant flow of ideas, let it be known. They can't win a discussion if you decline to have a discussion. Make them find someone else to exchange ideas.
4	3 years worth of school stuff in 12 months.	So i want some suggestions on how to get from 9th to 12th grade in 12 months. Ending 8th grade this year and gonna start 9th next year. Can i study through the 9th grade material in 3 months in summer and then focus on 10th and 11th grade material? So instead of learning about 9th grade material in class, i'd be able to study 10th grade material. What should be my study time each day? Would have a part time job in the summer. Thinking That i'd need only 1 hour of rest in a day. Sundays would be days off or i can study 1/4th of the day. What websites should i use that could increase the speed of learning? Can be paid websites. Just looking for suggestions. The idea just came into my mind a few mins ago and want to know if it can be possible to learn 3 years worth of school stuff in 12 months?
7	Why do you want to do this?
2	I think it can be done, and sites like Khan Academy are designed for this grade level. For retention, you should put in at least 1-2 hrs a day. But no more than 5-6 imo otherwise you reach burnout. So probably go through 1-2 classes a month, depending on how many classes your 9th grade has. It's actually enough if you gain a cursory understanding online in preparation, and the rest by paying attention in class. \n\nHowever, I think your time might be better spent learning programming. MIT and coursera has a few courses on these. You can find amazingly fun (and challenging!) problems on Project Euler. You can make an account and see how you measure up against others who solved these questions.\n\nAlso, if college is your short term goal, I think you'd be better off practicing for the SAT. There are prep courses for it online, and once you're in 10th/11th grade it'll pay off to take paid prep courses too. You do well on the SAT by practicing for the SAT. And you'll improve your vocabulary+ quantitative reasoning skills. \n\nAnother skill that I think might be more helpful is learning another language (which is also part of your curriculum, so two birds with one stone). You can use apps like duolingo or hellotalk to learn a language of your choice (perhaps Latin, or classical Greek, or German)
2	First of all, What are your long term goals and what do you want to obtain by doing this? Is it worth overworking yourself?\n\nI can give you as an example my case: \n\nI'm in 11th grade myself. I want to step foot into the creative field and make a living by building a personal brand using social media. My next goal is to start a creative business and make money for my other creative related goals.\nGiving my goals, I have no reason to study my ass off in maths and physics in order to get into a good university so I can become a 9-5 monkey. \nAt school, I do homework only if I'm really required to. I barely write anything in class. I don't really pay attention if the subject doesn't interest me. I don't waste too much time learning outside of school, and I'm average in class with absolute minimal effort. My final exams don't bother me that much knowing that It won't matter anyway. I'm going to film school for editing and my grades don't matter for shit.\n\nOn the other side, outside the school hours, I'm all in on creating and developing plans for the future and the steps to achieve them. I'm way ahead of the curve when it comes to life and marketable skills compared to my peers. \n\nIn 10th grade, I made a better effort of learning because I wasn't sure if I want to pursue the arts or the academics. I've always been a creative person but when I hit highschool I got involved in a lot of contests and projects involving game development and electronics and seeing that my efforts put into these projects paid in awards and opportunities my vision of my future career become blurry and conflicted with my artsy side. Long story short, I decided that the academics are too much effort for not being rewarding enough, and so I turned to fully committing to the creative world. This is a reason why I think you shouldn't go all in into learning all this. If you don't have a clear picture of what you want to do in the future then you might waste precious time that could be spent elsewhere.\n\nSo basically: Define your goals. Analyze if it's worth the effort. Reflect on the analysis. Get to work.\n\nNow if you know that you want to pursue the academics or you just want to do this just for the sake of it then yes, it's possible, and shouldn't be that hard either.\n\nI don't know how it works in the states but here in Romania, the hardest year of learning was 9th grade. This may be a lot different in the states though. In my case, I think it was a combination of bad teaching, new environment, and way harder subjects all of the sudden. \n\nIMO, 10th and 11th year maths and physics at least, can be learned in a single hard working summer.\n\nNow, we have a girl that flew to the states as an exchange student and academic subjects seem to be overall more diluted and practical compared to what is being taught in Romania. So it should be even easier to do this.\n\nYou are hella lucky to have so many online resources to learn from that are made for your educational system that a little bit of googling will get you on a really good path. Khan Academy is really well structured and there are a ton of other quality resources that can come in handy.\n\nIf you decide to go about doing this. Try avoiding burnout like the plague. I'm a brunt out/bored out creative myself and it's really hard to get out of a rut. I used to cope with this by taking care of my physique but now I can't exercise for about 2 months because of a stupid hernia. Keep in mind that you won't always have the energy to do this and it's okay, take a break. If you are like me and you have Seasonal Affective Disorder then winter is gonna be a bitch for your productivity and it will tell your plans to be productive to take a turn back around the moon and fuck off.\n\nHere are a few unproductive and pseudo productive things to avoid if you want to not waste a ton of time on meaningless bullshit that contribute to burning out. This is from personal experience: \n\n1. Quit gaming. Cold turkey. One of the best decisions I've ever made. I used to waste my days playing CSGO, WoW and Overwatch and I thought to myself "I'm enjoying this so it's not wasted time"\nTruth is that nobody cares that I hit Grandmaster in Overwatch on season 3 and the fact that you practice in game skills instead of practicing real life skills says it all.\n\n2. Stop feeding your brain with shit. I don't have a TV. I don't browse 9gag for memes. I'm mindful about the stuff I watch on youtube and my only sin is wasting too much time on reddit instead of working. But even there, I'm not subscribed to any unproductive subreddits, only pseudo productive and productive ones c: Check out /r/nosurf , Feeds are the hardest ever addiction to try to break out of, and I still haven't broken \n\n3. Eat healthy. No it doesn't taste like crap you cunt. I've been eating really healthy for a year and a half and now all candy is way too sweet, soft drinks taste like shit and honestly, broccoli is like my favorite motherfucking thing on earth when ate along side chicken breast.\n\n4. Limit self deprecating humor. It plays with your brain and image. Image is respect. Respect is the most valuable currency. Money **can buy** respect. Respect **makes** money. Check out /r/InfluenceAdvice .\n\n5. Don't be me, get out of the house. I love people and the outdoors but my indoors activities are interesting as hell as well. Sometimes this alone time goes unchecked on holidays and here I am, literally rolling on the floor, going insane because I haven't interacted to other human beings other than my family for 2 weeks. Get outdoor hobbies. I'm trying to make music creation an outdoor hobby, also, I love longboarding but these two can only be done if my dick doesn't turn into a popsicle once it steps outside. I'm also not a fan of wearing 5kgs of clothes only because some shiny ball in the sky decides to fuck off in the winter.\n\n6. Coffee. It's great, drink it. **Only when you need it**. Coffee is motherfucking great, but you are like me and you like to make mistakes and drink too strong and too many cups of coffee then you'll build a tolerance really quick. Tolerance resets after taking 2 weeks off. But you mind not be be able to go 2 weeks off without coffee, so it's good to avoid building a tolerance.\n\nI could talk for hours but these few should do for now.\n\nTL;DR: Read it.
2	You're gonna regret it, seriously.\n\nI took the acceleration program in high school, so all 3 years curriculum (9th to 12th grade) would be completed in 2 years. It's been around 6 years since I'm graduated, and now I'm regretting why I took the program instead of going in normal way. Then again, I took the test mainly for giggles but somehow I was qualified, so maybe it would be different from you.
1	What do you want to get out of graduating early? Do you hate school? Do you think it would look impressive? Do you want to leave home?\n\nAlso, were you taking advanced classes in middle school? Do you have gifted-level intelligence? You'd have to be super-smart to make this work. Like, extremely intelligent. I know I wouldn't have been able to do it, that's for sure.
1	Why? While it is possible, it's going to be very difficult. Unless you're used to the intense studying required of you, you'll find the workload damn near impossible. Are you mentally prepared to buckle down? If so, websites like Kahn Academy are going to help you *tons*. I recommended looking at the teacher websites of your local high school and purchasing the textbooks they use. Follow their curriculum but at an accelerated pace. You can probably get you GED and begin college when you finish all three years.
1	I'll have a little bit of a different perspective from some as a homeschooled entp who finished my highschool courses in two years and then got my associates from college technically before I graduated (it was half off tuition since I was still a hs student), transferred to a 4 year and graduated from college with my bachelor's at the age of 19. Most of this was while working part time and now I am 22 with a degree and almost continuous job experience. \n\nIf you are able, I would highly recommend doing something similar. \n\nOn the if you are able note: how are you currently being educated? People who are homeschooled are typically better prepared for accelerated means of learning because they are often largely self taught. If you are public or private schooled, this is a skill that is  less likely to be practiced. That being said, it can be learned and places like kahn academy are excellent to help build those skills. As a side note, learn how to teach yourself from a textbook ASAP. Just do it. No matter what you do in life (esp. college), it will be incredibly helpful. \n\nSecondary point: you will probably need more than an hour off per day to have this be a sustainable lifestyle. I would recommend having a hour of "farting around" time, and 1-2 hours of productive fun time. Do a hobby you like, study a subject that genuinely interests you, etc. \n\nLet me know if I wasn't clear on explaining anything. 
1	Some people...\n\nI became self-aware only at 30
17	As an ENTP, what was your worst and best interaction with other personality types?	So I'm not sure if someone has already made a post like this before, but I was just curious. Not trying to "discriminate" against other personality types or call one out for being "bad," but I was just curious as to which personality ENTPS have better or not so good experiences with and why. I know that a quick google search can tell you compatibility, but I do want to hear some stories.
7	I like how you're asking for stories but all you got so far is a couple of best/worst lists without any elaboration. \n\nAnyway, stories are pretty much worthless because the average person sucks at typing so you'll learn more about their personal biases rather than actual experiences imo.\n\nI think one thing you should observe is that NTs and SFs and NFs and STs have a harder time to get along because they're opposites in scope and primary judgment focus. Next should be T vs. F for the same reasons. \n\nI'd expect NTs and STs as well as NTs and NFs to get along well because they share T and N respectively. 
5	My worst interactions are with my ISTJ father. He can't talk about anything else than work. And even when it's not work related, he makes it seems like it is by analyzing every (not interesting) details of the topic, and explaining things about it that I already know (for 20min). Of course, I absolutely cannot interrupt him during his enlightening explanation without him becoming angry, even if I already perfectly know everything he's telling me, because he is the father, and I'm the daughter, so I have to listen.\n\nSometimes, he starts explaining things to me that I myself introduced to him a few days before, as if it was a brand new discovery he made by himself, and that I couldn't possibly know. Every time he can, he tries to make a "life lessons" of everything, even when it's supposed to be a fun time. And of course, I've already heard these "life lessons" a hundred times before, but he always present them as if I just discovered them.\n\nBasically, talking to him is like talking to someone who always assume you're ignorant (even when you just proved you're not), and he's only capable to discuss very down to earth things, always taking himself too seriously. Even when he laughs, it feels like he is trying to constrain it, to stay in control.\n\nI think that's a very sad relationship to have with your father.   \n\n\nMy best interactions were with an ENFP guy (used to be my first very close friend in high school), and my INFP best friend. When I met the ENFP, he was the most open-minded person I knew. We became friend very quickly. I  started spending all my time with him, and I loved every minute. We could talk and laugh about everything, try new crazy things together, write songs and poems, be sad and quiet together. He was also very, very charismatic. He could become friend with anyone, and everybody liked him. I was really impressed by his social skills, especially in high school, where I myself really wasn't socially developped.\n\nMy INFP friend shares a lot of the ENFP characteristics, especially open-mindedness and honesty. But it took a lot more time for him and I to become friends. For a good 6 months, we shared the same classes in university, but never really talked to each other. Until one night, when we went out with common friends, and ended up walking home together for a 40min walk. We talked about everything. Especially about life. And we shared the exact same views, the same feelings about it, which is really rare to find in real life. I think we both felt a lot less lonely after this night. What I love about him is how we can have meaningful conversations about everything, but also how stupid we can be together. He doesn't care too much about what other people think of him, and it's really refreshing. 
7	Best: any NT. Some of my closest friends are other ENTPs, INTP, ENTJ, and INTJ\n\nWorst: ISFJ. That's the only personality type I can think of that I just don't work well with
5	Worst are definitely Fi doms for me. I usually get along with everyone, but somehow the Fi doms always find a reason to be mad at me for things I do/say. Idk how I always end up fighting with them when usually I never really fight with anyone (about personal matters) but I cannot stand it when people always want things their way.\n\nBest would be... TPs and FJs I guess. Never really had any problems with them, since the Fe evens everything out. \n\nMy worst current experience was with an ISTJ... it was a nightmare. She explained me a task which could‘ve been explained in 15 minutes in fucking two hours, because she repeated every little detail 10 times and at the end it all felt like a big mess and I felt I was losing control over the big picture because she went so much into detail about everything. It was suffocating... a nightmare... horrible...
1	Best: ENTP, ISFP, ISTP, ESTJ, ESTP, INTP\n\nWorst: NFs lol
1	As a young up n coming entp, i find it much harder to get along with Dom/aux Fi users—as an aside, socionics  is 100% right about the entp fi-blindspot and if you think you're the exception to that or just deny socionics because as a model of personality it assumes that each individual participates in every function, I put this forward to you; if you agree that all human beings sense, feel, intuit, and think on some level and therefore share every function with each other in varying degrees, and you also agree that every instance of perception and judgement falls on the spectrum of being either introvertedly or extrovertedly-charged(if you disagree with this you disagree with Jung's model which is a strange thing to do) you must also agree with socionics' model and beebe's and all the relevant jungian analysts' when they include each and every one of Jung's psychological functions when typing, but what you must NOT and CANNOT say(if you agree with the first two points) is that because MBTI only gives out four functions per personality, "ENTP's can't have Fi because MBTI AKA Jung's personality types for dummies  says they can't," lol get out of here with that nonsense. \n\nSo yeah, don't get along very well with Fi-users, I tend to offend them without meaning to in the slightest. Isfjs can be very grating to me, they're nice and nurturing on the surface but idk you can just feel the expectations they have for you to behave according to how they think one 'ought to behave' when you're around them \n\nInfjs are either really cool or really weird\n\nInsecure teenage infps I actually can get along with really well \n\nEnfps are dope as well, especially the older dude one that I know \n\n
1	Best: With my INFP and ISFJ best friends. INFP laughs at all my jokes (including dark humor) and ISFJ is quite rational-minded. I also won't forget an ENFP guy best friend. He shared my passion for music and the arts in general.\n\nWorst: Now I wouldn't say this is the worst, but I often do clash with my ESTJ mother. She often tells me to do things the traditional way, but knowing how ENTPs function, we like the novel in comparison to the norm. This sometimes leads to petty disagreements and she will think that she is right, when in reality, some cases are not necessarily right or wrong.
28	The concept of „Regret“	What are your thoughts on what regret is and what to do about it?\n\nGoing by the definition that regret is something you wish you‘d have done different, I think we have technically no reason to feel regret ever.\n\nAt the moment where you have made a decision, you were a „different“ person than you are at the moment. It would not be fair nor make sense to judge what your self at that time has done with the self that you are now. You‘re no longer in the same circumstances as back then, so it would be easy to „regret“ what you did back then from your comfort zone now. Since you‘re no longer in the same situation, it is easy to talk big about - like what you should have or should‘ve not done. But judging the actions of the „you“ back then is like judging a stranger, so you have no reason to feel regret ever. You‘re out of the situation, you cannot judge whether your decision was right or wrong. Thus have no reason to regret, but should respect the decision made by the you in the circumstances back then. You don‘t remember how it was for you, and whether you would make the same decision again if put into the same situation.\n\nThoughts?
13	I think this ignores that our actions have consequences. Regardless of whether we're a different person now than two months ago, we still have to live with what that person left us with. I think I only ever regretted something that impacted my life negatively when I could have known better at the time but chose differently. \n\nTrivial example: \n\nGetting drunk and saying some stuff you usually wouldn't say. Regret it now because it impacted your friendships negatively.\n\nNot so trivial example: \n\nChoose to ignore some tell-tale signs of a disease because you're more focused on advancing your career, just to get fucked over by your body a couple of years later. 
4	I think the reason you shouldn't embrace regret is the same for shouldn't embrace any negative emotion. It means resisting rather than accepting reality, and being stuck in an illusion of the past not being past. But like anything else regret is a natural response to when things didn't go right. If that feeling is there it means that there's something to resolve. It's not like you sat down and decided to be regretful, there is no rational process involved. It's not even irrational, no more than a physical pain would be. So it's less about how you shouldn't be regretful and more about how you should handle it - as you said, you should focus on learning and moving forward
3	>I think we have technically no reason to feel regret ever.\n\nThe idea that one will not regret anything is an ego trip and the inability to learn from the past likens one to a wild animal.\n\n>What are your thoughts on what regret is and what to do about it?\n\nLearn from regret, or don't and repeat your mistakes precisely.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
3	I try to leave the past in the past. Could’ve, should’ve, would’ve I try not to think about. 
2	Regret only has a purpose before it happens. It is pointless after the fact!
2	Thank you for sharing your thoughts on that subject. I like your logic, it sounds like you're advocating unconditional love. I won't play the smartass on that one because I want to believe. Comments will be interesting... talking about regrets to inferior Si, blind Fi
2	Well.. your past shapes the present. It in someway becomes a part of you.. or doing a certain action in the past has shaped your present.. perhaps in a negative way. if it was in a negative way, you'd wish you weren't in this current situation of ours and so you "regret" or wish you hadn't made a particular choice in the past.\n\nRegret comes from wishing you hadn't done something in the past.. all because of how that choice has affected you in the present. 
2	What about regretting things you *didn't* do? And now can't do? That one gets me. In fact, anticipation of that one gets me. 
2	It’s only useful for identifying problems with procedures. If the procedure is fine, and the outcome still regrettable (due to circumstances beyond one’s control, incomplete information, and so on), then it should be let go post-analysis. It’s pointless to either flagellate or sympathize with one’s past self. Anything beyond assessing whether a past action was right/wrong and why (based on some current criteria) is excessive story-telling, imo.  
1	It is a useful evolutionary trait and helps us to become the different person that we are now. Usually regrets are associated with making an incorrect social decision. We are not born with the ability to socialize at the expected level that a normal human adult can. We have to make those neural connections. \n\nSocial success leads to better mate variety and selection, which improves chances of producing viable offspring. The first mammals to have the ability to regret making poor social decisions probably saw a marked increase in group cooperation which would translate to better survival rates as well.
1	Sorry I was an asshole.  Oh wait, not sorry.  That wasn't even me! The guy you want doesn't exist anymore.  Sorry.  Oh, wait!  Not sorry again!  
1	I agree with you, and I'd add that it reminds me of "The Unbearable Lightness of Being" by Kundera. If you haven't already, you should read it. I'm sure it'll speak to you. 
3	Where to take test?	Which free sites are the best for taking the personality test?\n\nI’ve used 16personalities and once got INTP, and latest test ~6 months ago got ENTP.\n\nWhile I understand that from day to day your answers may be different and the outcome may therefore be different, I think I read somewhere that 16personalities was not so extensive as others (can’t remember which ones)
3	When I may be honest:\nThis putting oneself into boxes just because of an model fitting is very stupid. I would have the same problem, but I don't call it 'problem'. I did the test 5 times, 5 times ENTP. A lot of things changed recently so I did it again. So I am INTP. \nWell, I feel absolutely comfortable with. Since I've seen that the difference is just one letter and when you're quite in the middle of both than the model gives you a different outcome. \nDon't stick to the declaration debater or logician too much. Try to find out more about these things. \nSurely, you can take different tests, but my oppinion is not to try test over test all the time. Go deeper into the discription, you will find out, what fits more or less. \n\nAnd here is a very good discription for that: \nhttps://junglove.net/type-vs-type-entp-or-intp/\n

4	I'm making Radical Choices, and i want opinions. Can you help me?	**I quit my job.**  I was bored, tired of the endless loop. I'm now unemployed, sitting at my computer, watching Youtube videos on how to find out what i want to do, and what i can do to get started . My passion, so to speak.   ^((These videos, i assume i am not getting side tracked on useless stuff, i assume.)) I'v been procrastinating for years, never investing the time into anything helpful.  I have either done work/school and then spent the rest of my time playing video games and eating food. It's helped me ignore the hate i had of working simple entry position jobs. No amount of "charm" or "competence" helped me get promoted and succeed in the workplace. There was always someone with the power... to prevent me from achieving my goals, *regardless* of what i did. Perhaps, it was because of the work ethic the people around me had, maybe i wasn't doing my best and didn't know it. I don't know for sure. At the end of the day, nothing i did was enough to move me forward. I tried doing college, ^((Computer Engineering, never got through introduction classes after getting fed up with how insane the prices was for almost no information))  but i was also working at the same time, and that work drained me of the **will** to continue. I lost the resolve to finish college and **wasted** ***2 years*** out of High School working entry level jobs. I found next to no success, even after changing what i did to see if something else would work. After finding myself in an endless loop, i decided i was done with playing games.\n\nNow that i have left my job, i'm trying to focus on the next steps. My procrastination hasn't show up since i quit my job. I'v been spending most of my entire day dedicated on learning from many different resources. Even now as i write this, i feel fantastic knowing i have nothing keeping me away from doing what i want. I now have the drive to do something, to avoid the horrible pain of being bored and never finding a way into a better position. I have a reason to stop being lazy and unproductive. If i don't do anything, i will keep being sad, mad, and start going crazy. To step down from this, i am now trying to focus on what is most important to me. I'm going to find another way, a better way.\n\nNow i have a goal. I need to pay *$200* rent to my parents, who i am still with, because i can't afford to live on my own. I need to pay this, and other fees i can't get rid of, like a phone service bill, and car insurance. The thing that matters most is the $200 rent fee.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm trying to focus on doing something that can pay *$200* a month and work on doing some sort of business i haven't figured out yet. I'm fortunate to have this, very fortunate. I'm now trying to make the  best of my time. I'm looking for ideas on what i could do. I'm trying to waste less time looking around on my own, and maybe hear it from someone else who has done something like this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you don't know what your talking about, then don't say anything. I want facts, not maybe or untested theory.  On the other hand, if you got some solid advice, i would really appreciate to hear from you and what things i could be doing better. What things i could be doing. Maybe questions i am not asking.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance!  :D\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS: I didn't ignore this post, [https://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/asxlqz/guide\_on\_starting\_a\_business\_how\_to\_take\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/asxlqz/guide_on_starting_a_business_how_to_take_the/)  This advice is being considered, but i'm still thinking through it. 
3	What are you better than 90% of the population at? 
3	I would learn a [trade](https://www.trade-schools.net/articles/trade-school-jobs.asp) if I were you. \n\nIt doesn't really matter what it is, as long as you don't hate to do it and it pays okay. Then you can use this money invest in a business.
5	To summarize, you have bills you need to pay, are currently unemployed, and are seeking some ideal business to join/make? Reality check: beggars can't be choosers. In situations like yours, it's prudent to treat job seeking as a full time job (or even part time job). Allocate 20-40 hrs a week toward seeking a job, applying for jobs, interviewing for jobs, etc.\n\nHate your 9-5 job? Join most of humanity. Even the SJs often hate their day to day jobs. It's a human thing to feel constrained and subordinated. The only difference between the J's and the Ps (and the SJs and NPs in particular) is the Js recognize they need to suck it up (that's canonically SJ advice).\n\nYour head is currently in the clouds. So an alternative option for you is to set a time limit. Apply for unemployment, and give yourself 6 months to start something up. If you fail, give up this dream and go back into the workforce. \n\nAnother option is to sell your body to porn 
2	What industry are you planning to enter?
2	Try UpWork to get a sense of what skills people/employers are paying for. I taught myself social media marketing, expanded skillset to dabble in analytics  etc., and now I work full time at a startup. I don’t have a college degree and I worked full time as an Uber/Lyft driver before this. It can be done, you just need to know WHAT to look for/work towards to. \n\nGood luck! \n\nEdit: lots of typos 
5	Why does my ENTP friend do this?	Hi, I'm not an ENTP but my friend is, and I've been having the same problem with him since we met and actually ghosted him for a while but I keep seeing the same pattern repeating itself. \n\nLet me know if I'm not explaining myself well but basically he starts to feel like he's sort of intrusive/possessive about my ideas/projects that have nothing to do with him. I'm a creative person and whenever I tell him I'm working on a project it's like he HAS to know all the details before anyone else so he can be "in the loop" and then go brag about everything he knows that other people don't. And he'll try to insert himself into my projects and take credit for them when he hasn't done anything. Like just yesterday I mentioned an idea I had that I'd just started working on and he goes "Oh you should do this..." and basically repeats what I'd said but reworded, just so he can say it was partially his idea later. And now he has it in his head that this is somehow a joint thing, meanwhile I'm the one working my butt off to make it happen and he's done nothing but tell me my own idea reworded. So now he thinks he can tell me how/where to first reveal it, and who to show it to, and he's saying I have to show it to him first before I show anyone else...\n\nSorry this is turning into a rant but we've had this issue before and I've explained it to him that I feel uncomfortable making him a part of work that's so personal to me and he has nothing to do with. I end up putting up a wall because it feels like he's invading a part of me.\n\nSo just wondering if any ENTPs would know why he does this, and how I can get through to him that it really just makes me want to put a huge barrier between us? I like having him as a friend and I don't want to end up so put off by him that I end up ghosting him again for months because I feel like I'm being violated.\n\n(Also sorry if I'm posting this in the wrong place, let me know if this isn't the right sub for this kind of thing!)\n\nThank you!
16	In my opinion? Just be honest with him and tell him how you feel. He probably doesn't realize he's taking credit, but is just excited to share what you guys are working on with other people.
16	My guess here is that he likes you, thinks your ideas are cool, and wants to be involved or have input because it excites him and he has no idea that feeling isn’t reciprocated. 
4	What do i think? Tell them what is on your mind. Don't sugar coat it. Don't let them take you off track and never get a resolution. Don't be rude about it. That is what i think. 
3	I don’t recognise it from ‘my’ ENTP’s. They get protective of me and like to feel included in a sense, so they will pick my brain if I have an idea or plan and I know that is their way of showing interest and wanting to help me. Regularly that does lead to repetition of what I had already figured out, I recognise that one :D. I take it more of a confirmation that I was indeed on the right track, and I am grateful they are supportive of me.\n\nBut taking credit for it? Hm no. I would just discuss it with him, I understand it can get really frustrating. One of the things I appreciate about them is that I can simply say I don’t like it when they do this or that, and why. As they usually have such good intentions, that can sting a bit but I’ve noticed they care about whether I am comfortable. So don’t wait till the point of blowing up or ignoring him again, try the more direct approach :). I hope you two can sort this out!
4	Sounds like your friend is an ENTJ? They tend to like to take control of things a bit more than an ENTP. I'm kind of in between, and I think if you tell him straight up how you're feeling  he'll back off. He's probably just not self-aware of the fact that he's making you uncomfortable.
2	Well, don't keep your thoughts to yourself, he can't read your mind! If you think he's being intrusive, or being repetitive/annoying by rewording your ideas, just tell him! He will appreciate the honesty:) 
32	How would you react if somebody found a proof that the meaning of life is eating and drinking?	By proof I mean an absolute and irrefutable proof. The kind of proof that leaves no doubt that eating and drinking is the one and only meaning of life, all else being just self deceipt.\n\nI was discussing this with a friend and I realised it would destroy me. A large part of my view on life revolves around not knowing the meaning of it and building my own. However, if someone proves to me there IS a meaning and it is exactly the one they are saying my whole worldview would crumble. I guess it's because of Ti and its inability to ignore facts, thus discarding everything that accepts the lack of a concrete meaning of life. I would feel betrayed by logic and reason, knowing that what has been my guide my whole life has turned into a tyrannical leash pulling me towards a destiny that lacks any personal meaning nor importance. 
23	This belies the idea of a meaning, really.  The way you view meaning is nonretractable.  Even if the *purpose* of your life were discovered to be that you eat and drink because you fertilize a farm for growing some galactic Titans produce, the meaning that you create for that is always the only meaning that will matter.   
5	In a similar vein, I recall a conversation I was having with some friends a while back. The topic was that we encounter an infinitely wise genie, and get to ask him one single question - anything we want (but no nonsense crap like "how do i get more questions" which get categorically rejected).\n\nAfter a bit of thought, I decided a good question to ask was "are we alone?" In other words: is life elsewhere in the universe? It was acknowledged as a good question amongst friends, but the followup was tougher to answer: "what would you do if the answer is that we're the only life in the universe?"\n\nI'd be mostly confused, and a bit pissed. What are the odds? (infinitesimally small.) I could only imagine the type of responses that religions would begin to espouse, and philosophically all we'd really be able to say is "well, just because it's a 0.000000000005% probability doesn't mean it couldn't have happened..." In other words, it'd give direct credence to religious arguments, I think. Not proof, mind you, but a significant supporting argument. It's be a massive prediction made by some religions (counter to scientific predictions) which is actually supported.\n\nSo I'm not sure I'd call it a "betrayal" of logic and reason that leads  to this despondence. But rather a *contradiction* of airtight logic. In that, we take something we're extremely confident about, like the reflexivity property of mathematics "x = x", and get shown that's actually logical nonsense. It just leads to a human 404 error.
3	Since meaning is arbitrary, I wouldn‘t be bothered by someone else‘s understanding of the meaning of life. There can be no „proof“ of meaning. It is not universally defined, even though many individuals attempt to make a universal truth out of it, it does and will always depend on the individual. — and that would be what I would define the universal truth of the meaning of life as.
2	Don’t forget sleeping and breathing 
2	First of all, I'm a Christian. To me, the meaning of life is to glorify my creator. \n\nSecond, I am also an ENTP. Duh. You see my flair. This means I am a slave to the truth no matter how uncomfortable it makes me. I assume we're all like that, I might be wrong. \n\nThird, I am a carnivore. Not by choice. I cannot eat any plant matter aside from trace amounts such as seasonings or I get sick all the time among other problems. \n\nThis would mean the meaning of life for me is to kill so that I may live. That's kind of dark. It would also mean my religion is wrong, or I've been interpreting it wrong. Perhaps the great heavenly feast after the end times is the end goal my God had in store for us. Maybe eating of his flesh and drinking of his blood(metaphorically, I'm not catholic) is really the core of Christendom. 
2	Its pretty similar to a scenario used by the stoics. They liken us to dogs chained to a cart and life/fate being the cart. You can either be dragged along or go along with it. \n\nSimilarly, if the meaning of life was proven to you, you can either accept it and go along or be dragged along by it. However, it doesnt change the fact that the choice is up to us to decide our attitude. Personally, I think our attitude we come up with in facing this ‘leash’ gives us personal meaning and importance.\n\nEven if you have solid proof, theres nothing stopping you from having your own defined meaning in life. Lets say humans, as animals are born into the word to reproduce and lead to the growth and survival of their race. This does not stop individual humans from coming up with their very own life purpose. Biologically all they are need is to have offsprings but still come up with their very own purpose in life anyways.
1	I mean... I’d be pretty stoked since eating and drinking is one of my favorite things (though I recently gave up drinking). 
1	That is my purpose of life already
1	I'd pour a tall one.
1	Considering that I take this statement seriously, if life has an irrefutable, absolute meaning, I would trust myself to have discovered it eventually through trial and error. It's like having a spoon, it has one function, two at best, but you're using it for other things. You \*can\* use it for other things, but it is better suited for something else, which you should eventually discover.\n\nAnd if I don't take it seriously, it wouldn't really affect my belief system all that much, since there isn't much of a belief system to begin with.
1	Here I am scrolling through Reddit minding my own business and this post pops up. \n\nThe things you ENTPs talk about... lol. \n\nIt's like getting a look inside my mother's mind, who spent my entire childhood hitting me over the head with Ne-Ti. When I learned what word salad was when I got a bit older? I told her she was speaking in it when her Ne went into overdrive. I wasn't wrong, but I got glared at and told that I was an arrogant contrarian insufferable demon of a teenager. Good times, I always enjoyed our banter and I still do. 
1	The meaning of life is to replicate/pass on genes. We are nothing more than complex vessels for DNA to facilitate replication through. At least, that's the "intention" of life (if you will permit a phrasing that implies planning in a process that's actually random and emergent)\n\nAlthough as a cognizant human I have the ability to act on my own drives instead of the biological imperative. As such, I'll probably never have biological children. Take that, billions of years of evolution!
1	Honestly, not a thing would change for me. Idgaf what the true meaning of life is.
1	Honestly, even if it was an irrefutable fact, I would probably just consider it for a couple of weeks and then decide that just drinking and eating wasn't going to satisfy me. I don't like the phrase "the meaning of life", because even if there were an universal one, I wouldn't feel much concerned about it. \n\nI honestly prefer doing whatever fulfills me, regardless of what "the meaning" behind it all is. I don't think it'll influence the only certain thing in the universe, which is death. I don't think we should search for meaning in life, it risks our enjoyment of our time alive, which is considerably short. 
1	Eating and drinking has a direct effect on that your well being. So, if someone eats too much, he gets sick or develops all kinds of diseases leading to an early death. Hence nature is designed to prevent people from living to their fullest or you could say that you cannot 'realise this meaning' beyond a certain point. You can surely end up not realising it significantly though, by simply being born somewhere in Somalia and dying of starvation or thirst.
1	I mean we all live to have humans continue thriving (people disagree on what this menas) anyway so I don’t see how this would be anyway.
1	Continue with my day, it’s all I do, after all.
1	The language, since the day it has evolved with cognition, was the day of joy and sorrow, as the consequences were the half-truths that came with it. This is now.\n\nWe must transcend all evidence as nothing can ever be completely evident. We "go" with the "evidence" for the lack of alternatives, but who decides what is true if not the organ that accepts all things at face value? What else does is believes in? God? Self? Physical reality? \n\n2+2=4 seems like an undeniable truth on paper and to the eye but is still an idea, an idea is a gross oversimplification of a phenomena, and since we cannot know how deep does the rabbit hole goes, nothing can ever be concluded, everything has to be accepted for what it is - one big everything.\n\nSo, when something leaves no doubt, it is still completely relies on your own cognitive devices, of genetic and cultural origin. Read above.
1	How certain are you that you're actually an ENTP?\n\nBeing crushed that the 'meaning of life' isn't what you had hoped it would be doesn't sound very ENTP at all. Just the fact that you can begin to imagine a reality where ANYTHING is absolute and irrefutable is CRAZY to me. Read the description for ENFJ and tell me if it sounds closer.\n\n'Meaning of life' is an inherently subjective phrase. What does that even mean? I can spin 'meaning of life' to mean any number of things if I talk enough.\n\nWith this in mind: Learning this "truth" to me it would have EXACTLY the same effect as if I had learned that the sole purpose of Kablorb was to Goosh and Flirp - It wouldn't change anything AT ALL. Might as well be gibberish.
1	As a Baha'i, today is the first day of our fast...refraining from food and drink from sunrise to sunset, so I find it pretty cool that I got a notification for this. Lol As if not eating (not drinking is much more difficult) was hard enough, only to be reminded of it. 😄\n\nI would be distressed, I'd imagine, if the purpose of life was so trivial as to eat and drink. I think there could be multiple purposes of life. The material purpose is to procreate.  I think the ultimate purpose is to grow spiritually. \n\n"I bear witness, O my God, that Thou hast created me to know Thee and to worship Thee. I testify, at this moment, to my powerlessness and to Thy might, to my poverty and to Thy wealth. There is none other God but Thee, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting." -- Baha'u'llah
1	Utilitarianism
1	What would you do if someone found an irrefutable proof that the meaning of life is NOT eating and drinking and transitioning the human species to sustaining on pure breath alone?\n\nA la, Professor Arnold Ehret's Mucusless Diet Healing System.
1	Life would be boring
1	What about reproducing?\n\nThat is pretty intrinsic to being an organism. 
1	Your life has whatever meaning you put into it. You will die for what you believe one way or the other. If you yearn for more I would imagine you would find life more meaningful. If you learned that there is more than embracing it makes sense. If you don’t believe in more and have no contact with Moore and no desire for more, I wouldn’t worry about it. Strengthening your will is usually about relieving yourself of doubts. If you don’t know your own mind and there are shadows there that you have not explored, then uncertainty will continue to plague you.
1	The bible says that there’s nothing better for a man to do, than to eat, drink, and enjoy his work, so there’s that. [Ecclesiastes 2:24]
1	I found it a liberating thought that there is no objective ‘meaning’ to life unless you consider survival and having children from a simple biological point of view. \n\nWhich doesn’t mean I don’t experience meaning in my life, I do. But I realise it’s subjective and my choice how I choose to implement and experience it.\n\nIf anything, the realisation has made me more joyful :). 
1	I am quite agnostic to the idea of a universal meaning for life. 
1	What if the proof of the proposition was only graspable by a few select very brilliant mathematicians in the world...but nevertheless it was completely true.   That is, you couldn't personally hope to understand it, but it is nevertheless true.   In other words you have to take their verification on faith. How would that affect your thinking?\n\nSecondly, suppose you could readily understand the proof and accept it as true.  Why would that matter?  What would it actually change about your life *except* to dispel any and all of those deceits?  How is that not liberating instead?  I mean I'm kinda used to Ti shattering things I think are true...which is what I prize most about it.  You would now know the purpose of life.  But that doesn't rule out that you can have other, personal ones. \n\nThe only things which go into my 'worldview' are things I have some probability associated with, like the non-existence of God.  I don't see any good argument for it, I see no absolute benefit or qualitative difference in the lives of his worshippers, and I understand that a logical proof is not possible as the question of his existence is logically absurd.   I don't have any 'grand scheme' of the universe ideas and I don't see how you could even get them from a purely Ti process. \n\nSo if there was suddenly some proof of God, and I mean physical proof because there can be no logical one, it still wouldn't destroy my worldview.  I would just say "whoops, really fucked that one up" and probably become a theologian who wanted to study him.   (Incidentally I'm having trouble thinking of what would constitute proof.  It can't merely be super science because you can otherwise never rule out aliens.)\n\n
63	All ENTPs are all out being interesting on a Friday night, quick, what do you guys really think of these pricks?	I'll start: I wish I was out being interesting on a Friday night. 
74	Ah yes what are you fellow introverts, who are not ENTPs, doing tonight. As someone whose type is not ENTP, I do not feel ashamed to be using reddit tonight. I do hear ENTPs are great though. They're charming, funny, smart and they have huge penises
46	My ENTP husband is researching something really boring because my conversation about my inner feelings was too much for him. Haha
30	I've shamed myself and my community with my title. 
25	This is as interesting as it get, *are you ready for this*\n\npick a fight with people on reddit, argue, eat, go to bed at 10 pm. \n\nThat's what I do on my *crazy crazy* Friday nights
20	How dare you assume we're all interesting. I'm watching Live PD at home. 
12	Worked all day producing murder shows. Hosted my podcast, and now it’s time to drink red wine and smoke some weed! 
12	Enjoy the satisfaction that some of us will be hungover tomorrow as well. 
9	Welp I just finished playing dnd : / it was very fun and productive
10	I was going to argue with you since I’m usually never doing cool things on fridays but damn if I didn’t have an orchestra gig playing for Korea’s 100th anniversary of independence from Japan. 
5	I lost any FOMO I had years ago so I'm happy to be home watching Mr. Show and waiting for the juicy gossip about the ENTPs while they're out having fun.
5	Tensed as I am not tensed everyone's been freaking out and studying for our university internal examination while I think there is not much to study but seeing everyone study makes me feel I've not studied but then when I open my books I feel what is there to study. And finally I ended up arguing with myself weather I was being overconfident or everybody else was being stupid! 
5	I was doing physics for the competition the whole day, then I debated with my INTJ sister while eating chicken nuggets and went to sleep.
4	Why don't you go out and do something interesting? Do you lack friends? No excuse. Use meetup apps. Half your city is at your fingertips. Get a hobby and do something. Need help? Drop some ecstasy first. 
3	They are rlly energetic and fun lol, as a entj I just stayed home, rather be out too
3	Playing videos game and crushing drinks what else \n
3	Was working (service industry) aaaand now I'm drinking. 
3	I was in a latte pouring competition. Lost horribly, but made my INFJ friend join me. Got my car towed and already filed an appeal for the ticket. Seems like a regular ENTP night. 🙃 
5	I'm at home being interesting. Who needs to leave?\n\nIt's 2am. Been working on Motion Graphics for my next youtube video   \n/ documentary thing since I woke up at 9. I should really get some sleep but it's so hard to drag myself away.
2	Going to the gym, then drink good wine, then play old games with friends, then go out with friends and drink some more. Probably wont be in that order.
2	Woke up after a night of partying with the bros. Now I’ve got to go to work though. :sad face:
2	Drank a cup of coffee did some smelling salts and put up a bench press pr with my roommate
2	Hungover
1	Playing Far Cry 4 because last tike I got bored and didnt finish it
1	Well I almost planned a get together but because we only started planning it 15 hours beforehand it didn't work. Then I got my new computer parts and sold my old graphics cards. Then I played rainbow six with a  bunch of toxic people.
4	What’s the most fun topic to talk/debate about? What grinds your gears and gets you talking like a mad man?	Personally the idea of flat earth bugs me a lot and the idea that we’re the only beings in the entire universe does too.
11	I consider talking like a madman a sign that it's time to stop, lol.\n\nThe stuff that grinds my gears usually isn't worth talking about. It's either shit like flat earth theory, which really only deserves ridicule or it's something like an uninformed opinion on a matter I know more about than the person I'm talking too. Unless I'm getting paid it's not worth my time. But sometimes, I just can't resist when I should know better. \n\nLike I'm interested in conspiracy theories and why people believe them but I'm not really interested in engaging genuine conspiracy theorists because there's virtually no chance that I can convince them that they're wrong. It's like talking to an INFP.\n\nA good example of the latter is politics. Almost everyone has political opinions but most of them are complete garbage if you examine them critically (especially the ones you regularly encounter on platforms like Reddit). \n\nMy solution? I'm trying to spend less time on Reddit and more time reading. Why engage a 25 yo college dropout that unironically believes that the current US administration is the best thr country has ever seen when I could read the works of genuine experts?
4	For me usually the topics I enjoy the most are the ones that I have never thought about. Give me a new idea or a new perspective on an idea I know and I'm yours. Those are the discussions where I learn the most about myself and the world in general.\n\nWhat grinds my gears and gets me worked up is any discussion where a person supports an idea that makes absolutely no sense and is actually proven to be false, like for example what you said about flat earthers. However, usually instead of making me talk like a madman what it gives me is a desire to punch said person in the face, because chances are no talking is going to convince them and the punch will at least make me feel better.
3	You
4	Philosophy 
3	Probably over historical events, and people who are socialist just- I don’t get it. Cool question
3	Politics, specifically Economics 
2	Economics. Especially when people use anegdotes and biases as proofs for their claims...
2	I really enjoy space and future possible events and future possibilities, Fermi Paradox, string theory, Dyson spheres, terraforming and beginning life in new planets.\n\nUsually to get me fired up is when someone tries to come around with their ignorant, ridiculous dumbass opinions and impose them on others. Think the hobby lobby case, abortion, gun control, vaccinations, shit like that.
2	Lord of the Rings vs Harry Potter. Always good for a debate as long as you're on the winning side with the Hobbits. 
2	Anything that doesn‘t quite make sense or seems incomplete and/or not properly thought through.\n\nI generally love theories. I‘ll engage the most in those. And I cannot shut up when we‘re talking about philosophical topics such as existence. My mom knows all those times when I turned a breakfast into a 2/3 hour TED talk, but she‘s an INFJ, she‘ll/does understand.
2	What usually gets me going is seeing how ideas can be generalized, and how we can use already existing solutions to new problems/how we can improve already existing knowledge to create new things.
2	Flat Earthers, Anti-Vaxxers, Feminists... 
1	Anti-social justice discussions give me a headache and are usually just devil's advocate shit, but in the hindering way from the place of someone who's free to give their two bits and move on because they're unaffected anyway.\n\nCould go on for days about Japanese sociocultural climate and history to weebs
4	ENFP Interviewing ENTP Male Mike Silberstein Ne Fe PC/B(S) FF	
1	# "iM a JuMpEr EnTp DoUbLe FeMiNiNe DoUbLe SiDer" 
9	My friends keep comparing me to Barney and Chandler	I'm not complaining. I like Barney from HIMYM and Chandler from Friends. I personally think that they're best ones. Maybe I'm biased haha but being compared to these 2 characters constantly is pretty interesting. I think they're both ENTPs too so I guess it makes sense. \n\nBut yeah, what other characters are you constantly compared with? \n\n&#x200B;
7	Barney for me! I take it as a compliment, that man is a fucking legend
5	ENTP is pretty much the best characters in all the tv shows. \n\nTV likes to give ENTPs the thoughts and ideas of an INTP but also be an ENTP. 
2	But got time to comment on this, yeah you sound real busy pal
2	im a total jim, thats how i see myself (looking at the \*camera\* in reaction to the antics of my enfp/estp/esfp friends) and have been compared to juno a few times
4	>being compared to these 2 characters constantly is pretty interesting\n\nHow is that even remotely interesting? I get occasionally compared to House because I'm a grumpy prick sometimes (or because they think I'm a genius, but I think it's the former). \n\nBottom line is, people will point out superficial resemblances all the time. It's part of making small talk. Personally, I think if you're constantly compared to a fictional character it means you lack any depth because most fictional characters are just regurgitations of cultural archetypes. 
1	Barney is a legend lol
1	I was compared to Monk once, other times to Sheldon Cooper.
1	>But yeah, what other characters are you constantly compared with?\n\nNone as an adult, but a few as a child - you'd have to guess!\n\n&#x200B;
-1	>But yeah, what other characters are you constantly compared with? \n\nNone, because my friends are I are too busy discussing deep and complicated ideas rather than menial trite. 
76	Self development books I think are good for ENTPs	Title. Feel free to add your own\n\n“Grit” by Angela Duckworth. This was is a cold shower because it forces you to realize that being the smart kid actually means very little in how successful you’ll be in life. We tend to be the smart ass who never follows through so there’s that. But the book also provides good, science-based advice on how to develop your grit and how to build a call (or mission) for your life. Worth checking out.\n\n“So good they can’t ignore you” by Cal Newport. Explains success and why some people “make it” and some not in a very logical and fact-based way. It was a breath of fresh air from the vague cookie cutter nonsense that a lot of self help books give you.\n\n“Deep work” by Cal Newport. Kind of a follow up to the previous one. Fact-based and deliciously rational. Also a cold shower because it basically yells at you “get focused you *fuck*”, but I never hear it enough.\n\n“40 ways to be miserable” by I don’t remember. Just some basic advice that a self-sabotaging idiot like me needed. CGP Grey made a video about it if you want a summary.
24	Does alcohol count as a self development book? 
28	The subtle art of not giving a fuck by mark manson is nice for some positive reaffimment that we are right
7	Every fucking ENTP needs to read or listen to "Can't hurt me" by David Goggins, that's it, no other book for so called self help.
17	Those kinds of books are just mental masturbation. I have never heard a story of success starting from a self help book that was not a pitch to sell the book. And this is coming from someone who has read dozens of them. It just never sticks. In the end it's just a lot of text meant to motivate you and nothing more. It's information you add from the outside. It can help with some things, but it won't affect your brain that much because it's not really connected to anything that can make it stick.\n\nI think the best way to change your way of handling life is by thinking and building your own ideas, not by passively absorbing someone else's. Also if you actually examine most of these books the information provided is quite obvious and chances are you were actually aware of it, so it's even less new information. If your idea bucket is empty and you want to actually find new ideas to think about try Nietzsche (if you can understand what the fuck he is trying to say most of the time) or any random philosopher that you have heard of at some point in your life. Usually what they say is not that obvious and requires reading the same thing a few times because it's so fucking complex your mind can't really comprehend the whole idea on the first try. Overall this means you will spend quite a bit of time analyzing their ideas to understand them by basically building up their idea in your own Ti-vision of the world, and once you understand what they mean the idea will stick with you for much longer, because even if someone else came up with it you spent a lot of time actively thinking about it and trying to understand it.\n\nActually now that I think about it, I would love to see an experiment where they try to teach some kids a concept giving a control group a full text and another group the same text except taking out a word from every second sentence, and see which group understands it better and remembers it longer. My bets would be on the kids who had the edited text.
5	I would 100 percent recommend stoicism, if you want a simple book read the daily stoic. in my experience stoicism is very compatible with our personality, it makes up for what we sometimes lack.
5	I have been reading like 8 pages of 'Grit' every couple months for the last 2 years.\n\nBasically sums up my relationship with books. Guess I'm just too zoomer unmedicated ADHD'd out to pay attention long enough. Works well for my job in ads though.
5	> by Cal Newport\n\n> by Cal Newport\n\nThe year I read Cal Newport's blog posts was the year I became truly organized and productive. I think his system works for me because it creates sooooo much free time. Like, he basically says, "Why study on a Friday night when you should be partying?" and I think that's a beautiful message. You can replace "partying" with "reading," "Wikipedia-bingeing," or "butterfly-collecting," but the point is your time belongs to YOU, not to your work.
3	The one by I don't remember looks interesting. Might give it a read
3	Two self-help books that actually give you the means to do something about yourself: "Getting Things Done" by David Allen and "The Tools" by Phil Stutz and Barry Michels. \n\nDavid Allen coaches CEOs and other influential people on how to be effective at being productive. Half of it explains the concepts the other half helps you set it up. Really good stuff because it allows you to be productive with minimal effort. Every ENTP should implement this book in their life!\n\nPhil Stuttgart and Barry Michels give you actual psychological "tools" that you can implement to improve yourself. Instead of being told by psychologists why you are the way you are, these tools help you improve yourself and fix problems: increase confidence, motivation, remove procrastination, do things you dislike. \n\nUsing the above books I moved up four positions in nine months. They work!
2	I’d like to recommend 48 laws of power, if not everyone here has read it already 
2	Cal Newport’s books are good, I second the recommendation. \n\n“Atomic Habits” by James Clear is the best book on habits that I’ve read and very practical. You can implement the stuff from this book right away. \n\n“Why We Sleep” by Matthew Walker is practically required reading for just about anyone because even if you acknowledge the importance of sleep, I can almost guarantee you still vastly underestimate it. Will make you borderline neurotic about getting the right amount of sleep because of the countless studies on the benefits of sleep and the countless detriments to just about every measure of health when you’re sleep deprived (just 5 hours is already mild deprivation). \n\n“Why Buddhism is True” by Robert Wright. Interesting book that shows the ways in which eastern spiritual principles and neuroscience overlap. It’s also a good primer when it comes to the illusory nature of free will (along with “Free Will” by Sam Harris) which is helpful to know. \n\n“Influence” and “Pre-suasion” both by Robert Cialdini are also must reads, IMO. Great intros to the basics of social psychology. As social creatures and as people living in a world where we’re marketed to left and right, it’s important to be aware of how we’re being influenced and persuaded.\n\n“The War of Art” by Steven Pressfield (not to be confused with Art of War). Probably the most giftable book there is because it’s short enough to be read in about an hour or two and each passage is only a short paragraph. It talks about the struggle against the force of “Resistance” (i.e. procrastination, fear, avoidance) and the many forms it takes and the many ways it can trick you into not doing what needs to be done. It’s written from Pressfield’s perspective as a writer dealing with writer’s block, but applies to just about everyone. It’s so easy and so quick of a read that you can’t go wrong with this.
2	No shade to you OP. This is an ENTP rant about this subject. \n\nAs an ENTP I don't give a shit about self improvement. I had success being exactly how I am. Self improvement is bullshit that is fed to us by all the J's in the world. ENTP'S succeed by being the most important person in the room regardless if people even know it. We are the visionaries, the idea machines. Success comes from others benefiting from our influence. \n\nThe term Success is vague, idealistic, subjective, oppressing, non creative garbage.\n\nThe subtle art of not giving a fuck was the only self improvement book I have started to read.
2	Switch by Cheap and Dan Heath\nUnflattening by Nick Sousanis\nLiminal Thinking by Dave Gray\n\nThese are all books which actually lean into our ENTP nature, which I think is a much better approach than trying to work against it or 'fix up' our weaknesses. \n\nBusiness Model Generation - to teach you how tertiary Fe can be used to your advantage as an inventor.
3	Also, I found Jordan Peterson's 12 Rules for Life to be useful and not so abstract. 
1	All sound like solid leads. Thanks OP.
1	> science-based advice on how to develop your grit and how to build a call (or mission) for your life. \n\nEh, the overall message of the book I got, but her Grit Scale came off a little too *Dianetics* for my taste
1	Self development Books, one of the most useless things ever created. \n\nJust educate yourself about social and natural sciences. Read some novels and you ll already have developed yourself.\n
1	I would add to this list Power by Jeffrey Pfeffer
1	48 Laws of Power\n\n16 rules of success\n\nIntelligent Investor \n\nThe Prince- Machiavelli \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\^ If your trying to go places
1	"Self-envelopment" books are great because the ego loves to build around itself, while you follow like a donkey on a leash.\n\nTao Te Ching goes a different path, the one of return... you will have to read more than one translation to get a picture out of the word.

1	JP's political agenda is as a classical liberal is basically mind your own business, seek truth, and don't be an SJW.  And the book is basically a guide on discipline and wisdom--something fathers have gotten away from teaching their children. Think for yourselves fellow ENTPs. 
2	Need Answers (Totally Unrelated to this sub)	With retail stores, banks, and even some service  sector companies ditching brick and mortar store fronts, commercial property use is starting to transition.

I by no means have collected enough data for a full picture, but it seems a lot of old retail space is being converted to senior living. \n\nSenior Living might be the "best use" for the next ten years or so, but what afterwards? \n\nAs anyone run into any interesting ideas for how to utilize old retail space? [d6,h4]\n \n
3	In the area I live most out-moded retail spaces have become service and entertainment. Restaurants and bars, places where you can drink a coffee while playing board games, adventure dating attractions, and micro-brews, and specialty grocers. \n\nMost manufacturing, had become condos, and food markets.
3	>d6,h4\n\nPawn to e5
1	Landfill, solar array, regular housing, farm, wind farm, mine, warehouse, distribution \n  \nEach location has different needs and different optimal use cases
1	Any senior living is going to be good for much more than the next 10 years.  \n\nMaybe some of it can be converted back to natural space: parks, playgrounds, trees, etc. I mean things like strip malls, shopping malls, etc. Less so commercial space on city blocks, etc.
12	All of my friends are INFP’s, what are yours?	I’m an ENTP and after having a slight obsession with Meyers-Briggs, I decided to introduce it to many of my friends. I would say I have about 10 people I converse very well and frequently with, and all of them besides for 2 are INFP. Some other people who I have recently met, but also had very intelligent/philosophical debates or discussions with have also stated they are INFP’s. It’s a little scary to me, and I was wondering if anyone else finds them attracting a certain type to this extreme level as well- or if they too tend to have quality relationships with INFP’s?
10	(INFP)  Whenever I run across INFP appreciation threads like these in other MBTIs I'm always like "Aw shucks, you're not so bad yourself, internet strangers!"\n\n&#x200B;
5	i am enfp and weirdly, a lot of the people i am close with are also infp. there’s something weirdly wonderful about them, they stick to their convictions like no one else and they’re very trustworthy. they are not people pleasers which i struggle with a bit, so yeah, basically pretty awesome people
4	Yup! Or at least most of my favourite people are. My sister, who I'm very close to, one of my best friends, and my beyond amazing SO. \n\nI find them easy to get along with as, not only are the ones I know fun and smart and interesting to talk to, they're really good trustworthy people who are generally upfront and sincere, and you know what they think about things.
5	My wife, my best man, and two other close friends are INFPs.  I'm also close to at least three INFJs.  We all joke that I'm the INFx whisperer.
5	That's interesting I only have one INFP friend and that's one of my best friends. The other two are ENFP and ENFJ. 
4	ENFP's. The ones I've met are extremely intelligent but I just can't stand their Fi-fueled rants.
3	My girlfriend is INFP\nMy best friend is ISTP
2	INFP, ESFP, INFJ, ENFJ
2	I think that according to the 16 personality type tests, the "diplomats" (enfp, infp, enfj, infj) are really common and easy to get along with. Since we're all just people, and diplomats tend to be plentiful, we find that a lot of people surrounding us are Infps, enfps and so forth. It's tempting to say that wow, as an ENTP im "attracted" to INFPS! Is this true for all ENTPS? Even if every single person on this sub corroborated this claim, it's still truth that we're just people with different experiences to differentiate us. Even if we have "similar brain processes," it's still a stretch to think that we're just randomly attracted to a certain type. 
2	I’m an INFP and my boyfriend is an ENTP. His roommate (who he’s really good friends with) is an INFP, two of their friends are, and I’m sure there are more. I guess we get along well, lol. 
2	Most of my friends are nfs
2	My close friends?\n\n4 INTP\n2 ESTP\n1 INFJ\n
2	This isn't unusual.  They tend to gather in packs, seeking each other out.  So even though they're only about 5% of the population, they usually tend to gather in pools -- usually pools of tears -- where they mutually support each other.  \n\nSince ENTPs are naturally charismatic and INFP just intuitively understand people at a deep level at first glance, they likely just glom onto you, like moths to a lone flame on a moonless night. \n\nOr do you have tissues in your pockets?  They might sense those.\n\n
2	Okay, I gotta be honest with you, this is my first reddit post ever and I made an account just so I could comment! \n\nI screamed when I read the title because ALL my close friends are also INFP's and I was quite intrigued by it. I'm so excited about the similarities between ENTP's; regardless of where we come from, or who we are, we're still so weirdly similar.\n\nAll of my close friends are INFP's and I'm not sure WHAT it means. I will say that ENTP's are sometimes referred (to my connotative displeasure) to as Debaters, while INFP's are sometimes referred to as Mediators. That in itself is an interesting pair, don't you think? A debater, who wants to stir the waters, paired with a mediator, who wants to calm them? \n\nScience shows us that things always want to reach equilibrium. I think THAT may be the key behind the ENTP and INFP relationships and the surprising rate at which they tend to happen.
1	INFP, INTP and an INFJ\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow do I tag my type next to my name? ;-; I'm an INFP
1	Mainly INFJ and INTJ. I know a lot of INFP (and ENTJ) but not really close with them. 
1	Friends are :\nINFP, INTP, ENTJ and ISTJs. 
1	2 ENFP \n\n1 ENTP\n\n1 ESTP\n\n1 INFJ \n\n1 INFP
1	Don't know what my friends are, but my wife is an INFJ. That gets... Interesting
1	I have a lot of pretty diverse friends, but my three closet friends are ENFP, ENTJ, and INTP
1	Friends: ENTP, ENTP, ISFP, ISTP, ISTP, ISTP, IXTP, IXTP, ESTJ, ESTP (I talk to these people a lot and I show them the real me, we help each other)\n\n"Friends": INFP, INFP, INFP, ENFJ, ENFP (I appease these people regularly and keep them around so they may serve a use in the future, they are unstable)
1	All of my closest friends are entjs
1	Oldest friends that I’ve never once had drama with: ENTJ and ESTJ. Sooo easy to get along with. \n\nBest friend: ENTP. Similar to me in most aspects but so argumentative that I have to purposely avoid setting her off about certain things we disagree about since she can’t seem to entertain the possibility that she could ever be wrong. \n\nMe and the ENTP’s mutual close friend is an ISFP and she gets her feelings hurt way too easily by our ENTP friend. Gets doubly offended when I laugh at the absurdity of it. \n\nWas friends with an INFP for a year recently due to circumstance and everything upset her too. Nice girl but I have no idea how she functions in life. Really sweet and conveying of warmth, which was refreshing every now and then given that the rest of my friends are colder than me. 
1	All INXX with one ISTP
1	I noticed that alot of my close friends have been infps as well. I love them and we usually get along great but sometimes when I’m not careful I run into the problem of offending them or hurting their feelings and I feel a bit bad then. It’s funny because in high school almost all of my friends we NT types so I didn’t have to worry about that as much but now they’re mostly NF types
1	ENTPs are attracted to people who are good at listening our crazy shit, which is a core trait of INFPs. ENFPs are also keen to make friends with anyone interesting, so guess NTPs are a good subject for that. Also, people are often attracted to their introverted sidekicks and vice versa, since they have the same structure, but are balancing each other's ego strengths. Hence, NFPs, SFPs, NFJs (rare) NTPs tend to flock together within their I/E counterparts. Other common couplings (friend or spouse) are NTPs to NFJs or SFJs, NFPs to NTJs and STJs, NTPs to NFPs and ISTJs to ESP, ISFJs to ESTJs, ISFJs to ESFPs. Ahh.. XOXX or XOOX (swap X, keep O) are kind of frequent in sensors, quite often SJs and SPs seek for their own temperaments as well. Not enough data to make more accurate correlations from.\n\nPersonally, I have a very wide group of friends and acquaintances (and a very narrow of very good ones), but out of all types, I get along with NTPs and NFPs and NFJs the best. NTJs are the only intuitives that I haven't befriended that strongly due to very low encounter rate. NFJs are rare too, but somehow they come to me like moths find a light source in the darkness. The ENTJs I know are too focused on their career and doing everything they can that it's hard to get a hold of them, and I find them a bit uninteresting & clashing in terms of thinking. That Ti vs Te don't mix well. They're basically ESTJs with longer term goals and generally more ambitious. Also I don't think I've actually ever met an INTJ in a peer group to make friends with. Other instances yes, but the encounters have been too short, yet interesting.
1	All my friends are ESxJs. It's a struggle. \n\nOn the bright side my best friend is an INTP
1	My sole and absolute best friend is an INFP. She's a little dumb (or maybe I am too smart xD) but we get along really well, not to mention that we've currently fought are not talking to each other but I know all of it is temporary because we'll end up resolving issues no matter what. 
1	All my exes are infps. And some of my closes friends are infps. 10 in total. It is also scary to me why i keep attracting these INFPs and im also mad at the same time. 
1	My two best fiends are INFP (the person I connect with the most, I really like his personality and way of thinking), and ISFP (We don't connect as much as with the INFP friend, but there is a lot of trust betwteen us, and I really like how accepting and open-minded she is).
1	Have three INFP friends (2 I'm pretty close with), best bud is INTP and myriad of other types I guess. 
1	INFPs
1	Either other ENTPs or xNFJs (mainly INFJs), got a couple of ISTP/ENFP friends too. Not too keen on INFPs, they seem to take everything very personal and I feel like I am walking on eggshells around them. They are also incapable of being logical.
0	ESTJs. Loooove me some ESTJs.
8	Is it possible to be completely apolitical ENTP?	A question to my fellow entps, I've been into history ever since I was a little kid and as I grew older I became also interested in politics and I am now looking for a career in the said field\n\nNow my question is, regardless of which way you swing politically right or left. I'm not trying to start a shit storm of argument here (entp board, lol) the question is more about an idea as a whole\n\nIs it possible for ENTPs to not have any interest in history or politics and etc? Like I'm crazy into politics and can talk about this shit for hours. Am I the only one and when it comes to debating other folks can and will debate only about music and movies? 
8	I honesty don't know.\n\nEven though I keep saying "No, I dislike talking about politics because it will break your relationship when your believes crash," in the end I still talk about politics for hours.
4	Nice timing. Last night I noticed my knowledge of American history is poor. I can't remember half the presidents, let alone their political affiliations or actions. Mostly because I never stayed on top of it past secondary school. \n\nMy interaction with modern politics isn't out of interest, but out of duty. As a voter, I think it's important to stay up to date on recent events so I can make informed voting decisions. So it's mostly a job in my eyes, and jobs suck. \n\nTheoretically, I do find analyses of political structures interesting. For instance, it seems tax plans (conservative vs liberal) depend on where you place more weight on economic duty (who has the most money, or where most of the money is). \n\nPolitically I tend to lean centrist on most issues. Either out of ignorance (E.g. trade agreements) or ambivalence (E.g. social issues like marriage). For example: I'll say I "support" gay marriage, but that's only superficially due to the political climate. My real view is more inquisitorial: marriage is by and large a religious construct, in spite of its conferred federal benefits. In other words, religious ideology and governmental ideology are interwoven into the concept, which I think is constitutionally invalid. It makes more sense to just throw marriage away to the religious folk, and instate federally recognize unions which are divorced from canonical marriages. \n\nOr another example would be abortions. I unilaterally support them, but there's a peculiarity in them. Late stage abortions are often advocated if the mothers health is in danger. So, what about post birth if the mother's *well being* as an adult is in danger? Pre-natal late stage abortion isn't really different from neo-natal *euthanasia*, as far as I can see. The only discriminator is birth, the transition from fetus → infant. So my argument is that *if* an abortion is advocated in late stage cases, then neo-natal euthanasia should simultaneously be allowed. Since neo-natal euthanasia is typically barred, I think the logical thing is to unilaterally oppose late stage abortions. \n\nWhat I'm getting at here is that political positions often don't make sense when inspected closely. They're almost always contradictory as far as I can see and are ethically self defeating. So then why take the stance at all? \n\nHence ambivalence, centrist, and sarcastic positions like the Regressive Party. Against abortions but for killing babies. 
3	If you want to do this for a living, then go ahead. Don't let us hippies tell you not to do something you want to do for a living. Best of luck.
3	I have no interest in politics... to an extent.\n\nThere are many reasons for this, but the main ones are two.\n\nOne is I cannot vote in the country I reside in because I have no citizenship. I can vote in my home country, but I do not know enough about how the system there works and the country itself is extremely corrupt to the point of requiring something bigger than electing a different party to be fixed.\n\nThe second reason is I do not believe in democracy. I know it's the best system we have, but I do not believe it's the most effective nor efficient we could have. Also I do not think I can come up with a better one, and much less with a way to implement it, so I prefer to stay out of all of it.\n\nHowever, as much as I want to stay outside, lately political discussions have been pissing me off to the point of making me want to punch people left and right (hehe). On one side I see a bunch of modern lefties offended by everything, who try to attack and silence any opinion that does not 100% agree with theirs, and it even seems they can't agree between themselves most of the time. On the other side the right wing edgelords who shape their whole personalities around exposing how stupid the former group can get. Both groups keep playing a stupid game where each group fuels the other group's hate by finding the dumbest individuals in the other group and using their words and actions against the whole group in their own circlejerk forums, subreddits and other platforms. Then media comes and spills gasoline over the fire by publishing overly sensationalist articles that only create more problems for everyone by spreading biased or even false information.\n\nI can rant on this for hours, but this is my main view on politics right now. It might sound I do not care about the world I live in, but that's not the case. I choose to leave politics to people who want to bother with them while I bother with thing I can actually influence in a meaningful way. Luckily I have been born with a brain that is relatively good at finding patterns and using it to solve problems is something I enjoy, so my goal in life is to find a way to use it in a way that helps humanity, so I'm going into academia. I am aware chances are I will never really contribute in a meaningful way to humanity in the field I have chosen, and still I find it more realistic for me to solve a millenium problem than to fix any problem we currently have in our political system.
3	Seriously of course yes...\n\nIt's a personality type, being apolipitical has nothing to do with a personality trait.
3	Seriously of course yes...\n\nIt's a personality type, being apolipitical has nothing to do with a personality trait.
3	I am also into both of those things. I will say that I definitely get tired of the culture surrounding politics. I don't really know any other ENTPs (I do have suspicions) so I can only speak for myself. I would think that most would be very interested in politics, but I could also see a bunch hating it because it often turns into the exact kind of conversation we hate. Less debate, more opinion and feelings. At least as an American, that's how I see it. Its kinda hell sometimes, because literally half of the people I talk to deny reality and any source I site. 
2	I'm usually ambivalent about those topics, because I either don't care enough to spend time forging a certain political stance and/or I'm just simply not knowledgeable.
2	I find it to be fairly common, because it is easy to confuse even ourselves when we are arguing for a point that we may not necessarily agree with etc. Also ENTPs seem to be one of the quickest types to change views and lifestyles which means by the time one is done sliding across the political spectrum they probably end up just moving on from the idea altogether in search of greater horizons
2	I won't debate about politics because my views on most issues are pretty dynamic, and there is something to be taken into account within most ideologies (though there is one in particular that I absolutely will not budge on).  I will debate music all day, every day, maybe because those kinds of debates are relatively meaningless.\n\nIn answer to your question, I can't imagine why it wouldn't be possible.  I don't think it's particularly probable for any NT to not have even a passing interest, because it's prevalent and a general term umbrellaing several concepts, but there are always exceptions to rules.

1	I sure as hell am not one. I'm shitty to people that I perceive as being shitty to the undeserving. I guess my perspective on it is more like a comedian and I want to take the piss out of the powerful and the brutish while trying to uplift the oppressed and downtrodden. I like to make people who seem entitled feel a little (read: a lot) more undeserving.   There is generally a political position that this would align with. 
1	Personally, I am not apolitical. However, I hate to speak politics. In my own country, the government is controlled by narrow-minded people. So, you know, the intellectuals became minority, we tend to show harsh reactions to the intolerable events.  Just, it is. You can't change a narrow-minded person's mind. Besides, I don't need to change the ideas of the other ones. Why should I bore myself with those stuff? Though, I still try to alter the minds of the taxi drivers by asking questions in a Socratic manner when I am drunk. In the end, I piss them off and nothing more. In addition, my father has been involved in provincial/national for many years. What I've seen is, provincial and national happen through nasty human tricks and people are garbage. I hate politics in my own country as a definite result.\n\nThough, I find my political knowledge base insufficient. I need to read the essential philosophical books on politics (Republic, Politics etc.). I need to re-learn world history. I need to follow the recent news. That's how I will be able to discuss politics truly.
1	I’m mostly apolitical because I don’t really see myself as having much power to change anything. And I also see political arguments as a waste of time and energy for the most part because nobody deliberately chooses to believe in what’s “wrong”, so you’re unlikely to sway anyone with even the most rational arguments. \n\nI’m also contrarian af and don’t really have any strong allegiances so my stance changes a lot as I gain more info and experiences. I went from left, to center, to center right, to center, and now further left than originally. And I still don’t take it all too seriously. \n\nEven in terms of D&D alignments, I always score as “True Neutral”. I know being overly neutral/centrist is a meme now, partly because it’s seen as indecisive, but I really don’t see anything wrong with it.

6	I made an intj hate me today.	I was being my generally annoying self then he didn't talk to me thereafter.... Looks like I need to distance myself again. So, what should I do? Do I leave or do I stay? Do I beg for forgiveness? I can never keep friends, I really struggle with this.\n\n\nUPDATE: WE MADE UP. actually, I said sorry and he said I worried uselessly so I should not have apologised. So like I never did anything bad and he was just tired or smthn. So huhu
8	Apologize and tell him for your part, your still his friend.
7	If you got the door slam you may be out of luck. They rarely ever open back up. \n\nI know the feeling of saying doing something then regretting it later. Over time, enough of these door slams should help you (and me) slam our mouth shut first. 
7	My sister is an INTJ so I'm pretty familiar with their typical MO. INTJs have zero problems with solitude, so they don't suffer fools, like ever. But just being annoying usually isn't enough to make them hate you or door slam you. You gave almost no information in your post as to what was actually said or done, but it's likely that this INTJ simply wasn't in the mood for your bullshit and has better things to do. If you did something specific or offensive, just own it. Probably a text would be fine. "Hey, I know when I said x I was out of line. Sorry if I crossed a line, no harm meant" sort of thing. And then in future, watch yourself, look for nonverbal cues that demonstrate that someone isn't vibing with you and stfu the next time you enter dangerous territory. Just don't push it. INTJs don't expect perfection in other people, but they are extremely aware of patterns. So if you regularly push beyond their boundaries and show no accountability or willingness to meet them halfway, they're out. If you have demonstrated that you don't care about their preferences, there's no benefit to interacting with you and therefore they won't. While INTJs love bantering and expounding on weird ideas more than most, at their core is iron willed pragmatism. If it doesn't benefit them, they don't do it. Period. They are almost immune to manipulation and don't especially care about social norms or niceties beyond the pragmatic benefit that people are more compliant to their will if they don't hate you. That's not to say they don't care or are heartless, it's that they specially care very much or not at all. So if you betrayed your INTJs trust or violated their ethics in any way, you're screwed and it's over. Otherwise, take ownership of your mistake and don't continue to do it and they'll likely give you another shot. But you will have to make the effort most likely. \n\nGood luck!

3	You made them hate you in “we had an argument about xyz” way or made them hate you by being a backstabbing asshole? The first is going to be fine tomorrow, the latter is probably the end.
3	You're fine the way you are, not everyone is going to like you and that's okay too. That being said fuck that guy lmao. I hate when people can't just sit down and talk like normal people. "Hey, thi thing you did bugged me because XYZ" \n\nDone. Simple. Lame ass.

3	Inferior Si struggles	Ok fellas, I know this has been talked about A LOT but I still wanna post about it and I just don't feel like searching the whole subreddit for a couple of posts. \n\nSo the struggle about inferior Si is OTHER PEOPLE, especially close relatives. They won't stop telling me to put my life together, and that someday I will regret not taking these years of my life seriously enough, and it's got to a point where it's emotionally harming to hear these things over and over again. \n\nIt's simple: I don't give a single one of the thousands of fucks I could give about having a stable life. As long as there's something new keeping me busy, as long as there's intense things to live (not necessarily good ones, that's the part they absolutely don't understand) and as long as I'm content with what I do and my actions don't directly harm others, I'm just where I want to be. \n\nThey say that I won't be happy in the future, that I won't be able to settle down and find a job for the rest of my life... And I don't know how to make them understand that I don't want those things, that I don't value them as much as they do. The thing that pisses me off the most is that whenever I try to explain this in a calm way, they just come at me with arguments that make zero sense or they try to make me feel bad about it saying "but we do care about your mental health/ well being". I mean... My mental health is fine, thanks, and what I just tried to explain to you is that my well being depends heavily on NOT settling down... \n\n\nIs there any way I can make them understand this or am I just being immature?
4	> Is there any way I can make them understand this\n\nIt sounds like you've been trying. As long as you're not dependent on them, and your lifestyle isn't a burden to them, do you owe them any explanations?
2	I think it's smart to consider the possibility of you changing your mind in the future and deciding you actually want a stable life. Choosing stability sounds boring and lame now, but believe me, it sounds amazing when you take a look at your bank account and realise you only have enough money to pay two weeks of rent, your next paycheck arrives in four, and you are alone 2000km away from home and anyone who could help you, living with your landlord who also needs the money and other 6 people you have met a month ago. It's not easy to decide if you are going to ask your parents for money when they also are struggling financially or if you are going to ask your boss, who hired you just a month ago after a two month long job search, to pay you half your salary earlier because you fucked up your numbers.

2	If Ti and Si are "whole" models, won't ENTP eventually reach them too?	I'm an INTP, and there are some thing my Ti has right. Some things not, but as I learn more my Ti models of the world will eventually be accurate. Te on the other hand is just data collection endlessly. Ti has the whole model and, if right, all Te data points collected in the future will line up with that model.\n\nA similar effect should happen for Si and Se, Ni and Ne, and Fi and Fe.\n\nIf this is true, then won't ENTP with inferior Si eventually also reach this "whole" model? It may take longer than any other type but they should reach it given Si isn't "expanding."\n\nNe on the other hand is just data collection. I.e. dom Ne will always have more data collected than aux/tert/inf Ne. There is no limit to data collection for specific contexts.\n\nIs this correct? Or is Si simply not able to be codified into the ENTP conscious because by using Ne all the time they intrinsically render the Si model temporarily useless?
4	> but as I learn more my Ti models of the world will eventually be accurate. \n\nI think Ti converges towards accuracy and abstraction, but not necessarily precision.  Whereas Te, ever collecting more empirical data, can build a nest of exceptions to handle any case with precision -- like a giant flow chart that handles all possible cases exactly.   So Ti tends to become more generalized and Te becomes more expert.\n\nI think Ti is essentially a distillation of Te.  That is, if Te represents the empirical rules we observe in the world, then Ti represents an internalized model of those rules.   All models, by their nature, are simplifications and abstractions.  Their goal isn't typically to be precise, but rather to explain some general principle with a mechanism that can be generally predictive.  (Hence why the Ti archetypes tend to be system builders and theorists, trying to internalize their Ne/Se Perceptions, and Te archetypes tend to be architects and engineers and 'masterminds', trying to externalize their Ni/Si vision.) \n\nIt's like Ti takes that giant Te flowchart and notices certain rules.  If a flowchart box is a hexagon, you always take choice D, and the *reason* for that is that a hexagon has 6 sides - 2 = 4th letter.  Then Ti posits that if the box is a triangle you should take choice A, etc.   Then it comes up with a formula that simplifies the whole mess down into an abstraction and does away with the flow chart entirely.  Until Te notices more exceptions that break the law.\n\nAnd so it goes back and forth....Te creating empirical laws and Ti reducing them to principles which predict laws that Te then tries to find exceptions to... a kind of experiment-theory loop. \n\nIn the same vein, you can view Fi as a set of principles pulled from how someone understands the social dynamics and rules around them (Fe).   You can see Si as a distillation of expectations, a learned bias,  about things experienced in the world (Se) (like the fact that stops signs are red.  It's not a fact you 'notice' every time you see a stop sign, because you've come to expect that is always the case.  But a blue stop sign would immediately be a conscious perception. ) And lastly for Ni but on the categorial level instead of the details level.  (If Si draws an internal road map of reality, Ni draws a schematic of themes.) \n\nSo these processes are really just two sides of the same function, and which side we expose to the light of consciousness, our predilection for being theory minded or empirically minded, is essentially what determines our personality type as a kind of average value of those preferences.  The other side of the coin goes onto the back burned of the subconscious as we Perceive and Judge automatically without giving it any though (the biases of expectations for Pi and the biases of assumptions for Ji) \n\n> Is this correct? Or is Si simply not able to be codified into the ENTP conscious because by using Ne all the time they intrinsically render the Si model temporarily useless?\n\nI think it's best to see Ne and Si  as complements of each other, due to the dichotomy of N and S.   If we think of Ne as being Perception gathering at the conceptual level, and it being a process that dominates the consciousness, then what are we ignoring (but yet still Perceiving unconsciously?).   Well, if Ne is about being interested in novel, conceptual ways of seeing things, then what we should ignore in favor of that is the old, already known, well-understood ways of putting 2 and 2 together.   Likewise, if you tend to favor and trust the tried and true status quo (Si dom), then new, untested, untried, spontaneous, dynamic (etc) solutions are met with suspicion.   It's like describing the same glass of water as half-full or half-empty.  And just as that attitude towards  the glass says you're an Optimist or Pessimist, your attitude towards Perception determines if you're NeSi or SiNe favoring. \n\nSo it's not that Si is useless.  In fact, it's necessary.  Because, how can you possibly get excited about what is new and fresh and exciting, if you simultaneously can't tell what things you've *already* experienced enough to know that they're not doing anything new.\n\nSo, ultimately Si is just a redundant complimentary description of Ne (or vice-versa) but there is a utility in maintaining the distinction, because we can use that to build qualitatively different description of Ne-doms and Si-doms. \nISFJs get annoyed if you don't bother writing their description and just refer to them as ENTP^(complement).\n\nSomething to ponder -- since in the same manner every type that has Ti also has Fe (and never Fi),  following the above reasoning, in what way can Fe a termed a redundant description of Ti?  (This was something that was very insightful for me to think through, so I won't just spit it out.)\n\n
1	Yeah, I think so. I’ve found that even though my Ne will be constantly firing on all cylinders at any given time, many of these thoughts aren’t actually materialized as things I hold to be “true” usually because of what my Ti instincts tell me. If it’s something that I need Si to ground me on then it’s harder to build the “model” because it’s so underdeveloped, but I’ve found as I get older I’ve been able to better read my Si. 
1	Ne and Si work well together. The more you read the more Ne you get. I can't say the same for others. \n\nTi deals with What, Te with How. One deals with the heart, the other with the flesh.\n\nTe: We need to do something!\n\nTi: Is action necessary ? Is it the right action ? \n\n&#x200B;
1	Can someone catch me up on what this all means? Im new to the whole thing
3	Type Change Via Pharmaceuticals	I want to know more how Pharmaceuticals (drugs in general) can affect a person regarding their functions (and mind), even if anecdotal, so yes, especially other XXTPs, specifically on retaining the TP bit. As it goes for a self-report, on Ritalin (strong dose, brief usage, the recognition of the change was striking), I tested as an ISTP (I was not myself as I knew it and decided to test on the drug) and it was so interesting, yet horrifying. I truly didn't give a fuck, I was essentially forced out of my own mind. No more obsessing about ideas, little room for theory or creativity, just 2 + 2 = 4 and a focus on the present. I also wonder, if these kinds of medications can induce a permanent change after a long enough period of exposure. I don't think that this phenomena is particularly abnormal and I find it interesting how drugs can affect how a person acts.
6	I once took the test tripping on 3 hits of acid. Ended up getting INFP, convincing myself I was a "broken" INFP that forced himself to behave like an ENTP to the point of becoming one at the age of 14, then I realized my whole personality is just a combination of genetics and external factors that shaped me into who I am, and that the actual me didn't exist as a thing. That realization combined with the fact that I hadn't even reached the peak of the trip convinced me I was going to forget who I was because of the high dose of psychedelics and probably become an INFP because I had been thinking about being an INFP. That scared the shit out of me because who wants to be an INFP and I decided the only way to save myself was to call a friend who knew me well to stay with me during the peak. Called an ENFP friend, got him out of class (he still gives me shit for that years later) and convinced him to come. He found me literally crying in fetal position in the corner of my room (maybe the transition to INFP had started).\n\nWorst trip of my life, worse than fighting two flying cockroaches with a broom after watching black mirror pre-peak.
3	I just become a focused ENTP when I take Adderall idk wtf ur taking
2	I'm assuming you do actually have ADHD? I can't help but think ADHD somewhat forces us own the EN\*P route. Whether it's causation or simply correlation, I'm not sure.\n\nI started taking vyvanse around 2-3 months ago and I've noticed something similar. It's not so much that it detracts from my ENTP-ness, but it yanks up our Si by the reigns and makes a become a much more dominant function. Certainly the wild thoughts that attributed to my thirst for creativity have been somewhat quelled, but when I do apply myself to something creative I can do so in a much more organised fashion, and with better end results.\n\nFrom what I understand the only lasting effect is generally positive: the balancing of dopamine (where ADHD has a deficit of sorts) allows for your neurons to form connections it struggled to otherwise, which can help offset to a small degree some of the deficits of ADHD. Of course, once you stop taking the medication and these neurons cease to be used fully and they'll eventually die off. Other than that, the meds have no lasting direct effect on your personality (except remembering how shit I am at some stuff without them).
2	With some adhd drugs, i become quite Entj/intj extremmely focused, unpacient, i get mad at people because they take too much time to formulate thougs and i start planning way more, and truly get a harder Ni perspective on things, i just dislike that state,because is boring, if i focus on people is really easy to predict everything theyre thinking and going to say and ill rather be more chilled out, spaced out as im normally am, than some planning psycho.
2	Stimulants bring out Te and Se. Psychedelics bring out Ne and Ni together.  Depressants fuck with Fi.\n\n 
1	Your post has been removed for breaking the Ti rule:\n\n> Use logic. Posts must be able to be logically analyzed. No DAE posts or posts with vague general statements about ENTPs. Meme posts should include a comment from OP relating the post to ENTPs in a logical way.\n\nThis is the part of your post that broke the rule:\n\n> I'm curious if this has happened to other people here\n\n> I do want to hear what others have experienced.
1	Amphetamines tend to make me extremely analytical. I wouldn’t say a type change entirely, but I probably act closer to an ENTJ under the influence of a recreational dose of adderall or dexedrine 
17	An Ego Check from r/ISFP	
13	I think it’s really almost typical for SFs not to get along with NTs except superficially.   We’re opposite quads — different contexts (N/S) and different ways of processing it (T/F).  It’s the most likely chance about not seeing the same situation with any degree of overlap.  \n\nOf course, I’m sure there’s theoretically mature SFPs out there, someplace.
3	There's so many entps posting in that thread it's like a raid this is pretty funny
2	They clearly haven’t met any lady ENTPs yet. \n\nBut I agree that I’ve never understood the whole charming thing. Eccentric, yes. But that’s not everyone’s cup of tea.
1	How do you expect this to ego check anybody
