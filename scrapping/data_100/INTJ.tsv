1	Your "No Memes" example leads to a dead link. Might I suggest replacing it [with this](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)?
1	Ewww what is that example meme!? Hello grandpa, how's it going? Mind catching up with the times.
1	No memes? lol wtf is this garbage? 
1	Sidebar is dead. Pretend like it doesn't exist, because for most Reddit users these days... It doesnt
1	Just tell automod to remove every post or comment with emojis, problem solved.
1	Really? No memes? Lame.
1	Your no meme rules sucks though 
73	So relatable	This was the most relatable posts I ever read about INTJs.\n\n[https://enfp-and-intj.tumblr.com/post/182681465141/intjs-definition-of-self-care](https://enfp-and-intj.tumblr.com/post/182681465141/intjs-definition-of-self-care)\n\n&#x200B;
31	Walking in the alleyway rather than the street because there is less people to interact with.  The Irish goodbye.  Shopping at 5am because the grocery store is empty.  Enjoying being a morning person because everyone is asleep.  Headphones.  Missing the way movies used to work where you could pick your seats based on where everyone wasn‚Äôt, now you pick seats on a computer that look good and everyone sits next to you.
26	* Talking to a random person on the internet or a close friend at least a few hours per day to fulfill their social needs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUmm not this one. Maybe lurking Reddit for a couple hours to fulfill my social needs, but actually talking to someone for that long seems outrageous.
11	Cute.  Leaves out INTJ‚Äôs interactions with others which is where we truly need methods of self care due to the constant assault by stupidity, ignorance and public cluelessness.  
18	Are cats supposed to be an INTJ thing? I mean, can see why... dogs are great but they are needy motherfuckers. 
7	Yes!\n\n* Discovering and creating new music playlists. ([Best Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/canadianananas/playlist/3Tl1PN4U8XvcTeNSCt8654?si=PzE8MiupRP6b--K3KKQzdA))\n* Talking to cats and spending time with them.\n* Refilling the glass of water or bottle and place it near desk to remind themselves to stay hydrated.
5	i don't feel special anymore haha
7	I feel exposed.
6	As an INTJ, this is a yes. My life summarized. 
3	The only part of this i disagree with is oversleeping. Being punctual and following my routine is one of the most important things to me,  which includes my sleep schedule. 
2	nicely summarized üòÖ
2	That post is really accurate. Especially the reply text back to the ENFP summarizing their entire day in a few words and wishing them luck. I do that. I‚Äôm also a big fan of cats. 
3	I actually barely tolerate the ENFPs in my life. I love them so much and probably can't live without them but god, I hate when they're too friendly with people. Sometimes they can drive me nuts. 
2	[deleted]
1	stop
1	low quality post
1	As an ENTP this is much my exact definition of self-care as well when I'm in social recovery mode, except maybe the one about talking to people for a few hours. None of that when I'm self-caring, please.\n\nBut then again I guess it shouldn't be surprising. The ENTP's shadow function stack is INTJ, so when the ego is resting it makes sense that my low-energy psyche matches INTJ recovery modes.
1	I especially love that I do almost all of these things with great satisfaction, but without actively thinking of them as self care. They truly are, though. I get an immense amount of joy organizing my surroundings and restocking my office supplies.
1	Refilling the glass of water or bottle and place it near desk to remind themselves to stay hydrated.¬†\n\nYearp, that's me. ^
1	Haha spot on...only in my case it‚Äôs not cats...it‚Äôs parrots 
1	So, I'm totally not staying up late right now, to enjoy the state of the world when everyone else are asleep. Surfing reddit to fulfill my social needs, petting my cat, whilst also creating a bomb playlist.\nMy bottle of water is on my night stand, btw.\n
19	Am I Asexual, or is this just another INTJ thing?	I have had sex before. I wasn't repulsed by it. I enjoyed it when it was happening about half the time. The other half was just me understanding that my partner needed this, even if I never felt I did.\n\nHowever, if you gave me the option between sex and pretty much anything else, I'd choose the other thing. Would I rather eat cookies? Yes. Would I rather snuggle and watch a movie? Yes. Would I rather clean my room, cook dinner, or run errands? Yes, yes, and yes.\n\nThere's also the fact that I never understood the whole "Omg, isn't he hot? Look at those abs. Who do you like right now? You must think someone is cute. I want him to put babies in me." mindset. I can objectively appreciate if a man is attractive, but I do the same thing with women. "Oh, his haircut suits him. Wow, her clothing choice looks great on her." It's all the same to me.\n\nI also never understood why chastity was an issue. I grew up Christian (though currently idk what I am). They were always preaching not to have sex before marriage. And I was just kind of like.... Ok? Doesn't seem like a challenge. Don't want to get pregnant? Don't have sex. It's not that hard. And then I'd see girls in high school knocked up and not be able to fathom how they were that stupid. (No offence to anyone who did, because a lot of them are fantastic mothers. Not meant as an insult, that's just how my teenage brain worked.)\n\nSo are any of you on the same page as me, or is this just a "me" thing?\n\nEdit: So the consensus seems to be that this isn't a personality thing, but more of a low libido/possibly Ace thing. Thank you for all the answers, I really appreciate all of the input you guys gave me. You're steering me in the direction of the answers I need.
10	41F INTJ. \n\nI'm not an asexual, but I have strong demisexual tendencies. I have to have an emotional bond with someone before I'm even interested in having sex with them. Once in a great while, the bond will form almost instantly for me, but it usually takes months before I would even consider having sex with someone... and, by then, my relationship is usually already over anyway (relationships being an INTJ problem unto themselves).
10	Male INTJ, same opinions, same feeling- still doesn't make this an "INTJ thing"
15	Im intj and fucking love sex lol 
6	It's not an INTJ thing, exactly. It's you and your libido not being the best of friends. I'm quite the fiend.
10	I (27F, INTJ) disagree and do relate it to being an INTJ. I grew up not having a ‚Äútype‚Äù, not really caring, etc etc. Then I met someone who I developed a huge emotional connection with (I felt understood, happy, ‚Äúhome‚Äù, excited, etc) and he became the most attractive thing in the world. And of course I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking of him in that way.\n\nFor INTJs (from personal experience and personality type research), you kinda need an emotional connection with someone to be attracted to them and then furthermore be interested in a physical relationship with them.\n\nFor me, I have to be wildly attracted on every level (emotionally attracted, physically, etc) to be interested in it.
4	Or you are a sapiosexual and have never met anyone that heats the boiler. Took me like 10 years to find someone to really have a crush on. 
4	Your question is...ü§î..off.\n\nIt's more complicated than that.\n\nIt's a frequency issue, I think.\n\nThis is an Asexual (somewhere on it's spectrum anyways) issue.\n\nWhile, being also a question of frequency in INTJs issue.\n\nIt seems that INTJs self report higher rates of a asexuality than other types, based on a passing glance from asexuality style post. But it is not the norm it seems for INTJs.\n\nI would be really interested in seeing someone conduct a study on this phenomenon. I am just curious to see how much the numbers differ.\n\n
3	I don't see how libido and personality type are correlated 
2	I think our thirst for knowledge makes everything we know about seem mundane. Since we seek more knowledge the more we know the less satisfying thing become. You need someone that is spontaneous and will make you think. 
3	I'm "ace" too, and INTJs are the type most likely to be asexual - followed by the INFJ type. So yeah, there are a few of us, and I don't think of it as a bad thing.
2	I‚Äôm an INTJ with a high libido ahaha
2	i love sex cuz i need the dopamine
0	You just have low sexual libido.\n\nMy understanding is that this isn't unusual, especially for women.
16	Triggered by mainstream media in my country giving quackery a platform. My rage seems bottomless.	
12	TL;DR millennial kid discovers tarot cards as a hobby, tries to monetize it by claiming it will help clients' mental health by identifying their present feelings. She's neither a trained psyciatrist or tarot reader (which is amusing at best). Local network gives her coverage.\n\nI know stupid people will pay and believe her but the most annoying thing is spreading her quackery. Lately, there is so much in the news about anti-vaxxers and crystals and mineral oils and it's all so very frustrating. 
4	Maybe it‚Äôs time to shut off media instead of giving it a platform in your own life. Read, focus on relationships, plant a garden, etc. 
45	I exclude myself from family/friends	I've had this problem for a long time, and I just would like some help on to maybe why I act this way and maybe some advice to help me. \n\nI'm 19 years old, I avoid spending time with my dad and his side of the family for some reason I don't really know. I love them so much , but for some reason I always prefer to be home or just with my girlfirend. I never seem to miss family either , I could go months to a year without really talking to them. But lately my dads side of the family has been going through quite a bit of problems , and I feel guilted into seeing them and visiting even when I really dont like to hang out with them. They arent very similar to me. They are nice , but pretty judgemental and they have high expectations from me. It takes a lot of energy out of me to be around them because I always feel like I have to act a certain way and I cant really be myself. They are great people, and I love them but I really dont enjoy myself around them ever. So i always tend to stay away from them , visit on holidays of course and see a few other times. But they are a really close knit family, they are always contacting me and wanting me to visit , they are big family people and always are trying to set things up so we can all get together. So I always feel guilted into visiting them , but I really dont enjoy myself around them. I dont want this to be a problem forever , it stresses me out badly. Is there anything I could do about this? I feel maybe I'm just being selfish but I dont know , I'm pretty independent and different to say the least I'm not sure how my brain works I just know I would rather sit at home doing nothing than going to a family event with them.
25	You sound like you have the situation figured out. You get to be who you actually are when you are with your (immediate) family and girlfriend, but you are very drained by pretending to be someone you aren't when you hang out with your extended family.\n\nYour only two choices which actually solve the problem are to either  see them less often or to be yourself around them. I'd recommend the latter. If they judge you for being you, then you have a good reason not to see them again, so there will be nothing to feel bad or stressed about.\n\nGood luck. 
4	My advice, act your normal self, go as and when you feel like it and don't stifle your behaviour.\nIf they don't like your real self then that makes your life easier because they won't want you to come round as much.\nI'd suggest also talking to them about what you'd feel comfortable with in regards to your part in family get togethers.
2	I'm in a similar situation, or at least I was some time ago, my family slowly realized that I don't appreciate time spent with them if it is not on my own terms, when and if I get to choose on my own to spend time with them it's great for all of us, when someone else makes me do it I am just phisically present but miles away in my thought- I don't even hide it even though it does make me look like an insensitive asshole- I'd say things like: I don't wanna be here right now, I'm leaving at the set time because I have important things to do...
2	What are you then, if you have to pretend to be something else?\n\n>  I always feel like I have to act a certain way\n\nWhat is that certain way? Sounds like you have to act to be nice, that you care. If so, everything is up to you.\n\n>  I love them so much\n\nNo one doubts that, but stereotypical INTJ trait is not to directly show it, which leaves many people confused to question things about you.\n\nThey certainly noticed your behaviour and I'm pretty sure they want to let you know that you have nothing to hide and you can be yourself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are not obliged to attend every "family meeting" or answer their invitations (at this age, it would be preferably), but it'd be nice if you contact them regularly just to make sure everything is going just fine and to simply hear their voice.\n\nOne last thing. You are still "just a child" (19 isn't that much) and you have to bear that in mind.\n\n> I would rather sit at home doing nothing than going to a family event with them.\n\nOf course you do. :)\n\n&#x200B;
2	Your story is same as mine. But since i am twice your age then i might give some advice here.\n\nMake sure you at least dont miss the family events. Weddings, relegion related events such as Christmas, and consolation. If you made sure you attended those events, they will not think you are disconnected, just busy with life. \n\nUsually your aunts will be more likely to be happy to see you more often. Women might not understand why you would not visit or call. Men may not care alot of your disappearance. That the case of my family. \n\n
2	Feel this way too, it exhausting.
2	I disagree with the majority here... Hang out with them if you want, don‚Äôt if you don‚Äôt. As an INTJ, I have to save energy up for annoying social events. If it‚Äôs causing you that much stress, just say f it. Honestly. It‚Äôs your life. Enjoy the time with those you enjoy time with. The people that don‚Äôt judge you or drain all your energy. It‚Äôs your life. Enjoy it. Sculpt it to be enjoyable.\n\nI am really comfortable and have energy around certain people, but otherwise I am just bored and exhausted by people. I currently over exert my social energy because we‚Äôre physically near my in-laws and their families and it is very draining. (We‚Äôll be states away soon so I‚Äôm trying to just fit in as much socializing as I can take) I went to Hawaii with my in-laws, sister in law and her fianc√©, sister in law and her husband and it was so exhausting I had almost no fun. It doesn‚Äôt make me a bad person, I just have different social needs.\n\nRealizing I am an INTJ was so freeing to me because it helped me realize it‚Äôs okay to just frickin be me and live how I want. It‚Äôs my life, not anyone else‚Äôs. Just like it‚Äôs your life. Live it. Be happy. 
1	I've always been this way as well, mostly stemming from being so different to my extended family. I love most of my family equally, but I really only enjoy spending time with my parents and siblings, because I feel like they accept me for my unsociable self, where as I feel like my extended family is always judging me for my awkwardness and my need to isolate myself from people.\n\nOnly recently have I come to see things a little differently. For the past dozen or so years, I've done the bare minimum I could get away with when it came to keeping in touch with family, saying no to invitations, keeping to myself at gatherings and so on. And I still do this a whole lot. What I haven't really considered much before, though, is how much of my aversion to my family stems from assumptions about them and generally just simple selfishness. What has mattered to me has been my own comfort and my need to not set myself up to be judged or to feeling discomfort in any situation if I could avoid it. Which, fair enough, but I also believe in doing unto others what I wish to be done unto me, so I've been on some really shaky ground morally here.\n\nMeeting others half way isn't about sacrifice, it's about giving. Even if it's just giving your family a bit of your time, or a chance to get to know you better, or a chance for you to get to know them better. If you always go into family gatherings with the assumption that you'll feel trapped or uncomfortable or just constantly looking for escape, it isn't likely that thing's won't turn out that way.\n\nAnd if your family doesn't matter to you enough to make yourself uncomfortable on occasion, that's fine. Sharing genes is absolutely not indicative of having to share your life with someone. If that is the case, just remember it goes both ways. Push someone away long enough and one day they'll be gone. \n\nSo it comes down to choice. If you choose to not take your family's needs into consideration alongside your own, all you can do is accept the situation and accept that your family won't have any obligation to care about you or your well being either. \n\nAnd I'm not being judgmental with my take, this is simply the thought process I've been going through with this exact same situation in my own life.
1	Don‚Äôt avoid them entirely. It sounds like they are not bad; it is just uncomfortable. \n\nIf it were me, I would probably maintain a distant connection: keep in touch via Facebook, do an occasional favor for them or visit them individually. 
1	I'm going to give some advice as someone who has dealt with this for years.   \n\n\nWhile family is supposed to be there for you, the reality is sometimes being near them is unbearable. Of course you can love them and have their back. But you have to make sure to consider yourself. INTJs need their space, it's just what it is (and there is nothing wrong with that--it's a trait that likely won't change). However there are other types (ESFPs in my experience) that will see anyone who functions differently than them as bad/wrong, and try to change them.  \n\n\nBut as I grew older, I began to notice the people who I butt heads with the most where the ones who really lost control of their lives/screwed up. So I couldn't help be think "You berated me for years for being who I am, but if I had listened to you, I would be in the same mess." And obviously this had bred a lot of negative feelings towards those people because I endured years of anxiety for nothing.  \n\n\nSo for your family's sake, it's important that you don't allow them to guilt you/make you feel inferior--or down the road when you wake up to why you don't like being around them, you might grow to resent them. For example, in situations where say there's a family gathering, but someone will be there who gives you anxiety--IT'S OKAY NOT TO GO.  \n\n\nWhen you do establish boundaries and make yourself more comfortable, you can nurture some healthy relationships with your family members. Because the inevitable result of holding a facade for so many years is, you will just end up having a breaking point and cutting most of them off (I've seen this happen with other INTJs). 
14	Any heartbroken INTJs?	Am I alone in this path :(
14	It's hard. You have to not think about the person and not contact them until you're over it.
8	Been there
11	Yeah, it was brutal. Thing that helped me the most was understanding that the way I felt was the result of a biological process evolved over time to make humans stay together to propagate the species. So when you feel bad, are crying,  etc try to step back and just observe/think about the physical response you're experiencing. "Hmmm... I wonder what's happening in the brain to cause my tear ducts to emit water?" or "I wonder which chemicals in my brain are making me feel this way?" That sort of thing. Sounds weird but it worked for me.
7	I‚Äôve been through so many break ups, honestly about 7 maybe 8 in the last 5 years.  Here‚Äôs the data I‚Äôve collected as far as what to do and not to do.\n\nDONT‚ÄôS...\n\n1. Don‚Äôt drink or do drugs. You risk trying to run away from your emotions or just trying to escape your head end up doing/drinking too much and doing something dumb.\n\n2. Don‚Äôt go looking for a rebound. Your in a vulnerable state, decision making isn‚Äôt at its peak and a re-bound is not the solution it‚Äôs only putting a bandaid on the wound.  when emotions are high logic is low. You risk just grabbing the first person you meet even if they aren‚Äôt a great fit for you.\n\nDO‚ÄôS\n\n1. Process what happened like this \n\nA. What mistakes did you make? Be honest. Were you too negative, controlling, passive? I know I am.\n\nB.how can you improve next time?make a list, write down the characteristics you‚Äôd like to see in yourself in the future.\n\nC. As far as picking a ‚Äúgood partner‚Äù did you make good decisions?\n\nD. If not what characteristics are you looking for in a significant other? write a list, know what you value in another person and know what your looking for.\n\n2. Engage in healthy activities such as working out, hanging with friends, movies, reading and so on. \n\n
5	I've been there.  \n\n\nAnd I would say time. Time and keeping yourself occupied, with gaming or activities or whatever makes you happy. Try to get some fresh air where you can. You can still acquire a new skill, or learn something to advance/better your life and that will help make it a little easier. Taking up something physical especially like yoga/martial arts can help a lot. It's important to try an empower yourself because it can negate feelings of emptiness. INTJs often resort to sensory comfort in these situations so I would recommend to avoid binge drinking/smoking if you can. On the worst days when you don't even have it in you to leave your bedroom, binge on entertainment, and gradually try to incorporate activities throughout the day (even if it's just showering/stepping outside for a minute/having a good meal). Every-time you think about it, it will hurt, but you will get the point where you've thought about it so many times that you have become numb to it. And once you do, you can start to think about other things. I hope you feel better. If you need someone to talk to feel free to PM me.
3	Me :(
3	Create something to look forward to. We are so future focused that when our future falls apart so do we. Make some decisions about what you want out of life and start doing small things to move in that direction. 
2	You‚Äôre definitely not alone. I got back from a deployment to my GF saying she‚Äôs leaving me. Yup. Been rough. \n\nTime has a way of healing wounds though. 
2	No you are not alone. And it's tough now but it will get better.
2	I have two words: Clean. Organize.\n\n
1	you're not alone in this :(
1	Yup. Happened over a year ago. Still fucked up.
1	Happened 10 years ago. Still fucked up. :))))))
1	Oh man. Gf of 3 years left me and it triggered a massive grieving process because I lost my mum as a teenager. Pretty much the worse experience of my life and I'm still reeling, years later. You are definitely not alone.
1	Every single day will be just a tiny bit better than the day before.  \n\nTry to go for a run/walk, workout, go for a hike - it will help both physically and psychologically.\n\nTake a deep breath.  This too shall pass. ‚ù§Ô∏è
1	I, unfortunately, have also been heartbroken.\n\nThe immense pain and regret I felt, I wouldn't wish those feelings to even my worst enemy.\n\nThey way I pseudo coped with it was by bettering myself, exercising and aiming for the top of the class in every subject (every subject but Spanish or music, I hate those).\n\nI talked to the person who broke my heart and realized that I could have been no more than a pawn because I was the only one who was feeling sorrow.\n\nIn the end I realized I broke my heart myself because of the situation I was in.\n\nSo I tried to forget, but I still cry some nights. The pain isn't so intense and my grades have gone up insanely.\n\nI would say you should focus in what matters and not in what mattered and think that it's better to have the memories you made with her/him, its better to have loved and witness that love being destroyed in front of your eyes than not loving at all. After all you must not forget how you got there, remember who you were before the heartbreak and consider if you want to go back being your old self or becoming something new.\n\nI mightn't have explained myself as i would have wanted, but that's because I don't want to write the whole story.
1	Been there
1	I am there right now. GF Broke up about 3 Month ago. I still can't get her out of my mind. I tried alot of things but they didn't helped. The only thing that kinda helps is that I tell myself that she wasn't the right one and that I didn't spent time doing my hobbies. Now I have a new Job, spent more time with my friends, do a little bit sport, read more and started programming again but this still doesn't fill the emptyness of my Hearth.
1	You are lot alone on this path.  This path sucks!  If you need to talk, please message me.
0	*heart?*
3	Do any of you do this when arguing?	I make a speculation and someone disagrees. Then I argue about it as though it were an absolute. After a certain point I‚Äôm not sure what I believe anymore but I feel compelled to argue the opposite point of the other person. I have to do whatever I can to prove that the original point is 100% true even though that wasn‚Äôt my intention at first.
4	I do this on purpose, it furthers both mine and my counterpart's understanding of the subject, a well mediated debate on a subject of my own interest is irresistible whichever side of the argument I'm on...
5	We are not interested in being seen as dominant, or seen as winners of the argument, because we are more interested in understanding and practicality and the non-trivial. Most others are only in it for appearances.
1	Yeah I try to jump out to the meta level and see things from that perspective. And I also try to be deferential and gracious, because I prefer that in others. But then a half hour later I reflect on it again and realize I was right in all aspects. And because the person I was talking to was stuck in his aspect, I should‚Äôve been direct and tactful and waited to doubt myself later.
3	What are cute things your SO does for you? Cute things you would like them to do for you but don't?	If you're single, imagine being in a relationship with someone, then think about these (lol).
3	Randomly give me a bear hug without saying a word which communicates,‚ÄùYou got this. I know you do. Knock em dead.‚Äù \n\nRecognise my individuality and surprises me with elements of it from time to time. Eg RANDOM BLACK MIRROR REBINGE (with discussions of course) or make me a playlist of my favorite classical music and set it so I hear it when I least expect it \n\nGive me enough space to be me. \n\nIs self sufficient and content enough not to rely on me for anything-which will in turn prompt me to do things for him. This makes me happy. \n\nDoesn‚Äôt flinch when I turn into Mr Hyde, judge/hate me for it or take it personally. \n\nDoes chores in the way I want them done..without me asking. Omg yes\n\n...this person is so unrealistic I‚Äôm going to die alone. FML \n\n
1	When bae leaves me alone for loooooong periods of time.
1	He would surprise me with hugs from behind my back, just showing me affection and closeness, making me feel we are one;\n\nHe would know when and how to hug me tightly in order to quiet me down when my Te loses its grip on my Ni, and I cannot cope with my paranoia. That would help my Ni stop working on overdrive.\n\nHe would be childish and make childish jokes and engage in childish games with me. I would grumble, pretending to be putting up with it for his sake, when in fact it would probably mean the world to me;\n\nHe would be able and willing to develop with me a new form of communication. Specific words, mannerisms, anything that we would share and that would impart meaning only to us when either of us use them in the context of our relationship. This would instill efficiency in our communication, and would be a sign of the great level of intimacy and mutual understanding that we have attained.\n\nWell here's to someone that is unlikely to exist. \n\n\n\n
7	Growing up in the middle class	I'd like to assume that a lot of us here grew up or are growing up somewhere in the spectrum of the middle class and what is it like for you guys.\n\nPersonally I think it's the most competitive class with so much lofty expectations because we sort of have a front seat to the upper class as it's workings. We try to keep up appearances and expectations. We compare each other so much that any downgrade causes so much embarrassment.\nAt any given point right now, anyone pursuing an education is really trying to establish a place within the middle class, So as to rise to the upper class..... I don't know....it's all very deep
7	Stop following certain friends/figures/celebs on Instagram. Cold hearts aren't exactly immune to despair.\n\nAs for rising up in the socioeconomic ranks, go full blown INTJ. Study how rich people started, how they handle money, how they got rich and most importantly how they handle money after becoming rich. Draw life lessons from multiple successful people, don't fall for get-rich-quick-schemes and never chase your dreams, that's reserved for those who ARE rich.
6	Or realise that it is in no way logical to obsess over imaginary classes. There is nothing classy about sex tapes, corruption or psychopathically dishonest business deals. \n\nIf you want to clamber up the financial ladder more power to you, follow /u/gale99 's excellent advice. If you want to carve your own path to happiness then first understand that the world is a charade and there is no need to get caught up in the lies. 
3	Meaningless distinctions meant to keep you with your head down and sweat on your brow so you don't think about how things actually work. The middle class never sees the upper class, the middle middle class sees the upper middle class, the oligarchs themselves never come down from Olympus.
2	ok
2	in the united states, there is no middle class anymore (if there ever was one).  only working class and elites
1	Hey idk if you want these but they may be relevant to your interests. I found his theory on social class in America to be interesting \n\nhttp://indiepf.com/michael-o-churchs-theory-of-3-class-ladders-in-america-archive/\n\nAlso it involves system building which INTJs love lol
1	The class issue is a tough one, since of course you have the super wealthy and poor, but also upper middle class, middle management, and working class. The latter three are all technically "middle class," but think about it this way- pretty much everyone, barring the one percent and homeless, self identify as middle class. Nothing's more annoying than when I was in college and you'd have the child of some wealthy doctors or lawyers wearing designer clothing telling you how they "understand the struggle" and how they're always oppressed and stigmatized. By the broad definition of middle class, they are in fact middle class. But then I'd look down at the holes in my jeans and my dad's old sweater that I was wearing and just shake my head in dismay.\n\nThe reality is that class is largely meaningless in modern society, save as a source of contention and complaint for whomever identifies with the "victimized" party. It's a very Marxist way of looking at things. So I'd say social expectations and appearances being a source of stress isn't a universal experience for all of us who "grew up middle class." The need for education is less about placing yourself in the middle class and more an economic reality if you want a job period. The lived in realities you're describing are more symptoms of a consumerist culture developed in a pre digital age experiencing growing pains as it progresses into the Information Age, than it is of being middle class, at least how I view things. 
1	From George Orwell 1984:\nUpper class only wants to stay up, middle class wants to swap places with upper class, and the poor just want to live another day.
0	Conversation Moments out of context	I want to see what crazy things other intjs  say.\n\nCommercial: Organize your receipts!\nDad: Hey, fuck yourself. And I farted a little bit.

1	INTJ-F?	Hey fam,\n\nI learned that I was an INTJ a couple of months ago and I was pretty surprised because a good buddy of mines is also an INTJ and we act somewhat different. But, I suppose at our core we‚Äôre very similar. \n\nAnyways, when I told him I was an INTJ as well he said, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no way your not an F.‚Äù \n\nWhat is an INTJ-F? Does that stand for ‚Äúfemale‚Äù or is there a subset of INTJ‚Äôs?
2	He meant F as in Feeling as opposed to thinking T, so not INTJ, maybe INFJ
1	What ^ they said.\n\nThis is one of my favorite sites to help understand MBTI:\n\nhttps://www.16personalities.com/personality-types
1	There's some thinking that due to female socialization (constant reinforcement of empathy) women who are edge cases on the F to T scale Feeling-Thinking, should probably assume they are INTJ (+female socialization.)\n\nI don't know if it's true, because I'm not an expert on either psychology or the MBTI. But I will say this, I will take every bit of help I can get at using emotions to relate to other people because it is a crucial life skill that INTJs seem to all struggle with. I struggle with it, and my male INTJ friends struggle even harder with it, so that seems unenviable. 
222	Do any of you guys feel lonely all the time	Its hilarious, I have a bunch of friends yet I feel so lonely. No one cares about what I talk about and I always have to adjust myself to others and figure out what they like and talk about that. No one likes randomly being asked sort of deep questions and no one really cares enough for this stuff. Its probably because I'm in college but its tiring because I've felt lonely most of my life and I always have to try to make friends and no one really tries to make friends with me lmao. Sometimes I don't even notice I"m lonely, but when I do it feels bad 
92	I get what you mean. I think it's because most people fail to understand us (or can't be bothered to try) and therefore the conversations we have with our 'friends' are merely a social formality. The feeling of loneliness due to not being understood
62	Loneliness is the only constant friend...
52	I love my alone time. I rarely feel lonely, but when I do it's one of those grass is greener moments. The second I'm surrounded by people, I wish I had stayed home. :D
21	I used to do this, adjust myself to fit other people. It's not wrong, but it's not right either. I find quality of friends outweigh the quantity. I used to want everyone to like me, but found myself in situations where it was clear they didn't and it was a waste of everyone's time. Now I really only have two friends I can fully trust/be myself around and the rest are acquaintances. I feel like I can keep stop trying to force acquaintances to "get" me because I already have friends who do.
39	It will never really go away. That longing for a deeper connection. Eventually you‚Äôll just learn to appreciate most things as they are, as I did.  Learn to love solitude and enjoy things as much as possible. I‚Äôve met a lot of interesting people and it always come short to what I‚Äôd consider a ‚Äúdeep‚Äù connection. Like, somehow, something is always lacking. All I want to say is never let it stop you from experiencing things, for things that we usually consider simple and mundane, could turn out spectacular in its own way. 
12	Definitely, I struggle with anxiety on this topic and see a therapist regularly about it.  \n  \nMy issues stem from me being consumed by my thoughts and just thinking way too far out which completely disconnects me from the *now*.  \n  \nLearning to identify those triggers that create this snowball affect in my psyche has greatly helped me. I'm learning to be more self-aware when these situations happen and I've learned positive coping skills to help ground me in that time. I've never been a person to recommend *meditation* but just sitting and focusing on your breathing is something that *physically* will calm my body and helps ease my mind into more positive thoughts.  \n  \nFriends are a great avenue for venting and validation but I really do recommend seeing a therapist that specializes in anxiety/depression. It's done more than I can say, for me.
10	Well, you're not alone (pun intended).\n\n"I used to think that the worst thing in life was to end up alone. It's not. The worst thing in life is to end up with people who make you feel alone." - Robin Williams\n\nI for one, am surrounded by all sorts of people: "friends" (is there such a thing, really? apply your INTJ perception!), acquaintances, family, etc. Yet I feel utterly alone. From an intellectual perspective, I'm in fucking Siberia. Perhaps that's why INTJs are overrepresented on online forums. It's easier to find same-mind people than in real life.\n\nI'd like to ask: what is other INTJs way of finding other genuine and intellectually curious people, to have a meaningful conversation with? (I've personally had some luck in the past with chess and astronomy clubs, but I no longer live in the west so that is no longer an option).
9	When i was in high school i had different groups of friends and had to adapt myself to fit in and talk about the stuff that interested whatever friend group i was with at the time. I saw this as a skill, and saw myself as sort of a chameleon. \n\nI did feel sometimes like i was the one that had to reach out to my friends to hang out or whatever. This is just the work you need to put in to keep friendships alive. I think everyone feels like this sometimes (that theyre doing all the work).\n\nWhen you‚Äôre feeling lonely just call up a friend and talk about stuff they like to discuss. You‚Äôll feel less lonely and it‚Äôll help keep those relationships strong, so you‚Äôll be killing two birds with one stone. \n\nIf you want to talk about deeper topics that you cant do with your current friends i say expand your circle of friends or find some people online that are interested in those topics. 
6	This makes me sad. :(\n\nI love you INTJs!  I would sit and listen to you talk all day.  (INFJ)
6	I felt this way for a long time. Luckily I met some friends that have some similar interests to me in college. I think the worst part about what you describe is the fact that it feels perpetual. But, if you continue to try and branch out in small ways, you‚Äôll eventually bump into likeminded people that feel more fulfilling as friends. I had friends for years that made me feel miserable when I went home, but once I quit hanging out with them and made friends that suited me better, that loneliness faded. It‚Äôs still there sometimes, but it‚Äôs been alleviated.\n\nGive it time, and keep trying to make friends with similar interests or personalities and eventually some will click. 
5	Absolutely I do feel this.  In my 47 years I‚Äôve met maybe 2-3 people I have been able to deeply connect with.  \n\nBut do you really think most people don‚Äôt like deep questions?  Are we just impatient waiting for a friendship to be ready for them?  Are most people really not deep thinkers?  I know I‚Äôve always been called one.  Is that because most people aren‚Äôt?
4	As I've gotten older , I've felt more alone. The deeper my thoughts go and the higher my expectations of friends. It doesn't help I have little patience so people get less opportunity to impress me than ever.   That's bad I know, but I'm realizing how short life is and how important time becomes.
5	I'm a bit late to the post. A number of people I'm seeing have mentioned INFJs. I can't say for them, haven't really been close to any.\n\nBut in my personal experience, if you can become friends with an ENFP or ENTP, you can usually have that deeper connection when you get then 1 on 1 with you. I've felt a fairly deep connection with a for of girls I've dated, and they all turned out to be ENFPs, and my brother who I connect really well with is an ENTP. \n\nOnce, with one INTJ girl I connected more than I ever had with anyone. But our passions/interests just varied too much so we didn't pursue anything. Such a shame.\n\nIt's a mix of finding a good personality type that you connect with, the then ALSO have similar interests. I personally connect really well with people through music, humor/Memes, or similar nerdy preferences (LOTR, certain video games, books, etc). If they are an ENTP/enfp that doesn't have similar interests as me in those areas, I struggle to push through to make the deeper connections. But if they do, I can make those deeper, longer lasting connections/relationships quickly.\n\nThat's just my personal experience though. Even though we are all INTJs, each person still varys so much.
3	I understand what you mean. I felt the same way in college, what got me through was being in a relationship with someone in my same major so we were together all the time... It's difficult for me to make friends that I'm very close to, but maybe try to get involved in clubs with people whom share the same interests as you, maybe that way you'll find someone that also likes to talk about the things you do. 
3	It weird, because I only really feel lonely when I force myself to socialise and maintain friendships. It drains me and makes me anxious. But I kept at it for a while because I thought that's what you have to do to be a healthy person even though I don't even like them. And then I just realised fuck it, I'm much happier on my own and with as few people in my life as possible, and after much deliberation I made the decision to ditch a friend last week. And the peace and contentment I feel is unreal, I feel like a new person and I've got my energy back. Solitude feeds me and I need to honor that, fuck what everyone else says. I'm only expending energy on people stimulate me mentally from now on. 
2	Like some others have said, it's not really loneliness as much as just a general disconnect from other people.   \n\n\nINFJs can really help to curb this feeling with INTJs. They tend to have an understanding about them and are good at expanding on topics INTJs like to discuss. They posses a great balance of subtle charm without the vapid traits seen more often in charismatic types. This makes them great company for INTJs, because they take each-other seriously.   \n
2	Il BE YOUR FRIEND!!! i know you said you already have some, but whatever you wanna talk about, im diggity down!!
2	Yeah INFJ here it‚Äôs because most people are sensors and sensors are boring, but they think we‚Äôre boring. The only people who get me are INTJs and INFPs.
2	yes, it's been the recurring theme of my life. just keep going bro and do the things you enjoy
2	The worst kind of loneliness is the kind you feel in a crowded room.
2	I know this sounds trivial but for less than $5 on your smartphone you can download Tetris. Always has a way of keeping my head clear of emotions and I‚Äôm always working on my high score. You can pick it up and put it down any time and it is very calming. 
2	Sometimes I want to make a clone of myself. Maybe not exactly the same, but similar enough that I could have that connection you're talking about.\n\nThis makes me wonder if in the future we'll be able to create and "program" humans to our exact specifications. Then we could have the interactions we desire.
2	Look at what you might be doing that is preventing you from forming a genuine connection. Can't really change other, can only change yourself or meet different people.

1	I completely relate, especially to acting my way through what people want, and my random deep questions followed by the instant halt in the flow of the conversation :(\nYou're not alone on how you feel, but I'm sorry you're lonely. 
1	Meditating has really helped me with not feeling alone.
1	Everyday 
1	I used to feel this way but being forced into that loneliness helped me to understand myself a bit more and as a result, I love me. I think it's a necessary process for anyone trying to be happy. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/LikIhHSv15c\nhttps://youtu.be/XGYwrF--Xdo
1	Lonely? Seldom. Alone? All the time...
1	I used to think of it as being lonely but I‚Äôve grown to understand it‚Äôs more just not knowing many people with similar values. With such a rare personality type this is to be expected and makes perfect sense that others don‚Äôt ‚Äúget it.‚Äù\n\nWhen the whole world is consumed with the superficial, I consider it a positive.
1	I'm often alone but never lonely. This feeling is unknown to me.
1	I have been lucky enough to meet some people with whom I did not feel lonely. I‚Äôm soon to be 20 and have met a solid 10 people or so like that. I‚Äôm in touch with only one of them now.\n\nIf you‚Äôre like me, you won‚Äôt struggle to identify those people once you spend some time with them. However, the fastest way to lose them is to dump all your emotional labour onto them.
1	Loneliness has been a faithful companion of mine.
1	I'm not so lonely anymore now that I've found a community of INTJ's on discord! It's cool to speak to some like-minded people.
1	I've accepted the idea that no one else can get in my mind with me.  It's like having Disneyland all to myself.  
1	NT friends would get you, they don't get you completely of course. But every NT has a lot of say, so time management and topic management gets difficult. 
1	The more I have invested in myself and become my own best friend, the more that feeling of loneliness has become manageable. Accept and appreciate loneliness, and you'll feel a bit better.
1	There certainly are times. I've had to move around for work and advanced degrees for over a decade now and it is difficult to establish a large friend base the way I had growing up in the same town for my youth. Now the friendships I have are really strong when I make them. However, maybe it is because many of my peers are married/in relationship, often with kids that it makes it difficult to relate or find them with time to socialize given their other personal commitments. I often think of joining local clubs/events but sometimes it just seems mentally taxing to get caught up in yet another requirement when my line of work is already quite taxing.
1	I love being alone. I can‚Äôt stand being in a crowded room with a lot of people and their chit chat. I tried going to parties when I was with my ex because they were her friends, but she would get upset because I‚Äôd question why her friends were doing stupid things like driving their perfectly clean trucks in mud holes or putting people in a utility tractor over a bonfire ‚Äúfor fun‚Äù. It made no sense to me, other than someone might fall in and get burned. Plus it gets me anxious to the point to get out of there because all the voices are overwhelming and my mind is trying to filter all the topics and just can‚Äôt. I decided to embrace my INTJ and not care if I accidentally hurt someone with my bluntness when they ask me questions. I actually feel happier.
1	I actually feel lonely right now. However at the same time I want to be left alone as well. I need to disengage from the world. Because lately I have been feeling lonely, even when I'm surrounded by those I love, and it's quite discouraging to say the least. 
1	Opposite. I work since 1 1/2 years now in an open office and im overstimulated socially. In college i had pretty much 0 contacts, yeah, because mentality is different there and people around you in courses change all the time. At work, i have to work with people in my team for months and get to know them even if i don't want to. Currently the new girl in my team moved to my area in the city so i "have" to often commute home with her. Thankfully she reads just like me, had another coworker a year ago that couldn't shut up.\n\nI'm currently happy for every minute of alone time.
1	I often feel lonely also.  But I have some ways of dealing with it:\n\n1) Write down your thoughts and then post them to reddit (and dont worry if the thread doesnt get much attention\n\n2) If you are in college try finding philosophy students.  They usually seem to like deep conversations.  And Im sure a philosophy professor would be no different.  I have an enfp friend who loves to talk about philosophy.\n\n3) deep intellectual discussions are for anyone who wants to participate.  Dont be picky about who it is.  I found that my english teacher was more than willing to listen to me explain my theories and thoughts (she was an esfj).  \n\nHope that helped.  Im an intp btw.
1	This is a video from a fantastic channel that any INTJ would love. This one is all about being lonely. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/n3Xv_g3g-mA
1	I'm sorry you feel this way, but don't give up hope!\n\nIt's an exaggeration to say "no one" does these things. They exist. It just may take a while to find them especially since INTJs are not known to be the most social. Keep going out and meeting more people - the more you put yourself out there and meet more people, the higher your chance of finding the people you can really connect with.\n\nIf anything, I'd be happy to talk to you if you want to be friends :) I love meeting new people! Besides, I hear having an ENFP around is good for the INTJ soul ;)\n\nGood luck!
1	Not really since I always tend to keep myself busy.
1	I think unhealthy INTJs crave the attention of others (despite not liking it), whereas healthy INTJs are generally content with being alone.
1	Not really? I mean, once and a while, but I have my friends when I need them, and I'm not only super introverted, but also kinda anti-social (not Anti-social Personality Disorder levels, or act negatively or aggressively in social situations, just not big on socializing. I get bored and tired with it really quickly, and only really enjoy it with friends or like minded folks. Add kids to the mix and my battery drains to in the red in 30 minutes or less). Plus I always have my pets, so they counter most feelings of loneliness for me, since I prefer the company of animals over humans, and tend to get on with them better and feel less socially anxious. I was also raised in a neighborhood with no other kids. Not even older ones. All my school friends lived over 30 minutes from my house, so hanging out at my or their house on the daily was not possible without lots of prior planning. My parents were rather hands off, and my only cousin, one year my junior, lived in Massachusetts while I lived in North Carolina, and since my Dad was relatively estranged from his family, the only communication we had was by written letters sent via snail mail. No joint vacations, no visits but two times when we were under 7yo, so... Yeah. No real close bonds. So given all that, I never knew about playing with others when not at school or in daycare, and just adapted to that being the amount of socialization I needed to be happy. I actually tended to have a low battery break down when younger at parties held by myself or others, especially sleep overs, and would go off by myself for 30 minutes to an hour to recharge and calm down\nADHD and sensory processing disorder also tended to make that level of interaction (especially in places I considered MY space) on a constant basis kinda hard for me. At least at school I could be quiet when working on stuff. As got older, I got the interaction I needed from work, though that was inherently frustrating, and tended to keep to myself after. When I could no longer work due to health issues, I went full hermit for 10 years, calling no one, outings only being by myself, any social interaction I had was anonymously via the internet, which was nice cuz I had more control and could ghost out whenever. It's only in the last four years that I reached out to old friends, and through them made new ones (also led to dreaded kid interaction. Some are better than others. At least I like kids enough to not go completely off my rocker. One day, I will find out why I have animal and child magnetism. One day...). We're all introverts, which means our batteries stay topped up when hanging out minus the kids, and drain slower even with em. We consider socializing sitting nowhere near each other in a room while surfing our phones for dumb memes and videos and showing them to each other. It works. üòÇ But we do fine with just PMing each other. \n\nSo I guess I was molded by circumstance to some degree to need ppl less. One parent is INFJ who trained herself to present as INTJ to handle mental illness, the other was INTJ, so maybe genetics had a hand in it too. Who knows.\n\nAs for you, I'm sorry you feel lonely all the time. The college years are a very selfish time of life. People don't necessarily form the greatest bonds during that time. Have you tried joining clubs, groups, or volunteering in areas that interest you to make friends you have things in common with? Also, if able, consider therapy to help learn socializing tips so you aren't stuck rolling over for everyone and get to talk about your interests too. Friendship is only real if you BOTH get support out of it. If they don't let you talk, say so! If they get offended or rugsweep, whelp, they aren't a friend. Also look into online communities catering to your interests. Oh! And there is r/intjpenpals! You might find some folks there to talk to. 
1	The irony talking about it is baffling. 
1	Sometimes, then I remember that I don't like being around people.
1	Wait 'til you meet another INTJ in person, till you see we're all disconnected, every type. Everyone has that unique flavor, distant that you can't taste.  Chances are you're doing that to the intimate people in your life.  Connecting, but not really uniting the whole. They're all the same, we're all the same, just a different bucket of cream. It sucks, because it's doesn't feel like it, but its true, a true connection won't happen until we can see an entire person's experience from birth 'til present.  Even though, as the emotionally distant observer we wouldn't feel the consequences of each step.  It's our charge to see it, NOW. embrace every shit, every moment. Hardest fucking thing to do.
1	No. I don't get lonely often. As an introvert, I feel energized by my time alone. Although, I have a healthy balance of social time in my life. If you don't feel you have that, it may be worthwhile to try getting outside of your comfort zone, which is something else I try to do often.
1	all my friends are infps and we have deep conversations fairly frequently. I also feel like they care about me so much. I do feel lonely sometimes, however, because I feel like I can‚Äôt reciprocate the care they give me all the time, so sometimes I become sort of a recluse. 
1	Yes. I just have one friend who is reliable, but the others are just fake. But since this friend is an ENFP and you know how social butterflies are they, I can‚Äôt talk to my friend. So I give myself to books, games, nature, questions and of course, memes. And honestly, they are better for those fake people who is around me for 8 years.
1	I know how it feels to adjust oneself around other people, for me it's all about making them feel comfortable and not unsettling them. I stay sarcastic and still keep my sense of humour because people like that, but I have to make my voice more pitchy and act more emote when I don't really do that naturally because otherwise they get nervous. I have to make sure to break eye contact a lot for the same reason. Sometimes I slip out an answer to a question in my usual tone and people laugh at how 'you sounded so dead just now' and I just nod. And often when a question is asked, I just stay quiet even though I know the answer and could elaborate, because people want to speculate and won't like the smart-ass who knows the answer explaining it to them for 10 mins even though they literally asked the question. People are so needy of their mannerisms being reflected and me approving them constantly. It's exhausting and I feel like nobody really would like me for me.
1	Hello INTJ. As an ENTP, I think I can relate to how you feel. I know we're quite a bit different but I think I get you get guys well enough. It seems to me that ya gotta meet some Intuitives (we like talking about weird shiat). Supposedly, ENFPs are good for you guys...I dated an INTJ for several years but I think I could have done better. I think someone having that F helps. \n\nCheck out places that have people with similar interests as you: bookstores, tabletop communities, certain clubs (hobbies not dance scene), etc. You can find some people out there, but therein lies the paradox-- being lonely but having to leave the house (your comfort zone). I understand even as an ENTP...being the least extroverted extrovert and all that. \n\nHang in there! üôÇ
1	Been there. I had all the making of a super popular guy: good at sports, academics, good background, etc. But this is just a reality when living in a world of sensors.\n\nTry and find other people, I'm sure you will eventually come across some intuitives.\n\nSensors are fun but being all the time with them is like trying to breathe through a big plastic bag over your head.
1	As a person of faith, I believe you are never really alone, God is always present, but were not always. There are times where I've felt lonelier in the company of the types of people you describe above, than actually being by myself yet mindful in the Lord's presence. 
2	MENSA Test prep advice	I‚Äôve been encouraged to take this test. If anyone has already taken it, what advice would you pass along? TIA
3	Don't take it. Why do you need to take an arbitrary test from a snoody organization that provides nothing other than a false sense of superiority to its members?
4	1. Turn up early enough - last minute room changes etc do happen. \n2. Don't sweat it. It really isn't the sort of thing that needs preparation - or, to look at it the other way: if you need to 'prepare' in advance, maybe you are not a natural Mensa member...\n\nBTW it's just Mensa, not MENSA - it's not an acronym or anything, but the Latin for 'table' - with the idea of a 'round table' organisation, plus a pun on 'mens sana' = healthy mind.
1	Just take it easy.
1	Don‚Äôt stress out.
1	It's mostly logic - so no way to prep. Just go in relaxed. What's the worst that will happen if you don't pass?\n\nHave you looked at getting in on SAT scores? There are ways to get in other than taking the test 
1	don't take it too seriously. make it as a personal test, see what you're actually made of.

1	Any other queers/trans find it difficult to form meaningful friendships?	Some background: I lost my best friend a few months ago. No, he didn't die; I scared him away. I met him online and we never met, but that made it easy for me to open up and express my thoughts in a way that I never have with anyone else in my life. This guy was straight and lowkey homophobic, but he tolerated my queerness as long as I didn't hit on him. But he finally left me 3 months ago after another argument (we argued all the time so I thought he didn't mind it. Arguments don't offend me). I guess my expectations from him were too high, but I was hoping that he would take it that I expect a lot because I care about him. I mean it was also self serving, I thought that if I could make him the best he could possibly be, it would influence me positively as well and we could grow from connecting with each other rather keep ourselves stagnant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have had friends in real life, but it was always superficial and they pretty much drifted completely out of my life. I found it difficult to open up to them because I had never revealed my sexual identity, preferences, or even thoughts to anyone else in real life. I believe it was from being raped as a child (I cried it all out already so I don't mind discussing it here), but for a very long time I didn't like thinking of myself as a boy. I don't want to transition though, I never really wanted to transition.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhere do you guys find friends? Like friends that actually have goals and care to discuss complex issues? Not random acquaintances that you only small talk and play games with. For a large chunk of my life, I've indulged in games to distract me from the past. It had slowly evolved into an avoidance mechanism for responsibilities like homework (thank Satan i graduated last year). But now I want to make mature, like minded friends so that I won't feel the need to go back to games for some social fulfillment. I don't know where to find them, or how to behave for that matter. 
6	Coworker Ruining Reputation	I‚Äôm an assistant. I sit next to another assistant at work. I don‚Äôt speak to her much and she‚Äôs super offended by it. I don‚Äôt  speak to anyone at all however. Just the people on my immediate team. I‚Äôm super courteous on the phone though.\n\nAnytime she hears me be super courteous to someone or chat with them a bit I can literally see her back stiffen in offense.\n\nIf I come in and she doesn‚Äôt hear my hello she pointedly marches off in the evening without saying goodnight. \n\nProblem is that she‚Äôs begun to go from desk to desk to desk on my floor talking about me. I heard her go in the office of the assistant next to me. She left the door wide open. She‚Äôs recounting an incident where I took a call and slammed down the phone (my phone cord is super tangled and the tension keeps pulling it off the hook. I put it up there forcefully bc it keeps falling off- that becomes slammed). I must be bipolar or have some kind of mood disorder. Although she curses and many others there do, I can‚Äôt say a simple ‚Äúshit‚Äù after a mistake bc I know even that is being carried back to others.\n\nI would do it occasionally and see her back stiffen and her get up and march immediately into the lady next to mes office to talk about it. \n\nI‚Äôve literally heard her go to the desks of two secretaries talking about how I may seem nice, but what a b*tch I am. I‚Äôm so weird. There must seriously be something wrong with me mentally. \n\nShe gets in a big group of like 4/5 cubicles and talks to all of them about me in a mix of Spanish and English just one wall over where I can clearly hear and all the nearby attorneys with their doors open can also hear. She tells them I don‚Äôt say anything all day. Not even ‚Äúcomo estas‚Äù and makes little rude jokes about it everyday on her way out. She also talks about me in Spanish to the mail runners who come to the desk with our mail, even as I sit right there. She‚Äôll motion toward me, say a bunch in Spanish and then laugh. Sometimes she‚Äôll even mix my name in there for me to hear, just to make it obvious she‚Äôs talking about me, even if I don‚Äôt understand the rest. I find it really lame and childish. She‚Äôs over 50. I haven‚Äôt been rude to her at all. Just not her definition of ‚Äúnice‚Äù.\n\nIt‚Äôs like she think she can bully me into acknowledging her more or being friends. Of course the fact that she talks so badly about me when I‚Äôm not even out of earshot and then marches back to our desk with a smug little smile makes me not trust her. To the point where I barely want to say hello. I say it, I realize I have to so she has nothing to run back with but ugh. \n\nShe knows I heard her calling me bipolar. I mentioned the incident to someone else and it got out. So she gets on the phone whispering about it while I sit right at the desk. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs very very quiet. She heard me call her bipolar‚Äù. Why would she think we‚Äôd be bosom buddies after that. She shows so little regard for whether I can hear or not it‚Äôs certain that she actually *wants* me to hear. It‚Äôs her way of ‚Äúpushing me back‚Äù. Only I wasn‚Äôt pushing her to start with.\n\nAnyway, I don‚Äôt speak to much of anyone. I don‚Äôt throw anyone under the bus. I just mind my own business, don‚Äôt get involved in the gossip which makes me kind of ‚Äúother‚Äù. So when she comes around saying I must be ‚Äúretarded‚Äù or ‚Äúbipolar‚Äù it‚Äôs probably pretty easy for that to find a receptive ear bc I‚Äôm a blank slate.\n\nI don‚Äôt want to go to HR with it for fear or putting this narrative in the air further that there‚Äôs something wrong with me, I‚Äôm abnormal. I‚Äôm already very separate from everyone which to social types already seems odd.\n\nWe are a very insular team and for me to speak to HR without first talking to my immediate boss about the problem is treason. HR will also unquestionably take it back to him. \n\nHe‚Äôs a Partner and disconnected with the staff so anytime a staff issue comes up he asks his ex-secretary who is this gossipers best friend. The two of them shared that desk for many years and she has the gossipers back. Not mine. He‚Äôd ask around to all the staff members he knows making a mess and spreading that negative narrative even farther. The last thing I want is my boss thinking I have a mental illness, i don‚Äôt, but he‚Äôs the old school man‚Äôs man type in front of whom that‚Äôd make you a pariah.\n\nI have to make sure to greet every single person as I come in bc I know she‚Äôs been putting out there that I‚Äôm a crazy that won‚Äôt speak.\n\nToday I came in and I know she heard me greet the big team I pass on my way in, but NOT her. Because f that cow. Later I heard her in my boss‚Äô ex secretary office. I‚Äôm *so* rude to her. Why she‚Äôs never been treated so rudely in her entire life! For someone to be so rude to her for no reason whatsoever i must have something seriously seriously mentally wrong with me. There just has to be some mental problem there. She hears me on the phone with others and I‚Äôm all ‚Äúhi. How are you  but with her nothing.‚Äù She marches out of there. Gathers her stuff right next to me and makes a big point of leaving without saying goodnight.\n\nIronically this person has a reputation as being super nice. So her opinions do have weight. I find her hypocritical, stupid and petty if that‚Äôs how she acts over a greeting. She‚Äôs on a full fledged campaign to ruin me all because she feels slighted.\n\nEven if I never said a single word to her- not even good morning is it really cause to act like that? Is anyone bothering you or threatening you? Or keeping you from doing your work? The irony is her butt hurt lashout is super disruptive to me doing mine. I legit have people staring in my face scrutinizing it to see what mood I might be in when they pass my desk.\n\nTl:dr; coworker is offended that I don‚Äôt talk much. Has been spreading around that I must be bipolar or have a mental illness even within easy earshot of me. How to shut down.
6	She‚Äôs obviously egotistical and petty. Treat every single person with ultimate professionalism and kindness. Help people in any way you can. People will think she‚Äôs crazy and will start to feel bad around her when she‚Äôs saying bad things about you. This will affect her reputation over time and you don‚Äôt have to do anything. It‚Äôs just a matter of time. Just continue to do your best and watch her decline.
3	She looks like someone with NPD, ignore her, do not try to appease her, remain true to yourself, if she's spreading lies about you don't try to correct with words, but with actions - let others see what kind of person you are instead of telling them, eventually they will see thru the lies. If not - quit.
2	My coworkers do the same, and so has nearly everyone I've been in contact with in a professional setting. I've accepted it as part of my life, and you should too; I don't think it will go away any time soon considering how society views people like us.
3	She sounds like one of those bombastic extroverts that introverts can't stand, mainly because she is overly subjective and in a professional office there should be an expectation for objective interactions with co-workers. She also sounds like a fruitcake but hardly a terrorist. That's taking it too far and so you are allowing another person to control your mind space too much.\n\nMaybe try to say a few polite Spanish niceties to ease her anxieties and if that doesn't work, speak to HR calmly. If all else fails, look for another job........she clearly seems to be an insecure wuss who is desperate for your validation which could possibly turn into a worse situation for you.
4	What's your priority here?  Do your job. Do it well. She's not fooling anyone. People who are smart see through her. She's not ruining your reputation. Only you can do that.\n\nYou don't need to be her friend, but you need to be cordial because you work together.
1	Well, if she wants you to communicate, then communicate. Ask her why she's so offended that you don't talk with her and explain that you just aren't always in the mood to chat with coworkers.  Also explain that talking bad about you behind your back doesn't make you want to talk to her any more than before she started gossipping. Try asking other coworkers about this issue. If everyone is against you even after you've made a genuine effort to fix the problem, then go to HR and tell them everything you've written here.
1	Sounds like she‚Äôs making assumptions because she doesn‚Äôt know enough about you. To some people, daily small talk is a measurement of temperament. If you don‚Äôt give her enough data, she feels obligated to make guesses. \n\nThe more defensive you get or try to hide, you make yourself an even bigger target. Try meeting her halfway and see if can prove her wrong with some extra kindness.
1	I get this from women all the time, really bitchy bullying behavior. It's like if you're not exactly like them and don't want to be a part of their clique who does nothing but gossip all day, then they feel personally threatened, like you've just insulted their mum or something. I haven't found a way to deal with it other than to just cut them off, but obviously you can't do that in your situation. You can't complain either (depending on who your boss is), because you always look like the anti- social one and personality wise you're always going to be outnumbered, even if you're just minding your own business, because people value a people person more. \n\nMy best job was working in a majority male environment, they leave you the fuck alone and don't get emotional and bitchy (a lot less than with my experience with women). It's a sad state of affairs but I guess you've just got to make up for it by being an exceptional worker.

15	Why do people want to have children?	I genuinely don't get it. Is it just a biological urge to pass on their genes? A selfish act to give meaning to their own lives? Following a traditional way of life - the whole marriage and kids thing? Or is it altruistic behaviour as in they believe life is good and the more people who get to be a part of it the better?
8	From what I‚Äôve observed, people rarely ever actually WANT kids, like really passionately want them. Many kids happen as an ‚Äúoopsie‚Äù, and many people get kids because that‚Äôs what people are supposed to do. I kinda get the rare minority who actually want kids but I don‚Äôt get those who do it simply because they follow socially acceptable pattern of life.
12	Pure biochemistry. Our rationalizations are irrelevant.
10	I am a woman who doesn‚Äôt want kids and does not like babies or children at all. This is really off putting for other women, apparently. I‚Äôve been told I‚Äôd make an excellent parent because of my intelligence and generally prudent approach to life, but I have no desire to mother a tiny human. At all. I see it as kind of selfish and entirely too much work and money. All that to potentially have the kid turn into an addict or something else life wasting and pathetic, in spite of all my efforts to prevent it. I will continue to mother the shit out of my pets though. They are my BABIES. And they‚Äôll never become teenagers so that‚Äôs a plus. 
3	I dream for the ability to raise a family with love and learning and happiness. That's been my dream since I was around 12 I think my deeper reasoning would be to show my love and recieve it in such a unique way.
3	Most of my friends and family have abused my trust enough to make me withhold my affection; at least enough for me to keep everyone at a distance.\n\nMaybe it's just wishful thinking, but I feel I can put my shield down in front of my own child. In fact I'm most relaxed around children and animals. They haven't scum bagged me yet.
3	Because they want to be happy and some combination of tradition, societal pressure, and life experience ties them together. \n\nI grew in a very close and loving family. Many of my happiest times were with family. My parents would say the same, probably more emphatically. \n\nWhen I think about the pursuit of happiness, I can‚Äôt imagine a version without kids and my own family. 
3	I love them. Simple as that. Yes, raising kids can be incredibly difficult, but for me, watching them learn and grow is one of the greatest joys in life.\n\n
14	People who want kids are just acknowledging the reality of the human condition. To be human is to expirence love. Love is what binds everyone together, and the desire to procreate is just another expression of that love. I wouldn't say selfish either. Love is selfless, and procreation is wanting to build a life for their child so they can expirence the same happiness that the parent themself expirence.\n\nIf I were you, I'd drop that "Rick & Morty" style secularism. It's less of philosophy and more of a form of catharsis.
5	Well, we need people to want to raise children otherwise we wouldn't have to got to where we are now, so it doesn't matter what their motivation is. It's a necessary biological urge. In a way it is selfish because people have kids for their own happiness/future benefit, but on a larger scale it's also selfish to not want to put the effort into raising children because you're leaving it to everyone else to breed and provide the necessary man power that you also benefit from - e.g Armies. Unless your ideal lifestyle is living in the wild on your own. \n\nI really don't want kids because I can't be arsed with that life. I'd much rather leave it to some other woman/man to do the hard work of raising kids. I'm not about that life. The cons outweigh the pros for me. But I see the value in people wanting kids.  
4	Yes it is natural. Mainly because of the maternal instinct, but I believe also most men normally want children at one point in their life.\n\nI'm a man.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI do not have children.  In fact, I have a chronic disease which can be genetic. So, I have a legit handicap in that regard. There have been many moments where I thought it would be bad to take the risk of letting a child get the same disease. However, deep inside I'm still positive to have a child or two later if I have the right wife.\n\nIf my dad didn't have me, I wouldn't be alive right now. If your parents didn't have you, you wouldn't be alive right now. Perhaps it's good to be thankful towards parenthood and life? Creating a life is pure magic and unique as far as life goes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMost of you people are disease free as far as genes goes, there is still a lot of negativity about having children. It is because of fear? laziness? childish?\n\nBesides, if you insist on not having children, but your life-partner really wants to, that's a big problem and can in some situations be selfish because it is normally not only your partner, but the families around too. There should be a common understanding and agreement about these kind of things before and under a relationship.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI respect people's decision to never have children, but in many cases I do not like the common attitude about not having children because life gets so incredible much harder. I thought other INTJ's were suppose to be hard-working and smart about challenges in life.
2	Its *nice* to see how you are putting to use everything obtained from collective efforts of humanity \[its one way to think about your question..\]\n\nEven *nicer* is the username
3	I have always wanted kids.\n\nI guess it kinda feels like my duty to give back to the world what the world gave to me: the gift of life\n\nAnd i will do my best to make my kids better then me to try and make every generation better then the last.\n\nbesides that its often the ones least capable of parenting that get the most children (like my cousin who is now in jail) and i would like to balance that a bit.
2	Because I like existing, and my children probably will, too.\n\nPeople like existing even in the worst of conditions, war and famine, you name it, and the conditions I will try to give to my offspring will be better than at least 95% of others.
2	Why do people want to do anything? Why do you want this job, house, partner or pet? Or none of it?\n\nNot saying you can't know, but that each and every person will have it's own.
2	so youre saying you shouldn't exist?
2	To create a family...
2	To me, it's the power to mold and create something in which results can be somewhat quantified
2	They dont, but everyone likes sex without thinking about WHAT sex is for. \n\n**Ill give you a hint. Its not just for fun.** 
1	I believe the choice to have children is all of the things you describe, OP. There's a biological urge and psychological desire to pass along parts of yourself. Some people may not feel they have a real or complete family without children. Some may want to recreate the best parts of their own childhood, or hope to provide a happy childhood that was denied to them when they were young. Some people feel that they're part of a legacy that needs to continue. Some like the idea of teaching their children and seeing the world through their eyes. Some people wind up with kids less because they actively seek the experience than because they didn't care enough to avoid it or because it is what everyone else does, so it seems inevitable. 
1	I often asked people that question and the reasons I conclude are:\n\n1. Most people are traditional and do what their families want them to do. This is especially true in Asia.\n2. The generation ahead of you will soon perish and you have to produce a new generation, so that when you are on your 50s-70s, you have people to care for you and be your family.\n3. We always have a biological urge to procreate, this manifests in our bodily desires for sex. It's just that condoms, pills and other interventions in fertilization has been created in modern times. So we now have better control whether we have children or not.\n4. Some people have children because they see other people have children. They don't want the idea to be "left out". They fear being single, unhappy and lonely when they get older.\n5. Why not? It's actually more strange to not want to have children. Those who want to have children or plan to have children far outnumber those who don't want them or who accidentally have them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPersonally, I don't want them too.
1	It's probably the easiest way for people to find meaning in their lives.
1	Why do we form any kind of relationship? To share the things we love with someone.\n\nThe thing I think about the most when I fantasize about having kids is the joy of explaining *everything* to a human being encountering it all for the first time. Sharing this entire world which I am fascinated with and love. 
1	Your life is a path and feelings, desires, and what you consider needs changes as you travel along this path. My feelings on children have varied drastically as I adapted from single to married to one kid. Three kids and another on the way now. Genuinely happy to have them all. 
1	I've seen Idiocracy and the battle has to begin somewhere.  Spawning INTx clones also seems like a thing.  Although I don't think when our decision to have children became a reality, having a child that's VERY similar to me wasn't something I was expecting nor planned for; hindsight, it's been very cool having my own mini me, difficult dealing with yourself as a child at times, sort of fun at times though.\n\nThe screaming baby phase was NOT happy for me, yet the positives during that phase overshadowed the negatives.\n\nNow, we're dealing with tween boy things; at least he has a love of cats, LEGO, sci-fi, history, science, comics, drawing, sculpting, and fantasy.  Making fun of commercials/infomercials together is fantastic, introducing him to Star Trek, Stargate, 80s comedies, Douglas Adams, Tolkien, Asimov, X-Files, The Tick, and other items is great.  Powering through The Walking dead has been fantastic the last few years as well.\n\nOf course, exposing him to how the sausage is made (figuratively and literally) is honestly one of the best parts of being a parent.  Watching the wheels spin and knowing that I got a few of those cogs rolling in certain directions almost brings a tear of joy to my eye.
1	I've always felt that any couple with more than two children is screwing the rest of us over. We don't need more people. In fact, the human species is the least necessary to the well being of the planet. 
10	Struggling with the J	I find it very easy to dislike those who I haven't met. So-called social situations are rarely truly social at all - more like skimming the filth off a pond and missing the treasures in the depths below. I prefer deep conversations and tire of predictable and vapid exchanges. For a long time, I'd accepted that I was somewhat misanthropic, but a part of my work means dealing with people and I decided to make an attempt at change.\n\nI'm currently reading a lot of Carl Rogers. His work, *A Way of Being*, is the counter to B.F. Skinner's view of humanity as rats in a maze (to woefully oversimplify his POV). I was introduced to the concept that it is better to be kind than to be right and that our internal, often unconscious, desire to be right all the time leads us to judge humanity swiftly and harshly. Rogers' concept of Unconditional Positive Regard was initially proposed as an approach in psychotherapy, but I believe it has value in all our lives. You can read about the tenets of UPR here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconditional\_positive\_regard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconditional_positive_regard)\n\nI'm still in the midst of this attempt and I'm not sure how it will go in the long run, but it has opened my eyes to some new concepts. That's NEVER a bad thing. I scoff at many of these ideas initially and that makes me wonder why my knee-jerk reaction is so strong. That alone is worthy of exploration. \n\nPart of what makes me so angry at people is my deeply held belief that we are all capable of so much more in our lives. I hate seeing a person squander what they have under the crush of society, drugs, government oppression, etc. I also abhor cruelty, which seems to have limitless manifestations among humans. These judgments raise the question of how best to affect change.\n\nWe have all seen the push/pushback model at work every single day. Just forcing our own ideas on people doesn't help. All it does is foster more dissent and ultimately the tribalsim we're seeing manifest in society today. A few minutes reading YouTube comments shows me that an ideological hammer is ineffective. As an alternative, I'm willing to at least entertain Rogers' concepts and try to put them to work in my own life. So far, I think this exploration is helping me to feel more centered and less responsible for the actions of others.\n\nHave any of you struggled with this as well?
2	TL;DR at bottom.‚Äî‚Äî\n\nI do very much so. But this is most likely because I constantly have intuitive predictions about a person‚Äôs nature based on how they talk to me, how they look at me while they‚Äôre talking to me, the words they choose and words they emphasize‚Äîand these constantly come true for me at least. \n\nFor example:\n\nA roommate and I a few years ago (we were in the Army together as well so we‚Äôre very good friends but he‚Äôs the closest epitome of an ENTJ that I can think of) were looking to rent a house instead of an apartment that year‚Äîthis comes with having to deal with a private landlord and their hyper-sentimental thoughts of their outdated property. (My J is showing) \n\nBut my roommate and I went to meet a landlord who was renting a townhouse: within 4 minutes I felt that I knew who she was and could predict how she would act in any unforeseen circumstance that we might need understanding with and I 100% felt that tingly feeling I get when someone doesn‚Äôt deserve my respect nor interaction and I want to shut my peephole (because the INTJ door was never open to them to slam in the first place). \n\nI‚Äôll cut to it:\nAfter constantly trying to persuade my roommate to seek other options because I couldn‚Äôt explain why I knew it was a bad one but I just knew‚Äîhe forced me into it through procrastinating long enough to the point to where it was our only option. \nI really don‚Äôt want to get into the Jersey Shore level of drama that she caused us because I‚Äôll get lost in rambling but she was the epitome of upper class entitlement and had the most irrational expectations and ideas of what her legal position as a landlord.  \n\nMy reason for judging so hard on her irrational perspective:\n\nHer and her family own nearly 10 properties in this college town where properties are increasing in market value at about a 200% rate per year, yet she has never lived in this property we were renting and never intended to. \n\nFuck I rambled for a long time, sorry. \n\nTL;DR \n\nYeah I‚Äôm constantly having trouble with my J and letting it effect how critical I am of people that I‚Äôm already biased to have judgements about because I feel that they‚Äôre fulfilling my earlier predictions and analyzations. \n\nI feel it can be healthy and very helpful in navigating my life to avoid people who sap my energy, but also I try to challenge my own J because I know it can be unhealthy and unfairly biased. Gotta acknowledge that the universe is always unfolding. 
1	I went to dinner last night with new "friends" and was repelled by their shallowness and stupidity. I've been preferring the company of my animals over humans more and more lately. My job is isolating, so is my relationship. I'm almost officially cutoff from the world. And when I do go out to "socialize" which is very rarely, I am surrounded by a world of plebs with pleb thoughts. I just wonder where I screwed it all up. 
0	Regardless, you will never reach the bottom of the pond without first diving through the surface.  In order to maximize depth opportunities, train yourself to maximize surface diving.\n\nPeople are very much afraid to share their innermost thoughts, goals, and true ambition as I suspect you are.  It is the price of admission.
1	I'm 29 years old and just bought my second house	The first one wasn't all that nice. It was a modular house that looked like a trailer but we had it decorated really nice. Everyone is throwing out their wood furniture, or giving it away...solid wood! Can you believe it? So we always get a deal on furniture that frankly is probably going to outlast whatever people are trading them out for. People would see it and they'd say oh wow it looks really nice. And there's that pause where you both know that what they really mean is "for how shitty the outside looked". So....I mean a few years of that.....After three years we just sold the house for 60k more than we paid. ($115) It turns out when you buy a shitty house in a nice area the value goes up disproportionately than other properties because a huge part of a homes value is it's location. If you have a house in San Francisco the house isn't where the value is coming from- it's the location. Now my house is...I mean not huge but it's nice. Like if I die here I'll be okay but if I have kids I might have to move....it's only two bedrooms (but they're nice). The house is four sided brick...2 acres. It's not a plan for everyone but for those of you getting older I think I was 23 when I got that last house- fha loan. Super easy. And I was making less than 40k when I got it. It paid off big time for me (about the size of your average student loan debt). Put it down on the next house and then happily enough ever after. It was a good investment.\n\nI'm also finishing my last semester for my bachelors- a degree I don't really care about anymore and won't use.  \nThey haven't all been good investments.  \n\n\nI'm sharing what worked for me in case it's useful for anyone else.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd for those of you who have  a house already you might be wondering, how is this INTJ related at all? Well I just wanted to share something with you guys in particular:\n\n[Growing Leyland Cypress Trees From Cuttings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jEr4-O2Bf8)\n\nWho knew it was so easy?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: this isn't me in the video I just found it.
2	A convoluted plot to get to a specific point. Exactly like an INTJ. GJ M8
1	Congrarulations, man, I hope you and your wife are very happy with the new home, keep up with the plan!
1	INTJ Humble Brag?	My INTJ friend  and I are both seniors in high school anxiously waiting on college decisions. We both applied to very prestigious schools and we talk about the college admissions process a fair amount. However recently, he has been getting very frustrating. He keeps implying he's going to get into Columbia, Harvard, etc. and then saying "but i'm like really stupid and didn't even try with my application." I'll try to call him out on his hypocrisy, but he then gets really defensive and says "oh but i'm not even that smart, i wont get in anywhere! why would you say that?" Two minutes later, he is back on his bullshit, and again starts implying he's getting into every school he applied to! It got really bad when he got a Harvard interview and started to assume that its practically guaranteed admission. Overall, I'm getting fed up with his ego. How can I effectively communicate to him that he needs to chill with the humble bragging?\n\nTL;DR intj friend has gotten very cocky in the past few months and constantly humble brags how can I get him to stop \n\n&#x200B;
2	He is clearly feeling insecure and nervous about whether he will get in. Hopefully he stops annoying you when he gets his decisions, and hopefully he grows up soon.
1	Less a humble brag than a poorly executed attempt at fishing for compliments. \n\nHe's clearly worked up and nervous about how this will pan out, which kind of makes sense. There's nothing more he can plan for or do, as it's all up to admissions committees at this point, so all of that INTJ focus has nowhere productive to go and it's turning to self-doubt. \n\nI'd address this directly with your friend. "Hey, I've noticed that you seem nervous about where you'll be accepted. I know we're both going to wind up at great universities because we've worked so hard to get here, so let's try not to obsess while we wait for our acceptance letters." \n\nThen give your friend something else to focus on, like a project that interests you both, gaming, something at school, a new book, movie, whatever. That will hopefully shift his attention a bit to something less annoying, which will give you some relief. Another option would be to go down the worst case scenario rabbit hole with him and actually get him planning for what he'd do if all of his top-tier schools reject him. This won't be fun, and could actually dredge up a bunch of negative emotional stuff, but it will help him feel more in control, which will likely keep him from seeking reassurance about his application and qualifications. \n\nGood luck dealing with this! I hope you get into the school you're most excited about and that you really enjoy your college experience. 
1	Getting into a good school will help him to stop. He's probably used to being a big fish in a small pond, that will very likely change if he ends up going to Harvard. 
4	What am i	You know,i had a significant other but I once told her in bed that when I grew older I wanted to be alone .... Like what's up with that, why would I say such a thing?\n\nPeople say whenever I'm walking , I do so slowly and without purpose and that I look dazed all the time. Half the time I'll locked away in my mind. I don't know, it's like I don't have energy for this life. I just trigger my day dreams when I put on my headphones.\n\nWhenever I'm with someone or with people it can be so vexing because I'm always thinking about what I should say next to them, where is the conversation going to go, how do I talk to them like other people to other people?\n\nI'm so negative all the time but I don't feel like it's negativity,i feel like it's just realism but I wish I could see the world the way I think other people do.\n\nAnyone relate?
7	Homosapien
3	You may be depressed
2	I can relate 
1	no
1	I completely understand what you mean. I have the same experiences. When I'm with people, i want to be alone, and when I'm alone I feel like everything is not the way it should be. One thing that we all need to realize is that we are not alone; yes there are MANY different ways that people view the world, but there are many people who view the world similar to you. Not all INTJ's feel the same way you do, but I understand (sorry for the lack of flair, i havent been subbed here very long). My urge is to not think about any of it, but I know thats not the right way to deal with it. If you have the opportunity to talk about it with someone, whether that be a therapist or a trusted friend/family member, do that. If not, DM me
6	Work life as an INTJ	I‚Äôm an accountant and excel at process improvement and knocking out work like a champ. My coworkers are good at talking and complaining about how much work they have, yet it‚Äôs less than what‚Äôs on my plate.\n\nI feel like my efficiency and effectiveness gives my peers an excuse to fuck off because they know I‚Äôm a safety valve that will keep us upright and because I despise office politics, I still get shafted for promotions.\n\nAnybody else experience this and have a solution? I could always join them in the bitch fest, but then nothing would get done and I would look bad so this isn‚Äôt really an option.
4	Change jobs. I have an accounting degree, not strictly working as an accountant though, I work in government finance. Grant calculations, data analysis, financial reporting, that sort of thing. Theres plenty of politics to deal with. But my manager values my contribution so she shields me from all the politics bullshit and I can get on with doing my job while she handles all that crap. We make a great team. 
3	Worked at one of the big 4 accounting firms, and like any other auditors who used to work at big 4 will tell you, sadly they don't reward efficiency. It's all about relationships. The performance managers sits in a room together and discuss everyone. You need a manager to advocate for you. If your performance manager happens to be on vacation, too bad so sad, you get an average performance review. If you want promotion, you have to play the game. I did suck up to my managers and senior managers, bought them coffees, went to their parties, sent birthday gifts, etc. I actually liked them, and kept in touch after I left. But for others, managers can be quite abusive...\n\nThink about how partners were made in accounting firms, they sucked up to partners, senior partners, and all the partners have the agree to let them become a junior partner. There are plenty of senior managers, directors that probably will never become a partner no matter how long they stay. You either decide to play the game, or take your businesses elsewhere.
2	I like to help make my coworkers jobs more efficient too - then make sure your managers know that you are doing it. 
1	I've been dealing with this most of my work life. I refuse to kiss up or gossip just to get promoted, but like you my work ethic is well above my peers. It never seems to matter.\n\nIt's why the 'team' office environments don't work for me and why I keep putting myself in them. \n\nI'm working on a more INTJ career....solo, challenging,  etc.
1	What does your boss think?
1	I'm a mix. I'm highly efficient with the soul purpose of buying myself enough time to chill. I am abnormally faster/more accurate than my peers tho. Basically, when I work, I work hard. Definitely not seeking extra work though.
1	Frequently out performed other's as IT helpdesk. Would clear tickets and backlogged jobs at between 3-8X the rate of colleagues. But due to such work streamlining and work ethic I have gone from basic support to BDM and SDM in 2 years. 
7	INTJs and downtime	I was just wondering what fellow INTJs liked to do to relax in their downtime. I personally like to go on a run, play guitar, or just listen to music.  What do you guys like to do?
11	Marijuana 
10	Instagram lurking. Reading. Video games. YouTube. Pizza. Movies. All shit I can do from the comfort of my own home in my warm ass blanket.
6	Run, lift weights, read books, hiking, video games, side projects like making furniture and stuff like that. Basically anything that can afford me a good degree of solitude and give me the chance to be in my head.
2	Stitching or gaming while listening to podcasts about history and philosophy. Or reading on my computer. I don't consider going out with friends as "downtime" 
2	I mainly do things where I can remain active and keep my mind focused on the task. Like working on my cars, playing video games, or building/repairing a keyboard or painting a miniature.  \n  \n
2	In the summer, running along the lake bank and breathing in fresh air, with some nice music playing is probably my favorite thing to do to relax and unwind. Cleaning/organizing when I am bored. I also like reading, writing, planning my life, and researching on random subjects.
2	Pretty much just random things that pop into my head. I may be reading books at one point and then just get bored with it moments later and then decide to go for a run. 
1	Lift, learn more about data science, drink beer 
1	Video games. I'll never stop loving them
1	I like to play videogames in my downtime.
185	Replaying Conversations in My Head	After I speak to someone, I always replay the conversation/events in my head.\n\nI think is probably a way to over-plan and an attempt to make sure that the next time I won't do the same error.\n\nI also try to plan/play every possibility of an upcoming event just to be sure I'll be able to correctly manage it and that nothing will surprise me.\n\nI really like this quote from Petyr Baelish (GOT) :\n\n‚Äú(...) Fight every battle everywhere, always in your mind. Everyone is your enemy, everyone is your friend. Every possible series of events is happening all at once. Live that way and nothing will surprise you. Everything that happens will be something that you‚Äôve seen before.‚Äù\n\nAm I the only one to do that?\n\nIs it an INTJ pattern?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Wow this community is awesome! \n\nThank you so much, INTjs, for *making me feel* like a normal human being! 
61	I don't replay - I pre-play. I know how every conversation should happen and exactly what I want to say. And I lead it that way. There's nothing worse than when it goes off track
42	This is natural for an "INTJ".  \n  \nWe don't base our inner thought from the feelings we get from a specific situation, it's much more of deducing the situation into objective evidence. Pulling the information that is relevant and throwing away the information that isn't, which helps us prepare for this similar situation in the future.  \n  \nSo, when that moment arises, we already had that inner dialogue and thought on the matter basically putting us "ahead of the game".  \n  \nThis is why it's also common for INTJs to look *too* far into the future and build anxiety off of it. It is sometimes extremely hard to exist in the *present* when so many thoughts are consuming your focus.
20	I do this as well.  I also have really suffered from this and offer a suggestion.  There are times when I am so perplexed or disturbed by an issue that it compounds and escalates and starts to cause me stress or dredge up old suffering.  I have learned to keep a document where I type these thoughts down and reason them out by typing.  I find that typing adds an entirely new processor to it somehow, like a second brain, that is now using my eyes or fingers in addition to my thinker.  For some reason this really helps me resolve things in my brain and push through them.  I will just type freeform without much structure or editing and it flows out my fingers as a stream.  It has helped me a lot; especially with memories that keep coming up and bothering me.  I'll remember things from 30 years ago that I never resolved and think about them for days and days.  I have learned that if I type them down and reason with myself in a document, that old angst will release.
16	Yes, it gives me anxiety.  Sometimes I do this so much I feel disconnected from my surroundings. I hate it. 
9	I do it all the time. Like I recently started a new job. When I was on my way to the interview, I'd walk myself through what I'd say. Then on the way back from the interview, I'd replay what was asked, what I said, and what I should have tacked on. But, I guess it doesn't matter since I got the job anyways.
6	Yes, it's a common thing, just remember the Prime Time Directive, since it's very easy to modify the memories, add something that wasn't there, or remove something that was. Like a feeling or a facial expression of the other person, body language, tonality and speech patterns, all can be changed to suit your agenda. Always remain objective no matter how hard you wanted it to be a little bit different in your mind. It will only lead you to ruin,
6	all the time.\n\nFuture conversations, as well. Theoretical conversations. \n\nIn fact, I try not to do it or at least limit it to a sliver of the things that I think will actually happen, as most often it is only a detraction.
6	Not the only one. I do the exact same things. 
4	All the time\n\n(No, I didn‚Äôt agree to this)\n(Yes we did)\n(Stop it.)\n(Can‚Äôt. Let‚Äôs start over and see if we get a different result)
5	I can relate to almost every comment I've seen here. It might not be a type-specific thing (INTJ in this case). But we need a bigger sample of non-INTJs.
3	I do the same thing, so it's not just you..
3	not only conversations...
3	I do this. I hate it. I sometimes avoid social situations because I know I will replay and regret some little inconsequential thing I said.
3	You are overthinking. I do this too and I think it leads to more anxiety. I've been shouting stop in my mind when I detect myself going into a mind loop and that seems to help a lot actually 
2	I do the same thing!\n\n It has gotten to the point where I'll dream about what happened the day before, but usually in a way that I would have liked it to turn out, or just really whacked. \nI had a dream like that last night. It was replaying things, people, and places of the day before, but adding things that didn't happen.\n\nTo me this is weird, but does anyone else have dreams like this?
2	Always. I really can relate to the quote, it's so true.
2	I liked that quote too, but I wish If I knew how to prioritize and quickly snap out of that racing mind state when I need to take action instead of over-analyzing.\nthis use to be way more intense to the point that it is almost crippling for me than it is today, especially when talking about very critical or negative subject( that would bring anxiety to anyone) , that saying the wrong thing would have very bad consequences or misunderstanding. \nnow I do more planning new potential scenarios than replaying. I noticed that it gradually got better as I got older( I'm still in my twenties though), but I'm still not satisfied with the way I'm handling this mental scan of upcoming possibilities, I want to learn to be more quick and efficient about it. 
2	Omg yes I do this too. Sometimes I can‚Äôt sleep at night since my brain is busy going through and planning conversations and thinking through all the routes the conversation can go. It‚Äôs annoying since I really need my sleep. However, I know that my brain needs time to do this and if I don‚Äôt have time during the day for flow it has to happen in the middle of the night sometimes.
2	Ya I did this too. Made public speaking particularly painful as I would replay the whole speech and critic myself over every nuance and the vibe of the audience. Not sure this is the case with everyone but the older I get the less this is an issue. Cant say it‚Äôs from experience or that my memory just doesn‚Äôt have the capacity to do it anymore. 
2	Yup, same here. Going over recent conversations and interactions, looking for faults, extrapolating future interactions. Sometimes I get confused and "remember" something from an extended mental conversation that never took place. Or, continuing a conversation from days before with new information but forgetting that the conversation may have been forgotten. 
2	Yes, I do this both pre and post conversation.\n\nPre conversation is a mental rehearsal to reduce the likelihood of any surprises and establish a mental ‚Äòagenda‚Äô for the interaction. I‚Äôve found that the majority of people are quite disorganised in their thinking which is reflected in their speech and conversation patterns. Without a mental agenda, I can‚Äôt be sure we‚Äôll cover the few topics I want to address and that they‚Äôre tackled roughly in descending order of importance/priority in case we run out of time.\n\nAs I‚Äôve gotten older, I‚Äôve noticed and caught out more unscrupulous people because of this - the kind that like to change the subject when pressed on a specific issue with some kind of ‚Äòwhataboutery‚Äô. I‚Äôve met one or two who were quite skilled at this in an unhealthy work environment, where they relied on it to avoid being held accountable or committing to anything - at least before I spotted the pattern, flagged it up to everyone else, and pointed out when it was happening. I could only do this because of my pre-planning, and it was still hard even then because they were very good at verbal misdirection.\n\nI also do post-conversational replays, but for me the purpose varies according to how the conversation went. If the conversation generally went as expected from my pre-planning, I don‚Äôt tend to replay it much if at all. If it went unexpectedly then;\n\n* if it was better than expected, I *think* I tend to replay  it to try and reinforce my approach, and look for any further signs or patterns that might result in more such successful conversations.\n\n* if it went worse than expected, I will often replay both as a post-mortem, to figure out if I missed or misjudged something I could have done differently, and to figure out how best to move forward. These don‚Äôt happen often, but are usually the worst for getting ‚Äòstuck‚Äô over, especially if it‚Äôs a result of a ongoing situation where these types of conversation can mount up quickly in a short period, without sufficient time to pause and reflect on them.\n\n* if it wasn‚Äôt good or bad, but I intuitively felt something wasn‚Äôt right and couldn‚Äôt put my finger on it, then I‚Äôll replay repeatedly trying to figure out what that thing was, and make sense of the conversation in light of that new information. I can usually do this most times, but it sometimes takes me a few days as sleeping on it often helps bring fresh perspectives.\n\nFor ‚Äòstuck‚Äô replays, making things external through writing them down or typing them up in a form only I will ever see helps a lot. I rarely ever go back and re-read what I wrote. Space, time and distance is usually just as important, but often harder to arrange in a lot of circumstances. As an analogy, In some ways it seems to need treating a little like a wound, where externalising is the ‚Äòbandage‚Äô and gradually disengaging to create time and space is necessary for the healing process.
1	That stopped for me when I started my ADHD medication. I feel like I was living in static before that. 
1	I do this too but I thought it was because of my Social Anxiety... Hmm
1	I think replaying and pre-playing conversations is normal, but maybe not everyone does it. What you‚Äôre really doing is sharpening your wit. \n\nEven if you don‚Äôt use every part of the conversation you scripted beforehand, you‚Äôll have key points prepared in a well-spoken manner.
1	lol yeah. I replay conversations in my head if they are dramatic enough. It stresses me out, but yeah, I suppose it prepares me for the next conversation with the same subject.
-2	This is dangerous and entirely fuelled by ego. Imagining yourself in the infinite that is simply not there. INTJ's are especially capable of this. But it can be degrading to your consciousness of the present. $0.02
41	Drunk INTJ's	I'm curious to see what other INTJ's are like after drinking. Personally I get much more talkative than usual and if I get onto a topic I like I will go on until I don't make sense anymore (at least to others). I also talk more about the things I enjoy in general. Mostly I try to act not drunk. Many will tell me about a time out/in and I have to tell them I was very drunk and they thought I was sober. 
57	I‚Äôm much less reserved, talk a lot more and am quicker to make decisions. \n\nSome of the talk is inappropriate, and many of he decisions are bad. 
39	i become the happiest and friendliest person in the room. 
22	If I‚Äôm buzzed, I‚Äôm talkative and outgoing. If I‚Äôm past buzzed, sleepy.
22	I am fucking hilarious 
14	Buzzed? Relaxed, talkative, but less filtered. Results may vary, few people like my 100 proof truth. \nReally buzzed? I might dance. I might sing ‚ÄúTequila‚Äù at karaoke. Usually I talk less here because I know I‚Äôm going to say stuff I‚Äôll regret. \nDrunk? It‚Äôs likely that I‚Äôve found someone fascinating and I‚Äôm hooking up with them. Last one was a resident doctor, I of course had to ask him what his MCAT score was, etc. because that‚Äôs stuff normal people ask...right?
11	I become more aggressive and honest / without filter. I sometimes would get angry too. That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt drink any more. 
5	Quiet, sleepy 
6	This is always for weird me‚ÄîI absolutely hate drinking. I grew up in Germany and had plenty of exposure as well as joining the Army at 17. \n\nI hate the feelings that come with drinking:\n\nI feel like I can‚Äôt process anything and dumb. I also hate feeling dizzy/nauseous and can‚Äôt comprehend who would do that to themselves knowing an imminent hangover is coming. \n\nI also hate how people get while drinking. I can‚Äôt recognize their social identity and it makes me anxious because I‚Äôm not sure how to act \n\nHOWEVER. I don‚Äôt think less of anyone who enjoys drinking‚Äîit just doesn‚Äôt compute with me. \n\nThat being said I‚Äôm not against substances at all, I‚Äôm a huge cannabis advocate/professional/consumer as well as a psychedelics advocate. \n\nJust don‚Äôt want flames for people thinking I have a straight-edge perspective 
4	It depends on who I‚Äôm with. If I‚Äôm with the select number of people who I absolutely adore and feel comfortable being myself around, then I‚Äôm witty, funny, flirty, outgoing, spontaneous, and relaxed.\n\nIf I‚Äôm around people I‚Äôm not comfortable with, I usually end up not talking much and either insulting someone when I do, wandering off, or going home in a depressed episode and crying in the shower.
5	I become a drunk a bit less asocial introvert. I'll be a but more talkative and less held back by my problems..
2	I don't drink
2	Drinking is a mood amplifier for me... a drink or two can help me relax a little, but once I start catching a buzz and definitely by the time I'm full drunk, whatever emotions I have get magnified. If I'm happy, I'm really happy, and if I'm depressed, I'm really depressed.\n\nI don't like letting my emotions have that much power, so I rarely drink beyond 1-2 to loosen me up in social situations.
2	I'm much more relaxed and talkative.
2	I don't drink. I'm already annoying enough and it's funny to see the other people doing weird stuff...
2	Giggling on the ground after half a beer... I need some more muscle mass I think üò¨
2	Me but with like an ENTP alter ego. Probably very annoying or absolutely hilarious. 
1	I become merry and start to smile, laugh, dance, if I had a bit more then sing and hug people.\n\nWhen I drink even more I become sleepy and aggressive to people trying to keep me awake.
1	*INTJs
1	Depends on who I was with, sometimes I'd be a big ol' clown, other times I'd start fights (rare but it happened). I don't drink anymore because it was increasingly easy to black out and I only drink a glass of wine or have a beer on special occasions. 
1	Depends how far gone I am. A bit tipsy and I'm more open about emotions and what's bothering me, as well as tend to use profanities more. If I'd had a lot to drink and you say something that irritates me, I wouldn't hesitate to punch you in the face. Yes, I am an angry drunk
1	I'm mostly quiet or talk slightly more, but in bursts. If anything I just want to go home lol
1	I turn into an ENTJ. Not so much where the people in the room give me energy, but I become much more assertive in expressing my thoughts and feelings without caring about the repercussions or long term effect of what I say. Instead of sitting back and listening to people say dumb things and silently judging, I publically challenge them and get into loud obnoxious debates (if the other person is drunk). I effortlessly introduce myself to others as well. 
1	You called?
1	Used to get talkative and more cuddly. Now I just close up even more and get tired
1	Am I the only one that doesn't regret the things I do when I'm drunk? I'm very able to to keep myself in check even when really drunk and never really forgot that I'm acting this way because I drank/am drunk. I also believe that the quote: "drunken thoughts speak sober hearts" really applies to me lol, that's probably also why I don't regret it.\n\nBut yeah I act like the most comfortable person in the room when I'm drunk. Comparable to when I'm very comfortable around good friends (or very tired) but even more lol. 
2	in my analysis so far i think this is ni.	so far, by analysing  dom ni types. i can say ni is like weaving \n\nni just pulls all theres ideas together and creates this synthesis. ne can also connect things together, but not on a deep level, ni connects more ideas together to a single [point . so](https://point.so) you could say its like leggos, just pulling all the peices together\n\n&#x200B;\n\nam i right on this intjs?
2	Ne is the synthesizing function. Ni is the function that looks at some sort of information from the world and comes to a realization.\n\nFor example, a Ni thing would be to worry if someone's facial expression subtly indicates dislike, or if a situation is not how it seems on the surface. Ne users are usually more blind to this. They rely on their past experience to analyze the present. Ni users are more focused on the present moment world, and what they can get from that.
23	Does Your Brain Ever Feel Like A Whirlpool That Never Shuts Off?	INTJ female here. I‚Äôm wondering if any of you have similar experiences to what my day has been like. I conquered a major goal of mine I‚Äôve had for three years: I deadlifted 300 pounds (TWICE)! And while I want to be just simply HAPPY and THRILLED about reaching something I‚Äôve worked hard on for the past three fucking years, I can‚Äôt. And here‚Äôs why...below is my thought process of what happened after I hit my deadlift (I made sure to document it because I recognized that this was going to be an issue I was going to obsess and analyze afterwards):\n\n‚ÄúWow I wish I could share my hard work with the world, but I didn‚Äôt get it on film.‚Äù \n‚ÄúI work out alone a lot. I do everything alone a lot.‚Äù\n‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the difference between being alone, feeling alone, and feeling lonely?‚Äù \n‚ÄúFeelings are dumb, you‚Äôre better than that.‚Äù\n‚ÄúI feel like I really wish I had someone to share these moments with.‚Äù\n‚ÄúFeeling is dumb, we should probably start working toward 315 and 330.‚Äù\nAnd with that, I walked out of the gym feeling good that I had accomplished a goal but I should have been ELATED.\n\nI started lifting three years ago to help with severe depression that stems from a multitude of issues that stem from being alone (I‚Äôm on this Earth just existing but never being truly seen by anyone, not feeling like I can be myself, misunderstanding emotions and being confused about strong emotions I‚Äôve had, a lot of bullying and harassment growing up, including a sexual assault in college). I‚Äôve thought about this long and hard, and I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that there‚Äôs nothing wrong with being alone, in fact, there‚Äôs a lot of power, productivity, and authenticity that I find within myself when I‚Äôm in a prime solitary state. But I digress...\n\nDo any of you have trouble enjoying a  moment of pure goodness? Do your brains get in the way? Have you learned to be more present? Or is this a curse that we just have to deal with?
5	[Reminds me of this scene from Malcolm in the Middle](https://goo.gl/images/oRwK9N) \n\nBut yes. I can‚Äôt turn my brain off. Sometimes I get to work or class and realize that I can‚Äôt remember much of the actual events that occurred while driving and I‚Äôm like: ‚Äúholy shit I was so deep in thought figuring out that thing while I was driving that I didn‚Äôt even take the time to store the memory of what happened while I was driving‚Äù 
3	Yes.
3	All the time.
2	I completely relate to this! Wish I could tell you there's some strategy for enjoying the moment more, but I have yet to find anything effective... I've always wondered how much is due to being extremely analytical versus subconscious coping. I also had a tough past and I have to wonder if that causes me to enjoy good moments less because I'm bracing for the inevitable bad moments, or imposters syndrome, or getting caught up chasing perfection, or some other unhealthy thought process lol. \n\nI definitely wish my brain had an off switch.
2	First, congrats on the deadlift. \n\nI really connected with what you are saying here. I'm an INTJ. I'm also bipolar and have ADHD. My mind never shuts off, and I rarely "enjoy the moment". Sometimes it feels like accomplishments are irrelevant, or seem minor compared to the "next step". But then the next step happens, and it seems irrelevant to the next, next step. \n\nNot sure if that makes sense?
2	Congratulations! I just worked up to 185, small potatoes compared to 300.\n\nBut in answer to the question, yes. This is such an issue for me. Journaling seems to be the only thing to get me past a moment and let me move on. I went skydiving last summer, and while it was so terrifying and fun, I was weirdly calm before and after and was really annoyed by my reaction and lack of enjoyment of it all because my brain kept just analyzing everything. 
2	I don‚Äôt want to encourage a bad thing but I‚Äôve found alcohol allows me to be more present. Wine seems to do the trick the best.  \n\nIt‚Äôs very hard to shut off and that‚Äôs most noticeable when trying to fall asleep. I have to watch something to fall asleep so I can stay out of my head.
2	This was a huge struggle of mine, and the only thing that helped me was finally seeking out a regular counseling session where I could do weekly check ins and have someone else remind me to celebrate. \n\nI started with group meetings and now see a therapist for a more individualized experience. \n\nThere have been countless times I have casually mentioned a success of mine and she has reminded me to take some time to celebrate. \n\nOne example was when I mentioned I had quit smoking a couple weeks prior, and she stopped me to remind me what an accomplishment that was. In my mind it wasn't worth celebrating, because I shouldn't have been doing it in the first place. \n\nI also lost 50lbs in about 9 months by working out and changing diet, and I didn't say anything to anyone because I was still 10lbs away from goal weight and didn't want to celebrate yet. People obviously started noticing and forced me to celebrate. I talked to her about what a struggle it was to celebrate something like that because I hadn't reached the goal I had set for myself yet, but she reminded me it was still a major accomplishment.\n\nI think it would be wonderful to have a partner who could take on this role in my life (I have had a partner like this and it was truly wonderful, but we were in our 20s and eventually broke up) but a therapist has been wonderful for the consistency of weekly (or whatever frequency) meetings just to unload my mind and have someone else organize it for me. It took time to find someone capable, but is totally worth it IMO.\n\n\n
1	Girl. same here. I actually got into lifting because of the overthinking as well. Usually I do not overthink the good stuff but I have just started seeing this guy and I am overthinking the small happy stuff too. It's crazy.
21	Wondering if this is an INTJ thing?	So I went to this social gathering and I was talking to a lady. She has a teenage son and she mentioned that they are protective parents and the husband doesn't want the son to get his license yet but she does. She went on to explain more details and I'm listening etc.. etc... So I interrupt and assure her not to worry. I then proceed to explain what Tesla is and that in the next 10 years or so it's highly probable that humans won't be allowed to drive. She looks at me like i'm crazy so I go on to provide evidence, I then explain Elon Musk recently stated that within a year or so the technology will be sufficient enough to drive you home while you sleep. Given the time line Musk's proposing and the amount of time and effort your son would have to put into getting his license, it's essentially a waste of time anyway. So don't worry advise him not to get his license. He'll be fine, focus on other things. She's looking at me like i'm talking Spanish. I wonder if she thought I was being facetious? \n\n\nEdit: regarding future predictions. Exponential growth is slow until it‚Äôs not. I tend to be what others would consider optimistic, but I still think the shift will happen fast. Also, Musk recently said, yes, fully autonomous cars will be viable in 1 year. He specifically said the point where you can go to sleep and arrive safely, including freeways. He said it‚Äôs up to the governments how fast the technology can be used. My theory is based on the relationship of governments and their citizens. Autonomous vehicles will be much safer meaning SAVE lives by a significant margin. Just like seatbelts the government will be forced to act. This is about safety. Anyway think it through.\n\n‚ÄúElon Musk is no stranger to bold predictions, and on Tuesday he lobbed another one at self-driving tech doubters: The Tesla CEO said the electric car maker‚Äôs full self-driving feature will be completed by the end of 2019. And by the end of 2020, he added, it will be so capable, you‚Äôll be able to snooze in the driver‚Äôs seat while it takes you from your parking lot to wherever you‚Äôre going.‚Äù\n\nhttps://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-tesla-full-self-driving-2019-2020-promise/amp\n\nAnother thing people are missing is the simultaneous exponential advancements of other technologies that will compliment each other‚Äôs progress. ... cough, cough.... A.I.\n\nWe are on the cusp of A.I., quantum computing. 
27	A - Yes, pure INTJ. You brought relevant information that is bigger picture than she could understand in the context of her feelings. \n\nB - It‚Äôll probably take longer than ten years. Old cars will have to be phased out. But I‚Äôd guess in twenty years it‚Äôll be the norm. 
6	I think you've been mislead quite a bit about the timeline, hence her confusion.\n\n> Elon Musk recently stated that within a year or so the technology will be sufficient enough to drive you home while you sleep.\n\nTrue. Driverless cars already perform relatively well in environments with few to no other drivers. Put one on the road late at night and you'll likely have no issues. But do not be misled; this does *not* mean that within a year the technology will be sufficient enough to drive you on a freeway during rush hour.\n\n> in the next 10 years or so it's highly probable that humans won't be allowed to drive\n\nNot true. Even if the technology existed at this very moment (which it does not), it would take at least 10 years to get the technology through the US legal system in any widespread way. Also note that the very first consumer grade driverless car legislation that will make it through any body of government will be one which requires someone with a license to be present in the car anyway. Then even further note that a manually driven car will still be cheaper until the used car market gets mostly replaced by used self driven cars.\n\n> it's essentially a waste of time anyway\n\nNope. Not at all.\n\n> I wonder if she thought I was being facetious? \n\nShe thought you were crazy. Had you stuck to just "he might have the option to use a self-driven car in the next 10 years or so anyway," it might have been a different story. Instead, you said that people would be outright banned from driving, and you'd be wasting your time if you prepared for any other turn of events. I've never even heard of a stance on driverless cars this optimistic, and I'm in a tech field. 
6	Thinking outside the box; unafraid to voice an opinion that conflicts with mainstream thinking of the masses even if they think you‚Äôre off your rocker; evidence was provided to backup your opinion, and are nonchalant about a problem she‚Äôs experiencing that is distressing to her but doesn‚Äôt seem like a problem to you because what‚Äôs the big deal, there‚Äôs more to life than a drivers license (stoicism). Yeah that‚Äôs an INTJ thing. I probably would have stretched the timeline out a bit longer though. People always rush new technology because they‚Äôre excited about it but a progressive idea like driverless vehicles doesn‚Äôt catch on to the masses as fast as everyone hopes. 
6	that was so off topic to begin with\nthe lady was talking about her feeling about her son driving but you went on how cars are evolving... I think she just wanted reassurance that her son will be okay lmao\nbut yes i do this often too, I speak about the bigger picture when the person is asking the simplest thing ever. 
4	>that in the next 10 years or so it's highly probable that humans won't be allowed to drive\n\nLol, no way. This won't happen for at least 40 years.
2	I imagine you‚Äôd still have to have a license in case you had to take over for some reason. Or simply because you‚Äôre still operating the vehicle even if ‚Äúoperating‚Äù just means telling it where to take you. I imagine OWI will still exist for the same reasons.
2	The way I see it what you mentioned was irrelevant and out of left field.\n\nShe was venting about her frustration about her kids dad and possibly seeking some validation for how she's feeling.\n\nAs the world currently is, not how it will be when the kid is almost 40, getting a driver's license is sort of a right of passage. Not to mention the stress it will relieve from the mom and dad not having to drive the kid everywhere.\n\nProper response would've been saying something like, "Your son has to grow up sometime" and maybe "your son's dad should look into ways of establishing trust between them so he feels better about allowing the son to grow up" and maybe "if he's worried about the cost of a car, he can have the son get a job and make payments and teach him real financial responsibility and what being an adult will really be like so he isn't just handing him the keys and hoping for the best."\n\nThere are still people on the earth with no cell phones and who'd never be able to afford a tesla self driving car in their lifetime. I wouldn't expect it to roll out like you think. It's good to try to make others think about the bigger picture but the way you did it minimized her entire existence and made everyone involved in the present seem pretty insignificant. 
1	The question is why do you not want someone to acquire a  good skill ? I mean it doesnt make sense.
1	10-15 years ago I expressed this sentiment, hopeful that I wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about insurance and safety for my kids in 2019. They thought that was laughable, but here we are today with driverless cars being tested on public roads.  \n\nYes, the timeline is a bit off, things didn‚Äôt happen quite as fast as hoped, but it doesn‚Äôt mean we are wrong. Some people just don‚Äôt see beyond what is happening right now. 
1	Yup it's an INTJ thing to derail annoying family and relationship related conversations by mentioning technology, science, history, or anything else more interesting.
1	One thing I've noticed is people tend to want to discuss the same things, no matter where you are.\n\n-things relating to their kids, Kid's school, Kid's teachers, Kid's activities, Kid's health issues\n\n-things relating to their work, stress of work, colleagues and current social dynamics at the workplace, work trips, ambition/promotion\n\n-financial issues, financial goals, purchases, prices\n\n-things that generally stress them out or generally make them happy\n\n-good or funny things that have happened\n\n-small talk things like the weather or the way a place looks. I travel a lot and have found if someone similar starts a random conversation with you it will likely be mentioning the weather, and then the observation that "almost every city in America looks the same" and then discussing where they are from and places they've been. \n\n\nIf you can figure out that most conversations go down these fairly predictable paths, you can figure out almost boiler plate, predetermined responses. No one will notice if you say the same things in each of these situations or make the same jokes. Sometimes just asking a few questions and then nodding at a response is enough to make the person feel you are interested and not socially inadequate. Then later on you can possibly bring up a topic like self driving cars when it's not in the middle of a discussion about someone's life. \n\nAppropriate placement of topics is important. And some people just have different interests. Maybe ask a person the types of things they are interested in.. "Are you interested in what's going on with tesla? I'm really liking the thought of not having to drive anymore." or something like that. People might be interested in discussing things they aren't particularly interested in if you present it in a better way, including them instead of making it solely about you. \n\n
1	Hate to ruin your dream but Musk has been promising level 0 autonomy for 5 or 6 years now. \n\nStill hasn‚Äôt happened. But hey, let‚Äôs believe him this time!!!!
1	Predicting the future is an INTJ thing. _I_ think it's not that difficult to analyze technology and business trends, but when I tell people what's about to happen they either think I'm being funny or crazy.\n\nApprently, the supposition is that the status quo will remain static? I simply do not understand non-INTJs on this level. 
1	Too many kangaroos for it to happen here (a serious problem, autonomous vehicles judge distance by where the object is placed on the road, when the kangaroo jumps it messes it up). \n\nSeriously though, the technology will exist, probably within your predicted timelines, or near enough. Your error though is it will take a lot longer than that for widespread adoption. Give it another 10 to 15 years for that. A baby born today will probably not need to learn how to drive. But a teenager today sure as shit will (or will suffer disadvantage relative to their peers). So in that sense, your advice was wrong (in my opinion).
0	People do not see the future like you do. Be mindful of that.
1	Do you agree with this description of dominant Ni?	Connects the dots. Abstracts details given through Se into one most likely explanation. There is no evaluation process here (or at least none conscious to the user) as an individual just see's an answer. Behavior lends itself to favoring the root principles of ideas and an avoidance of "boring" details. Nothing makes sense without a holistic understanding. Ni functions in two ways: formation of Ni is inductive while it's use is predominantly deductive. The development of an Ni "vision" may appear to the user as a story, imagining one way a situation probably unfolded. Utility of Ni happens when new information is viewed through prior generalizations. \n\nExample: Sees neighbors lights are off, mail is piling up, snow on the ground but no footprints- concludes they are likely on vacation. Two years later they see a different neighbors mail piling and thinks immediately "are they on vacation?" to which they look for more details to confirm or deny this.
1	Sounds about right at a glance.
0	"Ni": something only NJs are supposedly good at\n\nWhat you listed: stuff that most people are competent at, it's called heuristics\n\nSo no, it's not "Ni"
8	I need advice on how to better bond with my non-INTJ friends.	So I am really good friends with three other people (for reference, one is INFP and the other two are ENFP and we are all females) and we hang out quite often. \n\nThey‚Äôre awesome friends and we have no problems getting along, but the majority of the time we spend together is either at someone‚Äôs house just lounging around or out to eat someplace. This isn‚Äôt the problem at all; the problem is that all I want to do is sit and talk and get into somewhat deep and meaningful conversation (as any INTJ probably would, lol)  but they continuously are on their phones and make comments about unimportant, insignificant details about their lives or other people‚Äôs lives. \n\nDoes anyone else have a continuous desire to simply be in the company of their friends the way that I do? It‚Äôs frustrating because I will be the only person at the table at a restaurant whose phone is put away. I‚Äôll just sit there, wanting to talk about our lives and what‚Äôs going on, but they‚Äôre all on their phones. There have been a few times that I‚Äôve asked to chat and they‚Äôll tune into reality but these moments are only temporary and they‚Äôll repeat the cycle later on. \n\nI guess this is mostly just a rant and an expression of my frustration but I‚Äôm sure some of you can understand where I‚Äôm coming from. I‚Äôm in high school and mostly everybody is glued to their phones like this but I‚Äôm just really not that same way. I would kill to sit with my friends for an hour with our phones in another room and just talk but if I ever suggested anything like that they‚Äôd laugh, put their phones in their laps or something, engage in conversation momentarily, and then when it dies down a bit, check their phone five minutes later. Does anyone have any ideas as to how I could learn to put up with this, maybe someone who has this same frustration with people being addicted to their cell phones?
6	Deep talk may mean two things:\n\n(1) honest talk about life struggles, aspirations and personal philosophy;\n\n(2) analytic talk about why the world is the way it is.\n\nFor honest talk, not everyone is interested in it because not everyone aims for authenticity (instead, they follow trends), has growth mindset and problem-solving mindset.\n\nFor analytic talk, not everyone is good at expressing their thoughts and building long logical chains (think of it like nearsightedness, hard to find something in a messy room, easy to get lost in unfamiliar environment, small work memory, low processing speed), it takes more time and effort for them, so they don't enjoy it. On top of that, they don't like to voice their arguments because they will be criticised, so it is even less fun to share it with an INTJ.\n\n(Also, some people just don't give a crap about certain topics.)\n\nIn all cases, pay attention to realise some systemic traits of your friends, and don't expect from people something what isn't in their nature. Cats don't like to swim, vegans don't like hot dogs.\n\nLook for thematic friends, like those who care for authenticity or astrophysics, and talk to them about those subjects.\n\n>"Does anyone have any ideas as to how I could learn to put up with this"\n\nAs of tricks, people are less likely to dive deep into smartphones while walking (go for a walk), and their hands are busy during games, although not every game works for a good talk because it may require attention.
4	I've met many ENFPs, they're all different but in my experience they love to get to know people and understand them to their core. So if they don't initiate those kind of conversations do it yourself and see how they react, chances are they'll love it...
1	I just made this discovery but most people, not just kids but adults too--they want to feel good, not know information--information and truth that we find interesting, like authentic and deep truth. Maybe you should try to discuss something deep for you that helps them feel good about themselves.
1	If you want to have deep conversations with enfps you will have to start it . My friend is enfp and we always have very deep conversations because I told her something about black holes and life during the starting days of our friendship.
1	As a INTJ i've learned that for the most part people want to talk about mind numbing things, which I find to be annoying. I've learned to confide life's deep issues in myself and contemplate them there. After a couple weeks I will need to socialize with my friends and take a break from myself and embrace the conversations about nothing and just have a good time with it. Then I'm back to talking to myself for a couple weeks. 
6	Conversation triggers	You know when you hang out with your friends and you stay quiet for so long and it gets awkward and someone starts off a small talk and it never gets any further from it? \n\nMost of my close friends that are not really that shallow, but when we meet in real life we are quiet and out of topic. It‚Äôs like our minds are shut off and then we realise that we need a trigger that will get us talking. I mean like a conversation starter..  and then we lean on small talk to ease the silence. \n\n\n\n\nDo our minds shut in such situations because we feel uncomfortable by our surroundings? Or because we are not comfortable with the other person? Why people require a trigger in order to start a convo? What if the two people need a trigger to start any conversation? \n\n\nI quite hate small talk, and it kinda turns my mind off when it‚Äôs brought to the table. So how can I bring that trigger to my conversations with these people that require it as well?\n\nI myself don‚Äôt know the kind of topics that are considered as triggers, but I love these people and I don‚Äôt want to wast the time I spend with them with small talk because they hold so much deepness into them and I want to explore that. 
2	I feel the same way. It‚Äôs easier to let it go, until an interesting topic comes up again. Also how close you are to your friends matters a lot, because it defines your level of comfort, to bring in what you‚Äôll say or bring up in the conversation.
13	Who are succesful INTJ people that have written biographies or good books	I want to know how they think and how they view life. I want more role models in my life and I find reading biographies of successful people very useful in finding particular habits they did to take them to the next level 
5	While you may see many people commenting books here, I have only one advice my dear INTJ mate, please dont box & fixate yourself into the INTJ mindset..Remember to treat it as a baseline & the functions as a spectrum..Learn from everywhere & everything however painful it sseems/feels/gets, in the end you will know it will be worth it...
3	External evaluation of public figures is unreliable. People often can't figure out their own type due to contradicting evidence, and from outside it is tricky even to distinguish introvert from extravert.\n\nCristopher Hitchens, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Dwight Eisenhower and Stephen Hawking are 'calculating' enough so that they are labeled INTJ sometimes, but all can be ExTx. They all have autobiographies:\n\n‚äï Hitch-22: A Memoir by Christopher Hitchens\n\n‚äï Total Recall: My Unbelievably True Life Story by Arnold Schwarzenegger\n\n‚äï My Brief History by Stephen Hawking -- Isn't very informative.\n\n‚äï Eisenhower wrote presidents memoirs, but Eisenhower in War and Peace by Jean Edward Smith is probably better.\n\nElon Musk is usually typed as INTJ or INTP, you may read:\n\n‚äï Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future by Ashlee Vance\n\nJay-Z is said to be an INTJ, he has a partially authobiographical book, Decoded by Jay-Z, but it is not a straightforward narrative, it's mixed with history, sociology and poetry.\n\nIsaac Newton is usually typed as INTJ, he is genius and famous, but he has rather low quality of life, so I'm not sure that he is successful or a role model. About him:\n\n‚äï Isaac Newton by James Gleick\n\nINTPs are quite similar to INTJs, and Alfred Einstein was probably an INTP. About him:\n\n‚äï Einstein by Walter Isaacson\n\nRichard Feynman, winner of a Nobel Prize in Physics, is usually classified as ENTP, but his worldview is still appealing to INTJs. He wrote several books, one of the best:\n\n‚äï Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman? by Richard Feynman\n\nINTJ may also find interesting those:\n\n‚äï The Meditations by Marcus Aurelius -- Because he seeks justice, reason, awareness and control over his perception.\n\n‚äï Man's Search For Meaning by Viktor E. Frankl\n\n‚äï The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York by Robert A. Caro - Because it is a mastermind case.\n\n‚äï Incerto series by Nassim Nicholas Taleb (The Black Swan, Antifragile, etc) - Recommended before me. It's unlikely that he is an INTJ, but his books are about better analysis of reality, so INTJ should enjoy it.\n\n‚äï Factfulness: Ten Reasons We're Wrong About the World ‚Äì and Why Things Are Better Than You Think by Hans Rosling - Same as with Taleb.\n\n‚äï Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions by Dan Ariely\n\n‚äï The 7 Habits Of Highly Effective Teens by Sean Covey\n\n‚äï The Demon-Haunted World by Carl Sagan -- Best on why critical thinking is important.\n\nP.S. On fiction side:\n\n‚äï Ender‚Äôs Game by Orson Scott Card\n\n‚äï The Martian by Andy Weir\n\nEDIT: Added Newton.\n\nEDIT 2: Added Einstein.
2	How I Accidentally Started the Sixties by Howard Bloom. Excellent book describing an incredibly varied life.\n\n100% INTJ quote from the book: "there are two kinds of scientists. One is a gopher. He is so specialized that he digs a hole and can only see the dirt ahead of him and on either side. He can‚Äôt see the landscape. I never wanted to be that kind of scientist. Scientist number two is like an eagle. He soars over the landscape and tries to see how all the specializations fit into a big picture. I loathed the idea of becoming a gopher. I wanted to be the eagle. Or like an √úbermensch equipped with wings."\n
1	William Burroughs.  Not quite a role model, but you'll learn a lot from him.
1	Nassim Taleb.
1	I don‚Äôt know this to be true but Elon Musk seems the type to have written something 
1	Michelle Obama.
11	How do you deal with depression?	I got chronically ill about 2 years ago, and I started to be able to do less and less because of limited physical abilities. Got even worse when I developed anemia. Now it seems like I have full blown depression. I am not really sad per se, but I am very bored, never want to do anything, lost my ability to have future aspirations due to being sick all the time, etc. \n\nThing is I used to strive for long-term goals, I wanted a cool career, and a loving relationship...I was passionate about elaborating plans in order to get what I want. I mean, INTJs love strategy! I loved going about life strategically. But I can't engage in most hobbies like I used to, I can't work because of illness, and I don't really want a relationship anymore (completely lost my sex drive or just the desire to be affectionate, while it used to be a HUGE part of my life). \n\nI can't recognize myself, and I can't even think clearly anymore. I get so physically and mentally exhausted. I became so terrible at putting my thoughts into words, and I can't even think about anything deeply anymore...who am I??? it's freaking me out. I also never want to talk to anyone anymore, not even relatives, and I am almost constantly irritated. \n\nHas anyone here ever experienced this? 
3	I had to stop and read this because the first few lines described me perfectly. I randomly got sick 3 years ago as well and they can't sort it out. I have all these symptoms and no answers so I just suffer everyday as my whole life falls apart around me. Sinking further into depression myself and I wish I could give you some sort of answer and solace, but it isn't an easy one. 
2	Something happened to my body some 7 years ago. I've had chronic pain ever since.\n\nIt sucks big time. I can't do... So many things that I used to enjoy.\n\n\nI try to enjoy the little things in life. Sunshine, music, etc. \n\n\nOne thing that can't be taken away from me is my mind and the thoughts it produces. So I spend a lot of time thinking and theorizing. Mostly about politics and gender.\n\n\nI spend a lot of time on YouTube and Reddit. There's a lot of intriguing things to discuss and learn about.\n\n\nBest wishes.
2	You've pretty much described me in a nutshell! Over 4 years ago I was diagnosed with a chronic illness and it opened the floodgates for everything else really. I'm still working on my depression (I'm bipolar) but I feel like even after 4 years I'm still grieving my old self. Active, working, healthy, not exhausted etc.\n\n I wish I could say I had answers for you, but it's an ongoing process, just like my chronic illnesses. But for me I see a psychiatrist regularly, a psychologist monthly and we'll be starting to work on things out in public too because I am quite isolated for many years. I take one day at a time and try keep my mind occupied (doesn't always work haha). \n\nTake care üòä
2	Hey man, check out this thread "I INTJ-ed my way out of depression!" , the OP has laid out things beautifully & it will definitely help you . Grab a cup of tea/Coffee & start reading , take notes, plan & formulate & "**execute"** it ! - [https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/awveeu/i\_intjed\_my\_way\_out\_of\_depression/](https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/awveeu/i_intjed_my_way_out_of_depression/)
1	Develop healthy coping mechanisms\n\nCounseling, meds, mindfulness, journaling, healthy eating.\n\nMaybe engross yourself in some video games become a leader in a mmo\n\nFish oil , Vitamin D, l-theanine can help reduce symptoms\n\nYou are and can only be yourself\n
3	INTJ and career change ?	Hi, \n\nI did the MBTI test and got the result saying that I am an INFJ. But I would say I'm also having a part of INTJ. \n\nAnyway, I'm in middle of a storm as I'm currently looking for a job. I previously worked as a technology and market analyst consultant. I was good at this work but being performant with short time was very stressful, and even if I like to interact with people from time to time, being often on the phone to interview experts drained my energy. \n\nI currently have various opportunities: \n\n* Either sales but I don't feel really motivated by any product and being in front of potential customers and do my sale pitch doesn't appeal me, and actually scares me. \n* Project management could be another opportunity but I'm scared of being overwhelmed at the centre of the attention, being the one that coordinate and make decision, the one that must be able to answer the phone all the time. \n* I may consider change to career like business intelligence, where I will handle datas and reduce my interactions to the minimum, for some part of projects or presentations. \n\nI don't know if there is such thing as "a good career for intj", but I'm just feeling lost and unsecured at the moment.
1	The insecurity which you mention is somewhat apparent from the content of your post. Let me elaborate: I don't think anyone here can give you better career advice than yourself, being that no one here knows you as well as you do. That you seem to expect us to be able to guide you speaks volumes. Furthermore, you list what I assume to be your top-three options; but two of them contain variations of the word "scared", which isn't really where you want to be when considering your ideal career. A bit of fear is natural when making such big decisions, but it seems to me that it is more than just that - but I have been wrong before!\n\nPardon the pseudo-psychology here, but I think you would benefit a lot more from serious introspection and perhaps some experimentation than from advice from relatively uninformed strangers. \n\nWith this in mind, these are the things I would consider doing if I were in your position:\n\n* Look at your hobbies and things you enjoy doing and talking about. Any way to make a career out of it? Any way of leveraging your education and previous work experience to get a foot in the door?\n* List all the options that are currently available to you and make the good old pro/con chart for each of them.\n* Consult the people who know you well; ask their advice, and emphasize the need for honesty over not hurting your feelings.\n* Pick whatever seems appealing and make the jump; if it doesn't work out, hopefully you leave with a better idea of what you really want to do.\n* Take a gap year, travel the world, experience different cultures and lifestyles. For me, this provided a much clearer view of who I am and what kind of life I want to live.\n\nI'm sorry that I couldn't provide a cut-and-dry answer for your original question. I am also sorry if my response is blunt; apparently, that's common for INTJs.\n\nBest of luck in the future!
3	INTJ: They misinterpreted my bluntness theme song.. (Amanda Palmer, "You'd think I shot their children"

9	What would you do?	You are at war. Deciphering an intercepted code, you learn two things about your enemy. A single spot in their defense will be at its weakest in ten days, and they will attack one of your cities in five days. What do you do with this information? What is the most efficient course of action?
8	In almost all situations you wait and keep listening. There is a movie by the name of [The Imitation Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Imitation_Game) which deals with this very subject. \n\nThe reasoning is that if you attack the weakest spot in their defense or you move extra resources to defending your city, then your enemy knows that their communications were intercepted and decoded. They may switch to a different, more secure encryption scheme, or somehow change their behavior in a way that prevents you from listening to and decoding future communications. Therefore, you only use the information gained from the decoded message (and future decoded messages) when it will provide you with such a large strategic advantage that you can deal a massive blow to your enemy. Most vulnerabilities or offensive moves on the part of your adversary are not going to be huge determining factors in the overall war, so I would say to wait for information that could help you more to come along.\n\nEdit: You also need sufficient time to conjure up a cover story for the source of the information you have on your opponent, and five to ten days is not enough time to launch a fake successful intelligence mission. 
2	There are too many unknowns to make an accurate decision.\n\nHow defensible is my city?  Is it Moscow?  If so, they are fucked.\n\nHow strategically important is my city?  Can I afford to lose it?\n\nHow strong are my forces in relation to theirs?\n\nWhat are the conditions of my supply lines?  Could I move enough metal, fast enough, to their weak point to deliver a crippling blow to their forces.\n\nIf I did deliver a crippling blow, would it destroy the enemy "center of gravity?"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n"The rule is, not to besiege walled cities if it can possibly be avoided." -Sun Tzu\n\nAny army attacking a city will lose men and material.  It will weaken them.  If we are talking about a traditional army, I would not do anything to tip them off.  I would, however, move as many small arms into the city as possible without being detected.  This would prolong the fighting within the city.  I would then ready a fast mobilization plan to move my troops to strike at their weak point as soon as they engaged the city.  \n\nMy boot goes on their throat the minute they move on my city.  I am heading for their weakest spot with everything I have.  They can leave the city to give chase (incurring loses), but there is no guarantee they can cut me off.  If they do cut me off, I can retreat to my previous position and still have my city.  If they don't cut me off, I win (in a traditional war).\n\nThis is assuming lots of things like terrain, weather, distance, luck, the level of defensive weakness, and that the intel can be trusted.\n\n&#x200B;
2	Surrender.\n\nDeclare a formal surrender will take place in 12 days as I gather my leaders, generals, etc. So that we can negotiate terms.\n\nNuke their military to a point where they can fight back on the tenth day.\n
1	I will lose the battle but win the war. I will do nothing at the moment, and lose at day 5, surrender. (Actually after you surrender, the guard will be lower, so I might not even need to wait till day 10 for the defense to be the weakest) Gather the resources and full out attack on day 10. Provided I am confident I can wipe them out at once. It will hurt when one of the city is destroyed, but it's small price to pay. 
0	Defend your city and do nothing. \n\nIf you cant take out the entire army then you will gain nothing by attacking its weakest point and having the rest of it come to you. \n\nIf you're really thirsty then defend your city and then move those forces to attack in 10 days time. \n\nAssuming you're on top 
0	If I had to choose one, I would defend my city. With the intel provided we don‚Äôt see any moves or situations outside of the 2 scenarios, so defending my city would result in saving more of my people. The attack would be by choice on our part and we wouldn‚Äôt have to attack and suffer casualties. So with limited intel defending seems more logical for prolonging life.
87	What's a rather toxic trait that you have?	I feel that we all have the potential to be toxic, not only as INTJs but as humans. What is probably most toxic about you?
199	Prone to isolating myself
158	Irritability, I get irritated easily by people, and sometimes leads to me being kind of a dick.\nEdit: grammar.
63	I assume people are ill intentioned for good deeds they do, it could be for fame, money , information , knowledge, my time, connections, my mental energy. If they apologize for their mistakes, I take apologies as hypocrisy, I‚Äôll think why don‚Äôt you repay for what you did wrong , apologies mean nothing, words are words. Of course, I say nothing when these happen, I just smile and walk away.
53	I'm told I "hold grudges" and don't forgive people their past mistakes. It could be true. In my mind I'm simply taking all past experiences, both good and bad, as evidence of a person's character and acting accordingly. If you fucked up last year, shown no improvement in subsequent opportunities, and it's relevant to a situation at hand, I'm definitely factoring that in.
52	Elitist Arrogance, mostly. It saturates every interaction I have and I've learned to fight back the Sneering Judge so things can go smoothly. I've developed plenty of compassion for people, but that doesn't dissolve my wish that they were better than they are, or can be. Every ignorant statement, simplistic question, unfounded belief, and narrow perspective makes the Judge stronger and, occasionally, he will win. Ending my interest in the person entirely and leaving the person very confused, which only makes things worse.\nMost of the time I'm more patient and prefer to engage with them in an agreeable way so they feel comfortable discussing their beliefs rather than defending them. Still have a reputation for being a cold, uncompromising, elitist though. A reputation with a few perks an INTJ can make use of, at least.
45	I know what I need to do to fix my problems, and yet I never seem to apply the necessary changes in my life.
32	Crippling anxiety. Makes my fiance think I hate him, and I've pretty much abandoned all my friends. I miss them... But, I'm not going to drive somewhere when I don't ABSOLUTELY have to... And when I've been working around people all week, the last thing I want to do when I get off of work, is more "people-ing". 
29	I keep my emotions to myself\n\n&#x200B;
27	When most people approach me to speak, I have a bad habit of assuming they're just going to waste my time, before they've even opened their mouths. Not terribly fair, or even all that accurate, in my experience. I just enjoy living in my head to the point that a breach of solitude can feel like an intrusion.
23	Pushing people away as a self defense mechanism.
47	Being proud and arrogant. I don't just look it but sometimes it seems I am. I wish I were as good a person as I see myself, but I fail to live up to my own standards and misinterpret human motivations. Human emotions being possible explanations is a new thing I discovered this week. I tended to assume that people in general were evil or stupid.\n\nTurns out many people look for emotional well-being, not information or truths.
20	While I am apathetic to 98% of people in my life, my 2% of an inner circle is held in such high regard, I lose who I am to appease them. It's taken me 27 years to find my best friend and I think I'm starting to lose the fire that they found desirable in me because I bend over backwards for them. 
16	I‚Äôm too independent and it makes romantic relationships kinda challenging 
16	Let's say I have an objective. I plan, and plan, and plan, and plan, and plan until the deadline has passed or I get so hung up about the 629 possibilities that it paralyzes me. 
32	I'm really selfish. 
12	I emit a noxious gas when I sense imminent danger, keeping predators at bay.
11	I'm pretty inflexible at times, especially when it comes down to the way I do things. There are reasons for the order in which I do things for example and if I can't do it in the way I always do it or see someone else doing it inefficiently it makes me incredibly anxious. \n\nI can be pretty selfish too.
11	Extreme anger outbursts. Obsessive.
9	‚ÄúHey, Ninja..., what‚Äôs your weakness?‚Äù
7	I feel like most of the things that I do are meaningless and so I became very apathetic and numb and I don't know how to solve this problem. \nNow I'm having trouble with empathy and relating to people. 
7	I never let anyone close. No one. My last girlfriend who I loved with all, well, most of my heart, I‚Äôd say I only gave her about 60% in.
12	I'm pretty manipulative and i have very low levels of empathy. Only for the ones i really love / like. I couldn't care less if the rest of the world died tomorrow.\n\n
6	Unstable anger. Sometime it lead to achieve good things but there are time where it led me to destroy good relationship but cutting people off or just doing disruptive behavior.
6	I avoid verbal conversations. Prefer text and email over voice calls. Many take it personally that I don‚Äôt want to talk, which most times I don‚Äôt, but anything written helps me remember important points and is documentation if for business/work reasons. 
6	I started therapy in December just because I had never been before and I had heard it's healthy to go to therapy even if there is no trauma, depression, etc. I have found it incredibly enlightening and helpful to have someone help me understand how my brain works.\n\nSo apparently one of my issues is that I 'live in subjectivity', ie. I give my intuition too much power. I think that what I see \*is\*. I don't make an effort to get a bit under the surface. This is probably what makes socializing so difficult, because I judge people too quickly and don't give second chances.\n\nThe other issue is that I don't allow myself to feel. I am very empathic towards others but not towards my self.\n\nMy doctor said I have a very strategic mind, which is great when it comes to work because I can 'see ahead' and I use it to plan my projects perfectly. But it is not so great on a more personal level because thinking about 'what might happen if...' all the time manifests as anxiety.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
9	Once someone has broken my trust, I never see them the same. I can forgive, but no matter how hard I try, I can't forget what that person did.\n\nThis becomes a toxic trait in relationships, where you can't really expect perfection from your partner. It's unrealistic for me to have a partner because of it. :(
4	I can get really really frustrated when people make stupid decisions. I also can't stand when they know it's a stupid decision, and are just taking the path of least resistance.
3	Not accepting that people can change.  \n\n\nIt takes a lot to break my tolerance (I'm not easily offended), but when someone manages to do it, I don't have the function to give them a second chance. As in, I might let them back into my life and be cordial with them for years--even playing the role of a friend, and helping them succeed in life. But in the end I feel indifferent towards them, and still see them as the same person they were before. I'll give them my time, and my thought, but I'll never consider them a friend or someone I hold important. Because of this that person might think we're "all good" and then are shocked when I randomly cut them off for some small inconvenience (like trying to force me to so something I don't want to). I realize this is a toxic trait, but I don't think it's something I can help. 
3	I‚Äôm easily irritated, and that puts me off to a lot of people. My irritation is fleeting, but I tend to express it instead of keeping it in. Unsure if that‚Äôs a good or bad thing, but regardless, i should be more patient with people. \n\nI lack tact. This is also something I struggle with internally, because most of the things I say to people I would want said to me. I find most people don‚Äôt want that, and I‚Äôm not sure if they‚Äôre right or not. \n\nI‚Äôm trying to be more like my better half, my intp, but I find he struggles with things internally more than I do. It‚Äôs almost as if, by us being assholes outwardly (you get what I mean), we are happier with our own selves. This ‚Äúarrogance‚Äù is why some people don‚Äôt like me. \n\nGood discussion I enjoyed reading the responses. 
3	Isolation, and being a little too honest with people, hard to read people i just run my mouth with no regard for others feelings rather than create a tactical way to approach it. \n\nObsession, it is a gift and a curse. I tend to subconsciously think everybody in my immediate circle of influence will find things interesting (most often they don‚Äôt). It‚Äôs just projection of myself onto those around me. 
3	I can be very self centered which isn‚Äôt that toxic in and of itself. When I‚Äôm in a relationship and I can‚Äôt hear the ways in which I‚Äôm hurting my partner because I just don‚Äôt get their emotions...it can become very toxic. \n\nMaturity has helped. Therapy has helped. Patient INTJ partners have helped. I still find myself unable to get the effects of my behavior on others. \n\nWe‚Äôre all works in progress. 
3	Skipping steps in explanations and assuming others will understand.\n\nThis really annoys people or the write me off as not having thought things through.  Some things just seem so obvious that I assume everyone else can see it.  As a photographer I am learning that sales are really increased when I tell people every detail, including what they like or dislike.
3	When I feel I know something‚ÄîI know it. No amount of rhetoric can change my mind unless it falsifies my already elaborate job of mapping out possibilities. \n\nThis kind of makes me a very pushy debater if someone brings up something extremely ignorant and stupid that I know I can squash. \n\nI‚Äôm not at all ever seeking arguments with people I don‚Äôt know, only those I‚Äôm comfortable with are the people I‚Äôm talking about here which is why I feel it‚Äôs a bit toxic. 
3	I don‚Äôt just like being alone, I want it more than anything. I don‚Äôt even speak to my relatives because they‚Äôre annoying and loud. I‚Äôll push people away just so I don‚Äôt have to deal with them. I‚Äôm trying to work on it, but that‚Äôs easier said than done. 
3	Cynicism towards romance.
3	Because of my tendency to overthink, if anyone starts behaving inconsistently, I get paranoid that they don‚Äôt like me anymore. So, you could say I am emotionally needy to my lifelines. 
3	Honestly, I‚Äôm kind of a stuck up bitch. If someone has shown me incompetence I have no interest in pursuing a relationship with that individual. I don‚Äôt like to engage in small talk so I come off as cold and uninterested 
3	leaving people before they have a chance to leave me.
3	I‚Äôm a pathological liar. It‚Äôs a habit I learned in my childhood (parents punished for telling the truth, even if it was the right thing to do) and it‚Äôs kept on going. I lie about my emotions, my wellbeing, even the most trivial things ‚Äì like having done something already etc. I fear that telling the truth might hurt or disappoint others, so I keep it to myself. \n\nI‚Äôm currently pursuing a romantic interest and I find it hard to reveal my vulnerabilities since they might make me unattractive in the eyes of the other person, even though doing so is essential for a healthy relationship to develop.
2	I totally forget that the other person is a human being and just piss them off.  
2	Unrealistically perfectionist, and I‚Äôm not that nice of a person, especially when I run out of weed. It‚Äôs the only thing that keeps me from saying to a rude older customer that their spouse must have have died with a wide smile. 
2	not taking the time in the moment to realise people don‚Äôt think or remember details the same way I do. I get internally frustrated when people forget things, or aren‚Äôt keeping up with what I‚Äôm saying. 
2	Horrendously stubborn. \n\nI'm open to other perspectives when it comes to beliefs I haven't given much thought, or actions to be taken on things I'm not knowledgeable about. \n\nYou just can't stop me when I've *decided* something. I believe I've thought it through to the fullest extent and let nobody change my mind.
2	INTJ here. The more I read and interact with other INTJ's the more I think they are narcissists.
2	I mentally check out from 100% of everything about once a month. 
2	I‚Äôm an arrogant prick and want nothing to do with most people I meet. I also believe I‚Äôm attractive which makes things even worse because people assume I should be the one talking and leading the group likely because halo effect. To top it all off, I have resting asshole face so even if I do like somebody, they likely won‚Äôt even know it. Shit is so isolating, but I‚Äôve grown to accept it.
2	Overthinking myself into paranoia and anxiety. 
2	I'm critical of everything. \n\nIn my career it can be a good thing, but it bleeds over into my personal life sometimes and it's not good.
2	Self-doubt. I'm always analyzing and problem solving at a point I might think I am the problem in toxic relationships. 
2	When someone can't make a fucking decision and relies on me to do it for them. I like that they think my choice will be the best and it most of the time is, but like damn.
1	What is "toxic"
1	vying for other's approval and then letting my head get inflated because of it
1	Catastrophizing in relationships: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs bad right now, it‚Äôs always going to be bad, and I should stop trying‚Äù
1	My superiority complex.  Well, that's at least what people are complaining the most about.\n\nAnd it also made my brother crying many times because I keep saying that I am talented and intelligent and my brother is too sensitive.\nWell I still don't understand how he could have been crying, I didn't even insult him xD\n\nEdit: actually people are complaining about a lot of things, like that I am arrogant, too obnoxious or  insensitive but I don't think that these traits are that toxic\nAren't they? \nActually I don't care :/
1	Impatience.
1	I am cold and unfeeling.
1	All these traits in the comments are lame, have you all dealt with actual toxic person? It's hell, not just minor annoyance. What I'm saying none of this is toxic, if someone is offended just by my lifestyle then they have mental issues.
1	Communicating, being hurt, arguing, standing up for myself, getting my point across. Almost any form of confrontation. My method has been extreme anger. Not physical violence I‚Äôd never hit someone unless I was hit I haven‚Äôt ever except for my brother. I‚Äôm learning this arguing yellin and screaming somehow was normalized as a child and I‚Äôve been trying to work on it ever since the past year.
1	My denial of my anger before recently learning that it's important to be honest with yourself about anger and express it or at least acknowledge and deal with it in healthy constructive ways... \n\nYeah. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
1	Putting 95% of effort into 5% of an issue that isnt that important. 
1	 I get paranoid and confused sometimes. Like when I didnt notice something but everybody Im around did. It comes off like im arrogant and im getting mad at myself for something super trivial- like too perfectionist\n(Im INTP)
1	The inability to offer anything of value for someone going through emotional trauma. Someone in a state of extroverted feeling absolutely paralyzes my ability to be of any use. The feeling spectrum to me is still so foreign, but I‚Äôm working to improve it. 
1	I‚Äôm very impatient. Once my mind is made up about something, I stick to it and want it completed as soon as possible. In my college life, once I‚Äôve finished studying for a test I get so impatient that I can feel myself get upset over the wait. Or waiting for papers to be returned is the worst, because I‚Äôm constantly questioning if I could have done better even though I know I did well. It also leads me to jump the gun on things sometimes, like when I bought my car. I had made the decision to buy a new car and refused to stop looking until I had one. It can make me very focused on particular things and completely disregard everything else. 
1	Skeptic of everything. 
1	I absolutely love intjs and I'm married to one but my husband has this problem... no one can ever meet his standards, and it sometimes makes him feel responsible for everyone or really burned out by everyone, or frustrated with others easily. I always joke with him that he's only married to me because I'm easy to laugh at :P It used to cause issues with other people but he's learned to accept others with time (sometimes breathing deeply yet controlling his annoyance somewhat lol) 
1	I obsess over mistakes I make. I can make a minor mistake, remember it much later and still be mad at myself.
1	I'm a bit of a killjoy when it comes to videogames. There aren't many that I enjoy anymore and most of the stuff released now i just view with disinterest because it's all the same stuff or I find something wrong with it, or just not interesting to me.\n\nMy friends call me salty. And it's often come to the point where I drag the whole mood in a channel down by upending a bag of salt on their hype parade.\n\nOn the other hand, when I love a game I won't shut up about it. But they'll also tend to try those games out because if *I* like it, then it must be pretty damn good.
1	Having really high standards for myself is great, but the inner urge to hold everyone else to those standards can be a bit damning and disappointing.
1	I overthink myself into a state of depression a lot, which often comes with having a negative outlook on life in general. Usually I am a pretty happy nihilist, but depression is depression nonetheless and I overthink things that don't matter really.
1	An omnipresent superiority complex :/
1	I‚Äôm a sociopath (Antisocial personality disorder). Though I don‚Äôt consider it a problem; most everyone else does though. Whtver 
1	I see everything as a means to an end.  That includes most of the people in my life.  I am an excellent strategist, but probably not the best human. 
1	I think my honesty  can be toxic
0	What are you talking about? Weaknesses are for other people. We're better than that. 
0	Arrogance/Hostility/Talking down to people. \n\nI see others as stupid,  illogical and a waste of time.  People are prone to telling me that when someone says something I think is stupid,  I make /a face/. \n\nI can't help it. \n\nI also will over/underexplain. I either give every detail and lose them,  or make them feel dumb by making it child-safe. \n\nI am very competitive.  In games that "Don't matter" (That's a lie they tell you to try and get you to lose by not putting maximum effort in). \n\nAt work,  during downtime,  we played a game caked 5 Second Rule. I won. Every.  Single.  Time. \n\nWhen I got promoted and left that area,  they said they'd miss me, but would be happy to see someone else win,  for a change. (I did try to be helpful and I probaby knew more than literally anyone else)But, I reminded them that the only reason they had a chance was because I was leaving.  :)\n\nI will destroy you in debate,  rip apart your defense,  desecrate its corpse. \n\nNow,  that being said.  I'll take a bullet for a stranger.  I'll be the first to jump your car or try and stop bleeding,  etc. I'll share my lunch of you have none.  I'll give you a ride if you normally walk.  I'm tempted to put weights on and pretend I weigh enough to donate blood.  After much consideration,  the risks are too much to justify when I can be more helpful in other ways. \n\nI'm also religious and highly moral. I have my own honor and it cannot be taken from me.  I'll die before that. I'm not prone to drinking.  Someone bet someone else that they could pay me to drink a whiskey-coke drink mix.  Earlier that night,  I told myself I wouldn't drink. I informed the soon-to-be loser of that,  and profusely,  adamantly refused the carcinogenic concoction . \n\nHe says "You're going to make me lose this bet".\n\nI simply said "No, you did that yourself". And that was that. \n\nIf you jilt,  dishonor,  or lie to me.  I'm done with you.  As a friend,  you're dead to me.  I'd still run into a burning building for you,  but not because of my loyalty.  That's long gone. \n\nI nitpick and comb over words and grammar with a fine-tooth comb. I'm not perfect,  but I try to be. And I expect the same of others. Heavy slang (some is acceptable),  ghetto talk,  etc... garbage in my eyes.  The death of a language and a culture.  The rise of trash. \n\nI could go on, but,  I'll park the train in the station today. \n
-1	Annoying others.. but ONLY when I want/need too...
0	Rage and vengefulness. I am a chill person but if someone starts being an evil abominable creature, or attacks anyone maliciously without being provoked, I start wishing for their death. When I see this I feel it is my duty to do the world a favor and go law abiding citizen on them...prayer and meditation keep me in check. There have been times where I have held a knife and thought: "This person  in front of me needs to die painfully and slowly, but I don't want to go to prison..."\n\nThis has delayed my productivity in the past as I would ruminate on violent thoughts  for hours sometimes. Now I live by a new saying: "F#@$ it"
27	Are your memories in first person or third person?	I was talking to someone about the traumatic experience he had of being robbed.  He mentioned that it was very strange recalling because he saw himself in the third person instead of first person.  \n\nMost of the time I recall memories in the third person.  I never saw it as odd.  Generally, my recall for past experiences is not good.  I don't remember the whole situation like a movie, just a glimpse, like a fuzzy picture, just a summarizing moment.  I remember the overall meaning or "lesson" of the memory, sometimes the surface level emotion like fun, happy, frustrated, etc., and then it's like the rest of the event drops from my mind.  \n\nEdit: I understand that he is likely seeing the memory from a third person perspective to disassociate.  Except that I do this with most of my memories, good and bad.  I'm wondering if anyone else can relate.  
9	I think because it was a traumatic experience they‚Äôve just disassociated from the memory as a result of trauma
8	My memories aren't exactly visual.  It's more like recalling a crude wiki article.
5	I'm pretty bad at remembering things, and I don't really keep a visual record of them. It's more like a database of events (THIS happened, followed by THAT, ...). Hell, I can't even remember faces! I recognize them when I see them again, though.
3	I remember things in third-person view, for some reason. And it's odd, because I remember very specific and random details about the memory. Great question!
3	I generally only remember the facts, players, or audio in a memory. "Remember" to me almost never associates with things like "relive", "reexperience", or "replay."\n
3	I have zero memories of traumatic experiences. Apparently my way of coping is specific amnesia 
2	Most memories I have are third person. Same with dreams.  Theyre like 3d snapshots that can be rotated and viewed at different angles. Over the years i've asked different groups of friends/family if they dream in third or first and haven't come across any third person viewers (small sample size). I've never really looked into this and have no other information. As far as I can tell, seems a bit rare. 
2	What an interesting question. I'm not sure mine are either. They're more like a 360¬∞ video where you can choose to focus on whatever you want, including internal thoughts and feelings.
1	I would say my memories are in the first person. One of my earliest memories, when I was maybe 3, is certainly from the first person and I think the other memories are too. Interesting question.
1	Both. I used to play online role play games. That's probably why.
1	Some of my worst childhood memories are third person but so was one of the best concerts I'd ever been to. So it's not just traumatic events. Certainly not the norm for me though. 
1	The only way I've ever seen myself in the 3rd person is an out of body experience, and it was extra strange to see myself that way since I'm not used to it. Everything is first person for me, except video games, fuck first person in games, makes me queasy.
1	If the memory is strong enough sometimes when I recall the memory I can imagine it in first and third person, sometimes interchanging between the two of them. For example, sometimes when I reminisce about a certain date I was on, I can remember it from the first person, what I was seeing, and the third person, almost like a movie. Even weirder, if I associate music with a particular memory, that song will play in my head as I remember, which makes the memory seem even more like a scene from a movie.
1	Yeah, i see memories in both 1st and 3rd person. Most childhood memories are in 3rd person and more recent ones are in 1st, but i have some recent 3rd person memories. 
1	Your brain and body are filtering / reducing your consciousness / perception. In times of great stress, or in some people all of the time, your consciousness breaks from your physical being.\n\nMore info:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/vijNhS1DuSU\n\nhttps://youtu.be/qbkgj5J91hE\n\n\n
7	INTJs and Music: What are your favorite genres? Do you have strong emotional connections to music? How often do you listen?	Music has been important to me as my daily anti-depressants. It might be more correlated to that than my personality type. Point being, I listen to music a lot. \n\nI‚Äôm curious about others. Oh, do go on. 
4	Radiohead songs! <------ 10 / 10
4	Music has always been a big part of my life and I still listen every day. I remember lots of music from different decades and genres but my interest lies in heavy rock/metal. I love the passion and energy.
4	Music provides me with an option to mute the outside world when commuting. As for what I listen to, Manntra, Iron Maiden, Sabaton, and classical music (Viennese classic, romanticism and sometimes baroque), I'm a big fan of Walzer
6	I listen to music that is not popular because i want to be different from all the basic bitchesüòÇ 
3	I love so many types of music, but house and techno pull me in like nothing else. I listen every day and I feel that I have a pretty serious emotional connection with it!
2	Metal (mostly black and melodeath), classical and recently i've started listening to dark techno
2	at least 4hrs per day, pretty emotional music, like Lil Peep or sad lo-fi
2	I like anything that demonstrates talent or skill. I like all genres but tend to dislike ‚Äútrendy‚Äù artists that don‚Äôt exhibit talent 
2	Deathcore, metalcore, progressive technical death metal\n\nYuh, metal helps me manage anxiety, anger, and sadness.  It is still amazing when in a more positive state.  It surprisingly helps me study.\n\nI‚Äôm always listening to something, I always carry headphones.
2	My tastes are all over the place. But I mainly listen to:\n\n\nHard rock/grunge. Stoner metal/rock.\n\n\nTrip-hop/acid jazz. Lofi hip-hop/beats\n\n\nSome classic rock here and there as well as folk. \n\n\nGangster rap too.
2	As we speak, I am listening to A Perfect Circles latest album on spotify
1	I'm a K-pop fan but I also enjoy rock, classical, and soul. I've composed for films. I've also been in a rock band though. Music is a big part of my life as it is also my profession. At home I typically like for it to be quiet. I'm a fan of podcasts though. I don't think I have a strong emotional connection to anything really.... except maybe my work. 
1	I only really listen to classical music.
1	Lana and soundcloud music that has a funky and indie sound to it. 
1	It's strange that I am so picky with music, since most of my formative years I studied in silence while all my friends couldn't study without it. I don't like all classic music, just things like "Pachelbell's Canon". I am also a sucker for instrumentals like some Rock. I prefer melody and harmony to verse.\n\nI like music that draws a single emotion.
1	My favorite genres are like indie rock and alt. rock.
1	I dig all the metal and hard rock fans here. I‚Äôm also in that category mostly listening to hard rock, hardcore and post-hardcore.
0	 2 Chainz.  A lot.  I like Chopin when I'm doing smart people stuff.  DMX in the morning.  Major Lazer, or just Diplo, both are good.    If I'm doing bad stuff, I like "Gimme Shelter" or "Eminence Front."\n\nI listen to a lot of blues, but have been moving into jazz recently.  I get my value out of my Spotify Premium.
6	How can I tell if my INTJ husband really loves me?	Just trying to understand what showing love in INTJ language is like.\n\n\nFor me (infj) I feel like I need to hear it often, lots of hugs, etc (which doesn't come naturally to my husband unless he really misses me)\n\n\nAnd I know my personality type can be smothering and I hate that, eventhough it's the only way I feel like I can express love to him. I really adore him.\n\n\nSo my question is, how can I show my INTJ love that'd be appreciated (I know he loves when I take care of him or let him game all day)\n\n\nAnd also, what do intjs do when they feel like they love someone? (I know one thing, he loves to tease me and make me mad then tackle hugs me. So weird lol) 
8	Real love? When you laugh together. When he gives you his undivided attention. When he does something for you without asking. When he thinks of something you would like at the store that wasn't on a list.\n\nPretty much anything that shows you were in his multitude of thoughts or the time he sets aside for you. We can get very involved in things and forget the people in our lives. I'm not a big hugger or expresser of feelings so I would say don't expect that from a typical INTJ.
3	How often do you engage with him in the stuff he enjoys? I don't mean sitting near him, I mean actively involved. INTJ's have minds that work best when distracted by an evolving idea (hence the common love of dynamic entertainment like video games) and when they have someone who can engage enough for them to share their interests, it can lead to a mental attachment when they think of something new. Essentially, try to adopt his interests or learn as much as you can. My ENFP wife doesn't write my stories with me, but she knows the ends and outs of everything I've made so far. \n\nAnother thing is that INTJ's prefer blunt communication so that when a problem arises, a solution can be formulated without messy details getting in the way. Just asking him about how he feels and getting him to look deeper than he normally does can help. As well as just telling him how you prefer to be shown affection and love. I will say that he will probably have his own interpretation of what you want, we're fiercely independent, but he'll probably make a good compromise. \n\nThis is all general and him being an INTJ doesn't tell us Everything about him. To me, it sounds like there's a distinct lack of communication and understanding. 
2	you're not sure this guy REALLY loves you and you...married him??\n\n*confuse*
2	Ask
2	The most valuable thing for INTJs tends to be time. \n\nAnything that hints that he is spending time doing something for you, or actively thinking about you is a pretty good indicator that you are on his good list lol.
2	You guys should take the 5 love language test. It helps understanding how you express and like to receive proof of love. \n
1	I believe most INTJ show love through actions instead of words. They tend to do things that their SO appreciates even it is a mundane task. They give more of their attention to you when the opportunity presents itself.
1	Try the love languages quiz and give it to him if you don't know what he likes. I could tell you what I like but it is not based on your MBTI. [https://www.5lovelanguages.com/](https://www.5lovelanguages.com/)
1	-He offers a listening ear to your problems\n\n-He makes plans and takes time to research crap relating to your requests and problems.\n\n-He engages in meaningful conversations with you\n\n-He actually cares to joke around with you.\n\n-He has a good sense of humor when around you.\n\n-He expresses love through action rather than verbal lovey dovey crap.\n\n-When he cares to sit in the same damn room with you for hours.\n\n\nSource: INTJ female who's been called everything ranging from robotic, mysterious, and "standoffish"\n
1	THANK YOU! I am an ENFJ in a relationship with an INTJ and things seemed to be going great,  then I started wondering if I was in a one-sided relationship? We spend a lot of time together and when I‚Äôm with him there‚Äôs no place I‚Äôd rather be, but it‚Äôs starting to feel like he could ‚Äútake me or leave me‚Äù and I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs ok with me? We are supposed to be moving in together, so this post is BASICALLY what I came here for, thanks so much and would love your insights, as you‚Äôve been married to your INTJ...Thanks again! üôèüèº
4	INTJ and connections with ADHD?	Hey peeps, im Shaun and I have ADHD (among other mental shit like anxiety and depression) but off topic. I've been curious to know if there are other INTJs that might have the same thing and would also like to know if there's a possible connection there with it. \n\nI'm an INTJ and INFJ.  \n\nAnd if you do have ADHD or anything of the sort what's life like form your perspectives. 
2	I am an INTJ with\n\n* Dyslexia\n\n* ADHD-Predominatly Innatentive\n\n * I have some Combined Type Symptoms, but I also have other attention issues they were considering in making a separate Attention Disorder with DSM V.  Sluggish Cognitive Tempo / Concentration Deficit Disorder / a form of Inattention Disorder that is seperate from the impulsivity symptoms of ADHD.\n\n * Only symptoms 13 and 14 are connected to ADHD-H, ADHD-Combined Type, ADHD-PI, the other 12 symptoms are associated with this other attention disorders the scientists think exist but they are not good at separating it out from ADHD-PI and you can have both https://i.imgur.com/oc97MNZ.png\n\n* Sensory Processing Issues\n\n* Depression\n\n* Anxiety\n\n* Problems with Left and Right\n\n* Coordination Problems\n\n* Bad Handwriting\n\nPlus some other stuff I am forgetting but I am also cutting myself off in order to be brief.

4	What personality is your best friend?	Mine is an INTP, and as everyone says, we stick really well together, even if we get fighting very often for stupid things
14	DOG
3	INTJ, and ENFP.
3	INFJ
3	INFP. My partner is one and I don't think I'd be even remotely as effective at anything without her. She adds sense and empathy to things I'd normally find painful and confusing. We're legitimately each other's best friends. Rarely fight. Can debate fairly and be "isolationist" together. I used to require solitude to "recharge" but she doesn't disturb that process at all. She's extremely tuned into my emotions and understands people's drives better than I can usually. She makes excessively social situations easier. She's beautifully tolerant of my ramblings.
2	ENTJ

3	How would you explain my mbti? Am I an intj, or a bit of everything?	
1	Have you taken the test more than once. Maybe not confident and decisive when taking the test. Dont think hard about the questions.  Try doing it on the weekend when you are relaxed and happy.
3	Struggling to Maintain this Friendship ENFP Update	\nThanks to y‚Äôall who gave some solid advice btw! \n\nOriginal Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/5zlgw8/struggling_to_maintain_this_friendship/\n\nWe have had a  few discussions about pasts mistakes but that‚Äôs about it. I never  honed in on the things that caused me to give up in the friendship.  I didn‚Äôt see what I could get out of it. Would have caused more harm than good imo. We‚Äôre kind of acquaintances now and that is so freeing me. Her new friend is a  mutual friend we‚Äôll call Meghan and Meghan is dealing with similar issues I did with her . Sometimes it‚Äôs  okay to let some friendships go.  Learn what your boundaries  are and what you what in a friendship! 
3	Good for you.  I think it's healthy to practice social hygiene from time to time and either end or let friendships fade.
2	Childhood	When I was growing up I was always a bit different to everyone else. I‚Äôm now an 18F but when I was about 5 or 6 I used to like to play by myself (I genuinely had no friends at that point). \n\nI have pretty good long term memory so I can remember that the reason I decided not to play with other children was because:\n\n1. I didn‚Äôt like them\n2. I saw no point in making friends.\n\nI was also an ultimate tomboy (even now) as other girls my age were playing with barbies and there was me playing with toy cars. \n\nI thought I would make this post so you can also share what your experiences of early childhood was like for you.\n\n(Btw, I‚Äôm not like this anymore. I do actually have friends nowüòÖ)
2	I'm 32, and had a semi-similar upbringing.\n\nI was very closed off, reserved and quiet. I was more interested in playing by myself, and being in my own head. In fact, I was so much in my own head, my mother had me placed in several residential treatment facilities, psychiatric hospitals, group homes and more.
2	Can‚Äôt say it was bad. I was more outgoing, had friends, we had family outings, ate dinner together every night, also allowed to be independent. My parents did their best. \n\nI was the youngest, but with a special needs sibling. I got to observe the consequences of my older siblings acts, was often dismissed by older siblings, and knew that the special needs sibling would always take priority. \n\nOverall positive, but learned that I would never be taken seriously. 
2	I was pretty autistic in my childhood and didn't have much friends.My parents and teachers always complained about my stubbornness.I was a teacher's pet so the other kids didn't like me.\n\nI was much of a sensor as a child and I was kind  of toxic as a friend.tbh I'm proud of my childhood.
1	Didnt have any friends especially in 3rd to 6th grade (ages 8 to 11).I always got asked why I was so quiet. Just couldn't relate to any of those kids, I guess. 
14	What doesn't kill you, makes you stronger	What is your view on that statement?
13	If you‚Äôre working that hard there‚Äôs probably a better, more efficient way of getting what you‚Äôre aiming for.
21	Absolutely true, as long as it doesn't leave you disabled :-)
11	I used to take it as a truism, but in reality,  there are so many qualifiers and exceptions that need to made that it is really pretty meaningless. \n\nExperiences change you. Seldom entirely for the better or for the worse. You may become stronger, more capable and resilient in some respects, but damaged, and more world-weary, defensive or bitter in others.\n\nThe turning point for me - the point at which I could no longer subscribe to that saying - was after first getting to know someone who had survived child abuse. They had gained *something* from the experience,  certainly, but only a fool could say they were 'stronger' overall.
7	It can cripple you for life.\n\nIn other words, it's just a "girly thing" style feel-good statement.
5	It‚Äôs illogical. PTSD and anxiety don‚Äôt make a person stronger. Being physically injured can damage nerves causing permanent pain and impairment.
4	Mostly agree, i mean you could still end up disabled or something, but for the most part i do think hardship makes people better.
3	It can be true, but just as often it isn't.\n\nSometimes, what doesn't kill you makes you weaker.
3	Lies don‚Äôt make you stronger and enough of it over time weakens you to powerlessness. Which is pretty much the same thing as death. 
2	False. Derived from a man who eventually went mad and became dependent. Didn‚Äôt make him stronger. \n\nPeople conflate endurance with abuse. There is a threshold in which over exertion begins to have negative consequences. Both mentally and physically.\n\nTry to apply that statement to real life examples. In body building. Will pushing yourself until irreversible traumatic muscle damage build strength? No. However reasonable endurance will.\n\nDefine reasonable limits and work toward them as pushing yourself to hard could make you weaker. Also, don‚Äôt allow people to abuse you, because what doesn‚Äôt kill you isn‚Äôt necessarily healthy. 
3	Sure, but what does kill you, does kill you...\nSo tread carefully, no extreme sports - that's for narcissists and immature INTJ
1	I agree only if I understood what it was that was trying to kill me in the first place, and to become stronger by not repeating the same mistakes as before. When I first started therapy, I never thought about the fear that was holding me back from letting all my emotions and trauma out. Few sessions later, after feeling assured that my therapist is someone safe to confide in, I took the risk of opening up and now I'm in a much better place and more willing to talk about issues honestly. What this taught me is that I took the risk by going against my instincts (mainly fear), and i got stronger simply by experiencing that one moment where I opened up, which allowed me to progressively open up more in the subsequent sessions and ultimately to make progress in my recovery. 
1	If this makes you feel better about suffering in the world, so be it. I think it's over-generalized. The real truth underneath is that we need challenges to improve ourselves. Too big a challenge at the wrong time, however, can be worse than death. Just ask the mental health providers.
1	Definitely true, considering I deal with painful migraines on the norm.
1	Yes, definitely true.
1	Suicidal thoughts dont kill you and they dont make you stronger. 
1	if you get shot enough, youll build a natural tolerance to bullets\n\n&#x200B;
1	It has some truth in it but I don't like how it's used, pain doesn't resolve itself by 'getting through it' or ignoring it. You've got to put active effort into growing past it to gain the benefits of 'getting stronger'. People who steep in their issues and refuse to develop, stay messed up well into old age. I've seen it. There's got to be a willingness to grow.  Throwing around conventional 'wisdoms' like this really annoys me, because people don't actually give it any thought they just parrot it because they think it's deep. 
1	How I understand this statement:\n\nIt applies to happenings or events where you almost die(its very bad in some way)\n\nIt doesn't actually kill you(you overcome the event and survive)\n\nThis sentence implies some increase in strength when the events above are met.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhit that understanding of the sentence I would say it is true. You overcome this huge challenge and in order to do so, you either improve an already existing positive or get a new one.
1	It's a good sentiment to push yourself and be resilient. Obviously does not hold up to scrutiny when taken literally.

113	Gut health and depression	Since so many people suffer with depression, I thought I would throw this out for review. \n\nIn summary, your gut has the same neurons as in the brain, can communicate directly with it, and gut health (bacterial balance) can affect mood/stress/emotions. Aside from that, if you have 'brain fog' this could be the underlying cause. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/gut-brain-connection](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/gut-brain-connection)
33	I'd had pretty severe brain fog for the past two years and (I think resulting) depression and social anxiety. I started eating well about three months ago and then I did a one-week water fast and it was like a complete reboot. This was months ago and I've been feeling and doing awesome since. 
43	Also, given the season, everyone should be looking at Vitamin D deficiencies too.
15	There is a symbiotic relationship between us and our microbiota. For years I thought when we experienced cravings for certain foods, it was our bodies signaling for certain nutrients. I'm beginning to wonder how much the microbiota influences our cravings. Maybe it isn't our bodies saying, "Mmmm, you want a candy bar", it could be the microbiota making that request. \n\nFor years, we've heard from a friend who's gone Vegan how the diet helped them immensely. We also now know that changing your diet can alter your microbiota. I wonder how much of feeling better had to do with Veganism vs the introduction of a new and wide varying beneficial microorganisms. People who suffer from IBS have a different microbiota than those who don't experience IBS. I'm sure this research is just the beginning of linking different diseases to the human microbiota relationship.\n\nThis leads me to my craziest theory yet, I emphasize CRAZY THEORY. One day this could true, but in the meantime it would make for interesting Sci-Fi. Here goes, What if the microbiota that lives within us, this collection of microorganisms, has what could be defined as a "consciousness". What if we as human beings are actually symbiotic beings living in unison as host to this organized collective of microorganisms. \n\nI really wonder if many of the mystery diseases we see today that have no seeming physical cause is actually a disruption to this relationship. So many people suffer from things like IBS or CFS and are tired of doctors telling them, "We can't find anything physically wrong with you". Maybe the answer isn't in our physical bodies. Maybe it's our "Symbiontic Microbiota" that is sick and the key to healing lies there. Who knows? Maybe one of you reading this will be the scientist to eventually prove this idea to be true.
12	This makes so much sense. Thank you for sharing. \n\nLately whenever I get excited about something my IBS flares. It‚Äôs been making me avoid anything that excites me - which, as you can imagine, is affecting my moods. \n\nIt‚Äôs good to know more about the process that leads to this, so thanks!
4	I'm literally working on an article about the gut microbiome right now so this was very timely.\n\nHere are a few things I want to throw out there that not many people know:\n\n- Some strains of Lactobacilli have been shown to have a positive effect on serotonin transportation in the intestine in animal and *in vitro* studies\n\n(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5776395/\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29451186)\n\n- Colonisation of the gut by certain fungal infections (such as Candida) can cause symptoms similar to depression, anxiety, chronic fatigue, IBS, and may increase risk of inflammatory bowel diseases like Crohn's and UC. Saccharomyces cerivisiae (brewer's yeast) colonisation causes a poorly-recognised condition called Auto-Brewery Syndrome in which carbohydrates are fermented into alcohol in the gut and cause intoxication.\n\n(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369527411000993\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/13590849009003132)\n\nAlso, from personal experience, taking a probiotic supplement containing Lactobacillus strains has definitely had a positive effect on my serotonin levels; I know exactly how a change in serotonin level feels having taken 4 different SSRIs and 5-HTP supplements in the past.
2	They refer to this pathway as the gut-brain axis, it‚Äôs so cool to discover that there is a channel of communication between the two! \n\nTracing back to the old saying ‚ÄúYou are what you eat‚Äù is pretty much spot on. For a healthy person,  The more diverse our diet is (rich in probiotic and prebiotic foods, low in refined sugars, high in fibre), than the healthier we will feel both physically and mentally. The brain works better and the body overall.\n\nFor those like me with a chronic gastrointestinal disease like Ulcerative Colitis, I have to undergo occasional ‚ÄúFecal Microbiota Transplants‚Äù to maintain that balance. \n\nGROSS WARNING: It involves the screening of a healthy donor‚Äôs stool for any bad transferable pathogens, and the donor‚Äôs blood for any active viruses etc. and if all these tests pass, their healthy stool can be utilised on the unwell patient via rectal enema. \n\nIt‚Äôs pretty much like taking probiotics but on steroids. The amount of healthy bacteria in a healthy person‚Äôs stool is crazy, and it‚Äôs helped me  so much In my journey to wellness. Better brain function, mood, I even feel a lot better physically after having infusions. It also cured my Clostridium Difficile infection which caused the colitis - this being the main application use for FMT by doctors at the moment.\n\nScientists see this field as wide open and they are excited for new research and findings - currently looking into new ways FMT can be prepared to help those with anxiety, depression, and even disorders like autism and fibromyalgia.\n\nIt‚Äôs a shame it‚Äôs taken so long! When I was a kid in the hospital in the early 2000s, the dietitian there recommended that I have ice cream with lots of high sugar chocolate topping on it to gain weight I had lost from the Colitis.\n\n THOSE ARE THE TIMES WE LIVED IN PEOPLE. She would be vilified in today‚Äôs day and age and I probably would‚Äôve been sicker if we followed her.\n\nLuckily my mother was smart enough back then to deny it and tell them off - nothing like her home cooking to put the weight back on. 
1	Absolutely. there has been a mountain of evidence and multiple people including myself that notice and enormous difference in how our brains function depending on what we have been eating\n \nPersonally speaking the single worst thing I can eat is a lot of salt and a lot of refined processed carbohydrates. If I do that I'm going to feel terrible
1	Can confirm. I was having a ton of gut problems and the symptoms exacerbated to full on panic attacks every time I would leave my house. Got diagnosed with SIBO(Small intestinal bacteria overgrowth) and changed my diet. Symptoms subsided but if I would have told people that I was getting panic attacks every single day, I would have been treated for that instead of the underlying cause(SIBO).
1	the summary you gave sounds so fucking wrong\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
0	There are many probiotics out there that address various issues including gut health. Try a health food/supplement store, they usually have higher quality products. I take a whole food multivitamin, calcium, magnesium, K2, and selected other supplements for my joints and brain. As a note, most multivitamins do not contain high amounts of calcium magnesium or iron because people usually have difficulties with those and supplement them separately. 
0	Yep, and what you eat determines the health of your gut microbiome because the bacteria eat what you eat\n\nA whole foods plant based diet cured at least 70-80% of my depression. It's helped me more than anything\n\nMore info: https://www.wholefoodsplantbasedhealth.com.au/gut-health/
32	Do you ever "complain" a lot?	One acquaintance of mine told me that I complain too much for everything and that he could never spend more than certain amount of time with me. However, I do not regard my complains and rants as something very serious and energy draining (if Im passionate about subject I'll put more energy into it ofc) , they are more random observations that come to my mind about random things and are said in joking and sarcastic manner. But somehow people find it energy draining and exhausting even tho I dont feel like my energy is drained at all. Do you have the same problem? Should I try to repress my thoughts and not tell them so often?
18	I guess I‚Äôm a complainer. I like to observe and discuss problems that I see in the world and how things could be made better. With the right people, that turns into an actual conversation that may last hours. With others, it just ends up being a casual complaint. I have found that other Introverted Intuitives are more open to these conversations. \n\nI have met people who I feel complain a lot and I don‚Äôt enjoy their company. This bothers me if what they‚Äôre complaining about is illogical or not something that I see as a problem. I also don‚Äôt enjoy complainers who aren‚Äôt looking for solutions. 
8	It‚Äôs usually the sensors that make that remark. Intuitive people understand it‚Äôs not a complaint but just an observation 
9	INFJ here, but I was recently told that I‚Äôm negative and critical. And I see myself the same way you described - sometimes I say things sarcastically or ironically but I really don‚Äôt mean it too seriously. I guess some people take it as negativity, but I don‚Äôt intend to be negative.
3	Yes. People tell me that, however, I reject it and embrace an idea that I‚Äôm more pragmatic. \n\nExample:\n\n>My friends see me as negative and complaining because I don‚Äôt want to wait in a 20 minute line for a burrito that everyone loves. \n\n>I love the burrito as well, however, I‚Äôm hungry and I know I could get a slice of pizza next door and be eating it within 30 seconds and feel equally content afterwards. I can get a burrito another day when the lines short. \n\n>I leave them in line and go to get my pizza. I can‚Äôt justify standing and waiting in a gaggle of people for 20 minutes for a food court burrito. They call me negative and a ‚Äúparty pooper‚Äù \n\nMy frustration with the burrito line being a thing comes off as being pessimistic, when in reality, I‚Äôm perfectly happy and content with my choices because they weigh-out logically.  \n\n
3	Whenever I make an observation about something, I have noticed it seems as if i am complaining. I am not, it's just an observation. People want me to talk more, so I try to express my thoughts, and it just seems like I am whiny. Not sure how to fix it, but it is what it is. I should just stay quiet instead, honestly, because I don't like feeling forced into speaking. 
3	I don't know if I'd call it complaining, it's more like analysing things, finding obvious flaws, and thinking about solutions. It veers more towards complaining when the problem is obvious, the solution is obvious, and the barrier to things being fixed is a combination of obliviousness, apathy, intransigence, and ignorance. \n\nTo me it's more of a pressure release valve. Otherwise, I'd just get properly angry. This way, things don't get bottled up.
3	Yes, I exhaust everyone around me.   It helps to find ways to release frustration in productive ways, however, to a certain degree you can‚Äôt repress one‚Äôs true nature.
2	Yes, very often. An ISTJ I know always say I complain a lot but I think I'm just making an observation and I'm comfortable enough with that person to say it out loud. Again, like yours, it's not that deep and I don't take it seriously -- just an observation.
2	I never complain. I once had a person confront me about it. 
1	If I get fixated on trying to find a solution to a problem, yes. 
1	I don't complain.\n\nI do yell at the TV.
1	No, because it is draining to me. Even writing novels worth of crap like rants drain me. \n\nDealing with major crappy life experiences, writing fictional crap, music, and people who barely listen have pretty much killed all of my repressed my ability to complain.\n\nOn the flip side, I can be quite pessimistic. But, it's usually just done in a  dry and blunt manner.
1	I find that rather than complaining, coming up with solutions is more productive. Anyone can complain, be the person with the answers. And then do something about them.
1	I‚Äôm a critical thinker, it‚Äôs just who I am.  People can benefit from it or they can ignore it.  
1	I complain a lot to my family about anything, but I tried to be more of a positive person to people around me. My friend says I never complain, but that's not true lmao
1	No, but it's because I've moved into entrepreneurship. All my complaints about something are either channeled into my work or I realize it is out of my control and so I don't say shit about it.\n\nWords are cheap. I also don't connect much to people these days so I usually keep my opinions to myself.
1	I use a lot of sarcasm in my complaining. Meaning I make jokes about stuff...but, the truth is that it ain't that bad. I am a pretty stoic motherfucker...but, the sarcastic complaining does make me and others laugh.
1	I'm always complaining about everything lol\nWell, I can not tell if this is because I'm Parisian, but I assume to be constantly grumpy, I don't find it tiring at all, I'm used to it
1	Funny how pointing out obstacles that others can't see is seen as a negative, when in fact it's more of just a caution or warning and not a negative.   Most people are short sighted, again, not in a bad way, they just tend to not look at all potentials as some others do.\n\nIt's nice when you meet up with people who understand our viewpoint and don't see it as being a pessimist, but as an optimist with cautions :)
1	Why don't people understand sarcasm	When people ask stupid, boring or obvious questions, I answer sarcastically, but people, especially my parents, take it as insolence. I hate this so much\nCan't people understand sarcasm?\nIt's not insolence because I don't want to be disrespectful, I mean, I'm just answering to a stupid question. It's not my fault if people's questions are stupid. \nBut I can not say to the people that their question is stupid, so I answer with sarcasm, so if I don't want to be grounded then I don't have to reply right? Because the problem is that, answering to everything is stronger than me. And whatever I do people will always take it as insolence lol\nIt's a viscous loop I just don't get it people are so stupid and annoying
6	>When people ask stupid, boring or obvious questions, I answer sarcastically  \n  \nCritically think about this statement.  \n  \nThe person asking the question is not thinking it's *stupid, boring or obvious* yet you always choose to react this way whenever *you* feel that. So when you respond with sarcasm.. it's not understood, which would make sense given the context.\n  \n*Think*, *Feel*, *Do* Cycle.
4	Apparently, people think I‚Äôm being funny when I reply with sarcasm. Perhaps that‚Äôs all it is, they‚Äôre not taking you seriously. 
3	People do understand sarcasm. It's very likely that your delivery makes it come off as insolence. Do you use sarcasm with a deadpan look on your face and flat tone? With your parents, it's a different story though. They have their own standards of behavior, and changing your delivery may or may not improve your situation there.\n\nAlso consider that many "obvious" questions are only asked when the consequence of the answer being unexpected is high. Your parents may ask you if you locked the door on your way out of the house (despite watching you lock it) in order to double check what they saw you do. This question is not stupid. It is cautious. Further consider that many obvious or boring questions have short answers by their very nature. Not too sure why it would bother you to give a straightforward answer to those who you already know do not take kindly to your "sarcasm."\n\n> Because the problem is that, answering to everything is strong than me. \n\nCan't tell what this means.
3	One of the best things my (ex-)wife I and I decided to do in the early part of our marriage was to eschew sarcasm. This was mostly on me, because I used it a lot back then. I now try to avoid it everywhere.\n\nSarcasm is good for a quick laugh, especially among the cynical, but otherwise is of no benefit to a healthy relationship. It is a cheap and easy response that calls attention to oneself and signals an unwillingness to work in good faith towards the goal of the conversation.\n\nPeople do understand sarcasm. They understand it exactly as you describe. At a minimum it is unproductive. In the context you describe, it is not hard to imagine that it might be taken as disrespect, regardless of your intent.\n\nPeople do ask stupid questions. You do not have to respond in kind. Instead of exercising your already ample wit, try to figure out their goals and motivations, and spend your energy on how best to further them without compromising your own goals and boundaries.
2	Your parents want you to behave differently. You want them to behave differently.\n\n> And whatever I do people will always take it as insolence\n\nReally, whatever you do? Have you tried just giving a straight answer?
2	*sigh* Sarcasm is fun and easy in the right context.  When everyone knows you're making a joke, you can impress them with the verve, cleverness, and creativity of your delivery.\n\nRay: Everything was fine until the grid was shut down by dickless here.\n\nWalter Peck: They caused an explosion!\n\nMayor: Is this true?\n\nPeter: Yes sir, it‚Äôs true. This man has no dick.\n\nBut It can also be a rhetorical strategy of weakness or of concealment.  \n\nOne the listener realizes you are speaking sarcastically, then they also recognize you are *purposefully* being non-responsive.  By throwing down the implied challenge "I'm saying things with words, but it's up to you to figure out if they're true or not" you're taking a risk they hear just the *challenge.*\n\nNote, if you don't give a *tell*-a signal to the listener-that you're being sarcastic, the risk is that you are effectively lying, even if that wasn't really your goal.
1	i always use sarcasm, ive always been like that, so im kinda used of people not understanding my sarcasm, they often get offended bc i can say offensive stuff but idk for me its just obvious im being sarcastic, i mean if i wasn‚Äôt i would be like the dumbest person on this planet\nbut there‚Äôs one thing i noticed, it became so ordinary for me to use sarcasm that i dont even change the tone of my voice to point out its just sarcasm lmao, makes everything even worse actually
1	People IRL do but not on the internet, at least that's my experience with it.
51	Anyone else think like this about, um, everything?	
6	Looks like option 5 is a win.
3	I love playing around in Excel and I'm taking as many math classes as I can for fun. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nUm,...maybe??
2	Always, how do I stop?
1	Yeah this is my brain 
1	can someone explain this?
1	Okay so this is cool but where are your conditional modifiers? \n\nI mean you can‚Äôt tell me your probability trees apply to all conditions. \n\nKudos to you for perfecting your thought organization and concision though. Mine would look like a Subway transit map, with a legend and color coded probability trees that change in real time like the moving stair cases in Harry Potter hahaha (I hope this didn‚Äôt sound like I was somehow inferring I think ‚Äúbetter‚Äù I just loved your question it cued how funny and sporadic I feel mine would be)\n\n
1	Looks like Ti. I also see beliefs and possibilities as probability trees.
1	Looks more like an ISTJ thought process imo
1	Reminds me of this Elon quote\n\n> The thing that I care about is‚Äîwhen I look into the future, I see the future as a series of branching probability streams. So you have to ask, what are we doing to move down the good stream‚Äîthe one that‚Äôs likely to make for a good future? Because otherwise, you look ahead, and it‚Äôs like ‚ÄúOh it‚Äôs dark.‚Äù If you‚Äôre projecting to the future, and you‚Äôre saying ‚ÄúWow, we‚Äôre gonna end up in some terrible situation,‚Äù that‚Äôs depressing.\n\nNot a fanboy of his, but I found it very, very relatable the first time I read it. Seems to be a things!
1	For me it starts off with one decision tree, if there is a dead end, I go back to start to search for another possibility. But I wouldn't start off with a million scenarios. 
4	How many people understand this? 27:48 why didn‚Äôt she entertain the question?	
3	Isn't it just explained over the course of the next 4 minutes?\n\nThe audience member essentially said that when she first read the speaker's work, she "thought it was proper" and agreed a bit. Then she says "Today, however, I am more educated-" and the speaker cuts her off. The (clearly accidental) implication is that the speaker's position is uneducated while hers is. This is why the speaker says "[the audience member] has already estimated her position, and my work, incidentally..."  \n\nI imagine the speaker has such a negative reaction to this phrasing/construction of the question because she devoted her life to her work.
3	Where Ayn chose to stop the question it implied that Ayn's philosophy only appeared correct to less educated people.\n\nLike one of the old sitcom plots that revolves around everyone not listening to anyone's full explanation, and choosing the least charitable interpretation.\n\nI don't think anyone ever accused Ayn of being 'nice'.
4	Ayn Rand comes across as defensive and unwilling to examine the possibility of being wrong. Rand was very offended by someone else saying that they were more educated now and may not agree with her, and that suggests Rand puts a high value on intelligence and education and does not feel comfortable with the idea that that could be used against her. \n\nHer emotional outburst at the woman undercut the woman‚Äôs ability to articulate her position. \n\nIt‚Äôs interesting too that Rand basically argues that, because she says she‚Äôs more educated now, that she has already made up her mind. However, it‚Äôs clear from the rest of the question that the woman has not made up her mind at all, only that she is more skeptical of Rand‚Äôs position. Which Rand doesn‚Äôt seem to take well to. \n\nIn reality, it‚Äôs Rand who has already made up her mind, who thinks she already learned everything there is to know, and who will dispense her wisdom to the lowly masses. \n\nUltimately the woman asking the question‚Äôs life experience is not relevant to the conversation, which she should have just asked directly. However, since part of the statement is not relevant, it should be disregarded entirely and not factored in to anything else. The fact that Rand can‚Äôt do this and is so triggered by someone feeling smarter than her speaks to a flaw in Rand‚Äôs character. \n\nIf you are truly committed to the truth, you dispassionately explore all paths and any idea can be put up against the existing one regardless of its origin. If a crazy homeless man writes down the exact steps to cure cancer, the cure would work all the same. \n\nThere are things about Rand I like and agree with, but I think she makes some large leaps and doesn‚Äôt factor in the possibility of black swan events. I think she tends to disregard ideas that disagree with her. I agree with the woman asking the question that the idea companies are looking out for us or that their actions will work out in our benefit as insane.\n\nRand worries a lot about the tyranny of government, but doesn‚Äôt believe in the tyranny of corporations. We need a balance that prevents tyranny from others. \n\nI fail to see how a large company is fundamentally different from government. Even in my career, I see that public and private sectors are more similar than dissimilar; private companies just tend to pay more and have more competent people. 
1	This is a lesson in rhetoric. I made a transcript to help with analysis.\n\n>Unskilled Questioner: "15 years ago I was impressed with your books and I sort of felt that your philosophy was proper. Today however I'm more educated and I find that if a company--."  \n>  \n>Ayn Rand, interrupting before UQ gets more than a few words in: "This is what I don't answer... She's already estimated her position--and my work, incidentally; displaying the quality of her brain, if she says she is more educated."  \n>  \n>UQ, now on the defensive: "I'm more educated now than I was 15 years ago, when I was in high school..."  \n>  \n>Ayn Rand: "I'm not interested in your biography. It is without context." \[The "It is without" was unintelligible; I'm about 60% confident this is what she said.\]  \n>  \n>Phil Donahue: "Let her make her point."  \n>  \n>UQ states her point simply, articulately, and effectively.  \n>  \n>Donahue calmly responds to UQ stating Ayn Rand's position. They have a brief, calm, back and forth.  \n>  \n>UQ, ultimately, to Donahue: "I can't believe it, because money is power. And the more money you have, the more power you have."  \n>  \n>Donahue, to Ayn Rand: "Can we encourage you to make a contribution to that observation?"  \n>  \n>Ayn Rand: "I will not answer anyone who is impolite, but--"  \n>  \n>Audience responds negatively to this.  \n>  \n>Donahue: "She wasn't impolite."  \n>  \n>Ayn Rand: "I do not sanction impoliteness and I am not the victim of hippies. But--"  \n>  \n>Audience again responds negatively, this time also with laughter.  \n>  \n>Donahue, incredulously: "Hippies?"  \n>  \n>Ayn Rand: "That's where it started. The dropping of politeness and of manner."  \n>  \n>Donahue: "You're equating someone who disagrees with you with impoliteness. That's not fair."  \n>  \n>Audience applauds.  \n>  \n>Ayn Rand: "No no. If you didn't interrupt me I would have demonstrated what I mean. To show you that I am not evading the question, if anyone else wants to ask the same question politely, I'll be delighted to answer."  \n>  \n>Audience reacts negatively again.  \n>  \n>Donahue: "There was nothing impolite. You are punishing this woman for the vigor and energy that she brought to the dialog. And that's not fair to her. This is the kind of woman we spend a long time trying to attract to our television audience."  \n>  \n>Audience (of mostly women, FWIW) applauds.  \n>  \n>There's a short back and forth between Donahue and Rand.  \n>  \n>Ayn Rand: "She says, now she's more educated. What does that mean?"  \n>  \n>Donahue: "Well, that means she now has a different view. There's nothing personal about that observation. Don't be so sensitive!"  \n>  \n>Ayn Rand: "I am going to be! I intend to be!"\n\nCut to commercial, followed by a different question. Then at 32:04, Ayn Rand returns to this question, saying she'll answer it if anyone will ask it politely. Finally, Donahue restates the question and she answers, bringing the exchange to a close at 34:14.\n\nThe questioner's first mistake was in thinking that she could establish credibility with her rhetorical opponent by stating that at one time, they were in agreement. This is a common gambit, but this exchange shows it is not as effective as people who use it think. Her second was in stating that her change of opinion came about through education, implying that her opponent is uneducated in some way--it's not just a difference in opinion. Given the setting, the questioner should have simply stated her point and asked her question.\n\nThe rhetorician's response is to latch on to her opponent's rhetorical mistake, by taking offense at her inference that her opponent considers herself superior. She then overplays her hand by refusing to answer on the grounds of her opponent's supposed impoliteness, and by throwing an *ad hominem*, implying that her opponent is a hippie.\n\nThis response is an even worse mistake than those made by the questioner, because it causes Rand to lose the audience's respect. This would have derailed a normal conversation, and she probably would never have gotten the opportunity to materially respond to the question. A better response would have been to simply answer the question; that would have established her credibility without all the drama.\n\nSomething Rand says during the second part of the exchange is worth mentioning:\n\n>Ayn Rand: "I didn't come here to be judged. I came here to answer questions."\n\nShe doesn't want to be challenged; she wants to be treated as an expert. I think most of us can identify with that. But everyone deserves respect, and no one deserves unqualified deference, and this exchange demonstrates the risks of failing to fully appreciate these underpinnings of civil discourse.\n\nThe master communicator throughout this exchange is Donahue. He's worthy of study.
1	This is an intelligence test. The ability to understand things without bias. I‚Äôm just curious of the results. Thanks for humouring me. 
14	Empathy	My wife claims I lack empathy which I somewhat agree on I suppose. She is slightly concerned and says I should ‚Äúlearn‚Äù to be more empathetic. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt want to be more empathetic but I don‚Äôt really see how that is possible. I feel that people are born with more than others and that is that. Maybe someone can say they learned to be more empathetic but are they really? Have they changed their inner being and mind that much?\n     \n       It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm not empathetic. But it takes a lot more to move the needle for me. My wife is an INFJ so of course she feels empathy for everything so maybe that‚Äôs why she feels so extreme about my lack of? 
9	Just try to put yourself in someone else's skin. Empathy 101. 
3	Do you think you lack empathy? I think I have a strong capacity to understand what others are going through; I get kind of offended at this accusation. \n\nWhat I have difficulty with is mirroring emotions. \n\nPerhaps you could just repeat what a person is going through, to acknowledge you hear them. 
3	Ask her how she would feel if you (on a whim) asked her to "learn" to be less empathetic and maybe she will see how ridiculous it is. You can certainly get better at faking empathy (experienced medical staff maintaining good bedside manner), but if it's the genuine thing she feels you should feel more of, that's not an option. You can't control what you feel, only how you respond to it.
2	Yes, I have changed my being and mind that much.  It's awesome.  People used to tell me that I was cold and heartless.  I figured out how to develop emotions, to act empathetic, and to experience life with an additional sensor called feeling.  It is totally worth it.  I didn't know that joy and happiness felt good.  I didn't understand what "feeling good" actually meant.  It has been really great and I recommend that all INTJ's figure this out.\n\nHere's a post where I talked about how to respond to people who are emotionally venting.  Don't try to fix them, just sooth them by saying things like I'm sorry and it's not fair (even if they deserved it):  [https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/aqqu25/i\_failed\_at\_call\_center\_work\_because/egife9t/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/aqqu25/i_failed_at_call_center_work_because/egife9t/?context=3)  This alone will cause others to think that you are really empathetic.  Sadly, you can learn these techniques without ever feeling anything.  Just mirror back to people what they are expressing and they'll think you're an empath.  But true joy for me came from learning to actually love people and feel love for people.  I went from hating people and thinking they were a waste of oxygen, to loving them and enjoying them.  My life is so much better.\n\nHere's a post where I talked about how I pretended to demonstrate love to people for 30 days until I started to learn it:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/avruoj/is\_it\_normal\_that\_i\_dont\_feel\_that\_sad\_when\_i/ehjjho5/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/avruoj/is_it_normal_that_i_dont_feel_that_sad_when_i/ehjjho5/?context=3)  Every "cold and heartless" INTJ needs to learn this for their own sake.  It brings so much happiness in to our rational world; happiness that we don't even know that we're lacking.  It's amazing.\n\n&#x200B;
2	I really don‚Äôt feel like INTJs are so synonymous with this idea of being ‚Äúnumb‚Äù\n\nYes, I hate hearing the group of people talk about how hard their first world problems are and how ‚Äúbilly joe hit Steve in the face and it was crazy.‚Äù Because I feel it‚Äôs pointless other than the reason of creating more drama‚Äîand this I can‚Äôt empathize with. \n\nHowever, I have to say that this is more of a ‚Äúyou thing‚Äù\nthan an INTJ-thing while the connections can be very close. I‚Äôve always felt like a borderline empath. Sure I struggle to communicate my own feelings and process my own feelings, but my ability to empathize every small aspect of a person‚Äôs situation is ridiculous. My problem is that I won‚Äôt necessarily say anything or offer support to that person‚Äîhowever, their problems and situation stays floating in my head for a long time. \n\nI feel I‚Äôm empathetic and INTJ in the way that I can definitely empathize and comprehend someone‚Äôs situation of possible obstacles And use that to help better understand them as a person‚ÄîBUT I also use this to then make my own conclusions about the emotional output of that person and if it‚Äôs rational or not. \n\nThis is where the INTJ in me comes in and says: ‚Äúwhy are you crying...‚Äù\n\n\n
2	Two part answer/talking points. \n\n1. Actionable empathy: I have learned that it is important to verbally identify how people are feeling and say it back to them usually in relation to something else they need to do. There‚Äôs a great formula for this I use multiple times per day.\n\n(1) Identify the feeling. (2) Acknowledge that their feeling is valid and acceptable; express if you share that feeling for bonus points. (3) Pivot to whatever action/info is needed.\n\nEx: ‚ÄúI understand that you‚Äôre upset your goldfish died. Death is a sad thing, and it‚Äôs hard on all of us. I miss Goldie too. But we have to go to school today because life has to keep going on for us.‚Äù\n\nNote that this also works for correcting someone‚Äôs behavior or relaying things to sensitive people.\n\nEx: ‚ÄúI appreciate that you are so passionate about our products that you want to make sure we get a fair price. That makes sense, we need to be profitable and we do make great products. However, I think that passion came off as aggression, which will drive the customer away, and then we won‚Äôt get any money. So sometimes we have to make exceptions and lower the price.‚Äù\n\nAlso, it‚Äôs helpful for me to do the same to myself. \n\nEx: ‚ÄúI do feel upset that I lost my job. That is a really hard thing to go through in so many ways. If I was happy about it something would be wrong with me. But it happens to millions of people, so I will have to do my best to start finding new leads on a new job. I can‚Äôt just lay down and die.‚Äù\n\n2. Empathy does not equal action. Given the above, it follows that just because someone‚Äôs feelings have validity doesn‚Äôt mean that we can act on those feelings. (All feelings have validity - all feelings. By definition, if you feel it, it is valid because it is a reaction to something. Doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a positive thing or a helpful thing, but it is a thing.)\n\nYou can fire someone with dignity and respect. You can break up with someone kindly. You can give direct orders with kindness. They are not mutually exclusive; they actually support each other. \n\nYou can‚Äôt control their emotion or their reaction. They may still blow up at you. But that‚Äôs on them as long as you did it with dignity. Showing them that you understand them demonstrates respect, but respect doesn‚Äôt override the actions you need to take.
1	Yeah,\nMy ex would claim the same of me. On occasion calling me an emotionless robot. I understand actions, as well as manipulations, and have clear cut boundaries. Am I empathetic, not if a person is doing something STUPID. \nNow I (an INTJ) am in a relationship with another INTJ, and it is beautiful. We understand the subtleties of our emotions. 
1	"Empathy" ...what a concept. Heh.\nWell. If you want my opinion, don't change yourself. In my case (I am an INTJ) I've been a lot confused about this, I thought I was Asperger, but I can not prove it without being diagnosed, and I refuse to see a psychologist due to my superiority complex.\nAs a woman, yes because I am XX, it's pretty hard to live in the society when you don't really feel or express emotions. All my private circle is way more empathetic and emotional than me, and, it's difficult for me to comfort someone, because I don't understand their pain (Also because I find it useless, boring and I think that they are too sensitive and let themselves being controlled by their own emotions) but, well, I do find these situations pretty uncomfortable ._.\nMy best friend is an INFJ, we are pretty close actually... Ahem.      Hm.. funny that your wife is infj too. \nAnyway.\nWhen I try to be "empathetic", my friends just notice it, because of how horrible I am at this xD\nI've been trying for years to feel empathy, but this is something you can not force yourself to have. It depends of how you think, if you think like me, that people are stupid and even more for not being able to manage their emotions, I don't think you'll be able to be to be more empathetic. \nIt's pretty hard at school to be like that, and especially because I am a female I have difficulties to be understood in the society, you can not talk about what you think because people reject you. Trying to be empathetic wears me out, I just can't. My friend is friend with me because of who I am. And to be honest, actually I don't care because there's 7 600 000 000 of people on this planet so, there's as many friends as I want so that was a bad example-\n\nBut you know, this is what makes my identity, my personality, if someone is hurt because I said something I really don't care, but I what people do not understand is that I DON'T WANT TO HURT THEM, It's not intentional, and this upset me. But I said to my friend that sometimes I say things and I don't know if he will be hurt or not and he understood.\n\nWhat I do is that I apologise (even if I don't mean it, I'm just being courteous) for hurting or not understanding the person. Then people will maybe forgive you. And just stop thinking about this, don't let these shitty thoughts disturbing you. Lacking empathy is a strength. You are able to brave your fears and tell people what you think. People tend to lie "because it would hurt the other" FUTILITIES they are just to weak to say the truth.\nAnd rationality is so much stronger, because it surpasses emotions. You are able to control yourself, not like the others, they're all stupid
1	I have become more empathetic over time, but I am a complete failure in being *supportive* when people are in need of emotional support. Could it be that this is what your wife is actually talking about?\n\nMy only strategy for approximating emotional supportiveness is [active listening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_listening). Active listening is not as easy as it may seem; it requires training and skill, and I have to work hard at it during conversations in which I realize it's indicated. In my experience it's sufficient in about 90-95% of the occasions where emotional support is called for. In the remaining cases I am at a complete loss.
1	I'm an infj and my husband is an INTJ. We had this problem a lot early on in our relationship, and I realized we just weren't expressing ourselves in ways that let the other understand.\n\nFor example id cry, be emotional. Etc and instead of listening to me rant or hug me he'd get logical and to the point and then I'd feel like he doesn't care he just wants me to solve it and shut up.\n\nSo I realized I need to talk to him in his language (clear, to the point, not beating around the bush, not expecting him to take the hint if I want something etc) and he in return understood that my feelings matter a lot to me and he listens more, tries to show he loves me more (we had a problem I always felt like he didn't love me too but he'd just show it differently)\n\nSorry if my post is all over the place it's extremely late where I am. 
1	If somebody close to someone dies or something then yeah that‚Äôs terrible and I feel for them. Or if they have to put their dog down, etc. But if someone for example hurts themselves (not super seriously) at work or something not so great happens to them through their own actions ( maybe homeless because of drugs or alcohol) then I don‚Äôt really feel a lick of empathy for them. Maybe that‚Äôs normal?? I‚Äôm mostly comparing myself to my wife who literally saves every little bug she sees or says she feels bad for me when eating a burger (????). So maybe I‚Äôm setting the bar too high
3	INTJs and mental math	I know this statement it‚Äôs overgeneralised but I wanted to ask - do INTJs tend to be good at mental math? I say that because I incorporate mental math into a lot of my rational thinking, I‚Äôm very good at making quick estimates as well as doing multiple calculations without using paper. When it comes to actual maths theory I‚Äôm not great because I find it boring tbh. \n\nSeems natural INTJs would be good at maths as it coincides with Ni/Te which is all about personal rationale 
5	I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm better at math theory than mental math. But I never cared to memorize my tt.I studied some calculus and statistics at the university level and I really enjoyed the concepts and equations. Once I discovered math is just a language I enjoyed the concept of being able to explain ideas with logic. 
2	Yeah. I‚Äôve noticed that I‚Äôm the first to make an answer, then someone will use a calculator to confirm. 
2	Also when I‚Äôm at the gas pump I always try to calculate the amount of gas I‚Äôm receiving. Always close to the amount. 
2	Yes
2	I'm pretty bad at maths. It's just too... well, flexible? But I'm quite good at programming, and mental debugging comes easy to me (I have never felt the need to use a debugger).
2	Me almost every day in any random place:\n\n" I need your calculator"
1	I‚Äôve always been pretty good at mental calculations, estimating and creating shortcuts to solving problems. I also enjoy logic puzzles. Not quite so good at fully understanding the full mathematical theory behind higher math. 
1	I feel I could probably become good at it with practice. I'm pretty comfortable with mat due to some advanced math courses in high school.
1	i never wanted to waste paper so in primary school i did nearly all my calculations in my head, sadly lost that ability when i started highschool. i have never been very good at complex math.
10	Intj's in the work place- how to deal with the emotions of your colleagues?	*Sorry a bit of a rant ahead*\n\n10 months ago I started my first proper job. I was so happy and was very much looking forward to being a part of a small organisation that could make a difference in the world. \n\nWhen I first started, the CEO took a shine to me however he was the only one. My other colleagues were very timid around me. I like to think I started off being friendly but now I just do my best to not be impolite.  \n\nTo summarise the dynamics of the small office I work in: \nOne of my colleagues is an enfp and he isn't my biggest fan because I've declined to go out with him a few times (on dates). For this reason, he takes any opportunity to make me feel like crap throughout the week. \n\nSome of my female colleagues have a crush on my enfp colleague and are passive aggressive towards me because of it. \n\nOne of my other colleagues, who is the CEO's favourite (and who I thought was cool in the begining) feels threatened by my presence and I can sense it- I genuinely have no interest in taking her place in the organisation.\n\nThe head of my department wants me to "wing" aspects of my job role which dont have proper documentation as he doesn't want to look bad for not having it in the first place. I've refused to do this as I know I will get in trouble  in the future if I do (and he will find a way to blame me). I've also tried to write the proper documentation to resolve this issue but he keeps diverting the topic whenever I talk about submitting them. \n\nI realise that the circumstances I'm in may be beyond my control however these patterns seems to follow me around and I'm getting bored of this. It makes my work life miserable.\n\nI'm debating whether to move companies and to not talk to anyone there unless I must, to avoid drama.\n\nI feel like I can be frank here- is anyone else tired of dealing with people's sensitivities? I understand at times emotions are justified and it is necessary to talk it out but at work it's too constant and draining. \n\nDoes anyone else here have a similar experience to this? / How do you deal with it? \n
8	Humans will human no matter what company you work for, so don't assume the grass is greener somewhere else - cause it generally isn't. \n\nWhat works for me is not giving a fuck. I go in there, do the best job that i can, be respectful, try to have a little fun whenever possible, and let everything else go cause other people's feelings are *theirs,* not mine.\n\nI also drink wine and vent. \n\n
3	Small offices tend to be hotbeds of drama and politics. \n\nIf the ENFP wants to go out on a date, that's a problem. If it was socially as part of the office, it's worth going out with everyone from time to time even if you'd much rather be at home working on a project. Maybe organise a trip to a bar for everyone so you can socialise. You could use the opportunity to totally friendzone ENFP guy if he was asking for a date in a way that you couldn't at work. \n\nAsk the timid ones to do stuff for you. Just little tasks like passing you things. Asserting dominance might make them feel more confident because they'll be certain of where they stand, even if it is lower than you and they resent it a bit.\n\nWith your dept manager, make sure you cover your ass, then do what he asks if at all possible. Have the emails and documentation ready.\n\nThe CEO's favourite, ask them for advice about things. You won't come across as a threat if you are showing that you consider them more experienced etc.
2	I am in a similar position as you. But my colleagues are not that bad, they don't bother me or anything, but I do sense some hostility from them (taking your credit, pointing out flaws, etc.). CEO likes me in terms of job performance. So I just go in I deliver, I produce. It's just a job, after I gained enough experience, I will take my business else where. Why do you even bother to care about these people. Do you job, and if they are in your way, get the CEO involved and advocate for you. It's not the worth the energy to care about their feeling. 
1	It's your first job and it's a small company. These things will influence the situation. \n\nFirst, I agree with the other comments to put the focus on your work first. Do well and start planning to go elsewhere. This is a personal preference but I have never worked for a small company except as a side-gig. I have worked for small, tight-knit groups within very large companies but I feel like I don't have much room to grow in a small company and if I want to switch areas/ groups horizontally because of interest/ clashing personalities, etc., there's less chance. Also, large companies -- FWIW -- have policies in place re things like dating and people are less likely to get into drama-filled situations (in my experience, that's not true for everyone).\n\n(Small companies I find tend to go to extremes. The side-gig I did: that group was a super-smart, kind, friendly, and well-paying group. I got the gig because my professor knew the group leader needed a temp worker and recommended me. A friend has worked for a company for decades where the owners consider her family  -- i.e. she wlll never be out of a job unless the whole business implodes.  On the other side, I've had friends work for small businesses where nepotism, embezzlement, drinking, affairs, etc. were issues.)\n\nSecondly, for the women in the group, treat them kindly. Go out of your way to compliment them on their clothes (I'm and you're female so we can do this easier than men) and if they do a task well. If there's a holiday/ special event, bring food.  Ask them about their families, dogs, children, hobbies.  I actually don't have a problem doing this as an INTJ as it's simple kindness to me but on a strategic level, people are less likely to be intimidated, passive-aggressive, etc. if you can connect with them. (My mother is someone who does this to the hilt: people have bent rules and gone beyond the call of duty for her. She taught me to buy people gifts for their pets/ children, even more important than gift directed at them.)\n\n I've been in a position before where a woman colleague had a chip on her shoulder.  I killed her with kindness and she mellowed out. She even complimented me at one point in front of her superiors. This doesn't work for everyone but it's worth a try.\n\nThird, since this is your first job, I'd wager that your radar of what is good/ bad/ neutral actions or attitudes still needs finetuning.  As mentioned, many workplaces will have people like this so you will have to figure out which things bother you the most and which you can let slide. There are tons of books out there about navigating one's first job and the politics/ people. Visit your library or local bookstore. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinally, if the same patterns keep popping up no matter where you go, then consider the problem might be you and not the people you are around. 
10	"Another flaw in the human character is that everybody wants to build and nobody wants to do maintenance."	I found this quote on a co-worker's desk.\nHe's an architect so I guess that's his context.\n\n\nBut for me it is everyday life.\n\nI love building systems for organisations. Clear processes that will generate the most effectivity. I make it really simple for people to follow, though sometimes it can't be avoided to have some complexity in the process to meet requirements.\nThe requirements are there to help the organisation grow in quality and quantity.\n\nBut once I finish the processes and pass it on to someone who has to do it, they just revert back to what they do before. It doesn't really meet the full requirements but it just helps the "now".\n\nNo one wants to do just a little bit more work now so they do not have to in the future.\n\nI absolutely love administrators who do their work well and maintain and develop processes to help the future. And absolutely hate administrators who doesn't care even just to maintain the process.\n\nThat's my rant for now. I'm pretty sure most of you can relate.
4	Data Architect here.\n\nIf you build a process and no one uses that process, your process is flawed. It may not be systematically flawed though. Humans will use processes that are of the path of least resistance - in knowing this it‚Äôs important that when creating a process others will use that they understand and get on board with why this process will help them.\n\nAny good system/architecture/process will have the insight built into that process to:\n\n* Show a user of the process the reasons as to why the process can help them\n\n* Be easy enough to maintain in the future. 
1	Let me tell a story, than shift the story, and then shift it again, till I return to your post.\n\nA poem by Percy Bysshe Shelley (a romantic poet but his wife is actually more famous than him, Mary Shelley author of Frankenstein.)\n\n>My name is Ozymandias, king of kings;\n\n>Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!'\n\n>Nothing beside remains. Round the decay\n\n>Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare\n\n>The lone and level sands stretch far away.\n\nOzymandias also known as Ramesses II received this poem^(The full poem is 3 times longer) by Percy Bysshe Shelley.  Shelly did this poem after a statue was shipped to Europe from the ruins of Ramesses personal temple.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozymandias\n\nThis personal temple is now in ruins^(more on this later.)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nExcept another temple Ramesses built / expanded upon still exists today and it is the largest religious Location of all time, larger than the Vatican City.  It is the various temple complex of Luxor Egypt on the other side of the Nile.\n\nThese temple(s) are famous for they are dedicated not to a specific god or king but instead dedicated to the royal concept of kingship and how the royal ka.  Royal Ka which is incarnated in one individual, then the person dies but the Royal Ka is incarnated again in an unbroken cycle.  Note with the cycle the individual need not be connected by bloodline to the previous pharoah.  In fact with this specific Pharoah Ozymandias / Ramesses the II he was born a rich person but not royalty, for the previous dynasty^(King Tut's Dyanast) had no living adult male heirs so a new dynasty was formed with the general picking Ramesses the 1st for this man already had an adult son Seti and a toddler grandson Ramesses the 2nd.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFurthermore besides these temples being in good repair, during Ozymandias rule there was an outer temple wall built to compliment the existing inner temple and on both of these walls they engraved wisdom literature for the priests to learn and for the other people to marvel at.  These walls contain over 100 wisdom proverbs dedicated to the concept of knowledge, what it is to know, and the transformation of all things.\n\nhttp://www.aldokkan.com/art/proverbs.htm\n\nOne of these proverbs is Know Thyself, and Through Yourself Know The Gods, which then through trade this proverb spread beyond Egypt and eventually the Oracle of Delphi starts quoting it and through the Oracle of Delphi other Greek Philosophers repeat a variant of it.  The most famous of which is Socrates who dedicates his lifetime to understanding what he knows and what he doesn't know and how Know Thyself becomes "I know nothing" [but I am wiser for it.]  Plato then says Socrates at his trial stated "The unexamined life is not worth living."\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kl0rqoRbzzU\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_thyself\n\nSo Ramaesses the 2nd and the wisdom of his times still exist today in some form.  Yet at the same time Ramesses personal temple turns is in ruins.  Ramases personal temple is known as the Ramesseum whose name means **House of millions of years of** Usermaatra-setepenra **that unites with Thebes-the-city in the domain of Amon.**  Usermaatra-setepenra  is the throne name / more elaborate name of Ramesses.\n\nSo the Temple of Luxor and its sister temple of Karnak survives ^(the Temple of Karnak was a collection to the Thebian Triad of Gods, Mother, Father, Son)has over a mile of Avenue of Sphinx connecting the two, the Temple of Luxor and the Temple of Karnak^(dedicated to the kings, and thus the god is man / king and the king is god.)  And these temples were in use for over a 1000 years and Alexander the Great when he became King of Egypt greatly expanded on the Temple of Luxor.\n\n* The irony here, humanity may exist for a million years like the Ramesseum states, but it will be to the credit of the other temple, not Ramasses's personal temple.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMy point here, you are correct, there is no glory, there is no way to become exalted by merely doing the maintenance.  But if you can expand an existing thing, you can become raised up and glorified / exalted.  You need not create something new.\n\nAnd when you do create something new often it is not anything new under the sun (an idiom from Ecclesiastes in the Bible, one of the 7 books of the bible known as the wisdom books, and they were in part inspired by the older wisdom tradition with things such as the Temple of Luxor, but also other things.)
11	INTJ boss. What is happening?	My boss is an INTJ (i'm an INFP)  I understand about how he likes us to work and how he likes me(and my pears) to behave in the workplace. \nThe thing is, he started to act a little different a couple weeks ago. \nBefore he'd cut off anything not related to work with "is this work related? No? So I don't care"  Now he doesn't, even when I start something and cut myself because it's not work related he asks me to continue.\nWe understand each other's humor, so it's easy talking with him. We talk about our weekend, our favorite colors, we texted almost an entire Saturday when I was drunk and sending him photos of a barbecue I was in, he told me not to change my hair because I looked pretty with that hair color, among other things. \n\n\nI just want to know the opinion of others INTJ about it, what is going on? 
30	From what you described he is most probably into you. As an INTJ, I would not talk with anyone about random thing or just chat, (especially not on a work day) with anyone if I didnt have an end goal.\n\nMaybe that's just me.
12	Either someone told him/her to be more ‚Äúhuman‚Äù and he pretends to care. Or he/she is into you. \nAlternatively, he might be lonely and crave social interaction and found out he enjoys spending time talking to you...  3 options that highly depends on the context and background of your situation
8	 Girl, he wants some of that, lol. 
3	Maybe he understood that he was acting like a total bitch and started to care more about his colleagues. INTJs likes to improve and become a better version everyday. \n\nOr maybe he's just into ya (drunk texts and he didn't care? A little too much for me).\n\nWho knows for sure?
3	He likes you. He may still professionally keep some distance but opened up to you. Kudos. He considers you worthy of his attention.
2	Maybe he‚Äôs socially developing/maturing? Anybody can become a better boss if they learn to balance professional and personal topics at work. \n\nAdding to what others are saying about him being interested in you - sounds plausible too. Take it with a grain of salt though. 
2	He gave you a compliment and is choosing to spend his precious alone time texting a person. He likes you. That being said he is your boss and has a lot to lose so is treading very carefully.
2	Maybe he realizes he shouldn't be such a dick to a person trying to be nice to him so he's giving you the respect you deserve.
2	Sounds like your boss has a crush on you. 
1	He‚Äôs flirting with you. Tread carefully, since he‚Äôs your boss. Whether you reciprocate these feelings or not, this could end very badly.
1	At first you were getting our generic canned response designed to save time in every interaction, but now over time he's starting to like you personally and the filter no longer applies.  Don't fuck it up by saying something stupid, but so far so good! 
3	Name a love song you hate to love!	I (INFP/F) am putting together a playlist for our wedding (INTJ/M) and I need SUGGESTIONS. We are not sappy (as you can imagine) but I would like some songs that suggest we MIGHT like each other more than most (LOL) We are both into 90s- early 2000s rock. What love song do you hate to love (or just really enjoy but wouldn't want anyone to know)? Maybe it could make the list!
3	One Week by Barenaked Ladies\n\nRandom note. For the longest time, I thought the very last line ‚ÄúBirchmount stadium, home of the Robbie‚Äù was actually ‚ÄúWhich STD are you gonna rob me?‚Äù  \n\nCan‚Äôt help it. Not just the part about Sailor Moon. The whole song just makes me think the wrong things. \n\nOh, the 90‚Äôs.
5	If you're going ones that people hate to love, I'd vote for Rick Astley's "Never gonna give you up". \n\nThere is no greater way to share your love than by rick-rolling the entire party. :P

27	Taking screw ups really critically?	Does anyone else take screw ups really critically and analytically. Like I have a minor screw up in my co-op placement ( in my opinion, I did why anyone else would have ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è). I take these things really personally because I hold fairly high standards for a lot of those I surround myself with and feel like I hold my own personal accountability and standards higher.  Anyone or am I all alone? I‚Äôm in a mood at work today just ruminating over this 
10	I used to constantly, especially when I felt dedicated to what I was doing, because it had to be perfect. Getting criticism meant I couldn‚Äôt even perform to the standards I held for myself, and if I wasn‚Äôt naturally good at something, I didn‚Äôt do it. Turns out that kind of self-criticism is pretty fuckin toxic, and I was losing out on experiences simply because I didn‚Äôt want to fail. Lately I‚Äôve been introducing myself to new things so I can at least try it out and make my decision after I make an effort. We can be unrelentingly stubborn and hard on ourselves so it‚Äôs important to create goals and recognize acceptable losses in order to  stomach ‚Äúfailure‚Äù a little easier.
9	Mistakes are opportunities to learn. Always. 
7	How do you stop making mistakes? By making good decisions. \n\nHow do you make good decisions? By learning from lots of mistakes.
6	When I was younger I definitely took my mistakes to heart. Now I own up to them and learn from them. \n\nIf there was no failure, would you know true success?
3	Hollyhock: ... Like, sometimes I have this tiny voice in the back of my head that goes, like, "Hey, everyone hates you! And they're not wrong to feel that way!" ... That voice, the one that tells you you're worthless and stupid and ugly?\n\nBoJack: Yeah?\n\nHollyhock: It goes away, right? It's just, like, a dumb teenage-girl thing, but then it goes away?\n\nand\n\nStefani: You know what your problem is? You hold everyone to an impossible standard, including yourself. It's super helpful for writing hot-take shakedowns, and clickbait take-downs, but totally toxic for your personal life and internalized sense of self-worth, girl.\n\nDiane: But shouldn't we be asking more of ourselves - and of the people in our lives?\n\nStefani: Of course. But we all fail, Diane. The world is unforgiving enough as it is. The least we could do is find ways to forgive each other and ourselves.\n\nDiane: Well, then maybe we should be more forgiving in our content, and maybe not publish so many take-downs?\n\nStefani: [looks at her with condescending amusement] Oh, Diane.
1	It it is my fault, I'll beat myself up about it. If it's not my fault, I'll learn from it and try to fix it, but won't be too invested if I am unable due to the context. If it is impacting me, I'll happily put some mitigation in place so the problem doesn't impact me and let those responsible wallow in the hell they've created and perpetuated. 
1	I feel the gravity of criticality that I view ‚Äúscrew-ups‚Äù with is equally as deep whether I‚Äôm mad at myself for screwing up or feeling cathartic about the phenomena itself for being out of my control. \n\nIf I do something stupid, however, prior to doing it, I also thought of 10 other options I could have taken instead of the one that led to the mistake, I‚Äôm hypercritical in making sure I know why I decided on it and I rub-in what it was that flawed my thinking almost to atone for it so I don‚Äôt trust that thinking again. This concept of ‚Äúrubbing-it-in‚Äù is my way of saying I make myself feel terrible about it. Probably not the healthiest way to handle it, but in the end, I wind up logically having worked through it. \n\nThe significance of how I react to something that was out of my control is opposite but equal in gravity. Most times if I can identify something was out of my control, I feel like I can almost let it go with the flip of a switch. I‚Äôm mad about the fact that it happened, sure. BUT I‚Äôm more comfortable in knowing it wasn‚Äôt something I could have foreseen or avoided. I‚Äôm not mad at myself, more-so relieved yet at the same time, the INTJ in me is in a state of existential crisis because I couldn‚Äôt plan and foresee something. \n\nTL;DR:\n\nProblems I cause are learning lessons, however, not without a good bit of hair-pulling. \n\nProblems I didn‚Äôt cause and have no control over offer me relief because there‚Äôs nothing I could have done to avoid it. Yet at the same time, realizing there‚Äôs things beyond my control sends me into a whirlwind of thought. \n\n\n\n
219	My last two brain cells trying to craft a nice message	
35	HAHA and of course when you have finally set upon the exact wording, circumstances, and medium by which you are going to administer the break up trauma, after a significant amount of deliberation, that you believe is direct enough to end it effectively but is also gentle enough with their feelings, your friends tell you that you‚Äôre a perfunctory ice cold bitch
15	Sugarcoating your messages feels like an unnecessary hassle all the time. I‚Äôm okay with adding a simple goodbye but many times it‚Äôs not that easy. People can get angry at any place for whatever reason. I do not get why people get angry at honesty. 
4	Capt Holt is probably my favourite INTJ on TV. 
3	This is so me. Ugh \n\nI can write up the most elaborate factual report but once I have to send it in an email, that's when I struggle because I have to consciously "sound nice" in writing. People have told me I sound rude just because i write/speak like a robot.
3	I thought I was in r/brooklynninenine
3	I relate to this. Honestly, INTPs are probably worse. At least in my case, trying to "sound nice" basically means over-analyzing my response, and even then, sometimes I still sound like a horrible bitch. What's even the point of trying if no matter how much effort you make, the end result is always the same? I must need actual classes on this shit.
1	Hahaha 
4	When do you like/dislike an ENFP?	I was just wondering in general, what traits of an ENFP do you like and which ones do you dislike.
11	ENFPs. When they‚Äôre good, they‚Äôre great. They‚Äôre your best friend and will do major favors at the drop of a hat. If you‚Äôre sad, they‚Äôre at your front door with snacks and tissues. If you‚Äôre dating then, they‚Äôre constantly noticing little details about you and soaking in how unique and special you are. \n\nWhen they turn, it‚Äôs a nightmare. Once you are no longer special to them, they‚Äôll lie and distance themselves. They‚Äôll say pretty words and let you open up and be vulnerable, while secretly having their own agenda. They‚Äôll gossip behind your back with cruel specific details that they know are particularly hurtful to you. \n\nFun and ego boosting, but not trustworthy. 
4	I don't know if this is a thing with enfps or not but maybe "not caring about money" and being unwilling to make a budget and stick to it?\n\nAlso they are among the types most likely to want children and we are the type least likely, yet we are supposed to be the ideal match.
2	When they‚Äôre passionate about a cause, they‚Äôll stand up for it with vigour. Usually pretty chill and accepting of people regardless of their social standing.\n\nWhen they let their FI go unchecked, they (in my expedience anyway) their reasoning for things can become nutty. It‚Äôs their feelings and nothing more matters. \n\nSource: enfp stepfather and I/enfpife long friend 
2	Unsure what traits count specifically as ENFP, but based off of the\n ones I know:\n\n\nLike: \n- ability to make you feel comfortable\n- ability to be a binding force between people or within a group\n- energetically attractive\n- releases light, warmth, and positive energy\n- interactions feel very human and genuine, reminding myself of my humanity\n- dismantle social anxieties merely by existing and also with an uncanny ability to handle social situations exceptionally \n- how in time they can be with others\n- sensitivity\n- accepting\n- encouraging, uplifting\n\n\nDislike:\n- not good at confrontation / avoids it\n- generally bad at communicating\n- bad at focusing on being here and now, handling here and now\n- locks up with any negativity\n- unstructured lifestyle which leaves room for forgetting and not accomplishing enough\n- doesn't know themselves very well, not sure of themselves
1	My husband is ENFP and we work really well together. Sometimes, I (INTJ) have to be careful with my tone around him, though, because he's super sensitive about how I ask him to do things. He needs a lot more of the warm and friendly social padding that people like, whereas I typically prefer to just get to the point. \n\nWhen we're working as a team, though, he respects my independence and can carry deep meaningful conversations. Unfortunately, I still get frustrated with him on occasion because logic doesn't come naturally to him, but that might be more of a male thing than an ENFP thing.
12	Salutations, fellow INTJs. I have a suggestion.	Hey, thanks for reading this far. I appreciate it.\n\nAs the title said, I have a suggestion. I've posted this idea on r/mbti, link here: [just click le me.](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/aye5ay/salutations_fellow_mbti_enthusiasts_intj_here/)
7	I want it because I like answering questions. 
6	Speaking as a non-INTJ, please do.
2	Go do it.\n\n/certified and confirmed INTJ
2	Looks like we gave plenty of support here. Go ahead an sebd out the announcement. Tell everyone to use the flairs
1	What would you like to ask
1	How do you get that INTJ tag\n(I am an INTJ) 
1	I think it'd be cool but like you said a lot here are non-INTJ's so you couldnt get reliable or true answers. 
-1	This is honestly common across all MBTI subreddit, it's just the "INTJ" *specifically* gets much more traffic than most of the other types, which makes sense.  \n  \nHowever, when I read this, I'm just left with the question.. *what's the purpose?*  \n  \nIs it to just ask random questions to a "verified INTJ" to get an answer? If so, making an announcement on *other* subreddits are not needed. I'm also not sure enough people would actually care for the time to do all this to really be worth it.  \n  \nMy RES extension keeps track of all the people I upvote, which is something I rarely do unless I feel they genuinely deserved it under the criteria I set for one to get upvoted.  \n  \nI do this because it's my way of *remembering* these users if I ever come across them again. I don't know how long you have been hanging around here but I've been here for a few years and I still notice some users from back then where I have a (+50) upvote count on them, *these* are the people which I "verified" myself to be "INTJ".  \n  \nI never take information at face value, but If it's someone I've encountered before and notice I've upvoted them a lot, then I'm far more likely to believe what they are saying over some newbie. I don't use this system as absolute, but it's usefull since my memory is shit.
6	That time I thought I had Aspergers but I was just INTJ	
4	Nah mate. Intj and asshole aren't synonymous. 
2	Definitely agree with the previous poster that INTJ does not equal asshole but the cartoon had me fucking dying lol. This mutherfucker parked across three handicapped spaces screaming about ass burgers lol.\n\n~*Edit*~ Looking at the YT comments I'll go ahead and say I'm sure having Asperger's doesn't necessarily equal asshole either. Carry on!
3	Whats your reaction when people tell you to smile ?	My usual go to when someone tells me to smile is ‚Äúgive me a reason to‚Äù\n\nI had a professor at my college once ask me \n‚ÄúDo you ever smile ?‚Äù\n\nMy response was ‚Äúwe all cant be as blessed as you‚Äù\n\n\nCurious what are your guys go to response ?
4	"$5"\n\nYes, I'm still working for a living.
4	I hate smiling. Even for pictures. Feels so damn fake and ridiculous. 
3	I make a faint smile or a dishonest chuckle / "breathing laugh" and then revert to indifferent look. They gave up persuading after a while.
2	‚ÄúNo.‚Äù
1	i usually just ignore it, i don‚Äôt want to say something depressing and make them feel bad. it‚Äôs a really rude comment anyway
1	:(  \n"Turn that frown upside down!"  \n):
1	Seething but silent judgment.
1	If it's for a picture that I have to take, I say "just this once" because the longer I fake it the worse it looks.\n\nIf it's for absolutely anything else, I either ask them why or deflect the request with a joke. "Do you ever smile?" might lead me to respond "No. Is there a problem?" or something asinine like "Of course I do! Just not on *insert day of the week*" depending on who was asking.
1	I just keep giving them the resting bitch face.
1	It's a provocation most of the times, best to ignore trolls like that. Depends on the person, sometimes I agree, sometimes just ignore it, sometimes it escalates into insults/fight if they persist.
1	Smile? What's that? This is not part of my vocabulary.
1	I smile. But with zero effort of it being realistic to the point that I‚Äôm essentially just widening my mouth to show teeth. \n
1	*sarcastic Cheshire Cat grin*
5	What's your favorite act of social deviance?	It doesn't necessarily have to be one you participate in. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe just an act you... find amusing looking on from the sidelines. 
11	When I was in college I briefly worked for a company that repaired electronics. It was in an extremely large warehouse, the company itself employed around 4,000 people in the building I was in.\n\nUnbeknownst to me, the repairs were done in an assembly line fashion. Dumbing down the process to just a few steps per person. My part of the process was new to the process, and was simply to try and turn on the electronic device and see if it had power. If it did, I‚Äôd put in on one conveyer belt, if it didn‚Äôt I‚Äôd put it on another.\n\nThis was a monotonous process, and by lunch on the first day I was done. Instead, needing a job, I walked around the other areas of the plant and acted like an auditor writing things down in a notebook and observing other areas of the process.\n\nDue to poor line management oversight, it took them nearly a month and a half to figure out I was just coming to work and walking around doing nothing. 
6	Not cooing over random peoples kids. 
3	Not sure if this applies to definition more than it does within my personal ecosystem but...\n\nWife and I got eloped and just made a Facebook post when it happened rather than have a big church wedding like everyone before me. \n  \nMy family was super happy about that.  ^/s  \n  \nBut it's okay, I never cared in the first place. lol.
3	Just trying to unrepentantly be myself, I would say. 
2	Not answering someone because I‚Äôm thinking, then they‚Äôll say something like ‚Äúok good talk‚Äù and because I find it amusing I‚Äôll just smile and never actually respond.
2	Before I go to work I have a morning ritual of vaping some herb after I pray and meditate. A mischevious smirk gets pasted on my face as I nail every assignment and presentation. Then they say: "You did awesome today you must be feeling good Ronin, you are always calm, cool and collected under pressure." They have no idea...I just give them a thumbs up and keep it moving.\n\nI find this is an effective way of giving everyone the bird while still ensuring my financial future.
11	Your inner circle	OK, INTJs.....\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\*How ***small*** is your group?.....those special few you invite to your realm......the crazy, misguided soul(s) that 'get you' or are intrigued by your quirks?? \n\n\*What types do you surround yourself with or find you naturally bond with? \n\n\*Do you push someone away to intentionally (unintentionally??) keep your group small if you find someone 'better'?
13	Definitely less than five and I‚Äôm not 100% about some of them
9	Less than 5 people.\n\nMy "inner circle friends" (the wider circle including around a dozen people I met from time to time for causal chat and drinks) are people whom I can talk about stuff which really is interesting to me, like Philosophy and wine. Also, these people are aware that I'm absolutely not interested in small talk and meaningless information.
5	5 people.  Edited down from from many more years ago.  The shortest friendship is 5 years.  The longest is 16.  They are all very different people, but have all (except one) grown to be very accomplished.  Some of them have become friends through me.  Some of them loathe each other and are just tolerant because of me.  The common thread is that they are all extremely smart people.\n\nI don't intentionally keep the numbers low.  I just am not taking new applications.  The last one basically pestered me until we became friends.  I'm glad he did, as it has become one of my most rewarding friendships.  \n\nThe range of their abilities is quite staggering.  If I could harness them all, we could probably take over the world.  However, it is very difficult to herd cats.
5	Lol less than 5 is clearly the answer. 
4	Definitely fewer than five. Including my husband. None of whom I've known fewer than 15 years. 
4	Inner circle - 3 people, one of them has an opposite view on the world, people and emotions, which brings about some interesting talks. Other two are somewhat similar, I share interests with one, and the other shares my level of dark humor.\n\nI push most other people away, I try not to be cold but sometimes I just can't help myself, as I enjoy it.\n\nWould I change my inner circle if I found someone "better", probably, but it'd be a process happening over a course of at least a year.
3	I have three close friends, all longstanding friendships (+20 years) from my chilhood. But I'm probably a bit weird, my closest friends are extraverted and sensors, I think they are ESFJ, ESTP and ESFP. I'm not sure they really get me, but we are friends all the same, it's not likely to change after such a long time. We have been accustomed to each other. I come here to find the likeminded people and discussions üòÑ
3	The group of strange individuals that somehow find it in themselves to like me consists of two people, a female ENFJ (65 percent match) and a male INFJ (75 percent match). However, I still don't *really* click with either of them. But they're the best I've got and they're both awesome friends. I don't know any other NTs, wish I could become friends with one. I'd even be happy with an ENTP! I'm *that* desperate!\n\nKidding. I love ENTPs.\n\nBut from my online experience, I click best with INTPs, ENTPs and other INTJs. It actually takes years to become my friend, because I want to make sure they'll be good friends and not fake and all that jazz.
2	Seven. Two I never see, one is my sister, and two I'm not as close to.
2	Interesting but expected that the numbers would be low. I have never been over 5, I'm at 2 now and they deal with me more than understand me. Was burned by #3 a few years ago and they understood me the best, but I am noticing that I generally don't surround myself with like minded people. They are mostly emotional, don't weigh me down with heavy topic types which explains why I tend to keep deep thoughts to myself. I don't think I've had an interesting discussion off-line in years. It also explains why I tend to take regular breaks from them and fall back into big projects. 
3	\- So small its only myself\n\n\- INTJ's because its only myself\n\n\- I keep everyone who's worthy \n\n&#x200B;
1	If we‚Äôre including sig oths, I‚Äôd say 3 at the moment.  I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a specific type I mesh with easily, just anyone willing and able to engage in dialogue that challenges our perspectives or gives any new insight.\n\nOver the years, the circle changes. I used to have two co-workers that I could discuss things with all day and not get bored not sure they‚Äôd be considered inner circle though.
1	Four. I guess five if you add my sister.\n\nPretty sure we are all crazy.\n\nOh and no, I don't push anyone out. Its a bit love you once, love you forever. \n\nThat being said, most people go away naturally within a few months because I don't have anything to say or the hit a redline; they don't make the cut. This is good. It stops me from showing my deep vulnerability to the majority of people I encounter. 
1	I don't have one. I have less than 5 people I see occasionally but each has their limits. Though I'd never call anyone part of any inner circle. That implies they have a high value to me. To which they really don't.\n\nMy family maybe, the ones I talk to daily, but these don't really count
1	As of right now I only have one person which is my dad. I have many associates but none of these people I trust, nor am I interested in getting closer to. If I see a kindred spirit in real life then I am always open to building a relationship but this rarely happens.
1	5...wow that really seems to be the magic number. I don't actively try to keep the number down, it's just rare for me to meet people whose company I genuinely enjoy, and I don't feel drained by.
1	3 people max\n\n\nI don‚Äôt have good communication skillz with one of them cuz she lives far away and we both are busy with college, but once we are in contact it‚Äôs the same old energy and closeness. And yeah I personally do push others away if I found my own circle, it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm choosing who am I really comfortable in devoting my energy to and it‚Äôs mutual.. it‚Äôs not about finding better individuals, but finding people that I don‚Äôt have to force myself to be forcefully nice around them or that I am allowed to be me without them getting hurt by my ‚Äúcold‚Äù and ‚Äúdistant‚Äù times. 
1	3, all people I've known for more than four years
1	0 people
1	3 close.  2 kinda close. 1 honorable mention.\n\nMostly INFx. 1 INTP.  Honorable mention is xNFJ.\n\nI don't push anyone away just because I found someone 'better', but more often than not, I pick and choose new friends myself on the very rare occasions I decide I'd like another friend.  All of my close friends are either people I chose to approach after some observation or friends I met through other friends.
0	Only my gf knew me deep. My inner circle friend had about 7 
6	Where would I find INTJ women?	Since INTJ females are the rarest of them all, do you have any tips on where to find them? Certain hobbies or interests they usually have? professions they usually take up?\n\nidk help a brother out
32	Work. Dark corners of book stores. 
23	We're in libraries, sitting by ourselves, reading, and wanting to be alone 
12	We will find you if we want you to notice us.
10	Hello, and thank you for your interest in INTJ women (we are very flattered). \n\nCheck, in no particular order, .your local hackerspace . woodworking/metalworking/machining collective .the engineering department in your office . the local branch of your coding clubs such as PyLadies .board game meetups .meetups for introverts or highly sensitive people .beer-making/coffee-roasting/wine-making class \n\nOk, that should get you started. As payment for this information, we request only one thing: tell us, why do you want to find an INTJ? 
7	Why do you want to?
5	You assume that we want to be found...\n\nI'm usually busy doing my own thing and only make myself available to the outside world when I want to be available. If you try to talk me up at work or any time my walls are up, I'm going to shut you out cold. You're more likely to be successful if I'm doing something recreational with other people. The best thing someone can do, is find themselves a part of my friend group, almost certainly starting off as a friend of a friend, and cultivate the friendship so I can get to know you first.\n\nOne of the things that will make me nope out faster than anything, is if I think someone just has a fetish for something about me (and the whole notion of "where can I find an INTJ woman" is one of those things that'll do it to me). Let things happen naturally.\n\nAlso, don't be flaky. I love my ENFP friends and the conversations we get into, but they aren't reliable. I totally appreciate that they have a large network of friends that they want to spend time with away from me, so I have time to relax between days where I'm picked up and bear hugged to death, but nothing annoys me more than when they can't make up their mind or change plans at the last minute because squirrel. Oh, and the fact that I even let them touch me, yeah, that's how much I still like them.
3	Looks like a lot of unicorns showed up 
3	Me personally, in a library and the bookstores. I am the one who always wears the earphones in the public. Sitting in the bus looking through the window and daydreaming. Reading a book while waiting somewhere. If I had an astronomical observatory closer, I would be there too. I don't mind to be where a lot of strangers are, if I don't have to interact with them. And I am self-employed and working from home. If you were going to approach me, I would recommend to start with just a short conversation, a few words maybe. And repeat later. Better several short conversations that wouldn't drain me than one longer.
3	Not socializing
3	Am I the only one who doesn‚Äôt go in libraries? \nI guess I stray a bit from the pack. You can find me at the gym, scuba diving all around the world, in a nightclub or at home playing video games. \nGood luck in your search and thank you for your interest in the finer things in life 
3	And just like that you found so many! xD\n\nWell you would find me in my university (i'm studying veterinary medicine) or in a coffee-shop working, normally I choose Starbucks only because I like the couches, not a big fan of the coffee... Other than that try the public transportation system, the streets, the supermarkets, anywhere because for every 100 girls that pass by chances are one is an INTJ.\n\nThis is not the first time people ask this in this subreddit! So guys, maybe start using a sign that says: "searching for an INTJ girl", i don't know how to help you out... Maybe I should start wearing a sign saying: "in search of another ENFP for my collection" xD
2	Commenting on this post. \n\nActually responding back is a good place to start.  \n
2	...internet? The two I've known I met through dating apps. They're human too, with their pros and cons if that's what you're in this for. Other than that, can't assume they'd be fundamentally different in their careers and interests from the men here, barring that they might wear dresses and makeup to work
1	library. in the corner reading something deep
1	Where would you search for a unicorn? Libraries I guess
1	I avoid social interaction as much as possible in public, but my bf and I (both INTJ) met on a dating site. We both laid out what exactly we desire in a SO, and what we cannot tolerate. I know it sounds cold and analytical, but it's not like we had laundry lists. Plus, that's kind of the INTJ M.O. We were both open about our political leanings (we are very much in the political minority in our area), our top values (humor and intelligence, for both of us), and our deal-breakers (drug use, smokers, hipsters, non-starters, etc). \n\nI like online dating because it allows you to weed out the hard "no"s without wasting too much time on them. Any stranger who is the type to strike up a conversation with me when not absolutely socially necessary is not someone I'd be interested in. I think that generally speaking, we aren't a people who are particularly open to small-talk and unnecessary social interaction.
1	I‚Äôm home, about to go to the library to do work, and go to the thrift store to get some sandals for vacation. I do most things by myself. If I want to socialize, I will seek it. If you see a girl happily alone who doesn‚Äôt look so lost, you may have found one. 
1	My best friend and I are INTJ women... but we don't like people and don't want to be found.
1	over there
0	Death Stare	I went to the dispensary to buy some legal marijuana.\n\nThe girl behind the counter said Hi when I walked in but when I walked up to the counter, she started to look at her phone instead of trying to help me.  \n\nI wasn't in the mood so I started to give her my death stare and I said "Can you help me?"  Btw, I think my death stare is pretty scary because it has stopped two people dead in their tracks when I was about to get into it with them. \n\nAnyways, she lifted her head to look at me and I saw her get really scared and her demeanor and body language totally changed when she saw me looking into her eyes with my death stare.  She didn't take her attention off me the whole time after that.  She even Dabbed me out before I left.  There was already an attendant at the Dab bar and when I went to get my Dab, that girl told the attendant who was already there that she would take care of my Dab and after I was done and leaving, she said "Have a good day" but sort of in a meek way.  \n\nFuck that girl. 
1	Pics of death stare for reference
1	Lol\n\nI shouldn't be laughing, this happens to me too many time ._.
1	Well, actually, she was impolite, so your stare is justified.\n\nWhat am I saying\n\nDeath stares are always justified.
1	I never realized I was giving death stares to people until I was like 25
5	Is INTJ/MBTI a meaningful/valid system?	Does anyone have any scientific articles proving or disproving the validity of the MBTI personality tests? 
3	Well.... that's one of the issues with MBTI, you see. There are a lot of folks on each side who have tried to do one or the other, but no one has ever actually been completely successful in either direction. I believe that, overall, the bulk of the evidence is in favor of it being valid. It certainly has strong internal consistency and is valid in terms of measuring what it purports to measure. The better question is: is the Myers-Briggs interpretation of Jungian personality correct, and, for that matter, is the Jungian model even a good one?
3	Newtonian physics was incorrect about gravity, but it got us to the moon. \n\nMBTI is a useful model. I think it is particularly useful for those classified as INTJs, whose minds may work slightly differently than most. 
1	If you feel so inclined...  Follow the links at the end.  The rabbit hole deepens (and broadens). \nhttps://www.typologycentral.com/wiki/index.php/Reckful_On_Type_Dynamics
1	Not really, in fact most articles are about its inaccuracies and lack of reliability. There was some study where people took the test 2 months after the first one and a big portion of the subjects got another personality. \n\nI always have found this sub kind of an oxymoron since our personalities are supposedly very rigid and logical; yet, people here believe in an unproven and basically obsolete test. I like to stick around sometimes because for one reason or another I can relate to many posts in here; this could all be down to just being a person, though.
1	MBTI is just one interpretation of *Type Theory* which Carl Jungus proposed in the early 20th century (Freud disagreed with him but is generally considered to be wrong by doing so) and is widely accepted as the gold standard of psychometrics within a large segment of the psychology community.
1	It goes the other way around: \n\nPeople read MBTI stuff while still young, then try to behave according to the description, and in the end MBTI becomes valid.
0	Is it truly even possible to prove at this point?\n\nWhat can be seen is the many patterns in nature so why not humans? It doesn't mean we aren't still individuals with unique guiding experiences. \n\nI can say, of the 16, I am INTJ through and through so just like being an Aquarius there are descriptions that accurately place me in certain 'categories', but they won't be 100%. 
2	I can't be the only one who does this	Context: I am a healthy policy student getting ready to graduate with my MPH and enter the world of policy analysis. \n\nWhen I need to focus, I put my noise canceling headphones on and listen to classical music and ignore the world. I've been told that my facial expression then becomes and I quote "intense, maybe kinda angry, maybe really focused, maybe you're yelling at someone in your head and while you type, please don't kill anyone". My mom and I have butt heads on this area my whole life; she never understood why I couldn't just tone down the intensity. I then get incredibly irritated when I see people I know and I actively choose not to engage in conversation with them and then they come over and try to talk to me and then it's just small talk that I really have no desire for. To all the INTJs here, provide me evidence that I am not the only one that does this and how to explain this to my mother, who of course cares for me dearly, but really needs to stop acting as if I'm some anti-social scheming villain planning to become a dictator (Note: I am not; I want to do  policy analysis and evaluation). 
1	Not the only one for sure.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/axmokv/your\_blank\_stare/](https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/axmokv/your_blank_stare/)
1	Similar topics come up often, actually, and I always mention how on more than one occasion I've been told I have a "resting bitch face" (I'm a guy)  \n  \nI do very similar things as you've described, I too love to throw on my headphones and play instrumental music when I know I want to focus on something. This hyper focus, for me atleast, will *literally* cause me to ignore the present and what's going on around me. I lose my self-awareness and basically stop *expressing* things because everything is now going on and being processed strictly in my mind and through inner dialogue.  \n  \nHowever, it's always funny to hear because, obviously, this is something I don't notice when it's actually going on but it's clearly something that others have noticed on more than one occasion.
1	When I need to focus, I want absolute peace and quiet. I find music to be way too distracting and stimulating in all of the wrong ways. I also find busy environments to be way too stimulating and I'll naturally shut everything out that I don't want to focus on. \n\nYesterday, I was having lunch with a friend at a restaurant and she was listening in at the conversations going on around us. Meanwhile, there were too many conversations and the music was too loud (why, why do we need loud music inside of restaurants? My friend said it was just barely audible though), so I focused on eating my food and our conversation, and, otherwise, had the blank stare of intensity on my face as I became oblivious to the environment around me.
1	That's almost me, only I use just normal headphones and my type of classical music has to be heavy on the violin.
13	Does anyone else have trouble with being to blunt?	I very strategically word my opinions and replies to have more emotional intelligence for people who can't handle bluntness. \nThat being said I am not able to do this as easily when in compromised states, ie. in pain, drunk, overly tired. \nI find that people that get to know me and only appreciate my blunt honesty when it benefits them and their feelings. \n\nHowever this also brings the problem that people will often ask me to be blunt with them and then dislike my answer and be upset with me. \n\nI'm in an arguement with one of my close friends because of this, shes an INFJ. It's got me down and I'm not sure if I can repair or want to repair the problem because ultimately if she really did understand me as a friend she would know my intent. 
8	I‚Äôm at the point that I don‚Äôt care if people get their feelings hurt by my bluntness. If they didn‚Äôt want my honest opinion, they shouldn‚Äôt have asked. 
6	Classic. It is beneficial to get used to it. Also, it helps, if you sometimes show extra empathy at some of their problems, so a target person realizes that you do have a warm (albeit robotic) heart.
5	No.
4	I think it‚Äôs about how much you value the person. If you value them you will be more restrained as the cost of losing them outweighs the benefit of being correct. Obviously INTJs have a higher threshold in this department but maybe you guys are at a breaking point. Let it work itself out.
3	I had trouble with being too blunt, afterall i didnt want to hurt people ego, as that can be very dangerous they may hide contempt
3	I got in trouble so much at my last job because of this. Customer service was not a good fit. Some people just didn't like my dry straight forward humor, oh well. 
2	Too. Yes.
2	Yep and it puzzles the heck out of me, because the truth is immutable. To me, complete honesty shows trust and reliability. It baffled me that things I assumed were blindingly obvious to everyone just... weren't! We live in a world that doesn't understand us, so we need to learn their language, and I wanted to learn how to communicate better. It took two episodes of learning to inspire my brain to figure this out.\n\nThe first lesson was from a therapist who told me "your insights are spot on and your heart is in the right place, but you need to work on your delivery." It was a huge shock, but also a hugely valuable piece of advice. \n\nThe second lesson was when I learned that not only do I have this outlier personality but that it is not common among women. OK - challenge accepted!\n\nI observed how people I admire and respect get their point across and then implemented some of what I learned.  In my experience INTJs don't fake very well but learning to be authentically communicate in a way that does not conflict with our "Prime Directives" is quite a complex undertaking. I can't lie or be hypocritical and am not always good at it, but over time it becomes easier and more natural and actually quite pleasant.\n\nNot in any way advocating the "fake it til you make it" trope because it's not about faking, it is about learning how to effectively communicate with those we care about. Showing kindness is as important as feeling it.
2	The bluntness of an INTJ is shocking at first.\n\nLike a clap of thunder.\n\nMost people recoil at it and run into their caves, afraid or angry.\n\nI walk out into the rain and look up and ask, "Why?"\n\nWhy were they so blunt? What were their intentions? \n\nAs long as they are not insulting (cursing someone out, name calling, etc) then an INTJs intentions are pure to me.\n\nThrough their bluntness they are sharing the fire of Prometheus at a time when my fire may have gotten low or has run out. Most people incorrectly grab at the flames and get burned emotionally. They think the INTJ is trying to hurt them.\n\nI grab the stick and rekindle my thoughts and say, "Thank you, for helping me."\n\nIt's sad to me in a way, the miscommunication between INTJs and their fellow human beings.
1	All the time. 
1	Yes, in the past. I worked on becoming more empathetic while still giving my honest answer.
1	My family is already immune to my bluntness by now, but my closest friend is quite sensitive to such cold and blunt comments like the one I say. I usually sound rude sometimes because it‚Äôs that emotionless. So I end up keeping it all in and try to be empathetic when it comes to feedbacks or something. 
3	How do you deal with failure?	This past two weeks has been incredibly hard for me. I‚Äôve been faced with failure after failure. I try to push it to the side and keep going but it seems like no matter what I do I won‚Äôt be able to achieve my dreams. \n\nI‚Äôm an undergraduate engineering student in my junior year and I‚Äôve been applying left and right for internships. I did poorly on an interview that I had because all the research I did said there wouldn‚Äôt be technical questions. Guess what? There was. I‚Äôve applied easily for over 500 different internship positions and all I hear is rejections. I only got an interview because of a friend. \n\nWhen I did poorly with the interview it killed me because I want an internship over the summer more than anything. I want to be able to keep learning and apply concepts I learned in class to the real world. \n\nThis is just one of a few failures I‚Äôve faced in the past two weeks and I just can‚Äôt get myself to keep going anymore. Any advise/help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks. 
3	Try being a screenwriter. Rejection is the job. \n\n\nThe trick is to let rejection, in any aspects of life,  deaden your soul and fuel your contempt for those who aren‚Äôt as great as you know yourself to be, then push through the feelings and keep on doing what you do. Actions make progress; you can‚Äôt unlock the combination if you aren‚Äôt spinning the tumblers. Eventually the lock opens. 
2	Why do YOU feel you are being rejected......SPECIFICALLY. 500 internships and only one interview...because of a friend??\n\nWas your research poorly done? Junior year engineering and you didn't expect technical questions??\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry, this might come across as harsh, but if you want ideas and not sympathy or excuses then I'd like to hear your honest thoughts.\n\n&#x200B;
2	> insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result\n\nAre you just churning out resume and cover letters without doing anything different?  Are you tailoring both to the individual company?  Have you gotten friends and/or school career center to critique your application?  Are your skills an appropriate match to the position, or are you aiming unrealistically high?  It seems you know you didn't do well on the interview, you have to practice that more.  If you feel you can't get an internship at this point, look for volunteer opportunities.  There are always other options.\n\nReal life is not about getting straight As, employers want to see you doing things with the knowledge.  It's not about working hard, but working smart.  Look up Cal Newport.\n\nLook at the situation objectively, figure out how to solve the problem, attack the solutions, and keep pushing forward.
1	What kind of engineering are you doing? I just finished a bs in civil and knew a lot of mech civil and enviros and noone I knew of had to do technical questions for any of their internships. Also are you exaggerating about the number of internships bc 500 is a lot, maybe you should focus your efforts on ones that better fit your strengths or something
0	Is there some other area in your life where you can do something productive easily and feel successful? Like cook a good meal, give your SO a great massage, help a friend with something etc... I just got a new job and I feel like I‚Äôm constantly failing at basic tasks. I prevail because eventually I will learn how to do it right but it still makes me feel like crap. So I try to do other things that make me feel like I‚Äôve accomplished something, like art or PVP video games to get that ‚Äúepic win‚Äù high.
1	ENFP asking INTJ's for advice about how I can become more organised and focused without it feeling like a chore?	So I sometimes struggle with getting round to doing important stuff, procrastination is very much my middle name üòë
3	Pick one thing and start small. Work up to better efficiency.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt may sound child-like in its implementation, but save a reward for after the 'chore'. Focus on that and just work through it. Distract from the chore and it becomes a blip. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEver drive down the road deep in thought and arrive at your destination 'in no time'?
2	I usually sprinkle in 'scheduled' distraction times while im working. It helps for me to run down a rabbit hole every 30 min while at work. Then im right back to whatever it is i was doing
1	Always ask yourself, is this process more complicated than it needs to be. Also throw things away that aren't useful. The more junk you have the harder it is to keep it organized.
3	Does anyone else feel as though the excessive toxicity of certain areas of the internet gives people an idea of what INTJs and other HSPs go through?	\nJust being around large physically present crowds makes me feel as though I am a sponge soaking up all their silent aggression and negativity.  And in these internet areas where people openly vent their toxicity under the supposed safety of anonymity I feel like other types or non-HSPs might start to understand what we‚Äôre feeling. 
2	Silver bullet to procrastination?	I need your help, I've been doing some research and came across the idea that fear of punishment overcomes fear of not succeeding.\n\nThis idea is horrible in a way that punishment can come in a variety of ways even physically. \n\nTo give an example, John and Matt are best friends, John and Matt create a contract in which they will achieve their goals (realistic goals such as passing a test, stop smoking, etc) and failing means the other person will carry out a punishment against the other that can hurt the person in ways such as physically, mentally, etc.\n\nEssentially I'll work hard and not laze around to achieve something if failing to do so ensues a harsh punishment.
2	A lot of the writing nowadays recognizes that inaction will often lead to consequences that are ar least semi far away and nebulous at best. The best information is to either organically or artificially link inaction to some kind of immediate and recognizable consequences. \n\nIf you really want info The Power of Habit is a great book that goes into a lot of depth. Atomic Habits is not a bad place to go either. 
1	Basically I have a minor procrastination problem that I would like to eliminate, if I can contract myself to carry out a punishment for failing then I will achieve my goals.
4	We are human....	Do you prefer intellectual or 'dumb', slapstick kind of humor?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI personally find no entertainment value in the 'Dumb and Dumber' kinds of movies and stand-up but love the ones that slyly attempt to slip the humor by you to see if you catch it. I would assume most INTJs would as well, but then again some might simply want to 'shut it down' and not have to think. Hence the question.......... 
6	I prefer ironic, hyperbolic or paradoxical humor. The kind of absurd humor you find in stuff like Adventure Time.\n\nI have a great deal of disdain for ‚Äúcomedy‚Äù that‚Äôs targeted at someone‚Äôs disabilities, race, sex, etc. like you‚Äôd find strewn throughout today‚Äôs stand-up comedy.
3	I enjoy lo-brow physical slapstick humor (think Charlie Chaplin). I enjoy a wide variety of humor. I am often the only one laughing at a movie theatre when puns are said.  \n\nI DON‚ÄôT enjoy jokes that are cruel or based on a person‚Äôs low IQ. 
1	I think the closest I get to liking really stupid humor is Beavis and Butthead, but they're really more satire than a total mental check-out.
11	How does caffeine affect you?	For some reason my body is really sensitive to caffeine, among other things. It can range anywhere from making me jittery, more anxious if i'm already and super talkative. Luckily i've found the right amount of coffee I can drink that gives me energy but doesn't affect me too much otherwise. I usually always order the same couple of drinks, but today I deviated. I was extra tired, working on a deadline and I had a reward for a free drink. I thought I'd get a medium size of this new latte that I just started drinking recently-- big mistake.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nToday I had the side effect where coffee makes me ridiculously talkative. I saw someone I know in the library and we sat together to do work. I feel like I talked this person's ear off, what an embarrassing feeling! I definitely shared some personal things that I wish I hadn't. I didn't say anything crazy, but it's just not someone I fully trust and I said a lot more than non-caffeinated me probably would have. \n\nThe humor isn't lost on me that if I took out caffeine and coffee and replaced it with alcohol, this post would still make sense. \n\nAny stories on how caffeine affects you? 
6	Was a long time coffee drinker, loved the home brew in a pot (called d≈æezva in my country, pronounced "jazzva" in English). The problem was that I developed a huge post-coffee crash sindrome, so I had to have more coffee to get over it. So I developed a habit, continuing daily cycle of coffee. Last year I decided to quit, endured two weeks of migraine headaches and body screaming for caffeine addiction. After that I never had another and my energy levels are normal. But nowadays I am more prone to daily naps when feeling drained.
2	I feel energetic for a couple of hours but then feel dead tired after that.
2	well it has a strange effect on me too. it makes me sing  and read 2X faster than my normal speed.
2	not much, though i think it's likely my body has built up a tolerance. i literally use black coffee as my bedtime drink. someone told me that chemically it's not dissimilar to marijuana but i never researched for BS (because frankly i don't care)  
2	I really enjoy caffeinated tea. It's like the perfect amount of caffeine without making me jittery and my stomach upset. Coffee is just way too much for me and actually makes me more tired. 
2	all caffeine give me insomnia. i can take it very early in the morning so that it is not that bad at night.\n\nCofee is tasty, but gives me ulcers and the caffeine is not strong enough i get sleepy midday and i cant sleep at night.\n\nenergy drinks give me insomnia for a week and make me grumpy and bad mannered.\n\nthere is an energy pill that i use for fitness called oxicut that gives me energy and keeps me awake the whole day but I have to take half the dosage and makes me jittery if I dont work out.
2	Absolutely no effect on me. I can drink it at midnight and go right to sleep and I would sleep very well.
1	Doesn‚Äôt make me talkative but my body over-processes it in a different way - it makes me sweat. I had to quit to not have to worry about pit stains at work ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1	Makes me jittery and even more tired, has no effect on me.. 
1	Like you described: caffeine has led to me countless times divulging parts of personal life to my coworkers and friends that I wouldn't have if I could slow myself down enough when on caffeine. I used to drink a large light roast from a coffee chain each morning on an empty stomach and come 10-11am I was almost dissociated from my body , easily irritated, complaining loudly about my boss/coworkers, frenetically touching my hair or tapping my foot, etc. Yet it took me 5 years to notice how much of a toll it was having.
1	Not only does it make me more talkative, it makes me talk waaaayy to fast. My coworkers told me that their brains have hard time keeping up when I drink coffee, specifically espresso.\n\nIt also gives me insomnia and causes my stress/cortisol levels to peak and so breathing gets a bit hard. I tend to verge on a panic attack when ever I drink more than a cup. 
1	I wakes me up a lot. My body needs it twice a day.
1	I stopped consuming caffeine 25+ years ago when I started to have chest contractions and difficulty breathing.  I also have many TBIs (traumatic brain injuries) and that probably had something to do with it as well.
1	If it makes me jittery or "wired" I'm definitely in overdose territory. The primary effect at normal usage levels is increased focus.
1	Insomnia, jitters, anxiety, mood swings, fatigue. It's a stimulant, what do you expect. I quit cold turkey and feel a hundred times better every day. It's tragic that nearly everyone is addicted to the stuff.
179	Does anyone else have issues with people understanding your statements/suggestions?	I feel like people quite often miss the points I make in meetings/group think tanks, or discount them out of hand.\n\nFor example I will be in a meeting discussing a problem with a group of people. I will immediately say "We should do X, because of a, b, c", only for the room to look at me like my heads been screwed on wrong. Then after 15 minutes of circular discussion someone makes the same suggestion/solution and it's instantly accepted.... "Wha? You just shot that down a second ago now it's a great idea?"\n\nAlso I find once they dismiss/ignore my suggestion I switch off and stop adding positives and only pipe up when people miss the glaring gaps in suggestions/solutions.
86	Yes. We see the 'big picture' and most aren't that far ahead yet. They need more time to absorb the data/new idea which our subconscious has been processing the whole time. I've learned to try and hold back some of the info and let people ask questions to better gauge if they see the potential. It's not that others aren't intelligent enough to 'get it', but that we tend to throw everything at them at once. Remember we process information in a unique way.   
35	Yes. I see it as a need to improve my communications skills.\n\n"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough" Albert Einstein.\n\nIn other words, regardless of who my audience is it is incumbent on me to explain it in a manner they understand.\n
12	Yes. It's helpful to map out how you came to the conclusion you did and connect the dots for people, because not everyone is going to automatically follow the connections your brain made to get there. I typically realize this after I've said a thing and confused people; it's something that I'm working on. 
7	People want you to be a linear word-thinker. Intuition is not linear, and contradicts itself when put into language too definitively. 
7	Yes.  The hack here is just like convincing someone of something they are opposed to.  You let them work it out themselves.  Its easier said than done, but you have to keep suggesting things, nudging closer and closer to the final solution until they make the final leap and think they thought of it themselves.
3	I think the problem is most people have extreme difficulty seeing things beyond just whats immediately there. Many people aren't able to break down or are even willing to admit that a lot of things are irrelevant, and thus aren't able to focus on the core issues of a problem. They like to just pretend that "things are too complicated" so it saves them the effort of having to break things down to their root problems.  \n\n\nThere is a reason the majority of pieces on a chessboard are pawns.
4	Also have the problem with reverse. Seems like when I‚Äôm digesting what other people are saying a lot of them typically don‚Äôt follow a logical way of communicating and there also tends to be a lot of fluff and rambling. Something that could have been summarized in 30 seconds could extend to 3 minutes 
3	I normally find that it helps to make people understand by drawing or writing it out on a whiteboard to them to drill it into their brains. But normally they don‚Äôt listen and I just sit back to see things fail when I have clearly warned them earlier on. 
3	Get used to being ahead of the group. What you can work on, is asking the questions "what about a?", "what about b?", "what about c?" and then suggesting x. (Unless you are in a room of NT's then you can just short cut all of that.)
3	A lot of good comments here. \n\nI suspect you are ahead of the group because you see the holistic view and have already taken everyone else‚Äôs viewpoint into account. \nThe others in the group are focused on their own agendas, and haven‚Äôt considered all the objections until they are verbalized in the group setting. \nIn a group setting, you got your message out. Some people probably realized you provided the solution. Don‚Äôt gloat or be resentful (unless some individual starts taking credit for the idea). \nIn other settings, you may need to approach leadership on your own and get his/her buy-in. 
3	Are you me??!?? This is exactly how I feel all the time. People need to be taken step by step and are not able to think as fast as we can to come to the same conclusion. It‚Äôs exhausting 
3	Yes!\n\nMe: *listens to person's story and they ask for my advice* "Well it sounds like you have a hole in your tire. You might want to get it to a shop or change it before it blows. You don't want to be in a wreck."\n\nPerson: "I don't understand."\n\nMe: "Your tire is going flat and you need to change it least you have a wreck due to your tire blowing out."\n\nPerson: "Why would my tire blow out?"\n\nMe: "Because you said it has a hole in it and your tire pressure warning went off in your car. That means it's going to go flat or blow at some point. That could cause you to wreck your car."\n\nPerson: "So you think I should have my tire changed?"\n\nMe: "Yes."\n\nPerson: "I still don't get it."\n\n*Another person comes up and asks what we're talking about and person 1 fills them in on the story*\n\nPerson 2: "OMG you should change your tire! That could cause you to wreck if you don't fix it!"\n\nPerson 1: "Oh okay! I won't take it to a shop because that's too expensive. My dad taught me to change tires when I was younger so I'll do it and save some money. I'll contact my friend at Advance Auto and have him order me a new tire. Thanks, Person 2! üòÑ"\n\nPerson 2: " No problem! üòÑ"\n\nMe: " **O_O....** "
3	all the time. and then i have to repeat myself and then i am "condescending."
2	[deleted]
2	In my experience, people don't like other people's ideas, whatever they are. If you present an elegant solution to what looks like a complicated problem, without 'showing your working,' they will dismiss it out of hand. This happens to me a lot, so I've got used to it.
2	It's really irritating I know
2	This post resonates with me, but especially the last paragraph 
2	**I swear it happens several times per day**, and often I can prove I was right. But if I do, everyone hates me even more.\n\n**I'd prefer thousands times if i was wrong, but at least not hated: I have no interest in being right.** ü§∑
2	 Same, only with me it seems like it takes weeks or months for others to understand and/or arrive at the same conclusion.I just want to record every meeting so I can go back and show them that their fantastic "new" idea is exactly what I told them we needed to do six weeks ago. I can't figure out if it's just that they don't want to accept my ideas or if they just don't understand them the way I'm presenting them.
2	As an intj myself I've learned that people skills go a longer way than IQ. My whole life people have looked at me funny for the way I say things but as I read books like how to win friends by Carnegie, it happens far less often.
3	Ya i gave tgat problem too. Its all about pexking order and dominance. Also most people are sensors so they cant connect the dots
1	All the time. 
1	This happened to me recently, a trivial conversation with my roommate. I thought I explained myself clearly: stated what I wanted and why. And they still missed it! 
1	As an INTP i have to be super clear with my explanations for people to understand me
1	Yeppers.  \n\nThis then turns into me being self-conscious about how I explain my ideas and that turns into me feeling the need to CONTEXT everything‚Äîwhen in reality I feel I have to translate my ideas to ones that are ‚Äúuniversally understandable‚Äù for anyone I‚Äôm talking to (to try and not sound so unintentionally narcissistic).\n\n I found that it really hit me close to home when my papers in school began to have a MAX word count instead of a minimum word count where my Professors only grade your paper based on what‚Äôs written within the max word count‚Äîmy brain would go into panic mode and I instantly lose my articulation skills because I‚Äôm limited in the total explanation I can give. And now I have to reduce the topic for an already novice audience while meeting prompts without being able to provide gap-bridging context. \n\nP.s. \n\nI also struggle to explain my ideas well to my s/o (ENFP) and most times she may go ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really follow you but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll make sense.‚Äù This is extremely frustrating for me because I interpret this as her dismissing my idea‚Äîbut in reality, she‚Äôs acknowledging that I have difficulty clearly explaining my thinking in conversation and knows that she will understand in real time through us manifesting that idea. \n\nThis is my ultimate challenge and Kryptonite: \n\nLetting go of a situation where someone says that they objectively don‚Äôt understand my idea, however, they still trust that they will understand through action. I feel the INTJ side of myself can‚Äôt fathom what it‚Äôs like to trust something before understanding every aspect of its function first, and I feel like I have to try to explain as many ways as I can which is marginally successful. \n\n
1	It's not my problem if they don't understand meh! lolz :)
1	I think the problem could be down to influencing power. Not that your ideas are not smart, but smart doesnt always mean convincing. People are subjective i.e. when emotions get mixed into decisions. So for people, convincing means smart depending on WHO it comes from e.g. if I respect your opinion, I will see you as more convincing. You have to learn how to earn that respect, or influence. Google ideosyncrasy credits as a start. \n\nI posted a similar question on this subreddit 8 days ago - "how to gain more influence power at work" as I've been having the same problem. I would suggest you take the time to check the answers out in my bio as they are quite insightful.\n\nEdit: not to say other answers here are not valid - they are. But this is another way to look at it. 
1	If I posted my conversations in r/whooooosh about 80% of them would be there. 
1	I'm in charge of a committee for my student government and yesterday one of the members of my committee spent ten minutes trying to figure out why I thought that we should be doing something that I decided ages ago was not something that we should be worrying about. It seemed so obvious to me that it wasn't our job but honestly it was my bad for not explicitly stating that part of my thought process.
1	Yep, reminds me of one of my [favorite commercials](https://youtu.be/zNCrMEOqHpc)
1	Oh my god YESSSS!!! I think that I think in a non-linear way and that seems to be really incompatible with the way many others do. \nWhen I deliberately try to simplify what I am trying to say that helps a lot. It‚Äôs not dumbing it down, but instead distilling it to the key point I‚Äôm trying to make, instead of, you know, trying to represent something in it‚Äôs full blazing complexity.
1	I'm an INTP and clicked thinking this would be /r/INTP like "I reworded this email six times and I'm not even sure anyone read it!" This is so foreign to me as an INTP. I never know what we ought to do, because there are so many ways I could be wrong, or things I haven't had time to think of yet. Only when I'm making decisions for myself do I know exactly what to do.
1	Yes, all the time. In my head I can make a detailed plan in a matter of seconds and then go on to explain it, but normally it seems whoever im talking to just doesnt listen to me and goes on to discuss it with someone else. Normally that will take at least 5-10 minutes for them to discuss options and come up with the same plan i had in the first place.
1	I'm a lot older now so I slow down and try to take them on the journey with me to the obvious conclusion. My God it is a tedious task that is our burden as born visionaries. I have a current task right now to rebuild something that was destroyed because no one listened to my warnings. I have enacted it 3 months ago and am completing my first phase and successfully entering into my second phase. I have had to drag everyone with me to pain this picture of what we are trying to build, no one sees it except another intuitive on my side.  \n\n\n 
1	Yes.  But whatever. Sigh.
1	Yes, this happens to me a lot. A lot of times, I will make the suggestion in a meeting and then a couple weeks later in another meeting, everybody agrees that it is a great idea...do I get credit? Nope.
1	Don't contribute in the meeting. Note your thoughts. If asked your thoughts, tell them you're still processing. After the meeting, organize your thoughts into a workable plan then email your organized thoughts and translation into a plan to your manager and CC a few others on the same email to establish a paper trail.\n\nFor some reason, I can speak all I want and people never get what I'm saying. Then I turn around and WORD FOR WORD put what I'm saying on paper, people read it and its understood. WHY??? I have no freaking idea but its super frustrating. Sometimes it feels like no one around me understands English.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVz\_l81qtsA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVz_l81qtsA)
8	Autistic Burnout: The Cost of Masking and Passing	
6	Have you ever get bored of your partner?	Don't get me wrong, I love my partner, but sometimes it feels like too much affection overwhelm me and it makes me feel less... passionate about him, as if I was tired of him. My thoughts towards him gets too rational and for a moment I forget about the love and why I want him in my life and I just want to have many hours alone. He's an INFJ and I think he's kinda immature about his feelings. Sometimes when I'm like that and I want some space he starts to ask if he did something wrong or treat me with indifference since I'm not giving him enough affection (which I personally think is cute sometimes, but when I'm tired I just think "f*ck off"). \n\nSo is it something wrong with me (or us)? Or is it a traits of my personality? I'd really like to know how things with my fellow INTJs. 
2	I mean.. as a feeler I can understand that he‚Äôs just expressing how deeply he feels about you. \n\nFrom my perspective it‚Äôs better than someone who won‚Äôt express their fondness of you at all. But of course you don‚Äôt want it to be so overwhelming that you feel smothered all the time or pressured to exhibit that same level of emotional expression. \n\nIt would be a bit hard to tell him to decrease the emotional affection without hurting him. But what I‚Äôd say is to dig deep into your thoughts and ask yourself why he expresses himself like that and then why it makes you feel so uncomfortable/overwhelmed. Because sometimes people over-express because they‚Äôre needing that same expression back for themselves to feel secure. So they give to get. \n\nMaybe try being equally expressive and see if it makes him feel more secure and maybe then he‚Äôll decrease naturally? Just an idea
2	My ex is an INFJ. And I‚Äôve felt whatever you feel sometimes. We used to get into huge arguments because he was generally insecure and insistent that I was not returning the same amount of affection as him. That being said, his idea of love was the fusing of both of our lives into one. A complete hopeless romantic. Honestly, a part of me found that adorable, but eventually it became too toxic. I needed the space he was not willing to give me. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1	I use to feel exactly like you until I met my boyfriend. My boyfriend gives me all the space in the world I need, he doesn't ask me if I did something bad, or make me feel like shit for being temporarily distant while I sort things out. In fact, because of this, I have seen this overly affection side of me naturally come out towards him. I've known him for 4 years and as time goes on I've become more and more fascinated with him. It's crazy. He really respects me and understands me on a level I've never had with anyone. He also understands I'm not always in an affection mood and just goes with the flow. He's very compromising and big on communication like I am. I've also never done anything to break his trust and he knows this. I wish I knew what type he is. Lol. He has no patience for tests. \n\nTo me, it sounds like you're close to being done with the relationship. I think you're bored because your tired of compromising your ways, while he whines about having to compromise his ways. However, if you're not fully done with him just yet, you should sit down with your significant other and explain to them why you require space in your relationship. You need very open communication in any relationship, never ever make assumptions someone should just understand or get it. If he still sees it as an issue it's time to move on and find someone that is similar to you or that can understand you better. This does take time by the way, but it is worth being in a happy and rewarding relationship. \n\n\n
1	>too much affection overwhelms me\n\nI've run into this with my partner before. I just talked with him and let him know that I need my space, and when he is too needy it actually pushes me away making him more needy (vicious cycle.)  He chilled out and gave me some space. I try harder to be affectionate when I'm feeling it. Much better.
5	mistyped as an INTP	I‚Äôve spent the entire time that I knew about MBTI thinking I was INTP. Turns out I‚Äôm just a bit disorganized/didn‚Äôt fit the stereotype for Js and that it was about *preferring* whether or not if a person liked plans and such. I never realized that I did a lot of planning in my head since I'm actually a big procrastinator and I just never carry them out. An ENTP friend pointed out that my intuition was rather pragmatic for an INTP and that‚Äôs kinda how I found out. I always thought me being INTJ on tests was just nonsense haha, but now I understand. I guess I‚Äôm home now.
7	I‚Äôve always claimed that a well balanced person should be so close to the border for all types that they could type all things depending almost on mood and changing regularly.    If your P and J are that close that they are almost interchangeable that‚Äôs a good thing.   I think people should be using MBTI to identify strengths and weaknesses and then work on thier weaknesses.  People should strive to be 50% for everything instead of trying to type themselves and place themselves in a box,  that‚Äôs where you run the risk of these MBTI subs becoming echo chambers that reinforce bad behavior.   I see it in this sub all the time.  We are often misunderstood as being cold.  Oh so it‚Äôs ok to be cold then?  No.  It‚Äôs not.\n\nSorry went on a bit of a rant there,  but the point is,  I think you should view your close typing as a good thing for your psych.
6	Spoiler: You're probably INTP, the stuff you can read online about Js being disorganized etc. was written by other people who are mistyping\n\nHappened to me as well
2	lolz ahahahaah \nAn INTJ will procrastinate.... , but not if life is threaten!\nAn INTJ is very pragmatic!

5	Male here, but maybe can help. I‚Äôve seen this in the complete reverse.  One of my friends is ISTJ married to an ENFP,  she basically sat down and figured out how much she needed him to be there for her emotionally.  She set up basic rules ‚ÄúI need a kiss before bed, at least 3 hugs a day, etc‚Äù. He meets those she feels satisfied, he doesn‚Äôt feel he‚Äôs not doing enough. She leaves him to his own devices the rest of the time,  though is always there for more if he wants it. They are both happy with the arrangement.   \n\nMaybe a discussion like that is in order.  You need to let your partner know you need space at times,  but he needs to let you know how much is enough for him.   If you want to give more... great.  But if you know the bare minimum he needs, you are both comfortable.   
2	I grew bored of *all* my partners over time. Relationships are not for me.
2	I(male) have dated an INFJ(female) before so I don't know if this helps, but I would have to agree with how you are feeling. If I do not get alone time to process information, or some time to work towards my goals, then I start resenting the person that is doing the smothering. I would suggest communicating this to him in a nice way. Encourage him to pursue his own hobbies. Solitude is a must, and clingy behavior will drive you insane if it is not taken care of.
1	At the first i feel the same way too, after years of keeping in touch with my emotion, im appreciating my partner more and more as time goes
1	Nope, I am loyal when it comes to love, but other matters, not really. I score good Fi in tests and extra low Fe (my lowest, usually a 1). As for friends, I‚Äôve had some that came and went (actually people that were interested in befriending me then we drifted away because they started pressuring me to socialize and stuff that made me uncomfortable). Idk if you could say that for friends.
1	In my last relationship, I really did... I felt awful. I was totally faithful but had fantasies of being with other people. I seem to have a pattern where I want out before being with someone for 2 years. 
1	My husband (ENFJ) and I (INTJ) have been together for six years, but we broke up for a time because of what you're describing. I actually cheated on him because I was bored with the relationship... long story. When we got back together, we restructured our relationship to allow for more independence. He seeks a lot of affection from friends and goes out without me, leaving me home to recharge and get lost in a book or something. \n\nIt really helped our relationship to talk about our needs. He understands it's not in my nature to be lovey-dovey, so whenever I do show affection toward him, he understands it's special. Additionally, we talk about whenever my mind starts wandering. It's not really that I want to leave him, but when I start thinking about being with someone else it's because I'm not getting something from the relationship, and it may be that I need more attention for a time. We INTJ women are so particular and sensitive, you know, and the stability of a long term relationship is so worth the effort!

A tattered treasure map of our similarities and differences, the trail of which had led us not to the glinting coins of a golden wedding anniversary but to a dead end."
5	What does rest mean to you?	I feel there needs to be some sort of an ‚Äòintense‚Äô rest to fully utilize an entire free day. Have yet to figure out how intense it needs to get though. \nJust a thought.
7	Complete rid of stress, noise, people. Eat well, hot shower, some exercise to get my dopamine. Get time to be fully absorbed in my solitary hobbies with no interruption. Have an uninterrupted sleep, waking up naturally.
4	Going for a solo 8 hour hike in the mountain by myself where the only human sound is my own footsteps.
2	A LOT of sleep and something like 7 hours of gaming. Some naps maybe. Sure, working on my projects and art whole Sunday makes me feel like I‚Äôve utilized my whole free day... does it make me feel rested though? Not at all.
1	Rest for me can vary based upon the need.  Do I need a physical break or a mental one. \n\nPreviously I would only ever take the first,  but I've learned that I occasionally need the second.  Even when I shut it off,  my subconscious is still working on my projects and I come back refreshed. 
1	doing what i want to do at my own pace, no pressure to be productive
1	Xanax and 10+ hours of sleep.  Otherwise, just having long periods of quiet where I research things or grind in WoW.
29	Your blank stare	Do people accuse you of looking angry or upset when you simply faze out....your eyes glazing over.....staring at a distant point, but not really? Is there anyone in your life that can guess your emotional state correctly, i.e. read you like a book? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nApparently it makes me appear unapproachable, people being afraid I'll bite their head off when I'm really just in deep thought. I laugh about it now, but wonder how/if it might have impacted potential friendships, jobs, etc.   I'm more conscious than ever to make eye contact and cast a small smile though now I find it puts me in position where the 'small-talker type' wants to drag me in. Ugggh!   haha
14	It's called a Death Stare for a reason.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you're a girl, people will be more likely to say, "You need to smile more."  I've started to answer, "why?"
9	I‚Äôve been told several times that I have a very serious face when I‚Äôm doing something mundane, like walking to class. I‚Äôm\nReally just thinking in my head during those moments, so I guess that has something to do with it. One person described me as ‚ÄúDexter coming to trashbag me‚Äù when I was simply walking towards them to help with something.
3	F em. 
2	I think many INTJs can relate to this - I did an internship before Christmas where, despite only being 3 weeks in, my manager decided I wasn't "clicking" with her because she thought I hated her, purely based off my facial expressions. I was then sacked the same day, despite also being told that I was doing a perfectly good job and it was nothing personal. I now try to make a real effort to NOT appear like I'm about to eat everyone I meet lol
2	I remember being in thought at work once and a customer (regular, overly friendly and chatty), asked why I was upset.\n\nI was having a great day.\n\n....
2	This is my life. Co-workers and family members alike. Always ask what's wrong, you need to learn to smile a bit. I am happy, but just because I dont display that emotion is often mistaken as being angry, upset, or depressed.\n\nAlso, my family loves holidays and loves watching me open gifts. I try so hard to show emotion and joy when opening a gift that I truly do like or cherish and my sister constantly reminds me I act like a robot.
1	People tell me to smile more, I just am not up to it. I like my serious expression.
1	I am either really smily (type 3 enneagram) or with the Serious Face. Thing is, the Serious Face is in fact my relaxed face, because I spend zero energy on making it. Doing the Smily face is really exhausting, despite me being actually happy
1	Ha ha! Yeah, same. Sometimes when I faze out, people ask me if I‚Äôm okay. Apparently I look sad üòÖ
1	My blank stare got me into trouble. I was stopped by a few cops in the middle of the street, in my neighboorhood. 
1	I've often been told I have "resting bitch face" whenever I'm thinking about something and not paying attention to my surroundings. I think it's pretty normal for an INTJ.
1	Yup.  I wear my emotions on my sleeve, as it were.  People can tell when I'm completely uninterested in what they are saying.
1	Been told that all my life. My resting face is pretty blank and emotionless which causes people to steer away from me i think. Im actually the complete opposite of how i might look when im walking or sitting, get me to open up a little and im literally the nicest person you‚Äôll meet
1	My wife is the only person who‚Äôs been able to read me so far. My INTP buddy can‚Äôt at all. *shrug*
1	Some stammer over what they were saying, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mean anything by it but you look angry and you‚Äôre not?‚Äù  Some double down, ‚Äúbut you have such a nice smile!‚Äù ‚ÄúYou look so much more approachable when you smile.‚Äù\n\nIt‚Äôs a running joke at my work with me and a few people. I asked one guy if they ever asked him to smile and he said, ‚Äúthey know better.‚Äù  So it might be an INTJ thing or a girl thing but apparently my bitch face is real.
1	I get told a lot that I should smile or at least say good morning when I come in to work. I usually answer ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs so good about it‚Äù , make a scary smile and walk away. I‚Äôm not much for small talk.

33	How To Be Me Again?	Last year shook my ground and I think I lost a huge part of what I was. Reading was a huge part of who I was, I used to read a book a week, but I haven't been able to read a single book since last June. I used to draw and sketch, but unable to do that anymore either. \n\nGrowing up, I barely had friends so I created this whole world filled with hobbies that helped me learn and grow. I am a recluse, never had more than 2 friends at a time, and was never really social or outgoing. I am (or used to be) the kind of person who completed online courses for fun and I don't mean this in a humble-brag kind of way! It was just how I was. Probably, what made me INTJ.. I read because I actually enjoyed the experience and art was a medium for me to express myself.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nToday, I just browse through reddit most times or keep thinking about past instances. Work is less these days, so I have more free time which has become a problem. I don't know how to move on. I have learned that a social life is not for me and I want to go back to being the old me. The ME who didn't waste her time thinking about people, and actually did stuff. It took a lot of courage to write this and I hope that you can understand that I am not being arrogant, just asking for help...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks
5	So what made you 'jump out' of your world?\n\nIf I had to guess from how it sounds, you were searching for the social and something happened to make you feel the compulsion to go back where you are most comfortable. \n\nWere you embarrassed publicly? A bad relationship? \n\nI would say if that's what you know and are most comfortable with, why the difficulty in going back? WHY are you asking for help? Do you really want to be more social and are afraid of being vulnerable??
4	itll come back. I lost ~everything~ a few years ago. Like... slowly learning to read linearly like books and stuff again. A bunch of things like that. Take your time, do what feels natural, make a good foundation that you'll be able to use for the rest of your life  
3	My experience with betreyal and losing myself for long years had taught me that there is no going back. However, there is always a way to build a new, and perhaps better you. It will be painful and neverending process but one day you will be content. Hugs.
3	Sounds like depression. I am there too. Please join us on r/depression! 
3	Make goals. Plan your free time. Execute. Achieve goals. Repeat.
3	For me, I can lose myself by too much exposure to others. Like right now, I‚Äôm lost because:\n\n-my life is very ‚Äúpublic‚Äù\n\n-my alone time is minimal to none\n\n-I don‚Äôt have a job (I‚Äôm moving back to my home state in a couple weeks, my current project is packing everything we need and selling everything we don‚Äôt need)\n\n-I have to be on social media to sell our crap ‚Äî I hate social media\n\n-I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm able/welcome to be myself\n\nI‚Äôm working on the factors I can change by going to the gym regularly (even when I really don‚Äôt want to), staying busy to pass the time, using social media only for the selling of our things, etc. \n\nI just encourage myself by knowing I can be better than I am now, knowing I can be myself again if I keep just doing my things. \n\nHope this shed a little light. Us INTJs gotta stick together. Good luck. 
3	Never stop starting. Take baby steps toward your goals. If you skip a day or a few, just pick yourself up and start again. Your only sunk if you stop the process and give up entirely.\n\nAlso progress is more important than perfection, which can be a difficult thing for us to grasp sometimes. I wish you all the best with your aspirations! :)
2	Sounds like you're having trouble concentrating. I think that's normal after a traumatic event. Have you tried meditation? Start with 30 seconds to a minute. And be kind to yourself. Give yourself permission to fall out of meditation, if it happens. Once a short period of time becomes easy, then slowly increase. 
2	You did it before cause it was fun. I don't think there was more to it. I think you may have shifted what constitute that or are looking for something deeper and more significant to do. If this is the case, then find what's meaningful to you and then proceed.  \n\nTry talking to people, anyone you like, maybe even chat with strangers. Some people who are really passionate might inspire passion in you. I think there's a social group for everyone, but don't force it. 
5	What job fits my personality?	I suck at small talk and being apart of conversations due to anxiety and maybe my personality as an INTJ. I have a bachelors degree in materials engineering but I think I hate the engineering field.  I struggle to fit in everywhere I go. I‚Äôm sick of the corporate environment where everybody is just trying to feed their own egos. I can‚Äôt do anything that is mindnumbingly boring. I don‚Äôt really have any hobbies either. I feel like such a boring loser that will never achieve anything and will always be alone. Wish I had a job I can be proud of and like minded people to be friends with. 
1	Job fit is irrelevant. Do what you like.
1	Find an aspect of the job that you like and that is relevant to the organization.   Become the best in that area and provide services based on that area to others in the organization, especially your direct supervisor.   Soon you will find purpose in that work and you can start to branch out to improve more areas in your life.   
1	You think too less of yourself, if you feel that way, shouldn‚Äôt you be going out and making things you want instead of wishing and whining? Or dare more on being the assertive type than staying too much on your head that you don‚Äôt get to do much. You are what you speak of. Small talks may appear boring but it‚Äôs a window of going inside through dimension if only one isn‚Äôt too much of himself that he thinks the world is a pool of boredom. Get a job, earn and save then get that thing you really want. Treat it as a tool first. Not everything are permanent anyway, depends if you want to stay stagnant. That‚Äôs all.
1	Go on an adventure, something away from civilization. Clear your head.\n\nThen go back to the drawing board.
1	I‚Äôm introverted as hell and a damn good waitress. It‚Äôs getting me through school, where I intend to have a job where I am more in charge when I graduate. But just because you are a certain personality type doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt find a way to make a job work. I used to lack so many social skills and small talk makes me angry. This job forces me to do what I hate and to grow thick skin. I enjoy it now, especially because of my coworkers. Because of my way of thinking, I make my job as tactical as possible. Everything has a script, order, process. This means every customer is treated equally, and the duties and way people are treated make sense in a methodological/almost mathematical way. I‚Äôm complicated sorry lol 
0	Ime social anxiety is something that can be fixed if u find something youre passionate about so dont let that rule out anything u really feel drawn to career or socially 
2	Why are INTJ's (and Judgers in general) so low on secondary psychopathy?	I heard some jokes about INTJ's being sociopaths but I searched for a correlation online and [I found a chart that showed that even INFP's of all people score higher on sociopathy](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f200519c463ad17529215d2a6b718522). What gives?\n\nINTJ scored high on primary psychopathy though.
5	Psychopaths are usually charming and likeable.
2	> What gives?\n\nThe image you linked to is based on a questionnaire [which was answered mostly by INxx types](http://worldofanentp.tumblr.com/post/96219034302/psychopathic-types). It's not an accurate representation of each type's actual average scores.\n\n
2	Perceived psychopath or genuine? 
107	People Jealous of INTJs	Throughout my life, I feel like there‚Äôs always that one person trying to compete with me and out do me in everything. I‚Äôm pretty laidback and chill so sometimes I don‚Äôt even realize until they say something like ‚ÄúHA! I did better than you!‚Äù Or they always try to correct everything you say and get upset when you prove yourself right. I must admit that I am competitive with myself and I strive for perfection, but I don‚Äôt brag about my success or put other people down. In fact, most of my friends come to me for advice since I usually come up with a solution to their problems pretty fast. One of my friends even asked me ‚Äúhow do you always know what you‚Äôre doing?‚Äù I guess from overthinking all the time I‚Äôm pretty much prepared for anything lol But does anyone have that one person who seems to envy you?
29	Had my fair share of people that have felt threatened by my INTJ competence. \nPeople normally hire us, but kind of sense that they regret after because now they have to do their own jobs well. \nThey feeling threatened doesn‚Äôt pose any emotions on me, but just makes me wonder why. \nJust do your job well, isn‚Äôt it the whole point?
19	Yes, especially in university. People have this idea that everyone is competitive and has an intention to bring them down or something. Whenever I walk around my law faculty I feel like I'm perceived as a threat, or maybe it's really just a feeling. \n\n
13	My whole life. Even currently on the workplace. Also the reason why many of my friends are gone and I'm nearly gone from social media. Not giving away free information about my life to those bastards. 
10	Oh yes.  My extraverted thinking has led to many leadership roles and influence in the workplace and there is ALWAYS someone who HATES the fact that I can think and talk at a level they can‚Äôt reach.  ALWAYS.  
10	Yeah, happens often. Especially when they see you not exerting the same effort as they do, and you have better grades/work performance and being complimented. It can be a headache.\n\nWhat I do is either I befriend them to get rid of their animosity towards me, or crush them thoroughly. Can't let them be little envious flies buzzing around me. Besides that it's annoying, they tend to be traitorous/opportunistic and like cctvs waiting for me to make the wrong move. It's just... uncomfortable.
8	There is always more than 1. Some just hide it better. Be careful.
18	Idk if someone could envy an INFP like me hahaha but I am quite mature and still striving for growth. Maybe I get quite a bit jealous of INTJs but in a good way that I admire them because they just know things. I love INTJs, though some might appear cold and what they say a robot, I think they aren‚Äôt. They‚Äôre just those kind of individuals that has a lot of things going on through their head but are capable enough to compose them and come out well structured to the world. I love my INTJ man. Hihi Sometimes he can get too blunt but doesn‚Äôt scare me a bit, it just made me respect him more because I‚Äôm also structuring what he says so I can become better person. Things are better with him and I love it that he isn‚Äôt perfect but I know he always want to improve things and the INFP says, we likey! \nSorry for the long message hehehe 
5	Recently I found out someone at work is jealous of me, I just didn't find out who it is.\n\nI am a very sincere person, so if I think something is good I outright say it. Because of this, I told many of the people I work with that I love working there (while many of them hate it).\n\nI work in a school that has two working units (I don't know the proper wording. There are two buildings apart from which other that operate under the brand of that school). I happen to work in both of them, and I prefer the poorer one (because the lack of resources made us have to be more together and made the work environment less formal). I told some of the people from there this.\n\nI've been "soft banished" from the other school, and the reason for it was just a bunch of lies that I found out to be lies two weeks later.\n\nIt makes me sad because I thought I could be open and sincere and true and kind, and now I have to go back to act at work as if I were constantly playing social chess. 
4	I had this when I was younger in highschool because I tended to be an overachiever in difficult subjects with little effort. Then again when I worked in a legal office, one particular person had it out for me because within a short period of time I shot really high in the company due to my excellent memory and ability to pick new things up. Both situations were both because they were really juvenile and obviously insecure. Eventually when I moved into IT, my ability pick up things quickly etc wasn't seen as threatening and I excelled.
8	Yeah, it's happened often enough, but I am competitive and I don't hide it (but I don't make an effort to show it either). Regarding envy, no I am not aware of any of that. 
3	Yeah, but my jealousy takes the form of, If I were just slightly different, a bit like y'all, I might actually get something done, rather than upon realizing how something is possible in principle abandoning its consideration.  That wouldn't affect anything I'd communicate though. . .
3	Uh, dunno, I guess I've never noticedü§î (read it as "I don't care enough to notice" üòÇ) but I'm usually the one who is competitive but in a good way.. Umm, or I hope it's in a good wayüòÉ - anyway, I like when there's a person around me, who is also very hard working and very successful in stuff, because it pushes me to try, to work and to be good as well. I mean this "healthy competitiveness" when someone around you helps you not to rest on your laurels. 
3	yeah i was even thinking this the other day. certain temperaments like the choleric especially, i think they envy INTJs. but there is something else i can‚Äôt put my finger on. Maybe it‚Äôs that we‚Äôre always doing different and surprising things on a deep level, maybe that we just don‚Äôt care what other people think, maybe that we aren‚Äôt playing the game of trying to please people and the things we do come naturally. Maybe all of the above.  
3	Yes. This happens a lot with my ENTJ spouse. He get's competitive with me and I don't even realize we are competing until he is like, "HAH, I BEAT YOU." For example, last week he was having a fit so I asked him what happened.\n\n  \nHim: "I was arguing with you in my head."  \n\n\nMe: "Uhm, okay...So what's the problem?"  \n\n\nHim: "You won." -stomps off-  \n\n\nMe: xD?
3	Envy, yes. Ironically this happened again yesterday and I was thinking about posting about it before I saw this. \n\nStory goes I ran into an old friend, and she decided to sit at my table and we chatted for a bit. She called me perfect. She said this even after hearing what I was stressed about (only shared that because she asked).\n\nI remember about a year ago she told me I was lucky and she was jealous of a grade I got. (I went to every class, took notes, made two sets of notes for exam, one by topic and one by case and annotated and studied for hours.. she skipped a bunch of classes.)\n\nI took it with a grain of salt because I know she has self esteem and image issues but I don‚Äôt consider those a compliment. To me ‚Äúlucky‚Äù and ‚Äúperfect‚Äù erodes the consistent hard work, discipline, and sacrifice it takes me to achieve what I have. It also assumes that every area of my life is perfect when it‚Äôs not. I‚Äôve got issues just like everyone else.\n\nPeople say to be more open but in my experience it doesn‚Äôt take away the facade that I‚Äôm always put together. It‚Äôs weird.
3	People always figure out who the top dog is.... social dynamics. whether you are in jail (alpha), or in the workforce/school (intellectual alpha).\n\n It means you come across as highly competent, so people are measuring themselves against you. I agree, it's very annoying but is technically a compliment. I'd treat it as such. 
3	Anyone jealous of being INTJ probably only knows the pluses of being INTJ, not the painful drawbacks.
1	Besides petty shit in my early high school years,that would be a no.
1	I am INTJ. In my family i am the successful wiseman (as sisters keep telling me, my brothers dont as i am a competition somehow hhh). My sister's husband is the only guy i think is jealous of me. He is not as successful. And he show his jealousy. 
1	Now that I think of it, I know an ENTP who's always competing 
1	it happens to me so often that It's just meddling with everything.
1	Yes, I have lost friends over the years I think due to this and it's sad because it's the last thing I want. I'm very competitive with myself, but not at all with other people. I was the kid who would get my test back in class and immediately turn it over or stuff it in my backpack before others saw and gave me crap for my high score. 
1	We know you are competitive and thinking the same exact thing that we say openly.  
1	After years of this, I started to purposefully look for ways to help those around me to be more successful. The more successful I am at this, the more my extended team is successful. None of what I do is really obvious, unless someone was really paying close attention to what I do. \n\nFor example, if I know someone really hates dealing with a particular administrative task, I‚Äôll offer to take care of it because I‚Äôm doing something similar anyway. If I notice someone is always poorly prepared for a particular meeting, I may ask questions of that person ahead of time, so they‚Äôll know they answer at the meeting...\n\nIts really fluid to incorporate into the way you operate when your heart is in the right place. I genuinely hope we can all be successful, so it‚Äôs often pretty easy to see how I can be of service. 
1	Many people in my life come to me for advice and then immediately turn around and do the exact opposite in an attempt to prove me wrong. It's infuriating! Don't ask me then. If I care about the person, I've even resorted to reverse psychology to get them to do the right thing. \n\nFriend: "Should I run out into traffic?"\n\nMe: "Yeah, you totally should. That's the best course of action. Make sure there are a lot of cars out when you do it."\n\nFriend: "Ha! I'm going to wait at the crosswalk and wait for the light to tell me to go. I knew I could prove you wrong!"
1	I had a 5th Grade teacher, after discussing a previous student who had gone on to skip most of high school and move directly on to college, turn pointedly to me and say "and that's what a *real* gifted student is like". I think even at the age of 11 I made a face that said, "wow, you really have issues if you're trying to berate a 5th grader for being placed into advanced courses." It's always something.  I took my SATs back in the late 90s and scored a 1340. My own mother turned to me and said "well, are you smart or not?" because....I guess she was expecting a perfect 1600? And yes, people really like to pounce on me when they get the chance to correct me.
1	I have found that because many of us make things look easy (often I think that others do not realize the amount of effort and thought put into our work), that they get jealous, thinking that we are just, "lucky."  What I find the most annoying is that they cannot wait until you make a small mistake, when you do, it might have been the ONLY mistake you've ever made, while they've made tons of mistakes, they will make a federal case out of it and gleefully draw attention to it.  This didn't even have anything to do with my judgement of their work, I would usually not say anything, so it's not as if they were just giving me a taste of my own medicine back at me.  These jealous types LOVE to see those who they are jealous of, "fail" in their eyes, even if it isn't a fail, but a tiny mistake.
1	We have better ideas than they do, so they steal ours. The problem is, this wasn't our only great idea. So they stole one of our good ideas, and we have plenty more where it came from and they get stuck not knowing what to do next when we have already crafted many other plans in the mean time. It's ok, let them be jealous.

3	The FX 8350 is an 8 core CPU\n\n**Change my mind**\n\nEdit: I just realized I asked an intelligent type that question so its not debatable to them as the answer is clear and logical. 
2	Is there a way/method to overthink less?	I overthink all the time about people (if I can trust them or not, if they're lying or not, etc), events (that happens to me or not), feelings/emotions, future, past, present, the food I'll eat in some minutes, what I'm going to do in some hours, what's the next movie I'll watch, "does my cat need more food?"...\n\nMy mind is driving me crazy. I tried meditation and focus on the present but I just can't. I need a method to really calm me down or I'm sure I'll go crazy anytime. Those thoughts really affect my mood, so it's something really serious. Even when I'm busy doing something my mind suddenly starts to think about something else. \n\nDoes anyone know a method to stop overthinking or decrease the frequency? \n\n(Sorry for my English, it's not my first language)
4	Whenever I start to ovetthink I write down everything that comes to mind in a journal. When I first started this practice I would write ~4,000 words a day. Nowadays it's around 750.\n\n
3	If your overthinking is affecting your mood and driving you crazy, you should really see a therapist to work on the specifics.\n\n[Meditation comes in many forms](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320392.php). You can try different kinds if one type isn't working for you. It's also an ongoing process. In the same way that you have a "habit" of overthinking things, you need to cultivate a habit of setting aside some time during the day to mentally relax.\n\nThere's no single method that will work for everyone, but luckily overthinking is a common problem and there are many articles out there with useful tips on combating an overactive mind. [Here's a great list](https://www.positivityblog.com/how-to-stop-overthinking/).

1	Ni versus Ti: Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb	Really on edge about even bothering to submit this conundrum. As a precursor, the following is probably left to the realm of late-twenties to thirty-somethings INTJs, also. \n\nSo, former boyfriend from ages fifteen-to-twenty, who, by all accounts strikes every note as INTJ, has tested as such, and even tepidly introduced me to this area of study at ages 19/20, has been exhibiting strange tugs. Aside from dating for about four-and-a-half years, we've been friends of a total of nineteen (Holy fuck! If that didn't just hit me like a lead pipe to the skull right now.) years now (this is including dating and "reconvening" after respective divorces). We've had the frank discussion about how we might be each other's crutch, in a sense. A reset of each other's Ni-Se clock, intermittently, might just be the essence of INTJ/ISTP relations?\n\nNow that the backstory is out of the way, moving on.....\n\nAlthough we are both adamant about never entering in the contract of marriage again, he hasn't been subtle about the notion of having kids as of late. Not completely sure if this is a 1/3 life crisis of sorts.He's been in a flux of dropping hints in terms of us having career stability, scholastic accomplishment, monetary stability, unfulfillment in previous marriages (not to mention the discussions on the semi-egotistic idea, at both the forefront of our minds, that kiddos were negated from the realm of plausibility early in). Not sure if this is a compensatory, Inferior Se factor making headway or not. (There's room for this in Jung's concept of Individuation.)\n\nKind of rolling off the cuff in terms of thoughts right now. Will leave leeway for Ti being just as much a dickhead as Ni. (And, thus, we come full circle to the not so cryptic message of the title.)
3	Do you meditate?	If so what kind of method and why? I have been on and off meditation for awhile, but I find it useful before sleep or any stressful event to calm my mind. For now I have only tried breathing meditation(?), but would also like to try other methods. \n\nCheers! 
3	I do.  I started with Headspace and evolved.  Now I just incorporate it into my self care routine.  I hit a point where I was getting overloaded and constantly running scenarios in my head.  It was making me weird.  I figured I had some pretty hardcore anxiety and there were two solutions:\n\n1.  Xanax \n2. Something else\n\nMeditation turned out to be the something else.  I doubt that I am down with the Buddha, but Buddhist methods do give me a little peace.    
3	Yep. Its amazing ^_^ i love meditating so much 
2	I did something yesterday. I was reading an article on how people preferred to electrocute themselves then be quiet with their thoughts for 15 minutes. Then I remembered that as a child I had the ability to get lost in my own thoughts for hours.\n\nI did not try to empty my mind or suppress thoughts. When they came I just put them away. For fifteen minutes I just thought about the universe and (since I am a theist) the Creator. When 15 minutes passed, I stopped, in the zone, completely at peace. I didn't day dream either, as I used to as a kid. I don't think it was meditation since I wasn't trying to empty my mind and think nothing.\n\nPerhaps you just need to think about something that makes you feel happy rather than empty your mind? We might not express emotions but we have them.
1	Personally I don‚Äôt like it. I believe there are three states of being. Positive, Negative and Neutral. Of those states people fluctuate between positive and negative while navigating reality. Mediation is a neutral state which is induced to disengage from reality. If you induce a neutral state from a positive you will return to a positive state as your unconscious faculties are freed to operate with out the burden of consciousness. If you engage a neutral state from the negative, the negative unconscious manifests exponentially as you‚Äôve removed conscious restraints. Mediation from a negative state destroys the self and deranges the personality. This is why most people who engage in mediation are, how would you put it, Magoo? Or just one shoulder shove away from snapping.
1	I consider my gym sessions to be meditation. It's 30-45 minutes of lifting and an hour of cardio.\n\nWriting as well.\n\nOnce I decoupled meditation with sitting and doing nothing, it became easier to clear my head. 
1	I practice yoga to certain aural frequencies.  I will do the moving asanas to a mid range frequency (432 to 320 Hz) and balance postures and stretch to a higher frequency (741 Hz +).  Sometimes I will simply sit for several minutes with 110 Hz.  The mid to higher frequencies are all mentally effective, but 110 actually physically resonates in my gut.  It's very strange and very cool.
0	My default state of mind is relaxed so I don't need to.
8	Never learned to smile. How do fellow INTJs give a genuine smile?	Growing up, I either gave a toothy gin or chuckled. I realized that I never learned how to smile, just like I never automatically picked up social skills. I am trying to learn now, but smiling is apparently a skill never written in job descriptions that is universally sought. How do I smile when there‚Äôs nothing to feel happy about happening at the present moment. My smiles look fake?
7	It's gotta be candid and in the moment. I can't do a fake smile for pictures or anything
4	Smile with your eyes. That is, make a smile face but make sure you feel it it in your eyes. If you feel it there, it's a good smile regardless of whether you show your teeth or not.\n\n> How do I smile when there‚Äôs nothing to feel happy about happening at the present moment.\n\nBeing alive at all is a good reason to be happy. I try to smile inwardly (I feel it in my chest) and it really makes a difference.
3	Learn to have compassion, honesty, and impartial view of the world.  Your smile will come naturally!
2	Yeah I've always been laughed at for having a waxwork plastic look when I smile - As others have said, just try laughing when people take pictures, seems to work for me
2	If it‚Äôs for a picture I have to tell them to make me laugh beforehand üòÇ
1	Same here.  If you find the secret,  I'll buy a bottle from you!  Lol
1	I try to laugh more frequently so my smile looks natural.
1	Try holding a pen in your teeth so it forces you to smile (when alone obviously). It gets your facial muscles working and makes it easier to smile when the time comes. And a genuine smile is definitely all in the eyes.
1	Smile with eyes. Mouth will follow far enough to be considered a smile 
1	I know how you feel.  I was never encouraged to smile growing up, and when I was reprimanded for something I was told to "wipe that look off your face".  So, I practiced relaxing my facial muscles and not using any particular expression.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo yeah, I have that typical "When you smile, you don't look like you know what a smile is supposed to be" type reaction.
1	i try to smile with my eyes, my mouth just does its thing
3	Need some info here...	Views on INFJ? And while that‚Äôs happening, what can an INFJ, viewed through your lense do to not piss off INTJs.
3	Not give the false impression of being an INTJ oneself.
3	My best friend apart from my husband is an INFJ, but she's not incredibly irrational. She's very thoughtful. I do think she's more sensitive than I am, but not really in an irrational way - more that she's upset by things that wouldn't upset me because I'm just less emotional. I guess I never realized that INFJs are stereotypically irrational.\n\nI enjoy having long conversations with her about deep subjects, so stick with subjects that matter to you both. Don't overwhelm your INTJ with emotionally loaded content unless it's directly applicable to your relationship or the subject of conversation.
2	Funny, my wife is an INFJ. Yes they are illogical . Very difficult to have sensible debates with someone who bases everything on their feelings rather than facts and rationalization. Makes no sense to me and is amazingly frustrating sometimes. She is an amazing mother and very intelligent however, oh and I love her.\n\nOh an she is very careful not to bring up certain topics with me because of our opposing viewpoints. She would rather not get me started because I don‚Äôt stop lol\n\nTo not piss off an INTJ, my main thing is don‚Äôt base an opinion or argument off of your feelings without any facts to back yourself up. Doesn‚Äôt make any sense .
1	The door slam thing? \nFuck those guys man 
0	Dont think ive ever met one. Intj don't like illogical people. Use thinking not feeling.\n\nWhat is it like to be infj. Do you get annoyed by people who are logical. Do you get annoyed by planning and thinking things through.
0	INFJ's are boring and uninteresting. I like them as teachers though.
