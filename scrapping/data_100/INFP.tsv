2	Daily INFP random discussion thread - March 09	\nThis is your daily random discussion thread for /r/INFP. Feel free to chat, or ask questions. \n\nNew to this subreddit? Read the sidebar!\n
222	I love it when I can make people I care about really smile.	
42	When their sweet smile shows. Followed by a genuine laugh.\n\nAnd the look they make at this moment.\nI could fell in love with everyone at this moment. 
10	Does it count if they laugh at me?
3	Me too! It makes my heart skip a beat!
3	I know what you mean. My mom's told me I'm the only one that can make her laugh. I think it's just a kind thought, because I've definitely seen her laugh at things other people have said. 
2	My goal everyday is to make my husband laugh and I'm really god at it. It's my favourite thing in this life. 
2	I live for that shit
1	When I make the girl I love smile/laugh I just wanna kiss her repeatedly. She's adorable. 
1	there's no greater gift than making someone genuinely smile :) except maybe the appreciation of that smile
1	the biggest mood
1	Hearing the laughter of my friends is my favourite thing in the world.
379	I took this picture during the summer while going for a walk. I hope you all enjoy it.	
20	This fills me with elementary school, pre-cell phone days, nostalgia. Playing manhunt and baseball before it got dark. Then popping in a VHS before bed. I miss it so much.
8	Nice photo!
6	I like it a lot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can feel the isolation.
6	I thought this was minecraft
5	Man I miss summer walks. This winter took the last piece of soul from my body. I can't wait June to get away from people and watch sunsets in peace üòç
5	My favourite part of a summers day, sunset ‚ù§Ô∏è
4	Ooohhh so beautiful üòç 
3	Love the colors in the sky. With the brick buildings on either side, it invites people to walk off into the sunset. A happy ending üòä
4	Seems like a place you could sit for quite a while and not expect anyone else to walk by ‚ò∫Ô∏è
2	looks like a shot from a next gen game
2	No hate here, just something I noticed. I find all the pictures posted on this sub very aesthetically pleasing, but all of them also, without fail, make me really anxious. No idea why.
2	The walls looked like a video game at first glance, to me. Thought maybe Arma
2	mind if I ask where this is relatively?  such a good feeling in there :)
26	Descent.	
12	no interest in romantic relationships	early 20s, never been in a relationship, never been interested in one, never liked anyone in a deep emotional connection kind of way and have tried dating apps but never interested enough to continue conversations or meet in real life. my friends are always asking me "why are you still single?" and i don't have a good answer. some have suggested that i just haven't met the right person yet / my standards are too high, but somehow i just feel like it's because i can't really be bothered. if there were a list of priorities in my life, getting into a relationship would be right at the bottom -- although there's also that part of me that's curious about what being in one would be like. i'm also not exactly a huge fan of emotional vulnerability.\n\nany thoughts or anyone have a similar experience? wondering if it has anything to do with being infp.
8	I think aromantic people come in all types. Some people just have other stuff to do. 
5	I envy you. 
3	I totally relate! I'm not quite sure it has something to do with being INFP, but now I'm curious about it
2	I am not in the same situation but I think being single and not looking for love desperately is a good thing. You won't find love when you look for it. Not being interested isn't a bad thing imo because life isn't about love, afterall. Plus, if you find the right one, you'd be interested. If not, then you'd still be uninterested. So I don't see anything bad in this.
2	Forcing yourself into a romantic relationship doesn't sound healthy or enjoyable. I wouldn't say emotional vulnerability is necessary either. MBTI doesn't try to represent sexuality I think. You might enjoy hanging around the /r/aromantic community as well as being apart of us. :)
1	Same! Although I haven't even tried out dating apps or anything and I'm soon 27
1	Being aromantic is completely fine! I think it presents itself in all personality types just like being gay or straight does. Romance doesn‚Äôt have to be your first priority, or a priority at all.
1	22F and while I‚Äôve had a few intimate friendships I‚Äôm in the same boat. I‚Äôm mostly asexual but would like to have a family one day too so I‚Äôm hoping there‚Äôs someone out there I can be happy with!!!!

18	Felt down, but then...	As an INFP I crave time on my own. To listen to music, be creative, switch off from socializing, spend time with my cat and just to RELAX. \n\nFor the past few weeks I‚Äôve thrown myself into the world of dating. I‚Äôve started a new office based job. I‚Äôve spent more time with my family. And, more time with friends/socializing. \n\nI felt after a couple of awful months and feeling isolated working as a freelancer, that I should change my lifestyle. \n\nThis weekend I was going to go on another date with a guy I enjoy spending time with and it fell through. I felt rejected and disappointed. But then, I stopped to think about things. Realizing that time ALONE is so important to me. I cannot function without investing time into my creative hobbies, doing the things I love and spending time with myself. \n\nSo, after initially feeling crappy and rejected to an extent I stopped. I thought about the weekend ahead of me and how I can enjoy it. \n\nI‚Äôve been spending so much time around other people that I didn‚Äôt realize that I need time alone. I‚Äôm not being true to myself. Yes, I can‚Äôt avoid socializing at work with colleagues or my family. But, I can take a breather and opt out of socializing. In this case, I didn‚Äôt opt out but I am happy I‚Äôm spending the weekend with myself. \n\nI need to recharge my batteries. I‚Äôm learning about myself and have realized I overdo socialization when I don‚Äôt need to. I love being introverted. I love having the freedom to do what I want, alone. Without the noise/distraction of other people. And, as an INFP it‚Äôs important to not get pulled into a situation that doesn‚Äôt fulfill your needs. Remember to take time out for you. Always. 
3	Many Slow claps for this victorious passage.  You have found truth and truth of self in a seemingly healthy way.  This is a momentous occasion that I'd say requires an INFParty.  \n\nüò®üò±üò∞\n\n... but i hope that this reply will do in its stead
1	I get this way too. People drain me
72	Picture I took at school a few weeks ago	
2	I love how you've catched the atmosphere. Very dreamy and i can almost smell the rain. Also the way everyone is walking in a different direction yet somehow going towards their goal
15	INFP memes compilation	
1	Ha. I use to be this lol. But in all seriousness make sure to take care of you. 
53	found this cute little bridge on my walk	
1	That is cute
1	Dark souls shit
5	Are your parents disappointed in you?	I feel like mine always are. I know they want the best for me but they still completely fail to understand me. I quit my job because I felt like I would suffocate there and now I spend all my time drawing and writing and going to the library (and watching tv series lol), waiting for spring when I'm going to go study again. I feel like I'm doing something really important, even though I don't get any money from it. It kind of hurts when they tell me I'm "wasting my time" when all these little hobbies means so much to me. They're an ISFJ and ISTP by the way. My mom nags more than my dad does. I think my dad might even be a little proud of me lol. Nevertheless I'm just really bad at being a responsible adult.\n\nHow do your parents feel about your life choices? And what types are they? 
2	I think my mom is ESFP but I have never been good enough for her, she always finds something. My dad doesn't say much he is okay as long as I am being productive responsible adult don't know his type. But it sucks when your parents don't comprehend or support because subconsciously you are always looking for their approval whether it's conscious or not. If they are hindering your path you may have to seek to let go of that or talk to them to come to an understanding. 
3	Am I too clingy?? Are any other infps SUPER clingy???	Its only with internet friends for some reason. My friend was playing roblox and so i joined her. Then she played a game that i couldn't find anywhere so i got sAd. Then this one time I was in a voice chat and they were accidentally ignoring me so i sat in the voice chat crying. I feel so selfish.\nI just want to spend time with her. Whenever she's doing something, I want to do it with her.  I'm usually ignored because i have to be quiet. I can't talk because I'll wake my parents up. (we're in different timezones) \nI want to say she's a friend, but it's more like i just follow her around.\nWhen we do talk, its nice.
2	Oh, if you are talking about female friends. then any emotional wants excluding lust makes you needy.
17	Am I the only INFP that likes partying?	Everyone here keeps saying that they don‚Äôt like nightclubs, they don‚Äôt drink, they don‚Äôt like crowds... Nights out are my favourite thing in the whole wide world. Drinking is fun, and I get to dance all night and I love dancing. I also think mosh pits are really fun. I would have said the exact opposite things when I was 19 but that‚Äôs because I hadn‚Äôt tried them and just assumed I wouldn‚Äôt like them. I feel like I don‚Äôt fit in here ha.
14	I think personality changes dramatically due to alcohol. When I drink I become super extroverted and love being out with people. Soon as I start sobering up, I need to be alone.
7	I am an INFP and ai love partying as well. Maybe it correlates with your music preference(?)
6	Nothing against drinking or meeting with friends, but nightclubs are just too much and feel fake. I love concerts however and crowdsurfing and all that on rock concerts.
5	Straight up, the INFPs that enjoy socializing, aren‚Äôt depressed, and like going out are severely underrepresented in this sub. \n\nYou do you brother, I ain‚Äôt hitting clubs but I love hanging with my people. 
4	I was like that until I was about 35. Then I began to loathe it, but that was really the result of depression. I'm starting to get back out in the world. I love happy hours, but I doubt i'll do the late night partying anymore. That really conflicts with my health and fitness goals.
6	Not trying to doubt you, but are you sure you are an INFP? It's pretty easy for people who are ENFPs to mistype themselves as INFPs because ENFP is probably the most introverted of the extravert types. \n\nI enjoy some of these same things as well, but sensory overload is fairly common with introverts and if you aren't experiencing overload at all, I wonder if you are more extraverted than you thought. 
2	I love parting around close friends! In many cases it combines my favorite things: good conversation, music, and food! I can't do it all the time and definitely need time after to recharge, but it mixes things up now and again. 
2	I sometimes like to party with friends, but I get tired so fast I'm often forced to sit alone at a table when others still dance and that becomes such a negative and alienating experience for me that I rarely ever go unless it's just me and one friend, because then they're more likely to keep me company. Sensory overload doesn't hit me if I have someone to focus on, sort of. \n\nNot quite partying, but drinking with friends somewhere we can talk is one of my favorite things to do, though!
2	You are not alone! I enjoy going to parties once in a while when I'm not busy. Though I will say, I only go to parties if I know other people that are going, otherwise it takes a lot of alcohol to make me more social.
2	nah man I live for the sesh 
2	I used to feel very uncomfortable to drink and dance in front of people, and I generally avoided parties. But slowly, I found myself among my kind of crowd and I realized how many types of parties there are. I still don't like certain types of nightclubs but I do enjoy house parties and tecno/rave ones, especially in nature. I got over my fear of dancing in front of people, and nowdays I just let the music move my body. I develop a tactic for drinking: knowing where to stop. I drink just enough to losen up a bit without getting wasted. Same about weed. I think partying is actually great and I am very proud of getting over my fears and enjoying it. 
2	I'm the same way.  I don't go out to nightclubs/concerts as often because I'm in my thirties now, but when I do I'm mostly focused on dancing rather than finding people to talk to.  So I think it makes sense for an INFP, and every INFP is a little different, since it's is a range that you are in, not an exact same level of preference.  
2	I love to party. But, I tend to over do it on the liquor in order to counter react how uncomfortable I feel. The good news is, I'm really friendly and kind when I'm drunk (or so I'm told).
2	I love the occasional party! I especially love going to concerts/festivals/raves featuring my favorite artists. House, techno, and EDM are generally my favorite but I like almost anything. It is definitely escapism and for a moment I can forget all my problems and just have fun dancing to the music. Also, people tend to be so nice when they are drunk/on some sort of substance!
2	For me, it depends on the situation of the party. If I‚Äôm friends with most of the people there, then I‚Äôll go and have a good time. But if I don‚Äôt know anyone there, or only know 1 person, I‚Äôll either anxiously stay for half an hour to be nice or just don‚Äôt go.
1	fucking love it,  but need like a solid few dayas to recover from every night out lmao
1	I go clubbing so rarely that when I do, I always have fun. But usually I stay with my friends all night. I just have to get a few shots first to be able to loosen up. Often I'll get tired in the middle of dancing and just stop and stare at a spot somewhere, then continue dancing after a while. Probably looks a bit weird lol. Anyone else ever do that? 
1	No I use to party and love to dance I just don't like phony places that are excessively loud, or too much immaturity, I prefer more quirky and intimate spots. 
1	I love clubs and dancing too! I can dance all night, drinks or not!
1	Yes! I love love love partying. 
4	Im an infp who does not get along with other infps	For a while i did not know why but now i think i know. Almost all yall sensitive as hell. I mean i am too but i have grown to not show i am and even laugh at myself and force myself not to sweat it. Also alot of infps think they are "deep" and i dont like it when people take things too seriously its kinda boring and seems self absorbed. Anyone else also feel this way?
9	Or maybe you hate us because we remind you of things you hate about you... ü§î 
1	I feel personally attacked right now.... üòÇ\nAre you sure you're infp? 
1	I agreee, especially the too sensitive part. I always test as infp but the f/t is always near 50-50 though so maybe that‚Äôs why?
41	Crying and sex with my INFP boyfriend	We have deep, intimate conversations and if I cry because I am overcome with emotion about something (I am an INFP too), he will cry as well. He will hold and comfort me and then eventually start kissing me all over and then we have some of the best sex I've ever had in my life.\n\nSO! INFP guys I know you get a lot of flack for being sensitive and crying and such but you are hot and ideal boyfriends and lovers in many ways.\n\n
23	As an INFP man, I can honestly say I love deep conversations and intellectual intimacy more than physical intimacy.   If our minds and souls don't connect, then physical intimacy is nothing to me.  \n\nThank you for appreciating that.  It is hard to find people who do.  
6	Thank you.  It's really nice being appreciated. We are pretty damn rare (INFP Males). We're only found in about 1% of the population so well done for finding yours! Yes, the sex can be sensual and intense can't it? It's the empathy I think, we tend to know what people like, instinctively. Plus we can be pretty kinky, which is fun. 
6	How do we female hetero infp ladies find types that let us be emotional too?! I like emotions in my male partners too, but I find it's so hard to find hetero guys that are both strong AND like women with emotions. Is it mainly NFs?!?! They are so rare ahhh. 
3	Ha ha! A red piller would be so confused about this.
3	Not an INFP but I just want to say my INFP partner is just like this and... damn. Total game changer. Definitely ideal partners (at least for me) for sure. I have no idea how I got so lucky. INFP guys -- keep doing what you're doing.
3	Here's a poem I hope we all find something meaningful about	Never willing: Never taken.\nIndefinitely led in squalor and betrayed by opportunity;\nIrony claims her throne and leads a relentless brigade of consequence upon your very being.\nWhat was your premonition of being? \nSolace from the soulless? \nClear water under all the words you heard?\nIt wasn't and won't be.\nFalsetto tears lead me home, or maybe something close to it.\nNoiseless sobs to reverberate in my chest, muffled by the density of thoughts that were stuck in my lungs: there isn't a breath strong enough to pour my heart out. \nIt's not me who sobs or cries, but it's shallow cries of the remnants of yesteryears that straggled upon this vessel of change: begging to be home again. \nOr whatever that was.\nSomewhere out there, there is belonging and conjunct understanding amongst us all.\nSomewhere, possibly, is a feeling of home.
4	so is this a date?	The last couple years I‚Äôve seen this college girl around town.... at the local library, and where I work because many college students worked there too..\n\nShe seemed like an interesting person, so I sent her a request on facebook..\n\nI said where I recognized her from, and asked how she‚Äôs been..\n\nShe replied kinda enthusiastically, saying what her major is, asked what i‚Äôm up studying, what i‚Äôm up to etc..\n\nI replied, then about a week later casually asked if she wanted to get coffee because it‚Äôs nice meeting likeminded people..\n\nshe agreed, does this sound like a date?\n\ndo i clearly need to specify if it‚Äôs a date or not? i feel like women typically want things defined instead of just going with the flow yeah?
3	This sounds like a date to me. We (as INFP) tend to feel the need to specify whether it's a romantic date or not. The thing is: you never know, because you don't know the person. You do know there's mutual interest in getting to know the other person and perhaps (probably) there is physical attraction.\nI think a first date is more like a prelude to dating. It's more like finding out if you want to date this person. \nGood luck, keep calm! 
131	My most recent painting.	
6	 This is like one of those days you have a headache, you go outside for the first time in two days, you haven't meditated for a while and everything is just blurry and it's oh so cuiet and depressing. Beautiful art. 
3	This is awesome. Very nice sense of color.
1	Is this oils? So shiny.
1	Wow, I feel like I'm in it... please keep painting. This is inspiring - you've captured the feeling of "being", simply "being". And I think that's something of great value.
665	My Life	
100	I fall in love with literally everyone in the world. So now I just waste 5 minutes for each person. I play a movie: ‚ÄúMe and [insert person]‚Äù mentally, say goodbye in my head, and try to forget the person.\n\nOkay, I‚Äôm joking a bit but it does happen on some days when I‚Äôm overly emotional lol.
35	Honestly, I'll take the 5 billion. I'll give 50% to the people I really care about and help them pay off debts, then I'll invest like 35% into something. The remaining 15% I'll just use to move far away from everyone to another country and live in peace, then save whatever is left for after all of my accomadations are met. 
32	Wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way
30	I'm offended but also acknowledge how completely accurate this is. üò§
27	Haha, I can just imagine thinkers seeing this and being like, "WTF".   \n\n\nBut i'm like, "yep" nodding at this meme. Ah, I love being an infp, I really do >.> 
50	Hmmmmmmm nah 5 bil please, could do a lot wit that shit. 
16	I feel seen.  The last decade or so of my life has been:  1 year relationship, 2 year relationship, (a month off), 3 year relationship, (a month off), 3 year relationship, (2 months off), 3 year relationship (currently in).  
9	Yup. That's right. üòÖ
9	At first I was like "What?? No, I wouldn't do that!"\n\nThen I thought about it and it's true. I'm just in denial lol
7	Or just that one person that talks to everyone on a social media app and never converses with anyone in real life and just slowly fades away in the background. \n\nBig oof
8	As much i want love I don‚Äôt want my time being wasted, I‚Äôll take that 5 billion and redistribute it to the masses üòå
5	Could I restart life with my previous life experience?
5	I didn‚Äôt go on reddit this morning expecting to get dragged. 
9	I'll take the 5 billion. I can find people to fall in love with and waste my life with and also waste my 5 billion dollars on, all on my own.
4	Ain't that the truth xD
4	\*also never getting over them for the rest of my life
9	No. Literally anyone would accept 5 billion dollars. Don't even joke yourself.
3	Sorry but I‚Äôm def taking the 5 billion dollar door. :)\n\n
3	5 billion for me. 
7	Room 2, for sure.\n\nRestart life? -> Will end up in a even worse country than i have already been born in.\n\nRoom 3 is just reserved for INFPs\n\nTherefore Room #2. Most logical way + i might actually start enjoying life at this point.
2	Too accurate. Even 5 years is pushing it for me though.
2	As an intp I can relate. 
2	Wow, this is scary accurate.
2	You kidding?  The 5 billion.
2	Ahh the truth hurts! Because of my grand love endeavors, Ive pushed off going to school/finding a career for the past 10yrs or so. Lmao. At least I managed to move to another country and get a husband. But now I must figure out the rest of my life.
2	Hell nah I‚Äôd pick door 2 in a heartbeat 
2	This is the exact kinda shit I have a hard time explaining about myself to people when they catch onto what kind of person I am. If we've gone separate ways, I feel like I have to apologize and seek resolve if I ever want to move on. I appreciate our differences and am sorry it couldn't work out, but I really have to stress that I don't want for there to be any unnecessary grudges or hard feelings. Hell, I actually did exactly this earlier in the week.\n\nI think for us INFPs it feels a lot harder to let go of things than it is for others. But, at the same, time I think I go through the stages of "getting over it" rather quickly if I seek to make amends sooner than later.
1	mate, this is so true...can i upvote it a thousand time...
1	ME.
1	Door 2 please 
1	I'm familiar with that door fosho
1	I'd chose door one if I had the knowledge I have know when doing so. Otherwise, yeah, that about right.
1	Funny thing, I can never seem to fall in love with anyone. I might have a light crush or anything, but never fall in love... 
1	I just fell in love with a fellow INFP, what do?
1	I'll take the cash. It does not say the people from door 3 will love me back. Already been tricked into that, no thx
1	Holy shit, came here from r/all. Is this an INFP thing? That explains sooooo much.
1	I literally laughed so loud when I saw this... Why is it true? Hahah
1	I feel so understood.
1	The struggle lol
1	Painful but so true. Having a big heart is a blessing and curse. 
1	r/2infp4meirl
1	Gotta love INFP's. 
1	Option #2:\n\n\- start a business that requires a lot of employees - entire chain of production of vegan products - and buy out the competition and place them as subsidiaries under my company, while keeping the management of those companies intact\n\n\- arrange benefits for the workers, such as insurance, retirement plan, health benefits, etc\n\n\- expand and buy out other production chains while keeping the management, but implementing the aforementioned benefits\n\n\- in time, option #3 will emerge as a result of those benefits provided in the form of happy workers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRather have it that way than some fairy tale with no realistic human approach.
1	For me it's more like go through door number 2 and spend all the money on the people from door number 3
1	Money can't buy love and restarting your life means you have to relive all your past heartbreak. \n\n-INFPs probably
1	tbh i would prefer number 2. love just isnt my thing üëÄ

1	INFP Magnets for Over-Sharers?	
67	I like Reddit. It‚Äôs like Instagram but I don‚Äôt have to be social.	
10	Right? I finally got a good discussion going in another sub and after replying to a few, I was like, ‚ÄúI actually... don‚Äôt like this attention. I‚Äôm out.‚Äù Hahah 
6	Instagram is great if you have a relatively put together life and high self esteem/are relatively secure in who you are. If you're someone vulnerable to easily feeling resentment and jealousy like me it can be incredibly toxic. Reddit all the way!
5	Reddit is probably my favorite social media. Easily tailored to my interests (so it's a happy place!), more like the old internet (my mom, your co-workers, & granny from down the road isn't gonna see I like BDSM because I liked a post), and you can get pretty good discussions going that aren't all emojis.
3	but you could be if you wanted? or you could just be the person plotting as they read all the reddit sub reddits .. lol
1	Anonymous social media is the best social media
1	1st coffee date already ruined?	I‚Äôm meeting this girl next week for coffee...\n\nOver the past year I‚Äôve recognized her around town, 2 weeks ago she accepted my facebook request so I sent her an email explaining how I knew of her..\n\nShe replied, told me what she‚Äôs studying in school...\n\nthen I followed up with asking if she wants to get coffee, that it‚Äôs ‚Äúalways nice to meet likeminded people‚Äù.\n\nI personally don‚Äôt know her well enough to decide if she‚Äôs a friend or someone I want to be in a serious relationship with..\n\nDo women usually prefer I don‚Äôt label this anything right from the start?... \nor is it better to clearly say if it‚Äôs\na date or not?\n\nI honestly don‚Äôt know where I stand with her yet...
3	Getting more introverted over the years	The first time I was introduced to MBTI was because of my school. They made me take the test and I got ENFP, didn‚Äôt think much of it. After that I took it a year later and I got INFP but like by a few percentages. Then this year I‚Äôve retaken it multiple times and I‚Äôm like 82% introverted. I know the test can mistype you so I typed myself and I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm an INFP but I‚Äôm still conflicted on the intro versus extro. And yes I have seen the ENFP subreddit and I relate more to this one but I still find common ground. My dads an ENFP and we get along great. I just sometimes start to feel bad because I wonder if it‚Äôs bad that I‚Äôm more introverted now? 
1	Not good at learning languages?	Hello everyone, I'm just wandering if you feel the same.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I really don't like to learn languages, although INFPs should enjoy it. I love poetry and liturature but I hate grammar, I don't like to learn by heart and it is just so boring for me to learn a foreign language (and even my native - not english - grammar).
321	Wanted to share this nugget of loveliness for you INFPs	
6	It's a drop dead gorgeous view, but I keep having that dreadful feeling that I'm about to drop face-first into the water due to the angle of the shot.\n\nIt's probably just me.
3	purdy
3	Dude thats so cool
3	How beautiful
2	where is this??
2	Thank you :)\n
2	I love this! Makes you want to go where the stones take you.
2	Omg, I needed this.
2	Perfect ‚ù§Ô∏è
2	Oooh, a path!
2	This is so beautiful! I love being in nature
1	Ha! It is lovely down here. 
1	üòçüòçüòçüòç
114	Just think about it	
6	every darn time
4	Depression is how your soul processes regret. Anxiety is how your soul processes fear.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn case anyone needed to hear that today.
3	weird... ENFP, why post this in INFP ?\n\nwhy not Post in INTJ too , lets see how it unfolds there
2	Yup, happens to me all the time.
2	i feel too much and then put myself in a bad mood
1	Achtung!
10	Lack compassion but hyper-empathetic???	I think I've hit a tipping point and it feels like it's eating away at my soul. Becoming bitter and resentful. \n\nMy partner is extremely neurotic. Has an anxiety disorder and is susceptible to depressive episodes. There are rational ways in which to go about tolerating it, though as time has passed and after being exposed to it consistently - it's become gradually more overwhelming.\n\nI find that I have to back off completely to feel like 'myself' again. I find myself subconsciously blaming her for how much I feel she's changing me. I feel like a selfish douche for even thinking those thoughts, as though she has control over her disorder.  I'm kinda ceebs going into deeper deets, but has anyone experienced something similar? 
2	I think I've been on both sides of that so yes. 
2	I get this, it‚Äôs kind of hypocritical because I have anxiety and I go thru times of depression. Where I just feel like absolute shite n pretty hopeless. But when it comes to other people I like to listen and be there for them but it comes to a point where I‚Äôm like ‚Äújust cheer up‚Äù knowing that‚Äôs probs the worst kind of thing to think about a depressed person. But when I‚Äôm trying to have a good time n I just feel like someone is sulking just for the sake of it. It can grind ma gears, as you will never feel better if you don‚Äôt try to have a good time n face your fears. Even tho it can be very difficult and uncontrollable at times. 
2	I think it's totally normal and it sounds like [compassion fatigue](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Compassion_fatigue).
11	Why I'm thankful for MBTI	I have a tendency to ramble on, so I'll try to keep this concise.  \n\nFirst, MBTI has allowed me to begin on what I anticipate to be a lifelong journey of self discovery.  Learning about my cognitive functions has helped me understand my uniqueness and the way I think about things.  \n\nSecond, MBTI has allowed me to better understand other people.  Knowing that other people process information differently has allowed me to not question a person's maturity or motivation when we simply see things differently.   It has given me appreciation for people who previously only ticked me off.  It has given me confidence when others berated me for my feelings (thanks INTJs)\n\nOn a side note, all this makes me love music so much more.  It is equally structured/mathematical and feeling/passion.  Music is the great equalizer.   It allows all types to see things in it that appeal to them.  Music is truly beautiful.  \n\nThat is all.  Please discuss.  
1	100% with you on that. It does help explain why people do what they do, and it's helped me tremendously. 
9	Why do my friends fall in love with me	It doesn't matter if the friend is male or female, they always end up falling in love with me. Of course, I love them already, that is a given, because I love everybody. But then I'm put in an impossible position, and I end up losing that friend. \n\nFor instance last night. I'm on the couch with my best friend f/infj (I'm f/infp), we were chilling watching Netflix after an awesome day adventuring. I felt a wave of intense energy that I couldn't understand, being directed at me. My heart starts beating like the clappers, and I turn around and my friend is just full on staring at me with this look. All of a sudden she leans in and starts kissing me. I wasn't expecting it, but from experience I should have. I pushed her away and was still trying to deal with this crazy energy that made me feel high and ill at the same time. \n\nShe folded into herself and said that wasn't the reaction she expected. Then the energy she had sent out came back to her and she had to leave the room bc she felt ill.\n\nWe discussed the situation - I'm already in a committed relationship with m/enfj, which she knew. She said she doesn't want our friendship to end, and she will just keep her impulses suppressed but she can't change how she feels about me. \n\nI was sitting there thinking about my other real close friends and wondered if deep down they feel that way but just haven't acted on it. I thought about each one individually and or recent interactions and times spent with them and my phone started pinging out of the blue with texts coming in. \n\nIt was late and I had to drive home anyway so I left. When I got home I checked my phone and all 3 of my friends had texted me (I'm infp, I don't have many) and I was totally weirded out. Each one had said something about us as friends. "I'm thinking about you" "I miss you" "were we supposed to get together today" messages. What the hell, universe? What's going on? I really don't know what to do with this. 
6	I don't know if people love me, never seen someone show romantic interest to me \n
6	Did you post a particularly fine picture that day that got all of your orbiters thirsting?\n\nHaha, just kidding. That is weird, though. As an INTP, I don't know how to make head-or-tails of that.
4	Same... I can't have friends, they end up secretly or not so secretly being into me! But as karma, I am thwarted from the ones I want >.< 
4	It could be the emotional energy we put out as you mentioned in your post.  \n\nThat in itself is lacking for so many people they just ... crave it.\n\nI am in a weird situation myself wherr my wifes somewhat ex bestfriend may have wanted to emotionally cheat with me.  \n\nSo now Im Cringe alert on max and anti-social thrusters on full-back about it.  I feel for you friend, good luck.
3	I feel you. Although I am full of self-doubt, this happens to me all the time. I once had a talk with one of them and asked him why he fell for me and why my friends in general fall in love with me. He simply said "Because they feel relaxed around you. They know you will not judge them." I have this group of friends and I have been in bed with each and every one of them (I know it sounds strange, but we are all very open minded and it is actually very nice.) There is a number of people still in love with me after years. There are also periods when I attract almost everybody I meet (this is not falling in love though, it is just crazy sexy periods :P ). It's so weird for me, cause I generally dont think high of myself, but it seems people see something in me that I don't.
2	OP are you willing to share what your going to do moving forward about your friend?  
2	This happens ALL the time with me. I've lost friend after friend for this and it's becoming really exhausting. I've lost 3 friends in 2019 to this alone. The crazy shit is most of them knew beforehand that I wasn't interested but tried anyways + made things really uncomfortable. I know this sounds really harsh. I know people can't control their emotions and who they love but all of my opportunities for having healthy friendships are failing because of the "I don't like you in that way - just as a friend" conversation thus ruining the entire emotional dynamic. 
1	Yeah, this happens with many of my male friends, which is why I don‚Äôt have any who I am really close to. Like someone else commented, I think it has a lot to do with that people feel very comfortable around me 
3	Can an INFP be FWB???	I'm a pretty textbook INFP, though I have gotten INFJ on a test before. \n\nI was recently propositioned by a former lover to be "friends with benefits". We have amazing chemistry, and when we were "together" before for about 3 months, there was a very confusing cycle of getting really emotionally close and then him freaking out and backing off quite a bit. I spent a lot of time overthinking this not-even-a-relationship. \n\nWhat I really want is a soul-deep connection with someone who shares my values and can be more stable than that. (That's where my MBTI type comes in.) I don't want to be in a relationship with him again, I know for sure. I am on a couple of dating sites, and I intend to continue to look for what I want. \n\nWe tested the waters, as I was somewhat convinced that our chemistry had a lot to do with our emotional connection, but...we don't have that now, and let's just say it went REALLY WELL. \n\nThis is unchartered territory for me, and I'm wondering how long I'll last before I decide it's too much of a stretch for my moral compass. How many interactions can we have where I refrain from asking deep, probing questions and ruin the whole thing anyway? üòÇ That being said, I'm sort of proud of the small number of sexual partners I've had in my life, so that makes this FWB situation more attractive to me.\n\nWhat do y'all think? Would you be able to do it?
3	Mhhh dunno. IME someone ends up catching feelings in this sort of arrangement. And personally I would not do it with an ex but if you feel like you can do it then go ahead haha.
3	I've done it successfully.  It worked for me because I genuinely wasn't interested in a real relationship with the person and knew I never would be, and I also knew that I was moving so there was an end date to it.  But I feel like I'm very unique as a woman and as an INFP in that (before right now, I'm currently in a committed long term relationship with someone I live with lol) I have been really happy to exist single and exploring multiple people at a time and not wanting to commit for periods of time too.  So it really just depends, and being true to yourself and how you feel is really important but knowing your boundaries and how your heart will feel in the long run too.  
2	Yes, an info can fwb but in my opinion it depends more on your attachment style than personality. For example, I'm avoidant attachment with a lingering childhood attachment disorder - where too much emotional intimacy repels me, safe relationships = sabotage.  Fwb is a comfortable way to dabble in sexuality and intimacy without pushing me out of my comfort level. It's a way to practice intimacy. It's not easy. No type of relationship is easy , however. Individuals with healthy secure attachments might not be good candidates for fwb relationships.
1	Yes, it's 100% possible but it is usually a surprise like a one night stand that ends up being a really good sexual companion. It can't start off as friends or wanting to be in a relationship and then grow into FWB. That is a disaster waiting to happen. \n\nI am in an emotional drought so FWB is fine with me at this point in time. No commitments. No hurt feelings. This is coming from an INFP girl, shocking I know. \n\nIt depends on where you are emotionally and the other party. As long as you're willing to communicate fully, it should be fine. 
3	Suspected INFP WITH A CRUSH	I would love your advice. \n\nRecently, I've been stuck in a situation where I think my crush both likes me and is an INFP. I've been exposed to quite alot of INFPs and I understand the specific vibe they give off, so I'm convinced my crush is an INFP. \n\nMoving on to thier behaviour: \n\n1) Awkward silences- Used to be quite chatty and then suddenly became quite awkward in convo. Don't know if its because they genuinely are not intrested in talking to me or .... Convo with them seem more awkward than usual. \n\n2) Staring- began catching my INFP staring at me at odd times. Usually, when I was alone, the staring would be more pronounced. While, this has slightly decreased recently, it is still a thing that I notice they do. I may also be imagining this but the infp looks at me in a certain type of way, that  feels intense. But i may be projecting.\n\n3) Mirroring - INFP mirrors my behaviour quite alot.  Infp copies the way I greet, if I make an facial reactions, will imitate that and so on. \n\n4) Greets me quite alot but does no attempt to make conversation and go out of thier way to be my friend.  \n\n
5	Maybey Throw hints... talk about a made up "friend" you know that has a crush on someone.  And ask if he can help you with the details or give you insight about it.  His replies will be very telling. \n\nThis way you can at least get a better understanding of how he sees the topic of crushing to give you more clarity without it being directly about him and you can maintain the status quo.
3	It's possible he lilkes you. Did he tries to helpyou more than others ? Did he compliments you when he can ? 
3	Kinda relates to this,I tried to remain normal and refrained from getting a crush on someone but damn ,got helpless against her charm and began to show that behaviorüò¢
3	Maybe you could...\n\n*~~Drumroll!~~*\n\nJust ask, he's your crush, right? Quickest way to get an answer to your question is to just ask him out when the two of you share a private moment together. You'll know quite quickly if he likes you back or not, I can guarentee that.
26	Imagine having someone to really connect with	
22	Avoid keeping that connection in your imagination. Connect with the actual person before you,  not the fantasy version in your head. \n\nIt might not be what you wish, but it's real.\n\n
7	The benefits of a great imagination 
3	If people don‚Äôt want to connect with you, is it a connect-shun?
2	Funny joke
2	Do other INFP's never find people they really and truly connect with? I personally have usually had at least one person at a time who I truly connected to, and all my close relationships tend to be very intense. Right now I don't really have this due to moving recently and then getting really sick after moving, and it makes me very sad and alone not to. And I do usually feel misunderstood and alone on some level.
2	I am a 25 year old female and I have been with 35 people (mostly men but also some women). I have connected with few of them in different levels. But there was one, that made me feel like I was in touch with another dimension. I can't even put in words how I felt when I was with him. If he touched me anywhere, I would feel a huge wave of warmth and energy flowing through me. Sex was like being in touch with the universe's deepest mysteries. I closed my eyes and I would forget where I was. Those were hours of absolute calmness and gratitude. I felt complete. We were together for a short period and then it didn't work out. I am still searching for a connection like that, but it seems it happens one in a million and I probably should feel lucky I have experienced it.
4	Intimacy is terrifying so I'll pass on that for now
1	Oh. Connect as in share your deepest thoughts with and them reciprocate with a conversation that flows? Yeah, dreamy. 
1	it will happen when u allow yourself to ground your imagination in reality! allow people to be imperfect and connect through your admiration of how they overcome their flaws, how they relate to you. your imaginary person u wish to connect with is out there, you just have to meet them halfway!!!! good luck !!! :)) 
0	Ha! I only connect with people not-interested in me (romantically)
10	For my fellow dreamers	You must not come to the dark conclusion that everything in the world is hard, false, and wicked. The forest likes you. In its company you will find health and good spirits again, and entertain more lofty and beautiful thoughts.
3	INFP's believe the world is dark and wicked? I went through this phase when I was younger, but now I love just about everyone in the world.
1	Which forest are you referring to? Definitely not any wild forest in Canada. They hate us with a passion. Humans are a scourge to them, chopping down vast swathes of forest to clean tar sands for oil, polluting the groundwater they drink with the tailings. \nBut can we do anything to stop it? No. So we love and live and look for beauty and share knowledge and spread peace. 
2	I don't know how to 'just stop'. (Any and all advice welcome!)	Completely new to this, so I'm sorry if there have been lots of posts about this before! But whatever I'm doing I just can't seem to stop: thinking, feeling, doing, thinking of doing and thinking and feeling and how I feel about everything in all that I do. \n\nI recently entered my therapy masters and whilst I'm enjoying it immensely, it consumes a lot of my emotional energy. I also work in the care sector for teenagers and also mentally ill adults, so this contributes. But I couldn't see myself enjoying any other line of work authentically. My partner also has mental health problems and I a history of depression in my teens, and I am trying to be there and sensitive to them as much as possible. But it all becomes too much sometimes and then I am told I am not doing enough to support their emotional needs. \n\nI've been told that I'm an empath and I do believe that, but I am finding all of these emotional demands upon me very difficult to manage and any alone time I manage to grasp I almost don't know what to do with myself. And I then feel selfish for any time spent on myself. \n\nThere is no time to stop, and even when there is, there are things in the household that need to be done, or problems in the family to sort out. And if I don't help with these I am lazy or being self-centred. \n\nAre there any infps out there with similar issues? Or any people that could give any insight over what I can do in this situation? \n\n
1	Meditate. Its boring but the aim of Meditation is to find peace between Emotions. At the start you are not used to it and dont value it. \nIf you get used to it, it is like entering a room in the clouds, without any sounds. Just Silence.
1	I‚Äôm not sure if this is an INFx thing, but I‚Äôm sure this is common among a few other types as well.\n\nSelf-care is pretty important to help you de-stress, unwind and recharge. You‚Äôre taking on a lot. It would seem like a lot of people are unloading their emotional baggage on to you, but how do you unload all of that? Are you able to talk to your partner about it? Or a trusted friend? Do you have a therapist? Would you ever consider it? \n\nLike another commentator mentioned, meditation might help you to just observe your emotions, but not let them overwhelm you. If this seems a bit woo-woo, I would just give it a shot for 10 days and see how you feel. Try the free trial of the Headspace app!\n\nIn terms of feeling over extended, I feel like that‚Äôs something a lot of healthcare professionals and mothers would relate to. I know I have.  It‚Äôs even more important to care for yourself, and to learn not to feel guilty about it. Sometimes you have to take care of yourself to better be able to take care of other people. \n\nWhen you‚Äôre on an airplane, there‚Äôs a reason you‚Äôre told to put the oxygen mask on yourself before anyone else.\n\nIt‚Äôs important to recognize when/ if things are getting overwhelming and do something, before things spiral into depression or anxiety. When things get to be a bit much, I learned to deal with it by: exercising (20 minutes of cardio clears my head), getting enough sleep, taking a long, hot shower, having some skincare/ soothing ritual, doing something to take my mind off things like seeing a movie or catching up with friends, going to the bookstore, the museum, a trip somewhere else, cooking myself a nice meal, enjoying a luxurious coffee, and listening to music. \n\nHope some of that was helpful!\n
1	Are you guys always sure about what you‚Äôre feeling? Or is that more an INFJ thing?	
6	I cant speak for all INFP's, but for me yes. I'm always quite sure about what the emotions I'm having are. I know quite well I'm experiencing happiness, sadness, or anger when I feel it (and man do I feel it). Now knowing WHY I feel these emotions and what causes them is a different matter. It's often hard to rationalize something as irrational as emotions, especially if the emotion seems misplaced or inappropriate for what you should be feeling. That I struggle with. 
1	For the record, most of us INFJ's almost never know what we're feeling until it runs us over like a freight train üëç 
1	I pay attention to my feelings but I don‚Äôt always know what they are. If you asked me to describe my current state of feeling I‚Äôd struggle to come up with a word. It‚Äôs like... I know that it‚Äôs there until I look directly at it, and then it‚Äôs gone. Unless it was a strong emotion, and then I know what it is. But if it‚Äôs just everyday, nothing much is happening right now, then no.\n\nI also have no idea what my opinions are half the time and end up with conflicting ones.
14	Anyone else with ADHD here?	I feel like a lot of the qualities described as being typical of INFPs are also symptoms of ADHD, which leads me to wonder how many others there are of our MB type that also have ADHD like myself.
3	I have ADD. Not really treated though.
3	yeah inattentive type. its also scientifically proven that INFPs have a higher prevalence of ADHD. not surprising haha.
1	Yep. Inattentive type.
1	I have ADHD, as well but I think the attention deficient part is more prominent due to the thinking part of the personality
1	Yep, I‚Äôve got ADD. I‚Äôm sure a lot of us have it.
1	Yep. 
1	ADD here too
1	Yep, ADHD, along with a lot of the rest of my family
5	This Was Taken By My Old Elemantry School, I Thought You Guys Might Like It... „ÉÑ	
1	So there was this mattress beside the school? Hmmmm not suspicious at all.
12	is this frowned upon?	is it frowned upon to be 30 and still living in the town you grew up in,\nstill living under your parents?\n\nam i seen as less competent?\n\ni work, but it‚Äôs nothing substantial at the moment... I‚Äôve just lived an unconventional life.
9	This is more common than you think, there's a lot of 30 year olds out there crippled by their student loans living at home because of slow income growth in their new careers.
4	I'm in the same boat as you my friend
2	frowned upon by who? Other people? \nIt doesn't matter what other people think in your life they're extras \n\n\nHow has your life been unconventional?
2	My honest thoughts are 15-20 years ago yeah, that would be kinda like... what's up with that.  But right now look how shit everything is, you know what I mean?  Our generation got super screwed, so don't feel bad about it.  The only reason I'm living 'on my own' is cause I'm with my partner and he makes a lot more than I do :( I can barely financially survive independently.  Most people our age can't.  We just got fucked over by the system and it wasn't our fault.  I was pushed to go to college and told the debts would be easy to pay off and promised there'd be jobs out there..... but I've been underemployed since graduating and haven't been able to start paying off my loans.  Rent, food, healthcare.... if you can eliminate some of that by living at home why wouldn't you?
1	It's common, but not super healthy IMO. I think it's important for INFPs to strike out on their own.
1	Snap. It‚Äôs probably frowned upon by most people but I‚Äôm proud thus far I haven‚Äôt lived a conventional life. I‚Äôve lived in my country‚Äôs capital city twice, lived abroad for a year and a half stint, lived with long-term partners, worked various jobs, acquired a cat and I‚Äôm 26. None of these are monumental accomplishments per se and I‚Äôve found myself living with my parents in my hometown which I have hated for so long for four months now. \n\nI was deeply ashamed to be in this situation. But I accepted the situation as part of my life. I‚Äôm starting to appreciate the area and know based on my past experiences this is NOT permanent. So, rather than preoccupying your thoughts with what others think, focus on you. Don‚Äôt associate negativity with your circumstances and the rest will flow. \n
2	INFPs at Festivals?	I‚Äôve agreed to go to a music festival with 2 friends this summer, but I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs for me. Have any of you ever gone to one? Please share your experiences! \n\nI‚Äôm exited to see different bands/artists play and to be free for a few days to just wander around and explore. But the idea of being surrounded by a big number of people for 3 days and 3 nights straight makes me feel anxious. I can‚Äôt quite picture sleeping in a tent surrounded by people drunk/on drugs for three nights. It seems overwhelming? I quite like to be in those situations, it is exiting but I also like to get away from them and go home lol. \n\n\nFor you Brits, the festival is Y Not, I‚Äôd rather go to something like Green Man but it‚Äôs way more expensive. Y Not is very indie/alternative rock focused, which is fine, I like a lot of the bands that are playing. But it doesn‚Äôt seem to have the chill/more folky vibes of other festivals. \n
2	I've usually found festivals to be a little bit overwhelming, but I think you should be okay if you're with trusted friends. Enjoy :)
3	Emotional rollercoaster or a steady comfort? Which life would you pick?	Do you think most INFP‚Äôs would rather live a passionate life full of intoxicating highs and crippling lows or a more steady, predictable life?\n\nThoughts?
5	Infp definitely craves passion and excitement, but not in a Se way. Se is all about direct experience, straightfoward and "feels good". \n\nWhereas what I crave is more creative, otherworldly, unimaginable. Ideas, possibilities, art, new ways to live, new planets, new concepts etc. And Fi needs A LOT of intensity to feel good. Most of us are self destructive, because our Fi is not being stimulated enough.  
4	I for one would much rather highs and lows.  The good times make it all worth it.  I find that I remember the highs long after I forget the lows. \n\nThat being said, I prefer manageable lows.  
2	One hundred percent high highs and low lows. The steady, predictable life would be a low in itself to me, and at least with the other one I get highs as well
2	Fuck. I would choose comfort. My life has been filled with highs and lows but mostly lows. I just want something to anchor myself to. I want some stability. I don't want to constantly feel like the carpet is being pulled from under my feet. 
5	Hating social media and tinder/bumble/etc. makes dating tough for a 30-something, working INFP	I got rid of facebook a year ago and it was one of the best decisions I've ever made. Got rid of tinder and okcupid too. Got rid of pretty much everything except reddit. I thought it was just socializing, but it negatively effected my life so drastically and I immediately noticed the improvement once it was gone. The dating apps just never went anywhere and felt like homework assignments from hell.\n\nThat being said, I have a problem some of you probably identify with. I hate the "infancy" phase of almost any type of relationship. I hate the build-up to being friends with someone. I hate introducing myself to people in the wild. Flirting is a lot of fun, but I hate the first/second/third date phase of the dating scene, too. Its especially disappointing when its like the last guy I saw, where the first date was incredible and it went downhill fast (he was really clingy and it kinda freaked me out. Like, showing up to my house unannounced after the second date clingy). I also am WAY too tired to go do anything after work, and sometimes even on weekends with how high-stress my job can be. Its gotten to the point that I'm considering proposing 4/10s to my bosses instead of 5/8s to artificially give myself more time to get introvert recharging done.\n\nCan any older INFPs, or heck even younger INFPs, identify with this? Do I sound kinda petty/lazy at all or does what I'm saying make sense?
6	Oh my... I tell you, if we knew the solution, we probably would be here! (JK, we‚Äôre INFP, we‚Äôd still be here for the chat üòÖ) \nI have the exact same problem. \nI have no time to date,  I can‚Äôt stand the small talk, and I use my weekends to recharge my introvert batteries ready for another week at work. \nThe reality is, you‚Äôve gotta go through those few few months in a relationship to get to the good part. \nFor myself, I‚Äôve been single coming up three years now. The dating I have done hasn‚Äôt worked out because either I‚Äôve appeared too disinterested in the other person or I‚Äôve held back because I didn‚Äôt want to get hurt. I‚Äôve taken to being up front and saying: look, I hate small talk but I take a long time to get to know properly so if you‚Äôre not interested in hanging around to navigate that then l‚Äôm not the person for you. \n\n\nI do try to meet people by *gasp* going out with a friend to meet up with others. Generally I don‚Äôt want to, but it does get harder to meet people to older you get. \nWhen you figure out how to meet people, let me know üòÖ
4	I can relate to this so much.  I feel ready to try and find some sort of relationship but really have no clue.  Sorry I can‚Äôt help but I would love to follow just to see some of the replies 
3	Ugh I had same issue. 30f. \n\nI would make myself do at least a couple social things I liked. I used the app Meetup, to find like minded people. \n\nI thought I would probably have to meet someone in "the line of duty" , eg: volunteering, non-profit work, etc.\n\nEnded up reconnecting with someone online via a dating site specifically for non-profit religious workers. Lmao what a weird way, but wow hes amazing.\n\nI hated bumble/cmb/hinge because finding someone who was not just horribly boring/unaware/30-something-fuckboys seemed like a joke. A sick joke I tell you.\n\nIf I hadn't met my current bf the way I did, I honestly would have no idea. I would just continue to throw myself into the lifestyle I love and pray to meet someone equally as passionate or interested in it.\n\nBest of luck to you!!! Maybe you'll find him doing the same things you love\n
6	Internal monologues	Ever have those moments where you realize you experience the world differently than others? I had one of those recently, and am interested if any of you have either heard of or can relate to this.\n\nMost people have an internal monologue. A song can be playing inside your head, or a thought is mentally "spoken" via your inner voice (as a side note, "The phenomena of inner experience" is a really interesting paper about how the inner voice differs too!).\n\nAfter talking with a few different people about it, I found out that it's not normal to have multiple inner monologues going on simultaneously. I can, for example, play a song and have a voice talk about the song and have a different voice talk about how I'm talking about the song, so that I have three distinct thoughts being expressed at the same time. This isn't going on all the time-consuming I usually only have one going on. Three and above takes concerted effort. Everyone I've talked to can only do one, while I've gone to the 5th degree (I can't sustain it long, but I have been able to do it a couple times).\n\nHow are your inner experiences?
3	For me I usually have a song going through my head almost all the time and a random unrelated inner monologue that jumps from subject to subject, and I'm also picturing something in mind that is either related to the song or the monologue. I have to picture things in my mind consistently to help me retain information, it's kind of like a never ending movie that would make very little sense to anyone else. 
2	Idk about simultaneously, but a sometimes my internal monologue ends up being a conversation between about 4 voices, 3 different opinions and one asking the questions in the first place. This is usually something I can only do when I'm laying in my bed, or generally by myself. I also notice that occasionally one of them is "louder" than the others and I sometimes end up mouthing or whispering whatever they're "yelling". They do sometimes overlap but usually I'm careful not to, so that its easier for me to understand.
1	I think very visually so typically I will have one monologue that expresses how I feel, asks questions, etc, and anything else that's associated with what I'm thinking about or that happens to be weighing on my conscious will express itself in images and colors and shapes.\n\nFor example as I'm trying to think of how to word this post I am saying the words in my head and I also have a visual of myself sitting in a room alone deep in thought (I guess cause I'm analyzing my thought process), an image of what I imagine OP to look like (cartoon lady with blonde hair), as well as detailed images of fish and my neighbors because I'm also listening to the conversation between my brother and my mom going on right now about my neighbor's aquarium, etc. As I choose my words each one has a color and shape that expresses it's weight and meaning. If I decide I don't like a sentence or I am unsure about it, it will respond visually by rearranging itself in my head or it will stuff itself in a box (like literally the words will be stuffed in a cardboard box and shoved into the corner of my mind's attic) to be held onto while I think of other colors and shapes (words and phrases) that will match better.\n\nBut to simply answer the question I typically only have one monologue in my head at one time. I could easily conjure up an imaginary shouting match between multiple people if I try, but it would be unclear and dream like, with voices speaking but not coherently.

21	20yo male INFP- A talk about life and society	I always feel like I‚Äôm constantly ignored. Like people aren‚Äôt listening to what I‚Äôm saying or that they‚Äôre trying not to pay attention to me. Is it because I don‚Äôt talk a lot? Am I boring? I always feel like I‚Äôm in this mental competition to try to present myself as a ‚Äúman‚Äù so I get more respect, since I was the victim to homophobic and sexist bullying. And of course, for being a shy, quiet, virgin. I even sometimes feel like people are watching me as well.  Like if I don‚Äôt belong, or if I‚Äôm some sort of odd creature. I‚Äôve always wondered if it is because I am black or because there is something inherent about me or my INFPness, and I want to know if these feelings and experiences are common. \n\nI also am tired of this consumerist/capitalist society. It seems that all people talk about is brands, corporations, money, and capitalist industry sometimes. We treat each other like commodities and only view each other in the lease of a commodity. Everyone‚Äôs willing to step on someone else for a couple dollars. Society worships these ultra billionaires and people with money, failing to realize that they‚Äôre just wealth hoarders and that they receive no benefit, and for the most part, it‚Äôs impossible to be like them.  My mom was watching Million Dollar Listing-LA the other day and all she could do talk about how much money they were making and had, and it was odd to watch. She herself, isn‚Äôt entirely doing the best, psychologically wise, either. \n\nI just want people to connect beyond market value, and to be more in touch with their emotions and the nature that surrounds them. Capitalist industry doesn‚Äôt care about anyone, we need to stop letting it control our lives. Meditation and connecting with nature and a ‚Äúforce‚Äù is important. A people‚Äôs revolution is important. Charity and kindness is important. Love is important. \n\nI also am sorry if I sound /r/iamverysmart but I feel like an alien on this world, observing its behavior. People are so bizarre in a way that‚Äôs odd and I don‚Äôt know. Does anyone else get these feelings? Can we discuss? I‚Äôd love to hear other thoughts and opinions. \n\n
7	I can relate an awful lot to what you're saying. I don't like having to act manly, that's not the fun kind of acting. I feel so out of place around stereotypical guys, or like I'm being judged or sized-up as competition and it's so petty.\nAnd I hate the way life is degraded by capitalism. It seems like a lot of people are really just concerned with chasing the next hot thing, the one commodity that's going to make their life better and more convenient even though none of the past ones have - people are just as miserable as before we had kuerigs, smartphones, and 4k tvs.\n\nFind people who don't care about that stuff. They exist... somewhere. People who value real relationships and real life, who don't judge you according to how well you fit one or another stereotype.\n\nIt's not just you, it *is* society. You're not crazy, you're very sane for feeling the way that you do. Us being made feel weak, powerless, and alien is one of the ways the status quo maintains itself. This is especially true with regards to mental health, which is always treated as a personal issue lest we critique the society we inhabit.
3	Sorry I dont have time to read it all. \n\nYou're always going to feel like an outsider. People will never live in your world. I am a 23 year old Male and my only advice to you would be to try an lower your expectations. \n\nIf you are setting the bar super high then others will never live up to that. Try to work on your extraverted feeling, its tough but is helpful if you want others to come to you. 
1	Thank you for sharing your story. I have some advice if you want. If not please ignore the rest.\n\n1) If people ignore your words, it may just mean they are inconsiderate and not that you are uninteresting. If your speaking presentation _is_ something you want to improve though, there are probably materials online you can research to improve it. There is nothing wrong to want to strengthen your weak points.\n\n2) It makes sense to not want to surround yourself around materialistic people. It may be you just need to find your tribe. There are a lot of selfless people out there that are into volunteering, advocacy, bettering the community, nonprofit work, etc. There will of course be greedy people out there, but there are selfless people too. I think it is important to realize that everyone has different values and their values are going to likely differ from yours, but we all have our purpose on this planet, even the money obsesses ones. What is important is we each follow our own path and fulfill our own purpose in this world.
1	I will tell you something, i am too busting my head because of those things but kinda now as im going trough some rough times i understood that you cant show others what you mean, me, you anyone, if they dont want to understand it, if something is deeply rooted in them.  \nSo the best option is for you to be healthy and understand yourself and your needs, yes, you might feel lonely and like an alien at times, but hell..that is life.  \nI have spent 4 months a time without talk with human being, except that talk with cashier - "Thank you, bye."  \nAnd also, people just love ideas of each other now, some kind of image they made in their heads that shows someone that shits gold and can fly probably. So as i think about you now and things you wrote, the fact how much i find myself in them, maybe my good man, this world wasnt made for everyone and it needs people who will change the pattern, who will be aliens and observers
1	As an INFP i agree with these all. Yesterday, i shared a topic(not here) about the feeling stranger to this system. Alienlike feeling. "Even I'm trying to adapt every environment, I do not belong none of all. This feeling is becoming bigger and stronger, every each day. I think, I'm an alien in this cruel world."

22	I just want a INFP best friend who I understand and also understands me	I actually have no friends besides my boyfriend and the friends that I do have are actually just acquaintances who I can‚Äôt hold a conversation with for more than 5 minutes. Help\n\nEdit: having no friends is hurting me and it‚Äôs making me become shamefully dependent on my boyfriend to the point where I do nothing I wait for him to start doing anything about myself and my life. I feel bad for him and I know it‚Äôs an unattractive look but it‚Äôs just so hard to make real friends..
7	I think we INFPs are much pickier than the average person when it comes to friendship. Many people, especially the extroverts I know, consider anyone they've known for more than 5 minutes to be a friend. We seem to be satisfied if we can have 1 or 2 real friends, although other people think we're too reclusive.\n\nWhat about your boyfriend? Is he also BFF material? What about other family members? I think some of us forget that we can be friends with the people we love. My husband (INTJ) is my best friend, I'm his best friend, and we've decided that the world will never understand our relationship. I'm also best friends with my mother and father (I grew up an only child), which some people find really bizarre. \n\nI went through long patches where I had no real friends, aside from my parents, and you just can't have certain conversations with your parents. It's tough. Keep looking, and eventually you'll find someone who's been looking just as hard for someone like you.\n\n&#x200B;
5	Just wanted to say, I feel for ya. I've been spoiled. I've been friends with the same guy since kindergarten whose also an INFP. We're 25 now and still live down the street from each other. We hangout, and record music, and write sketches. It's basically awesome. \n\nAlthough, unlike you, I've never been in a long term relationship with anyone. It's just never worked out. I envy you in that regard and understand your search for meaningful friendship/relationship. \n\nMeeting new people is hard. Do you think it's possible you have a good friend, but they simply don't meet your expectation for what a friend should be? \n\nI know in my life, I've had to dial it down a bit when it comes making new friends. For instance, I talk to the same guy everyday at work about all parts of our life. It feels like we're good friends, but some days he's in a bad mood, or has something going on in his personal life and just blows me off, doesn't even look at me, which at first hurt, but then I realized that's life. That's what our friendship is. We're just two guys who work together and shoot the shit sometimes on our breaks. If all we ever do is shoot the shit on our breaks, I'm grateful to have that experience and share life with him in that way. \n\nIt's unrealistic for me to think that we're really good friends who are gonna hangout outside of work and go on adventures. You know what I mean? \n\nDo you have any siblings you're close to? They'd probably be your best bet for instant friendship, but something tells me if you did you wouldn't have made this post. \n\nWhat do you mean by "real friends"? What makes someone a real friend to you? \n\nI think a good place to start would be more honest with the "friends" you currently have. It's amazing what happens when you make yourself vulnerable. Tell them you consider them a good friend. Ask about group dates with them and their SO and your boyfriend. \n\nI don't know man. It's hard and if there was any easy answer you wouldn't have to ask in the first place. 
3	Would it be a wild idea to suggest we make a discord server for us INFPs, get to know one another, chat adventures, and be friends?\n\nDoes one already exist?
3	We live in the age of information. You more than likely don't have friends because you haven't developed the tools yet to overcome typical INFP social issues. All of that can be eliminated. You have to want it. I went from years of depression to riveting with happiness every day I wake up. Starting researching how to overcome these weaknesses. I guarantee you it can be done. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm under the impression that INFPs can be the most charismatic people on this planet. We are gifted caretakers. We can provide warmth like no other. All we have to do is bust down anxiety and develop confidence. I do that daily. Each day it gets better and i'm more than ever hopeful for the future. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBe the person you want to be. You can do it.
3	why is everyone telling their p.o.v. lol let's be friends instead hello
2	I feel you. I have my boyfriend, who I live with, and one "best friend", I guess you could say. Weve been friends forever, but I dont feel a deep authentic connection with her because shes very facebook fake. As in, complaining about her other friends and then posting loads of selfies on Facebook with #blessed and #besties. I absolutely hate that, and it makes me wonder if she also talks about me behind my back. Im not friends with any of her other friends. I do have a couple of friends, from elementary school and work who i can go nearly a year without talking to, so they are mostly cool people i just know. Ive disabled my facebook app and dont do any other social media besides reddit and good reads, so its mainly my wonderful bf and my dog. I do talk to my sister occasionally, but shes a mom and too infp hermitty herself. 
2	I have 3 real friends irl who I really like and thats it. I got some casual friends who I can talk to though. But 3 friends is enough for me :)
4	Does something need to be observed to exist?	What counts as an observer?\n\nWhat counts as existing?\n\nAnd before this is brought up please know that the double slit experiment can run autonomously.
2	Hmm. The term "exist" seems a bit foggy, but if it were to be defined, it would be defined within our subjective experience or our little bubble.  And what is called "objective" could be like the consensus between subjective points or bubbles. But, the bedrock could be consciousness as opposed to this objective reality construct that exists outside of us. \n\nI mean, I understand that view, in some sense. Like, when we talk about whether or not something is happening in our experience eg. seeing a red ball, we're imagining it within our consciousness / awareness or whatever you want to call it. But in, like, the absence of such, nothing can be said (but I'm assuming such through being in bubble of consciousness), because there is no sayer at that moment that is aware of said things. And the degrees in-between after some level, we have things like hypnagogia and hallucinatory experiences, which could be like a state of uncertainty / wavering or calibrating of consciousness at some level. And right when consciousness / awareness / whatever is regained at a level  after a lapse in ourselves, it snaps back, giving us what appears to be continuity between the lapses via memory. \n\nAnd if someone were to tinker with our consciousness which some will say originate within the human brain (but the brain is within our consciousness as per mention) or some other similar structure, we, the "tinkered" won't be able to say anything regarding it as that consciousness point has been blotched out, but it's like happening through consciousness of said person doing the tinkering, but the person doing the tinkering, if tinkered too, will end up like the person they previously tinkered which is all within my consciousness at this moment of typing this, and like, whoever reads this will be adding an expanding bubble container of consciousness to contain everything else said in this scenario, and continual expansion following that beyond that point.  \n\nIt seems all interlaced in this consciousness interface, and without it, it does seem like "nothing", but, it's like an undetermined state of sorts. \n\nI used to think that what we observe was independent from us, but it just seems to go down the road of nonduality or something, which leads to a doubt or questioning of the self itself. But if that were the case, like, would there even be a "subjective", as it must be contrasted with something for it to be (in this case the "objective"); which bleeds into this idea of everything being "one" and all is consciousness or something. \n\nI actually want to churn my way through this, for this has been on my mind for quite a while as well. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
2	Does anyone actually believe that they'll survive getting hit by a train if they don't look at it?
1	I believe that anything that exists it is because it IS, regardless of whether it is observed or not.  
1	I do.
7	Validation seeking	Went on a trip to [the nearest seashore to my home.. a 300 km trip](https://i.imgur.com/WDj1anx.jpg).. on my own.. just to think clearly and kinda look at the sea and breathe its air.. never took a trip on my own. Also good thing is I forgot my headphones, also tried not to look at facebook, failed a couple of times.. but tried to isolate myself and just think.\n\nI think a good part of my anxiety, self hate & doubt, lack of confidence, chronic procrastination etc. Come from me trying to seek validation constantly.\n\nI cannot think of a time I wasn't seeking validation and trying to get accepted and be loved. As long as I remember, I have always been trying.. I've always been "smart" but never did well at school, not my grades I always had very good grades, but performance throughout the year, I've *always* passed my years by studying literally at the last possible time before exams, always did well, went to engineering college, never been able to make friends or socialize, hated it.. spent 7 years failing in it (I'm foreign, things may seem different to you because of that), now I'm dropping out and going to literature school.\n\nAll these years, I've been trying to prove to my dad that I worth any thing, he is always disappointed :'( here in my country not being college educated is like being a second class citizen, ok I've never wanted engineering, I always showed interest in art, design, animation, but never engineering!\n\nNow I work in an animation company, as an animator, I've always wanted this and thank god, it's happening, but I am struggling to enjoy it.\n\nThe trauma of being constantly talked down to, by your own parents, being in always fighting state, when we are not fighting, they are just trying to be nice to convince me to go to college, btw Ive always tried, but never succeeded to attend and study. This trauma has shaped me into what I'm now, self loathing person with zero confidence.\n\nAlthough I'm pretty good at my job, It've been 8 months since I started and my directors love me and my work and are friends with me and everything is great, I'm learning, I bought my first car, started losing weight, started to go swimming again. But again, I'm still depressed as fuck, I'm not doing half what I can do, I sleep too much, rarely talk to my family, which is also very depressing.\n\nMy parents love me, I *know* that, they always tell me that, their compassion is very clear, their motives are understandable, they've given up already about the college thing and what not. But the damage has happened already.\n\nLast straw that made me feel like there is something that needs to change, this girl at work that I liked, actually I still like her, I can't stop thinking about her, I see her everywhere while walking in the street as if I'm following here. I just asked her out couple of weeks ago, she said no, I thought she gave me enough hints, I trusted my guts but my guts failed me, she was a month away from a break up just before marriage when I asked her out, but I think she said no firmly and clearly and mentioned how I'm a good person and friend, so it's not an impulsive no, and it's not a "I'm not searching for relationships now" no, it's a no to me.. for the first time in my life I started to feel ugly, started to be hyper aware of my humor, my actions and behaviour, feel like I need to be more desirable to ask anyone else..\n\n\nI think she's very smart, I think she saw how insecure and non-confident I am, and she thought this would not be a healthy relationship. Good for her actually.\n\nAny way, I think it's time to stop seeking validation, I'm who I am, with the good and the bad, my parents did what they could for me and that's more than enough I'm grateful, I'm sorry they're disappointed, but I can't do anything about that.. so it is what it is..\n\nSorry for the wall of text, just needed to vent.
1	I feel ya, *hugs* oh how i can relate
24	For those who struggle with life/deppression	Life is a game on time. Just wait til the end. \nDont die before you are dead. Its just a matter of time. I made an interesting experience when i was 18. I went hiking for 2 months and it is possible to live with 3/4 Euros a day, even less because you can ask in churches and monastries for food. You dont need money overall, just ask and you will get, not everytime but often. Maybe just a piece of bread and a bit water but its enough to survive. Only what you need is a sleepingbag a bagback, and maybe a tent against rain. And if you have those things you can, if you cant wear your life anymore just escape. The possibility to do this gives me alot of freedom in life. And if you need some timeout, a monastry is an option.
6	What kind of things do you find yourself pondering from time to time?	The first things that come to my mind are:\n\n1. What would have happened if my parents had never met? Would you still be born the same way you are, just with different parents or would you just not exist? \n\n2. Do we have free will? .. Do we make our choices or do our choices make us?\n\n3. I wonder what would have happened if I never quit playing high school football. I started first string and I knew guys who played second and third string that went on to get full-rides to Div. 3 schools. How my life would have been if I kept playing and went to college right out of high school, instead of waiting till I was 25. \n\n4. What would have happened if I never started drinking? I drank everyday for four years, made some really fucking dumb decisions but I haven't had a drink in over 526 days and I'm so grateful for being able to overcome that obstacle. \n\nIt seems like every two months or so, I'll be at work trying to focus and out of nowhere those thoughts will kinda pop into my head and distract me. It use to frustrate me sometimes, but I just learned that if I think of the words to a song in my head or better yet, actually hum it or sing it out loud. It gives me something kinda fun to think about and doesn't allow my mind to focus on those obtrusive thoughts. I thought of the words to a song, about getting through the day at work. I'll leave you on this note, the song is titled, "Jackshit". \n\nVerse one.\n\nI'm feeling down about this ten hour shift\nBecause my boss is a dick\nand I make jackshit. \n\nBut I'm trying to be positive \nSo I wrote this song\nAnd it goes like this\n\nChorus\n\nIt's alright!!!\nIt's OK!!!\nWe're gonna get through this shift\nAnd have a great day \n\nIt's alright!!!\nIt's OK!!!\nWe're gonna get through this shift\nAnd have a great day\nIt's alright!!!\nIt's OK!!!\nWe're gonna get through this shift\nAnd have a great day\n\nBridge. \n\nBecause even though there's 6 hours left on the clock\nSoooooon yoooouuu'llll beee hoooome.\nWearing nothing but your socks.\n \n\nI hope you read it like I how I intend to say it. If there's a lot of "o's" it just means you say it longer. \n\n
3	Is it fine to dream?\n\nWhy can't I let go?
2	What would have happened if I had done x instead of y\n\nWho my soulmate is/what he‚Äôs like\n\nWhether I really am an INFP\n\nWhat happens when we die\n\nWhether my life is real or whether I signed up to be in an experiment that involves me being in a simulation and not knowing about it (see I worked it out, I‚Äôm on to you)\n\nWho I am\n\nThe list goes on...
2	\- Future of our species and civilization as well as the future of life in this universe. \n\n\- Whether or not we'll make it via the virtual exodus\n\n\-  Like, how the heck did we arise as a species, and if there will be any other similarly conscious life-form we can compare ourselves to. \n\n\- The nature of "paranormal" stuff if it actually happens in the first place\n\n\- How we're stuck in the human box of thoughts, and whether or not we can actually change that\n\n\- Stuff about the ancient past in general
3	I feel like I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing, or if I‚Äôm making the right choices.	I‚Äôm 23. I have a degree in English. Throughout college I took pre-med classes, did a bunch of different extracurriculars, and changed the idea of what I wanted to do with a ‚Äúcareer‚Äù so many different times. I worked a few different jobs after graduating from retail to restaurant work. I work in a book store now. Towards the end of last year I decided to take the LSAT, and I‚Äôve sent in applications to law school. A couple schools are even giving me full tuition scholarships. I feel like I have to go. I feel like I have to at least move somewhere. I‚Äôve been in this town for over 5 years. It‚Äôs a college town and people come and go. I want to go to a city. And then I think of law school as my excuse to move. But what is wrong with me? I‚Äôve been presented with great opportunity that many others would dream of having, buy why do I feel lost? I love music, I always have. I like writing music. I‚Äôve tried to form and join bands, but it‚Äôs never worked. I also like art and drawing, but I‚Äôm not very good at it because I stopped doing it in middle school, somewhere around the time my father had basically called it a stupid decision when I tried to sign up for the art elective in 7th grade (I forgive him‚Äîbesides, I got the drama elective instead that year and that class was a lot of fun and I even received an award at the end of the year for my performance in it). When people comment on my music, and tell me that I have a talent, it makes me happy, but it also makes me sad. I want to do something artistic in my life. But I worry I will not have the time or energy or motivation if I choose another path. I feel lost. Even when I have the free time, I don‚Äôt create as much as I used to. Whether it be with writing, with teaching myself how to draw, or with music. There are things I‚Äôd like to do, but I feel apathetic. I feel lost. 
2	I‚Äôm 19 and I feel the exact same way. Rn I‚Äôm a Finance major which I‚Äôm good in (4.0 gpa, top of my classes) but it doesn‚Äôt feel authentic to me. I was so paralyzed with indecision when I started college I just chose the major my dad told me to get. I don‚Äôt have any advice bc I‚Äôm still struggling myself, but I just wanted to tell you that you‚Äôre not alone. I am completely and utterly lost. I just detach myself to feel better (I know it‚Äôs unhealthy) but the second I start thinking about my life I feel dissatisfied, like there‚Äôs a hidden cosmic passion I have that I‚Äôm not pursuing. I too want to do something artistic and creative but I don‚Äôt know what. And even if I did know, my internal conflict between Reason and Passion would keep me paralyzed. It just sucks lol
2	My capoeira instructor told us if we want to achieve our goals we need to work at it. If you want to learn the piano you need to schedule time to practice it. E.g. Mon, Wed, Fri, 6pm-8pm. If your friends want to hang out Wednesday at 6. You have to tell them, "Sorry that is when I practice the piano." You can't decide, I am going to skip practicing today. You have to hold yourself accountable. That is how you get better and achieve your goals.\n\nSo if you want a career that you are creative, you need to plan the time.
2	If it makes you feel any better most people don't know what they are doing either.\n\nI'm in my late 20s and I still feel lost. I feel so behind compared to my peers. And I feel even worse when people younger than me have their shit together and are far more ahead in life than I am. I know I shouldn't compare myself to other people, I don't know what they had to go through to get there. But it still sucks not knowing what to do with my own life. I want to move forward but I always feel like i'm making a mistake. And I know making mistakes is sometimes how we learn, but I still don't want to make them when most of my life is full of regrets.\n\nSo be happy you're not an older guy like me who still doesn't know what they are doing. But just do what's best for you that you feel like you wouldn't regret later on. Sorry if that doesn't help much. 
1	Older person here. All I can say is that you can pursue your arts at the side and that‚Äôs ok. Have a day job that can bring you income, and if you think law could be the way, then do it. \n\nLook at Liz Gilbert (author of eat, pray, love). She didn‚Äôt immediately quit her day job when her book became famous. I think it took her publishing a couple more books before she quit her day job.  The actress for crazy, rich Asian was satisfied with acting as a side gig and didn‚Äôt think that she would be able to quit her day job, but she was content. It‚Äôs noble to be able to support yourself. 
3	Guilty	Have you ever lashed out at someone and then immidiately felt really bad about it? \n\nThat just happened with me right now. They did not deserve it at all. I realpy wish I can take back how I reacted, I don't want to really be angry at anyone. 
1	for me, i will explain why i did it/seems like lately i will ask my friends (whom i did not offend) if they prefer zero explain or constant explanations or etc.. (but most are kinda used to my long paragraphs & they claim to like it/appreciate it)\n\nif i do feel sorry, i will say it too. if i am not sorry, i won't say it. lol
30	Started with the first photo and working towards the last. I kept changing my mind on what I wanted to paint on this huge canvas. I‚Äôm hoping I won‚Äôt change my mind again. I love hiding in my basement and painting for hours, I haven‚Äôt gone out in over a month besides school.	
2	I loved the upside down women in the sky the best.Can't decide if I liked the first or second version of it the best. The second. It puts them upside down solidly on the horizon. Tempests in teapots. 
1	Sooo Boootiifullll....ü§§üñ§
1058	All the time	
80	I've resigned myself to being the second or third choice.
52	This sub keep calling me out 
46	Yes and then I get even more sad so I go out with people again, and the cycle continues. 
29	im not infp, but when you get into that situation, do you also not use social media anymore and like not answer ppl messages?
29	I want to delete all social media and never talk to anyone again at least once a week.
63	I feel so personally attacked rn
22	This is going to sound more narcissistic than intended, but ever since I became my own first choice, my life has been so much better socially. I take alone time when I need it, I happily receive from friends when they feel like giving (time, attention, encouragement), and I reach out to those friends on the rare occasions that I need extra support. \n\nI could write at length about what it took to get there, a personal growth journey spanning years. It‚Äôs not easy, but INFPs are awesome and we are worth it. \n\n\n\n
19	*oof*
13	It's only because it's the default of an INFP to distance themselves from other people.\n\nNot only that, but our personality type puts a lot of emphasis on getting along with like-minded people and a need for space. That makes friendships for INFPs a bit harder than other MB types.\n\nI've definitely felt what you're all feeling, but I choose to actively combat the problem whenever I can. Challenging yourself can really help open up your understanding of the world.
11	Yeah, which makes me wonder why I bother with other people. I don't even care to make new friends because I don't feel like doing the same song and dance for what amounts to a pretty shallow friendship. I just don't care about being alone like that.
9	Or people just don‚Äôt view you how you‚Äôd like, and it causes problems, because even if you are a priority, that‚Äôs part of the reason for the problems... 
19	Get a pet.  You will be their number one, always.  Simplistic, I know, but true.  They aren't people.  They are better than people.  You'll always get the truth from your pet.  \n\nI read something recently that went something like;  a pet is part of your world but you are their WHOLE world.  \n\nI understand this isn't possible for everyone but for anyone who has the room in their life for a true friend, make it a furry one.  \n\nLove this sub. 
10	Not till just now.
9	Story of my life. 
15	Yeah, and I'm super jaded about it.  The only time anyone calls is when they need to use me as free therapy.  I pick my battles, but if they're going to treat me like an emotional/psychological whore, they better be compensating me for my time.
6	Yep
7	I especially feel the part about wanting to be alone. I get the urge sometimes to just cut everyone off an make it on my own in this world, without worrying about pleasing anyone else.\n\nUltimately, I never have before, but I definitely would if I felt like I had no true friends. Luckily I have a couple.
7	It feel like that sometimes :/\n\nThen I feel selfish for it because everyone's lives are their own and nobody has to give me anything, even though it's perfectly normal to want to be important to somebody and there's nothing wrong with having feelings.\n\nI dunno, I'll keep giving my best when I can and try to focus on something else for now. Maybe someone else will come along, enjoy my company, and share themselves with me too :)
7	at least i‚Äôm my favorite person üéâüòê
6	I hate how accurate this sub is at times
6	damn, literally me right now xD
4	DAE hate the substitution of ‚Äúu‚Äù for ‚Äúyou‚Äù? Especially when it is ‚Äúyourself‚Äù and it doesn‚Äôt phonetically fit...üò°ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è . It‚Äôs like nails on a chalkboard to my brain. \n\nNot to take away from the content however.  I agree with your point! ‚úåüèª
4	There was someone I dated who I was very upfront with about wanting to travel and for the first time, I wasn't scared of commitment. I wanted to travel with him. When I told him this, I knew it would all be over because he wanted to stay in our town and wasn't willing to admit it. He was unbelievably upset and wondered why no one would stick around. Over the next two months, we are off and on together. He pushed away everyone and was bored while I still wanted him. Eventually, I realized I was the only one making plans to be together. He didn't make any effort anymore. When I stopped, he stopped talking to me all together. I figured someone would try if they wanted to be around me. \n\nA week ago, he started traveling on his own. I realized that he did want to travel - he just didn't want to travel with me despite blaming all of our problems on the fact that I wanted to travel. Fuck you for not being honest. \n\nWhen I read this post, I realized that a lot of people love the idea of being with me but not actually being with me. They don't want to deal with the spontaneity as much as they find it "charming". They don't want to deal with my anxiety even though I'm upfront and direct about it. I just want them to care and hug me when I'm feeling at my worst. They don't want to deal with an open-minded, independent woman who won't bow down to a man just because they are one. They want me to have opinions that align directly with theirs with no conflict whatsoever. \n\nI'd 100% rather be alone than try to make things work with anyone in a relationship. I put too much into friendships and never feel like I get anything back. I used to have friends that met that level of support but over the years, things have changed. I've had a really hard time having friends who truly care about what I'm going through anymore. It's not all about me - I just want to have a conversation that's not 100% surrounded around the other person all of the time. \n\nSorry for the long ass rant. Just had to get that off my chest. 
3	my whole damn life
3	FUCK
3	I‚Äôve done my best to become my only first person, and it‚Äôs been a lovely decision.
3	It's been a while since I've felt like this. Anytime I have, I just leave. It hasn't been around anyone I'm particularly close to. I'd rather be alone than be made to feel lonely around others. At least then, my solitude is my choice and I won't be lonely. 
3	Nah man. I‚Äôll always have [him](https://i.imgur.com/4Yb17LC.jpg). He always lets me know
3	I remember feeling that way when I had friends..
3	I'm glad I am my favorite person. But I'm also a narcissist, so...
4	Says the person with 12K followers 
2	going through one of these right now. woke up the other day and realized i just didn‚Äôt want to talk to anyone for awhile. the worst though is after you‚Äôre done doing the whole ‚Äúdistance‚Äù thing it‚Äôs weird to bring up a conversation. \n\nlike ‚Äòhey, sorry i ignored you for a couple weeks but i‚Äôm alive now?!‚Äô
2	Every day of my fucking life
2	Sometimes, yes. Absolutely. 
2	I'm my  kids number one.   For others.... it's quite painful when I shut myself off.   I have a friend at work... I know I hurt him often.  He keeps trying to reach me and I am angry and silent most of the time with him.  Don't know how to change. 
2	I can‚Äôt relate, but my heart goes out to everyone who feels like this. I have a wonderful best friend and we love each other very dearly :) I rarely go a day without talking to him, we always say that we‚Äôre each other‚Äôs favourite person and it feels amazing
2	Real shit Right here
2	secretly you are many peoples favourite person, you just might not realise. \n\npeople notice man,, \n\neven if it doesn't feel like they do, they really do, \n\nthey just don't say it.
1	yeah, people are wack.
1	Nah because I know I'm not, for at least a few. 
1	Luckily, I feel like I‚Äôm the first choice for my SO. She makes me feel so happy, and I love her so much.\n\nBut I do relate to this when it comes to friends. I‚Äôve had a few people I would consider best friends, but I‚Äôm not sure they would consider me as that.
1	INFP but never, can‚Äôt relate. Not because i may be someone‚Äôs first choice. I just don‚Äôt really care. 
1	Yup
1	I'm feeling this on a whole nother level today
1	goddamn just be your own favorite person instead of being a validation-chasing bitch
1	Exactly why I've gone full introvert. I'm my own best friend. No one has my back more than me!
1	Yeah, I feel that a lot
1	Yuppppp
1	Oof. I feel attacked
1	Yup
1	Sometimes 
1	It's accurate and i don't know if its something wrong with me and the cycle always continues 
1	And when they actually want to spend time with you they just use  you as vent tool, or to talk only about them , this happens so often with my enfj friend, we really get along, but more than often I end up feeling unheard, or sometimes I wanna do something different that I like like for example watching movies, but he just dodges it and do something different, the problem is that is partially my fault for not being more assertive , as of right now I have deleted almost all of my social media, and I‚Äôm trying to be happy by myself if he wants to spend time with me he should reach me instead of the opposite 
1	No, I don't ever think this. I don't know who taught some of ya'll that being an INFP means being a whiny piece of shit, but you don't have to be that way. \n\nIt doesn't have anything to do with being an INFP.
1	I don't care whether or not I'm everybody's favorite. I don't need that kind of validation. 
0	man... back in the MySpace days when i was on somebody's "Top 8" was one of the greatest feeling in the world... then inevitably being removed was a horrible feeling.  then you realize all social media is a game that was made up and the points don't matter.  so nowadays i just sit back and listen to something like:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChilledCow: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHW1oY26kxQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHW1oY26kxQ)\n\nJetSet Radio Live: [http://jetsetradio.live/](http://jetsetradio.live/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nalso, for whatever it's worth: thank you for reading this comment and i love you. #HappyComment\n\n&#x200B;
123	It was a beautiful day	
9	I love the...texture.\n\nThe moving stream with the water bouncing off it it's like a peace of fabric thrown on the floor with many wrinkles all over it.\nThe old mossy bricks.battered, warn away by time and people's feet as they walk along it enjoying the scenery\n\nLovely 
6	Just knowing there are others of you that can appreciate and enjoy this kind of day makes mine so much better!
4	Lol that‚Äôs the bridge to Terabithia
2	It sure looks like it. :)
18	I‚Äôm tired of pretending.	I‚Äôve been numb for so long that I can‚Äôt remember; I can‚Äôt remember the last time I felt happy, I can‚Äôt remember the last time I enjoyed myself doing little tasks. I want this feeling to go. God I just wish it would fucking go away.‚Äù\n‚Äî  I‚Äôm tired of pretending.
6	It's ok to feel this way, you're human.\n\nTry expressing your frustration in some kind of creative medium. It doesn't matter if you suck at it.\n\nWriting, let it all out. No thought or emotion is spared.\n\nPainting, I finger paint when I need to get something out. Mistakes or perfection don't matter to me in this medium. I just get messy until the painting looks right and I feel calm. It's usually abstract and liberating.\n\nOr just dance in the dark to music that reflects your mood. Let it out in exercise.\n\nFinally, talk to someone who you trust without holding back.\n\nI never judge my friends for their darkness, I just accept it as part of being human.
3	Do you mean that you feel trapped in the meaningless of the mundane that goes on as though it was the only thing to be experienced on earth? 
2	using a creative medium as mentioned previously can be a real fucking help. not only does it calm your mind, but it can give you at least a minimal amount of satisfaction and even help when reflecting on what is troubling you, and how to keep moving (slowly but surely step by step) without feeling stagnant. give yourself time to reflect and explore, I'm not sure about your daily routine but overworking yourself when you feel like you do can really put you in a hole, and you can feel like you inevitably just sinking deeper and deeper into it. \n\nkeep your head up, set goals for yourself if you can and when you feel ready (VERY small ones) and weeks ahead you may see a difference, maybe even smile.
2	I don't know how long you've been feeling like this or if you ever have bright spots here and there, but as someone who has gotten themselves out of multiple depressions, I have some simple advice.  It may sound trivial, but try to bundle all the negative thoughts up, stick them in a jar, and label all of it under the umbrella of depression.   When i'm depressed I often get lost down these rabbit holes of despair.  I try to think my way out but it doesn't always work.  Sometimes you can't rationalize it.  That's why I think it's helpful to try and take a step back and be like, "wait a minute, this shit isn't me, this is depression".   
1	Everytimei can be happy someone is here to stop me. Everyone always remind me the moment i was unhappy but no one never remember the one when i was happy.\nPeople saw me sad, not enjoying life but no one takes the time to ask me"hey man, are you ok ? Do you need to talk ? "
1	Sounds like the only pretending your doing is pretending to be unhappy. You're most likely unhappy because you constantly criticize yourself. You constantly doubt yourself. This is a 'reality' you created, and it's not real. Research how to develop self compassion and you will rid yourself of all the negative pretending you do. You're an INFP. You're one of the most wonderful people on this planet. You just haven't realized it yet.
1	Maybe you have to much?\nDont eat or drink for a day. Reduce yourself.\nMaybe you will be happy about water the next day?
5	Feel like I'm full of hate	Hi, INFP friends. I'm a 18 year old Spanish male. Two years ago, I started discovering the darkest parts of myself, due to reading a "Covert Narcissism" article (yeah It might sound crazy).\n\nI've been going to therapy once a week since September, and even though my therapist keeps telling me there's nothing wrong with me (she diagnosed me with an anxiety disorder), I don't really feel like that.\n\nFirst of all, today is Women's Day (at least here in Spain) and I know it's great that women fight for their rights. But I feel like It hurts my pride, and I don't want It. \nThis makes me think that I would be a chauvinist in relationships (I've never been into one).\n\nIn addition, I feel like I hate some people or groups of people for some reason. For example, I have a class mate who seems to be a nice person, but I despise everything he says (in my head).\n\nIf it helps, I can do a little summary of my (short so far) life:\nWhen I was a kid my parents divorced, also I had my best INTP friend with whom I had so much fun, we distanced because I got uncomfortable with his sometimes mean ways.\n\nAt my teenage years I had a really lonely and dark time, I created a Twitter acc and I became sort of a "troll" (not in a hurtful way), it made me treat my school mates w/ some kind of superiority.\n\nThis past years I had a better time, but what I said at the start of the post let me down.\n\nI don't want to be judged for this, I judged myself enough. I just want to understand it.\n\nAnd Hope my explanation doesn't suck.\n\nThanks in advance.
5	I don't know what that problem is called, but it sounds like you could benefit from a daily gratitude practice. Every day i wake up, get ready, and then list 3-10 things that I'm grateful for. It can be anything from someone doing me a favor, to me not having to wake up in the third world, to having the gift of life, to air conditioner.... anything, no matter how large or small.\n\nYou have negative thoughts so much because that's all you apparently think about, and it's just going to get worse. Start thinking about all you're grateful for. When you have an interaction with someone, point out inside your head a few nice things about them. Once you establish habits like this I guarantee your world view will turn around into something pleasant.
4	I think you might benefit from checking out r/menslib \- it's a feminism-friendly place for men (and women) to discuss issues that affect men around the world - psychologically, legally, physically, everything. If you have a fear of being chauvinistic in relationships they are \*absolutely\* the best people on reddit to help you discuss and unpack those thoughts. These are men who have examined and questioned their place in the world and what masculinity means to them. It's really great that you want to ask these questions at all, I sincerely hope you keep doing it and growing. \n\nFor anger- As an infp I personally find it very easy to give into resentment of people who are freer with their standards for themselves than I am with myself. Infps are generally quite principled people, adhering to an inner code with rigid severity, and often forgiving others in ways they won't forgive themselves. \n\nIt's a lot of pressure. So when I see someone acting unabashedly in a way I so strictly deny myself I can't help but feel envious, resentful, disdain...all of it. Because these people show me I often suffer for nothing. That I toil away at some sense of integrity that no one else is keeping score for. \n\nI don't know if that's what's happening for you, but it might be a start to just...look at who specifically triggers this in you and try to pinpoint exactly what bothers you most. Best of luck :)
3	Dude you are a young INFP but that doesnt explain hate.  Its more likely you have some unresolved issues from your past that are starting to manifest in your present.  I dont want to trigger anything for you but i will say I have just gotten through the same thing given a bad day yesterday.\n\nFirst off i am almost twice your age im 32.  And i work in a crowdes workplace.  I left and went home yesterday after nonstop negatove interactions.  Declaring that i hate humanity and just despise people.  But as an INFP that feeling lingered... so to control it i just replaced it with a dufferent stronger feeling.  \n\nHumans use two different brains man.  There is a "secret" second brain i have been told called the emotional brain.  As an infp the Ebrain gives us a special advantage but also a special curse being the burden of anger and sadness.  Its like when food left a bad taste in your mouth.\n\nYou are at an age where the past is catching up to your present feelings and you will begin seeing things through a negative emotional stance unless you find something other than twitter a platform filled with hate and disorder.\n\nAlso relationships are different.  There is less stress in a healthy relationship and our feelings change a bit to match the person we want to spend the most time with.  Whem left alone our dark ebrain can lose control without balance.  But again you may have something deeper affecting you.  Mbti cannot explain everything wrong or right with someone, there is still free will for example.\n\nIDK Maybey its time to find a new you or something.  
2	So we meet again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV74\_Z5vIMA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV74_Z5vIMA)\n\n[https://www.depressionalliance.org/vulnerable-narcissism/](https://www.depressionalliance.org/vulnerable-narcissism/)\n\nHmmm, vulnerable (covert) narcissism is a construct I don't see with as much clarity as I would like yet. It is a bit more vague and connected to things like codependency or BPD than the other narcissism in my untrained eyes, but I guess it shares 3 clear characteristics with overt narcissism at the very least. These would be a feeling of superiority, lack of insight and massive ashollery.\n\nDo you feel superior to most people? Doesn't seem like it. Are you an asshole? I cannot tell. Do you lack insight? Maybe, but you certainly seem to be trying very fucking hard. I'll tell you this, though; from what I know, a real pathological narcissist will not be on the lookout for his own failures so that he may grow, he would not be overtly concerned with being a narcissist and about hurting others in the process, and he wouldn't be beating himself to the ground instead of lashing out as a defense like you are now. Are you broken in some ways? Bet my ass you are. Do you have lingering anger or trauma issues from aspects of yourself that are as of yet unresolved? Bet my ass again.\n\nNow let's say you are indeed a narcissist. Sure, could happen... But assuming anything that goes on in your head, ugly or not, would be the result of just being "narcissistic" could be a very problematic oversimplification. A very prevalent theory as to the cause of pathological narcissism is that it is a defensive response to trauma and terrible self-steem, born out of an infancy in which emotional regulation skills weren't teached, empathy was not given or promoted, unreasonable standards were set, and maybe a lot of false praise went on, or so I've heard. I'm not checking sources for that one, so take it with loads of salt. But, anyway, my point is that, even if you are a "narcissist", you're not a bad person and you need as much help as the next guy, maybe more, and a SHITTON of insight.
2	Breathe in, breathe out. Breathe in, breathe out. Breathe in, breathe out.\n\nNow at this very moment are you full of hate, full of love, full of both, a little of each or devoid of either?\n\nYou are probably just thinking. All the hate, all the love is in the past. What you do right now, at each moment is more important. In fact, it is not more important, but rather, it's the only thing that matters.\n\nThe very fact that you made this post says you recognise some parts of yourself to be improved **and** you are honest and courageous enough to admit it, not to us (even though you made this post) but really to yourself.\n\nSo don't be too hard on yourself. Don't hate or detest yourself or your past. Just be the improved person you want to be.\n
1	Hi, I'd like to hear more about how (and maybe if you have a theory or two about why) you feel hurt about women fighting for their rights. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis topic has interested me for a while now after hearing about feminazis and incels, which led me to wonder why ~~can't we all just hold hands together, form a circle and be friends~~ people are still so angry and insulting each other while debating about gender equality.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I was randomly Googling the other day about gender dominance hierarchies in the animal kingdom and [this article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2017/04/13/a-feminist-biologist-discusses-gender-differences-in-the-animal-kingdom/#2f97859519b5) caught my eye, particularly this section: \n\n>Patriarchy (as defined above) doesn‚Äôt just hurt women by treating them as property. In fact, the worst victims of patriarchy are the low-status, unmarriageable men who do the most dirty, dangerous jobs in society for peanuts. Unfortunately, we‚Äôve done a terrible job at understanding and communicating this, to the point that most men in this situation are convinced that feminism, not patriarchy, is actually the root of their problems. So long as middle-class feminists ridicule and demonize them while enjoying relatively pampered lives, these men will continue to hate us. And who can blame them?\n\nAnd now I kinda want everyone else to read this and see if it's also an eye-opener for them, or if there are things the writer missed/got wrong (why are there no comments section on posts that need them?) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for hate, I deal with it by taking a big step back and distancing myself from the situation/environment/people. I used to fight very often with my mom and began to feel like I hated just seeing her face, but after moving out and having contact limited to just texts, rare video calls and once-a-year visits, I think that our relationship is so much better now. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHate and other negative feelings like fear and disgust and anger for me is a defense mechanism, like a response when our principles and belief of 'how reality or things or even people should work' are being threatened. 
134	How to become the best possible INFP.	Hey, this will be a long read, so I recommend you read this while eating something.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI see a lot of INFPs here that are very sad / depressed / unmotivated and I wanted to post something that will hopefully help some of you. By all means if you're struggling with mental illness, this isn't really going to do much, so take it with a grain of salt depending on your situation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll of the people that I find myself looking up to are usually INFPs. They are self-mastered INFPs, to be exact and I want to tell you exactly why. It's going to be very abstract, so you can apply it to whatever you'd like.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Introverted Feeling** (Sensitivity --> Durability)\n\nThere is something that can happen when an introvert reaches self-mastery (something similar for extroverts too). Their primary inner function 'flips' outward. Your inner-Fi is so deep and rich, its roots running very far underground. Yet, you probably hide it from others, as it feels extremely sensitive to allow others to see it or go anywhere near it. You are probably afraid of being hurt or manipulated in some way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, true strength comes from forcing these roots outward. People *will* make fun of you and try to make you feel awful for the things you love and value. But when Fi is strong and radiating outward, it's extremely hard to stop. It's why you probably cry at your favorite song or painting. It's not the type of crying of "I resonate / sympathize with this". It's the "Holy fuck this gave me chills" beauty. And believe it or not, you are capable of that. But you have to take all things that are important to you and push them OUT into the world. It means being unafraid about yourself and your opinions. People will quickly find out how they feel about you (which you are subconsciously scared of because you deep down think that you are not worthy of being liked, so when others find out the 'real' you, you think they'll stop liking you), but the people who do end up loving you will love you SO much more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPeople who radiate Fi are hands-down some of the most inspiring individuals humanity has ever seen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Extraverted Intuition** (Uncertainty --> Ingenuity)\n\nWe live in a very SJ-centered world. A lot of us are taught that traditional methods are the best and most rational means of getting things done, and corporations such as Apple even go as far as to not innovate too much at once, but instead release small superficial improvements to their products to sustain revenue. Ne is capable of far more than just ADHD and shitty memes. When true Ne comes through, it's not really calculated or predicted. It comes from such an original place when combined with Fi and makes what you are doing something the world has not seen before. I see a lot of INFPs that follow trends and are scared to truly experiment, because they don't want their unconventionality to put off other people. I have even seen them make things that are intentionally bad / ironic in order to avoid judgment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'll say this much, though. When Ne comes out, people aren't prepared for it. They don't know how to feel about it or what to think of it at first. They'll say "hmm, that's weird" at first. Then, as this thing becomes familiar to them, they warm up to it. That's how all game-changing ingenuity starts out. Mixed reception at first, and then retroactively we look back on those things like "Jesus, this was absolutely groundbreaking for this time / ahead of its time." Again, you are 112% capable of that, but you cannot be scared of consequences. Your Fi will help you with this. Do it for yourself and not the validation of others. Understand that everything we love today was new at some point in time, so why can't you be on that list as well?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you truly embrace all your Ne creativity and quirks (and not just trendy / manufactured quirkiness like most 'relatable' tweets try to be), there is nothing the world could do to prepare for it, and you'll be a truly spontaneous individual.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Introverted Sensing** (Laziness--> Accountability)\n\nSo a lot of people think that Si is just about being comfortable, but it's far more nuanced than that. It's more about stability, responsibility, and accountability. This is where the INFPs reading this might start cringing. Your Fi and Ne are spontaneous and powerful functions, but they do need to be supported by something, or they'll fizzle out. It means taking care of yourself, even if it means not spending a ton of money on drugs / alcohol  which might comfort you. It also means getting *out* of your comfort zone in order to actually put the Fi/Ne to use. One big problem INFPs encounter is that they work in huge bursts of energy and take forever to complete projects. So don't expend all of your energy at once. Force yourself to work in sustained, consistent mini-bursts and I promise at least 33% of your anxiety will disappear. BS-ing for 6 days and scrambling to make it work on the 7th day is going to make you feel like shit 6 days out of the week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot trying to go all Jordan Peterson on you, but try to pick one **small** thing a day to work on. Maybe you'll wipe down the table one day. Maybe sweep another day, or pick up your clothes from the floor the next day. Making the bed ain't such a bad idea either. Within one month, you'll have a pretty spotless environment and you may even feel confident enough to start inviting people over again! Having something to do also gives you a (very) small sense of purpose that you can use to leverage against feelings of meaninglessness and despair. It's not *the* fix, but it helps.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen you master Si, you'll be self-sufficient, and this means even *more* freedom to explore your Fi-Ne without people interrupting and giving their unwanted two cents.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Extroverted Thinking** (Non-focus --> Effectiveness)\n\nThis big bad demon of a function is scary. As an INFJ, I understand that just as much as you do. However, it's actually not going to be that hard for you. When you encounter external information, you process it a lot using Ne. You think of how objects and concepts relate to other objects and concepts. This is great, but Ne is a very loop-prone function. Meaning, it's easy to get caught in an Ne tangent for the entire day and forget about other tasks and responsibilities. From now on, you can look at objects with a sense of "how does this HELP me or my goals?". If you do this, and are honest about it, you will stop bullshitting very quickly. For example, when you are watching Netflix at 3am with a final at the end of the week, this question is going to give you two options: Stop what you are doing immediately; OR Continue on a downward spiral of self-destruction. It sounds dramatic, but a lot of INFPs destroy themselves little by little with tiny shitty decisions that add up to an entire life of pure regret. Please don't ever think you can't change.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis brings me to my next point; **DO.** I'm not going to tell you to write down a list of goals. That works great when communicating your ideas to others, but I personally don't think it's that necessary. You already have Si and Te down there in your stack. So deep down, YOU KNOW GOOD AND WELL what you should be doing most of the time. It's the voice in your head that you don't want to be true, and that you drown out with excuse after excuse.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you're an INFP, you are going to attain a large amount of hope from this post (hopefully I've kept your attention up to this point). You'll think "Wow, maybe it *is* possible to change!" Then, you will see a cat meme when scrolling down from this and forget about it. So, I **DARE** you to actually stop and do ANYTHING other than what you are doing right now. Something that you think will help you. Don't think of responsibility / efficiency as a chore. Think of them as building a wall to hang your FiNe portrait on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\--\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat being said, the world needs far more people like you. Me especially. What if that artist had never made that song that inspired you, because they were at home masturbating and looking at youtube videos instead? If not for my favorite INFP musicians / activists / artists, I would have probably killed myself by now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn that note, I bid you adieu. \*bows\*
24	Thank you :) *bows back*
15	Oh funny, I think I literally just made a post complaining about the Fi-part, not feeling like it's okay to be myself and stuff. But this already made a lot of sense and answered many of my questions. Thank you! \n\nI'm going to proceed to read the rest now. :D\n\nEdit, five (?? ? ?) minutes later: ***This is exactly what I have needed my whole entire life***: someone to tell me these exact words. I probably have to read this every morning from now on to remind myself of your words because that cat meme will definitely distract me eventually, probably sooner rather than later. Better yet, let me nail this post on my wall or tattoo it on my hand. \n\nI'll try my best to take your advice to heart, you wonderful magical INFJ guru. Thank you so incredibly much. üíñ
10	Thank you! I agree with all your insights
10	Sorry to perpetuate the clich√© but I  was thinking of killing myself before reading this lol.\n\nVery helpful and inspiring, thank you :)\n\n
8	Thank you! This was great! I definitely felt inspired by this post and actually got chills. (,: thanks for taking time out of your day to write all of this out. 
8	Um...you are PHENOMENAL. Thank you. If I could have an INFJ write down every insight about my weak spots, and everything they understand about humanity I‚Äôd be extremely emotionally wealthy. Thank you thank you xxx *shuns cat meme on way out* *tries to actively apply life lessons*

6	Thanks you so much!
6	I'm not concerned with being the best possible "INFP" I'm more concerned with being the best possible ME. There's way more to myself than just my MBTI. Just saying.
3	thanks for sharing this <3
3	Thank you! It makes me sad to see people are so unhappy on this sub and I was right with them just a couple weeks ago. It‚Äôs the little things that you put off that are always in the back of your mind making you feel like shit because you aren‚Äôt dealing with them. I was having some stomach issues that I put off going to the doctor for because I was scared. I finally went and got some medicine to help and I feel so much better in my everyday life Because I have one less thing to worry about. Fellow INFPs it‚Äôs all about taking the first leap! 
3	Dude. I cannot upvote this post enough. I‚Äôm an INFP and I have been trying to share these exact ideas with others here but you did it so much more methodically and it‚Äôs great.\n\nIf you‚Äôre an INFP and you‚Äôre reading this with a tinge of disbelief or disregard, I can 101% attest to this. Take another read and let it soak in.\n\nReally glad you posted this. This is a great reminder for me and I‚Äôm sure will help many others here.
2	That was fantastic, thank you!
2	This is amazing, I resonate with this a lot and feel like im definitely on the right track to being the best possible INFP. I definitely need to implement the introverted feeling portion of your post though for sure... ahh my recent ex is an INFP and i wish he could see this and hope this brings him up out of the hole that hes been staying in (i will never send it to him though of course for obvious reasons)
2	I needed this. Finding out my personality type has given me a lot of insight into my own thinking, but I haven't seen a whole lot on how to actually overcome some of the common downsides. Just a lot of "these will probably be your struggles". Which I'm already aware of! \n\nYes I did cringe where you said I would have to. But you make a lot of valid points... Definitely saving this.
2	You understand the power of Fi so well when channeled properly.
2	Shit, this is some really good, hard hitting insight. I was thinking recently how helpful it would be to have some type of directive like this...I've been stuck in the INFP spiral for some time, so I'm going to mull over what you said and start to DO. I appreciate you.
2	What I miss about this sub is discussions about doing. What went right, why it went and perhaps possibility of how to apply what you've learned. More practical approach to problem solving as opposed to theory - posting. 
2	All of this. I needed to hear all of this right now
2	Thank you <3 
2	I've been in a rut lately and I really needed something like this.  Thanks a lot for believing so much in us when we often can't in ourselves.  I would argue that I have already realized most of these point but, well, I still don't work on them. \n\n\n"If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do, chaples had been churches and poor men's cottages princes palaces... " - Will Shakes\n\n
2	Oh wow that is great. I love this so much!\n\n\n-Back to cat memes now I guess-
2	I appreciate this post. It does give me some hope. I'm basically a failed INFP in that I have all the traits but I was never disciplined enough to develop creative abilities really. I've had so many ideas for songs that just went nowhere. I want to believe I can change, I also wonder if it's too late for me
2	Thank you. 
2	Thank you, I promise I'll show you my music once I finish procrastinating the production (:
2	This is gold worthy advice :D
2	GOLD!!!

8	Does anybody else feel REALLY motivated to understand a person, but not really interested in that person understanding you?	Or is it just me? I want to learn about them, make them laugh, help them out - but I place almost no value in them learning about me. Why is that?
2	I‚Äôm like this with general acquaintances and with most friends but for people I really care about and love, I want them to peel back and understand each layer of me on a deep level. \n\nIt‚Äôs rare but I believe it‚Äôs out there. 
2	Same. I'd love to know everything about other people's minds but I don't ever want to show them mine. If I do for some strange reason, I almost always regret it instantly, disappointed in their underwhelming reactions. I've tried to tell personal things about myself to people before and once someone literally replied with "I'm so glad summer's coming". Haha nope, never doing that again, even though I know not all people are like that. It just feels pointless. I know myself and that is enough for now.
24	A picture from a couple months ago from a rainy day. Thought others might enjoy it as much as I do.	
2	Wow, really nice picture! I love raindrops on the Glass, it always gives me goosebumps. I don't know how to describe the feeling, feels like magic maybe. I feel so enchanted. I also like to take photos like this. Light shining through the drops, all those colors... And also the blur. Similar to this for me is the view of a sun (or any Light source) coming through the Frost on a window.
2	There's so much life and movement in this photo.
19	To the person who just deleted their post and username:	I don't know if this is against some kind of rule or not, to reply to a deleted post. Please someone let me know if it is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just wanted to let the person know that I think most of the things they mentioned can be normal for infp.\n\nI'm not a cuddly cinnamon roll or whatever.  I think most infps have an outer protective layer and don't show the sensitive inside easily.\n\nI used to be really worried about getting too close to people or bothering them. and I do often have an urge to delete an account if I feel like online relationships are getting too close or involved. Because how can they think they know me? They only see what I let them see and there are parts that I will always keep to myself. \n\nI don't usually delete accounts, because I feel like I should take responsibility for my actions. If I did not want this, then I should not have gotten myself into it. I should have thought more before posting. (not judging you, I understand) If I don't want a close online relationship, I simply tell people that I'm not comfortable with a close online friendship or that I do not wish to discuss this topic further. I also was raised religious, and I still am, and because of that, there are things that I will not view in the same way as most of the people that I will come into contact with online. We will have different values in these areas, so this is a large part of myself that I generally don't share. And my beliefs may even be different from other religious people. I don't particularly like people touching me, because it feels like they're in my personal space and it's also annoying, but in my case this is not a sex thing. I like sex. With my husband.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLife experience is a big help for a lot of the issues I had as a young infp. I realized a couple of things, over time.\n\none was that most people don't want to see all of you, they just want you to give them the part of you that they like. It's not wrong to meet their needs. You are showing a true part of you, it's just not all of you. This may not be a very fulfilling relationship for you, but it's not dishonest. They don't want the deeper parts. Some people will want the deeper parts, but these are rare. Hold on to them.\n\nthe other thing is that I remember seeing people when i was younger and thinking they were so put together and so good at conversation and intimidating to me. Then I moved away for 10 years and moved back. When I met them again, we talked and I realized that they were unsure of themselves, they thought they were bothering me with their problems. So now I think that a lot of people are insecure on the inside, they just hide it, because they are afraid for it to show. So then I thought that maybe they are happy when I talk to them. I try to say encouragin things and listen to their problems, because maybe they have no one else they can talk to. they are not judging me or thinking that I'm boring, they are too busy being worried that I will judge them or that I think they are boring. And for the other people who actually do think I'm boring or weird? They're free to leave the conversation whenever they want.
6	(I accidentally posted too soon and deleted my comment to keep writing but the old one's remains are still here (I think?). How ironic that this had to happen.)\n\nHello! Thank you so much for replying to my post even though I in my cowardly way went and deleted it. I'm really taken aback that you took the time to write this. I truly appreciate it! \n\nI didn't delete my username just yet but thought that the post in question was full of pointless whining and simply felt a bit embarrassed about it. I agree that I definitely have to take responsibility and think longer before blurting something, whether it be on the internet or in real life. It's something I have to work on, amongst many other things. \n\nYou're also absolutely right about most human connections being shallow, always. The right people are so hard to find and I feel like it takes years for them to also *feel* right. But they are there, somewhere and all over. And like you said, in order to find those right people I have to stop giving too many shts about how the general population is supposedly judging me and my way of life. In the end it doesn't matter at all. They are all too busy obsessing about themselves looking like imbeciles to think of anyone else.\n\nOnce more, thank you for your sympathy and all the reassuring words. I'll try to loosen up a bit lol. You're awesome üå∑
2	Lol hahah!  This has to be the best and most underrated true human interaction on reddit.  Its got so much INFP goodness in it I couldnt help but comment you guys kick ass, regular folks would not waste time and effort like that to reach back out.  Such a rare breed, and so much true honesty.  I bet you both are the "gem"  of your social circles,  they world NEEDs more if you both,\n\nEven if hiding is the most prefferrable way\n\nCheersüçæüçªü•Çü•ßüç™

13	I've found my people!	I have so much to say, but of course I really don't have the motivation to type all of it. Sorry if this is rambling; I'm just excited to find a group of people that GET IT. I've known  I was an INFP for years but I had no idea there was a whole community and others whose lives have been shaped by it!\n\nI currently am the most unhappy that I've ever been, and reading through these posts, most of them sound like they were pulled right out of my brain.\n\nI work in the medical field in a rehabilitation job with kids with disabilities (go figure lol), and I LOVE the kids but I can't seem to communicate efficiently with adults at work or get any of the accompanying paperwork done. I feel totally inept. \n\nI recently moved to a new city and have NO friends (and can't seem to make any), I eat like shit and don't work out and can't seem to get out of this habit or find any motivation to do ANYTHING that I'm passionate about. OR anything in general.\n\nI feel overwhelmingly lonely but everyone sucks. I can't break old habits. I can clean my room or desk thoroughly and it is a DISASTER 1 day later.\n\nMy dog is in another state currently staying with a friend (he is not allowed at the place I'm renting) and I feel like part of me has been ripped away. I need to find another living situation but I just can't (I am lazy to a fault and interacting with people is torturous). It's totally my fault.\n\nI just feel like every day I sit at home is so wasteful and I'm watching years go by without doing anything I dream of.\n\nThis was super rambling, but very cathartic. This was my first post here so I just have a lot to say and can't organize it well lol.
3	Welcome!! I relate to this, a lot. We're not alone! There are other wonderful creatures out there just like us!!
1	You are definitely not alone! This sounds like me a couple of years ago. I‚Äôve found giving myself small wins helped me get through those days (yay! I got through 1 pile of paper work, get up and go stretch). Focusing on getting a few small things done a day helped it seem less over whelming instead of trying to make everything perfect immediately like I wanted it. Before I knew it all the stuff that had piled up around me and overwhelmed me was taken care of. I tend to completely shut down when the smallest things start to go wrong and before I know it everything around me feels chaotic. Now that I am aware of that problem I make a conscious effort to address it as soon as it happens.
1	Im new too. The support ive found here is so helpful, theres lots of wisdom that goes through. Hope some of it found you!
1	Welcome! I just discovered this sub too and I love it. I also moved to a new city and was so horribly depressed and lonely that my dad flew out to come bring me home. I hope yours has a happier ending than mine but anyways, welcome and I‚Äôm excited to see these posts together :)
1	I can also relate to what you're saying, esp. about not having any motivation while everything in life turns into a chaos. But hey, think that at least you have a steady job. That's something. 
1	I relate here as well.  Try meditation.  It can help you seek purpose, path, or lifes current values for you.  All things a growing INFP needs üòÜ
7	What‚Äôs wrong with me? I feel like an alien.	I‚Äôm an INFP (44f), successful, two healthy kids, divorced and with a couple good friends. But outside of my kids, I feel so lost. \n\nI‚Äôm lonely and don‚Äôt know how to connect with people other than my two ENFP friends. I‚Äôm just too deep, too this, too that.  Both friends are married and so I try not to bug them much.\n\nI seem to scare men away with my depth and over communication, and many people in general just don‚Äôt get me.\n\nIn addition, I can be a doormat. Too kind and understanding, if there is such a thing.\n\nTherapy doesn‚Äôt help, other than having someone I pay to converse with me.\n\nAnyone else feel this way?\n\n
2	I learned to accept and value loneliness. It can be a beautiful feeling if you dig deep enough. Loneliness and pain leads me closer to God.  
2	I feel exactly EXACTLY the same way. I feel like I am complex and it is difficult for people to understand that about me. They get confused and make incorrect assumptions about me, I try to clarify but it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs too much for them. They only feel more confused and overwhelmed, most of them, with the additional information. \n\nThat quote ‚ÄúI seem to scare men away with my depth and over conversation and many people just don‚Äôt seem to get me.‚Äù Wow. Just. Wow. Same here. And who the heck wants to have a relationship with someone who doesn‚Äôt want to talk about deep shit? I thought that was the whole POINT of intimacy? It baffles me to no end.\n\n\nI have only found two or three friends in my life time that get me and accept me as I am, without having to make me bad or wrong somehow.\nI‚Äôve moved several times and this is extremely frustrating and isolating as my friends are spread out all over the place now.\nOne thing I read recently however is really helping me. I have a theory that INFPs are actually just old souls and this article, which supports that idea, explains almost every single thing about my life. Why I don‚Äôt care about money or status, why people always think I‚Äôm weird, why I have memories of past lives and why I am gifted with music and art. It‚Äôs almost like people think INFPs are stupid, which is really frustrating, because we understand things on such a deep level it‚Äôs almost like that they can‚Äôt even imagine or conceive of them.\n\n\nIt could be hocus pocus but combined with learning about the INFP Meyers Briggs personality types, I find it tremendously comforting to think that if I can find more of these so called ‚Äúold souls‚Äù like me again where I live, I might have a chance at feeling understood and accepted again, and less like I‚Äôm on an alien planet all the time. I feel like it reframed my problems with connecting in a way that I can understand and work with, so I don‚Äôt have to feel like a victim as much, or like I‚Äôm cursed by God, which is a truly awful and lonely feeling.\n\nI‚Äôm curious if others find the ideas under old souls helpful.\nhttp://www.michaelteachings.com/soul_ages.html#old\n\nI also totally agree about the paying people to converse with me thing too. LOL. Again, you have given words to EXACTLY the way I feel.
1	Sometimes, that's why I find Intuitive's to talk to.\n\nI've been kicked out of coffee shops with friends for chatting about philosophical matters long after closing and we'll into midnight. Just pleasantly lost in the depths of good "What if's" and "Why's".
1	Perhaps, I shouldn‚Äôt be giving advices as I am working on a lot of personal issues myself this year. However, I recently discovered this book that has been helping me tremendously: ‚ÄúThe Untethered Soul‚Äù by Michael Singer. There is even an audio version available on YouTube. It has a lot of familiar information in it but I guess I just needed that reminder worded in that particular way as it really resonates with me during this time.  The chapter about letting go was particularly eye-opening. It never occurred to me before that my unhappiness could come from trying to control everything and holding onto past experiences (both good and bad). Anyway, give it a try if you haven‚Äôt already.
1	its sad that depth and over communication is too much for some people, but there is a crowd out there that absolutely love it, trust me.\n\nfind people who can receive it and hold great conversations, keep searching cause we are out there, we are all right here in this reddit sub, and real life.
1	\*Hugs.\* I feel exactly that way. I have a husband who is also an INFP, but he's an A & I'm a T. Plus male INFP's tend to be a bit different anyway. A few good friends, but I've really cut back on who I talk to due to the "too kind & understanding" thing, started to frustrate the hell out of me over the last 5 years. Other than being 29, everything else is exactly as you described.\n\nWhen I can keep a positive mind set, I try to remind myself how much I do in fact like who I am, and that I'm complex. That the friends I have and any friends in the future, I'd like to have real connections with, because otherwise what's the point?
2	Daily INFP random discussion thread - March 08	\nThis is your daily random discussion thread for /r/INFP. Feel free to chat, or ask questions. \n\nNew to this subreddit? Read the sidebar!\n
3	I realized I posted this in yesterday‚Äôs thread but basically I want to change and be more personable and social but I feel too fake doing it and it makes me question who I am. How do I make friends genuinely when I feel fake initiating a relationship with someone?
2	I'm annoyed that when I get happy, apparently I'm too intense for both the cookie cutter ESTJ and ENTJ in my friend group so they always team up to keep my energy and mood down. I can't find a way to deal with it when it inevitably happens again. Am I not allowed to be happy around them? Are dominant personalities like those developed to keep me out of this world? They accuse me of whining and bullshitting all the time with utter coldness but try to warmly invite me as part of the group anyway. I have to fight myself to stay because compromise is part of maintaining the relationship. It's hard, but I'll get through it stronger. I can't help but feel like a victim.
1	kinda just wanna... get off the bus?
3	Are there certain colors you find yourself particularly drawn to?	Colors you find comforting or calming? \nColors that energize you? \n(And on the flip side) Colors that make you uneasy or tend to elicit a negative reaction? 
4	Blue based colours my entire life, but lately I crave orange. \n\nI hate brown and yellow. 
3	I love purple
3	purple all the way! dark shades are the best, but lighter pink shades are also nice :)\nalso black :p
3	recently purple, or deep ocean blue 
3	black or autumn red
2	Chalky indigo to calm me.\n\nInky Sable to think.\n\nNeon Orange to repulse me.
2	I like bright pinks and deep blues 
1	A rich and dark purple and a nice bright vibrant orange 
14	How can INFPs be so loving to others and yet so selfish?	I am so very perplexed by my INFP friend. This girl is one of the sweetest and kindest people I know and yet I am often shocked how inconsiderate to other people's feelings she can be. She is capable of telling someone she loves them so much and then never initiates anything and even sabotages all the effort to spend time together from the other person. I have seen many people get hurt by her like this (including myself, to an extent), meanwhile she seems to ignore that and only talk about how hurt SHE is.\n\n This is a common thing for you guys from what I understand, so could you please enlighten me on what drives you to such behaviour? Don't you think it's actually a bit selfish? Other people have feelings, too.\n\nDisclaimer: I still think you are lovely people, please don't take this as an insult.

9	To me, love is separate from contact. With my best friends, I often don't see them for months, but I would do anything for them. They live 3 hours away, though, or I'd probably see them more.\n\nI do think of them fairly regularly and sometimes I think about calling, but then I'll get distracted and forget and it's too late to call. (they're like this too, because those are the only people who can maintain close friendships with someone like me. They'll apologize for not calling for months and I'll be like, whatever, I'm the same way.)\n\nI don't like when people initiate things and want to do stuff with me all the time. If you do this more than once a month, (twice a month for ENFP friends), I'm going to think you are needy and exhausting and that we need to get some breathing space between us. Maybe not all infps are like this, but I'm extremely introverted and I already have more socializing than I want from my family. If I don't like that, then why would I do that to my friends? If they need more social interaction than I can provide, then they are free to find additional friends that can fill that void for them. I'm not prone to jealousy. If I care about you, then I'm happy to see you happy with others as well as with me. I believe that people are responsible for taking care of their own emotional needs and getting them met. If you have more of a need for socializing than I do, that is your responsibility, not mine. Do something about it. I have a responsibility to take care of my own need for solitude and I shouldn't have to apologize to anyone for taking care of myself.\n\nIt's nice to get together sometimes, and I enjoy the company of a good friend, but I guess I just don't feel that socializing is a need. Like, I enjoy cheesecake, and if it's in my house, I'll probably eat it every day for a week, but I can also go 6 months without it and it won't really bother me. If I feel lonely, I can go for a walk in a place with people in it, like a mall or a park, and feel better without having to actually talk to anyone.\n\nOne thing that you will get from an infp friend, if they really consider you a close friend, is extreme loyalty. That doesn't sound like much, but it is. I don't know if devotion is the right word...\n\nSo yes, we are selfish, because we need to take care of ourselves by spending time alone. And we are not selfish, because we would give so much for our friends, Just not our alone time. If we don't have that, we won't be very fun to be around anyway.\n\nNow I'm thinking I'm probably way more introverted than most infps, so a lot of this may just be me. Wherever I said Infps in this post, I probably should have said I instead. Maybe someone else will have their own viewpoint to add soon.
7	This is where maturity comes in. I have encountered both types and found that the mature ones usually sense other people‚Äôs feelings better than those that are immature. \n\nWe love people deeply but we also love being by ourselves maybe almost equally. I cant even remember how many people i have made people distant by not keeping in touch and i feel super guilty about it..\n\nIt all comes by as selfish but our intentions are never to hurt or disappoint people. INFPs are also conflict averts so when some of us realise we have done something to hurt someone, it is often problematic to address those issues with said person unless the person comes up by themselves. 
3	I do initiate things and I normally respond to social proposals if they involve a small group or one-to-one, because I do need this type of interaction. However, I understand an INFP not responding because they simply don't need it or don't want it, and unlike other types we don't feel we need to justify ourselves. It's not laziness as most of us feel drained already from trying to understand the world and trying to somehow fit in somewhere on a daily basis, so social niceties wouldn't be on our top set of priorities. This is my personal view as an INFP.
4	An INFP will carry you in their heart. Always and forever. They do not need to see you as often as you like because to us, it's like you're with us in spirit and you always will be. \n\nSocializing to an INFP (at least to me, I dunno about others) can feel like a constant give give give give give. \n\nYes we enjoy being with our loved ones but if we're not careful, we drain ourselves or burn out. Or get hyperstimulated to the point of shortcircuit.  Because it's not something we need, there's a thin line easily crossed at the point where socializing becomes something we do for others, more than for ourselves. \n\nIt would be the equivalent of asking an extrovert to isolate themselves in a room for 30 days without seeing someone. They'd be pretty bummed and couldn't stand it. Some of the more introverted INFPs feel an inversely similar way about socializing.\n\nI caught myself thinking once "Why are THEY hurt by me not being there? It's not like >I<make a difference to the dynamic anyway"\nAnd it is this kind of thought pattern that justifies us ghosting people. We think they'll have more fun without us anyway. Notice that somebody who thinks that way though, is somebody who doesn't think much of themselves and that's the whole point. By socializing constantly (when we're not feeling up to it) we put our needs below that of others, and we think less and less and less of ourselves. It jeopardizes our self esteem. This is coming from somebody who's been there.\n\nMany more times than I can count, I've forced myself to come to these things and regret it afterwards because I spent the whole night being somebody's sponge. That to me is worse than not showing up in the first place.\n\n We would rather hang with someone when it comes from a genuine want and need and positive vibes and love, rather than when we have to force ourselves. Do you want to spend time with someone who feels like they are forcing themselves?\n\n It's true that one can adopt the attitude of "Even if I don't feel like socializing I can for so and so sake" but that is a trap. Understand that at that moment, you (the party) have a compromised, not 100% version of a friend.\n\nThe better route for a friendship like this is to appreciate the moments when you ARE together so you don't take for granted the moments you aren't.
2	It's something that I always hated about myself. The moment I changed was when my friends brought it up to me and let me know that it does hurt them when I flake. It was hard for me to hear, but I appreciate them for telling me their feelings and now I try to really consider if I can go out or if I need to stay in. I also feel now like I can be more open to them about my concerns if I'm ever feeling that urge to flake. 
1	Obvious disclaimer that I can't speak for all INFPs, especially as I also have Generalized Anxiety Disorder which may amplify these behaviors.\n\n\nI rarely if ever initiate because I'm socially awkward, and initiating feels awkward to me.\n\n\nIf someone does initiate contact through some form of delayed communication (text, email, voicemail) I may not respond to them if I feel like I don't know what to say, or especially if they are extending some sort of invitation and I want to say no but am afraid I'll hurt their feelings if I reject them. (I value my alone time but have extreme difficulty rejecting others when they invite me somewhere.)\n\n\nSimilarly, I may not respond if I'm afraid I've already waited too long since receiving the message because I'm afraid I'll offend them through lack of punctuality.\n\n\nNow, here's where things tend to get messy. If someone calls me out on the above behaviors, I tend to get defensive, because part of me feels like I'm not at fault for being the way I am. This could cause me to feel attacked.\n\n\nYes, this is selfish behavior, but my experience as an INFP was growing up being walked all over like a doormat, saying yes to everything, being as selfless as I could until it reached a boiling point and I decided the only way I could maintain my sanity was to start being selfish sometimes. Sometimes I over-correct and say no too much now, and as a defense mechanism I can be quite the manipulator in my less proud moments.\n\n\nIf you want to foster a good relationship with this person, I would suggest:\n\n1) accept that she may not be an initiator - ever.\n\n2) let her know that when you extend an invitation she's wanted but **not** obligated.\n\n3) understand that if she doesn't want to hang out, it's probably not about you\n\n\nIf you're an INTP (as your username suggests) I think it's important that you take her feelings seriously and don't automatically look at her behavior as over-emotional. I get that a lot from my INTP brother and it makes me feel like he doesn't respect me and thinks I'm just a crybaby who always wants to be the victim when in fact I struggle with my own emotions and actually contain a lot more than I show.
1	Look the other, the non infp. Do you think they care about others ? No, it's them and only them.\n\n"oh look i did something Nice. I'm a gpdo person right" if you aren't like that you aren't.\n"he helped me when i was down, but if he help people he must be fine"\n\nThe worst is during a fight, i find always a way to take a part of the responsabilities. The other never do this.\n\nMy arguments sound selfish, but i try to not be everyday. I do what others want, even wjen i ask something others ignore my choice.\nI don't think we can't call this selfishness.\nYou just think we are robot made to give love, you aren't just ready to fix the machine when she is broken. 
6	(Falling) In Love With Two Women at Once	My first post in this community, and I really need some guidance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI met this amazing girl on the internet (INFP) about a month back. We'd flirted before, but recently ( as I often do :( ) I got attached and have truly fallen for her. She remains distant at some times, but is generally loving, especially over the phone and ft. Ig my inner prospective side comes out and I feel something very different and unique from her vibe wise that makes me imagine a future with her very easily.\n\n* She can come off as very condescending, but also very sweet and always wants to talk\n* Physically, she's my type lol\n* She's interested in meeting in person asap\n* She has some problems with trust due to insecurities concerning her body and feeling loved.\n   * She's an artist like me, and shares my interest in music\n* Her most recent interest ghosted her. According to her, I'm her first boyfriend \n\nThe only thing is, we recently got into a small argument. I confided in my bestfriend (ENFP) (who lives much closer), who I find is easier to talk to and much more loving but lacks that really illusive, attracting vibe that the other has. During that, she confessed her love for me and we ended up in a position in which I nearly cheated -- I couldn't bring myself to do it. \n\n* She knows more about me than anyone else on this earth. She's sweet and extremely considerate\n* I find myself attracted to her, but don't pick up on the same vibe\n* Our senses of humour and level of openness with one another are unmatched\n* We're both very sensual people and thus the sexual tension there is extremely apparent\n\nHowever, she now wants to pursue a relationship. So do I. But I also feel that I love the girl I'm currently with. I feel like breaking up with her would crush her as well. I've known what it's like to get attached and burned, and I'm too empathetic (not in a braggadocios way of course. Just a softy at the end of the day) to comfortably do that to her. They both deserve the world, and idk how I can give it to both of them\n\nPlease help. I'm emotionally overloaded and anxiously shutting down
4	So, I have a thought to add to all the great advice you've been given so far. Now, it's going to sound horrible, but hear me out first.\n\nSomething I do when I can't make a decision is: I flip a coin. Now, what you would do is pick Heads: INFP, Tails: ENFP, then obviously you flip the coin. But this next part is key. When the coin is in the air, you might get a twinge of what you want it to land on, or once it lands you might feel either relief or you might feel like you wish it landed differently, and in that moment is when you pick what you wanted it to be and disregard what it actually landed on.\n\nThis tactic has helped me a ton in my life, and I haven't regretted anything I picked after doing this exercise so far. \n\nI think you should give it a shot. It might not work, but could be worth a try. 
3	If you try to keep both, you will lose both. If you stay true to your gf, you may repair and salvage friendship. If you date your best friend, you will ruin your relationship with your gf and your BFF will become your gf. If you break up you likely will not be able to remain friends or very least won't be best friends anymore 
4	Break off the thing with INFP.\n\nBeing 100% honest here, I don't really like the vibe given off by your INFP friend, just according to you've said. Something's just... off. I've known people before that sound just like her, and uh it wasn't so great. Yeah I know, she's nice, understanding, has insecurities in a way that's oddly cute, *just got rejected by her the guy she liked*. This latter reason would lead me to believe that she's... how do I put this... allowing you to be her rebound guy? Trust me, not a great situation to be in. You both may not even realize that it's the situation you're in, but trust me, that's the situation you are in right now. To top things off, you guys only know each other online. IRL friendships/relationships is a whole different ballgame. Things tend to be exaggerated online and it's easy to get.. overly infatuated?\n\nAlso, physicality is ***NOT*** everything. I know how the falling-for-girls thing is (being a M INFP, I know how easy it is to become infatuated - it's really easy). Attraction in that area is important, yeah, but it's something that fades away - not such a great trait to base a relationship on.\n\nRealistically speaking, you already have a good irl friend in your ENFP friend, and she seems to legitimately be into you (unlike INFP friend, not saying I don't think *she* likes you, she just doesn't seem as authentic, imo)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReasons for ENFP friend:\n\n* You appear to know her *very* well, and she knows you equally well\n* You know her IRL, a big plus\n* It'd be more practical (bc of distance; not that practicality is a substitute for love)\n* You're both very open (this is a huge plus, *nothing* can replace it)\n* She's your *best friend*, and it seems like you've known each other for a while\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut in the end, I think it will ultimately come down to friend loyalty, for you. All I can say is that if I were in your shoes, it'd be ENFP 100%.\n\nYou've got no reason to listen to me, of course, but I feel like it wouldn't be a bad idea to take my advice consider your ENFP.\n\nHope everything works out
1	So just to confirm, you are in a relationship with the INFP right now?
0	To add to this all too, type doesn't mean shit. Don't categorize people. They are who they are. You clearly vibe with both

0	Are ENFPs really this good at spotting INFPs	So I'm at first year at college and met a lot of new and interesting people, but these two girls that I had best time with and I'm now practically best friends with, came out to both being INFPs! Crazy right.\n\nBoth were so chill and away from big groups so I approached them (I think it's the reason why) and we instantly clicked.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat you guys think of us weird ENFPs? XD
1	I'd say I'm pretty good at spotting ENFPs (especially female ones). Hands down the best people out there. The only type of people who actually seem truly interested and are able to understand me.\n\n>away from big groups so I approached them\n\nTypical ENFP thing and I love you to death for that trait. I don't seem very inviting to people even though I'd like to get closer to some and my approaches are very dry, awkward and my resting bitch face isn't helping much.\n\n&#x200B;

I only just now made the connection that they can sorta correspond to these functions (maybe? depending on how you look at it?). I mostly adopt the definitions that [DaveSuperPowers](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWWwQlDFnYbX_dgDP8lJ09A) has on his channel, but also I'm just going by my intuition (which I feel changes a lot (which is why I can never conclusively decide on a type for myself)).\n\nSo yeah, this post is more or less just my 2 cents.
5	What fictional character do you identify with?	What fictional character(s) do you think you are most like? Some I can really relate to are:\n\nCharlie Brown\n\nWirt (over the garden wall)\n\nHank from Swiss army man

14	Does anyone else ever feel like an alien?	I constantly feel like I don't ever really belong with the group of people I hang out with or the places I go, I just constantly feel like an outcast, it's a weird feeling that I'm pretty used to but sometimes it just comes with so much force it knocks me on my ass and I'm not myself for like a week. I don't know if you guys feel this ever but it's really weird and uncomfortable (even for me, and I love weird and uncomfortable stuff). It's really strange to feel loved and unwanted at the same time. Does anyone else ever get this feeling?
6	I've always felt like I was a slightly different species.
3	Yes, pretty much for all of my life so far. Wherever I went, no matter the people around me, I felt like a stranger. And I was very anxious about this. Wherever I went, there was no feeling of belonging etc. I fought this feeling, really Hard, doing things out of my Comfort zone, befriending people I should not even talk to, dangerous things even. It has helped me somewhat, but in the end, I realized I have to just accept myself as I am. This May be different from Your experience, we are all unique beings After all. I have always felt I was different, trying to fit in. I still do, sometimes. But After years and years of suffering, I am learning to accept my differencies.\nWhat helped me really was just to accept myself (it wasnt Easy and took 3 years of therapy). I still feel like an alien sometimes, but now I am OK with that :) Like I said, we are all different and maybe this is not the right path for you... Just my experience. Good luck, my friend :)\nEdit: i dont know Your age, but I am 34

2	Just like any other INFP, Embrace yourself, grow your roots & accept yourself. \n\nYou are (and will be) a huge inspiration to those around you and so many other people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nif you love weird and uncomfortable don't expect everyone to understand you, but find the people who do understand and appreciate you, be yourself to the fullest extent and these people will love you so fucking much. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBe yourself, and find the right people in life. there are other aliens out there man, were in this reddit sub, we love ya man.
3	College	What were you guys college majors and/ or college experience? Did you go to a small, liberal arts college or a big state university? Did you ever feel conflicted when choosing your major? Kind of like between an actual career and a thing you‚Äôd like to study. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm feeling right now. 
3	I went to a medium-size college located in the major city near me. I started with political science then switched to urban development and then emergency management. I felt stuck because I while I was interested in them, I didn't want to necessarily turn them into a career. I then stumbled onto social work and loved it! I went in to graduate school and have been working as a mental health therapist for three years now. It may take a while to figure out what you want to do but you will eventually find it!
2	My 1st major was international relations. I loved learning about other cultures, studying foreign languages, and geography, etc. But I changed it my sophomore year to English Language and Linguistics. I realized freshman year my writing skills were subpar and I wanted to improve my English. I graduated wanting to teach English in Japan through the JET Program, but I was denied. That broke my heart. So I worked in retail for a while, then as a pharm technician. Then at a non profit. And then now I work in healthcare and I am getting my second bachelors but this time in Nursing.
2	Small school in a small town in Wisconsin with lotssss of hiking trails and one of the cutest downtowns I‚Äôve ever seen. Mostly an agriculture school actually; a lot of people go for Agribusiness or pre-vet degrees. I was sure I was going to major in micro genetics and counseling so I could be a genetic counselor but then SURPRISE! I had what some might call an epiphany the summer after my senior year in high school and then bam now I‚Äôm studying to be a choir teacher. 
2	I'm majoring in economics rn and it's okayish tho
2	Pursuing a bachelor's in computer science. Interested also in linguistics and psychology 
2	Majored in Computer Science at a big tech school in Boston, but flunked out because of a depressive episode. Now I'm living at home and going to community college to get my associates in CS. \n\nI've known that I want to be a software engineer for about a decade now, so no, I never felt conflicted. \n\nMy college experience was really rough, actually. After the first semester my roommate decided to move in with his friend, so I got a single, which was amazing, but it allowed me to isolate myself like crazy, which was really bad for my mental health and by extension, my grades. 
145	Too real	
10	Are other INFPs sad or something?  I love my life.
2	I laughed a little too hard because I remembered the BPD Anakin memes.
3	Ironic, he could save others from sadness, but not himself
3	We CAN learn this power, it's just a high level spell.
4	Not from an INFP
1	It's absolutely possible to learn this power. 
1	Tell us about it? 
57	Taking in the View	
2	I won‚Äôt tell anyone but where is that magical place of solitude and silence 
2	I wanna pet your dog, please
29	Infp and Procrastination	We have so many dream but zero motivation .\n\nI always study 2 days before a test . I always start something i like but i never end it .\n\nThis state of mind make me stressfull , i have a bad image of myself , i think " why am i like this? Why others know what they do but i'm enable to understand how it's work?" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen i meet  difficulty , i prefer to give up and listen to music or watching stupid videos. 
7	I'm using Reddit to procrastinate right now! :)\n\nIt's like the risk of failure doesn't begin to outweigh the benefits of putting it off until we realize the window of opportunity for completing a task is almost closed. We hate chaos, and yet we perpetuate it.\n\nAs a protective mechanism against procrastination, I started doing things as soon as possible. I either freak out about getting something done RIGHT NOW, or I put it off until the very last minute. There's just no alternative. \n\nThe good news: my fear of professional failure is greater than my love of procrastination. At work, I turn in everything early.  Adulting sucks.
3	I am procrastination.
3	I don't think being an INFP means you're inherently lazier or lack willpower, it might mean you have the predisposition to succumbing to that sort of a mindset, but you always have a choice, regardless of what you scored on a test.
2	Yes, I'm supposed to be cleaning my house for company right now. Guess I better go do that. I just wanted to say that starting 2 days ahead to study for a test is really good for Infp. I almost never studied for tests at all, unless it was the hour right before the test and even then I usually had no idea where my notes had gone.
2	I‚Äôm a king of procrastination and it sucks. I just don‚Äôt want my mind to think about it and just do it. I‚Äôm stubborn aswell. 
1	I can relate so much to this
1	I've been giving this a lot of thought but procastination plays a big part of my day too.\n\nA planner changes things though. Heres something i tried for a semester and i did manage to score a 4.0 that sem.\n\n1) Create a list of tasks sorted by type: school, home and work.\n\n2) Work through the list of tasks by order of prority.\n\n2) Keep writing each task you complete underneath the day you complete it.\n\nIt works cause it feels good to write down a finished task once its done.\n\nIt's just harder to do those tasks on somedays than others.
1	Left to my own devices, I will procrastinate like no other.\n\nThe simple trick I use on myself is to loop other people into the task. Having other people involved creates a certain level of accountability.\n\nMy fear of letting others down always overpowers my procrastinating tendencies.
1	shit I never studied haha... always last possible moment like bus ride to the exam... and I procrastinate a lot, but I can be highly efficient in a shorter period of time..\n\nmeaning in my job I usually do nothing for like 6 hours... then in 2 hours I do more work than some of my colleagues in a full day.\n\nbut yeah it's really easy to fall deep down the procrastination/thinking hole, try to think of the tasks you have to do in the smallest possible way. Like instead of thinking "god I have to learn 300 pages"... always think of it I am going to learn just this 1 page... etc... that helps me a bit
3	How do you guys avoid procrastination and at the same time, be productive?	I woke up this morning and then I had a thought.\n\n"If I can discard my feelings and then just follow what I should do, then I'll be productive and successful."\n\nLike now, instead of lying in bed because I still feel sleepy, if I can follow what I should do like getting up despite of being sleepy and do works, then I'll be productive and succeed?\n\nHow do you guys manage to be productive?\n\nPlease share your tips
2	Lol! Totally know how you feel. I can waste a whole day napping! One thing I like to do is force myself to do at least 1 thing a day. Whether it is 1 errand or 1 goal or 1 household chore, just something. If I did at least 1 thing I don't feel as guilty.
