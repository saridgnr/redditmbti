6	Looking for Moderators.	As we all know, this sub is relatively inactive and quiet compared to the other MBTI subs. Throughout my 2ish years as the occasional spam remover, I've seen that many people would like this sub to be more lively. So I'm putting out a call for anyone interested in becoming a mod. \n\nIdeally I'd like to have a few people come aboard to contribute in discussion threads, features, CSS, or whatever else you have to offer in order to help grow our community. \n\nIf anyone is interested shoot me a pm or leave a comment.\n\nAlso if you'd rather not take on the responsibility of being a mod but have some ideas for the sub, comment here and I'll try to implement them.\n\nLet's try to break 1,000 subs!
2	I'm around, not sure what I could contribute though. I suck at CSS.
1	Oh, pick me! :D\n\nI'm really intense, and study Jungian works pretty much every day. In addition, I'm pretty well-versed in evolutionary theory and I have an interest in the philosophy of religion.\n
10	Banner for the Sub	I would love to work more on making this subreddit more aesthetically pleasing. I would love for us to have a banner on this sub! Is anyone interested in making one? If you do, feel free to post them on [moodboard](http://www.gomoodboard.com/boards/CHkep071/share). One of them will be selected and used. \n\nThank you so much and have a great day!
2	Over at INFP we had users submit image ideas to a sticky-post [moodboard](http://www.gomoodboard.com/), then selected the favorite for our banner. 
1	Holy crap, haven't been here in just over a month and we now have a banner and everything! LOVE IT 
1	I need more karma so I can make an INFJ/ESFP post on this thread.

1	Zyzzy boy too soon for you. Jeff pls go.
2	Need some questions to know if I'm esfp	Hey guys! I've been taking the mbti test for a couple of years once in a while and i always got the same result : esfp. I was always a social butterfly and love changing as many groups as possible and being in the middle of attention, I love humour and spreading good vibes everywhere I go but I'm stiĺl not sure if I am an esfp. Can you give me some questions that could define an esfp to the core?
3	You sound a lot like my best friend/roommate who is an esfp. You two should talk to each other so I can get some peace and quiet.
1	All of what you've said is common in ESFP, but does not define ESFP and relates to a whole bunch of other aspects outside of this taxonomy (Enneagram, instinctual variants, other).\n\nESFP is about your cognition, specifically, your perceiving and judging cognitive functions and their stacking.\n\nDo you perceive the world in cold hard facts, that are tangible and observable, as opposed to say, a multitude of possibilities? When someone asks you to logically justify your point of view, do you find it exciting to talk semantics and logically explain, or do you find it unnerving and almost like a personal attack? Are ethics objective and shared, or do you have a very personal value system that may or may not align with that of society, and an understanding that it's exclusive to you, and others may not align?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not the most structured, so it would be good to get questions from others, but those should help, somewhat.
10	Every ESFP ever	
9	To clarify I did NOT mean the sheep sex part!!
1	lol
1	Sweetest Lord please hold my benis
5	Do you have a career you like?	Hi all, \n\nI am a coder, and as an ESFP, I couldn't have chose a more depressing career. I am at my desk all day staring at my screen in a small, quiet office going absolutely OUT.OF.MY.MIND.\n\nI just did it at uni because back then I didn't do much besides gaming (huuuuge self esteem issues that I have mostly fixed), but now I still struggle with abstract concepts and its really ruins my mental state by the end of every working day (combines with lack of social interaction at work).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI guess I have accepted I will need to change jobs, but I am kind of worried and would love to hear what some of you do/how you got there?
1	I am in my last year of my undergrad in a Bachelor of Public Relations and I am hoping to be part of an agency or freelance in the future. I really enjoy it, and I’m excited I see where it takes me later on. I think there are a lot of options out there for PR depending on what peaks your interest. I wish I could give you more guidance, but I think you should follow your heart and make a big change in your career. You’re obviously unhappy and the time you spend miserable at work is just time that could be spent looking at other positions! Good luck with everything.
1	This may not be helpful. I’m a physical therapist.. I am around people all day which is nice, but can’t say I’m satisfied with my career choice. I’ve been trying to pinpoint what it is.. i think it’s partly I don’t like feeling that others depend on me and I don’t like my schedule being set for me. Definitely understand why you feel the way you do, especially with the lack of interaction. Kudos for recognizing your dissatisfaction and being willing to make a change!
1	I'm finishing up school and starting my career in commercial photography and it's pretty great. Right now I'm focusing a lot on retouching (working right now but always distracted haha) simply because it's good paying work I can do from anywhere. I'm trans and still in the really early stages of my transition so I'm afraid I won't be able to get a lot of assisting work simply because people suck haha so I'm trying to put a lot into work that doesn't matter if I confuse people with my looks. But I plan to diversify my work and root it in people. I can't work anywhere near product photography and architecture is ehhh. I love retouching portraits since I get to stare at people still and connect with them lol But yeah I love working with people and translating their feelings to photos!
1	I am currently a musician, traveling around europe and playing on streets. I set up my own schedule and i meet lots and lots of people. I don't think there could be a better option for me
2	Can any other ESFPs relate?	I'm an ESFP and I'm definitely not your stereotypical social butterfly lol. I try to reach out and introduce myself and talk to people, but nothing really sticks and I end up back on my phone again lmao. I mostly spend Friday nights voice chatting on discord. It's not like I don't want to hang out irl, it just doesn't 'work out.' And I don't mind it, because I can still get my socialization from the internet even if I get rejected irl rofl.\n\nI really enjoy talking to people, but I also don't mind being alone if they don't enjoy talking to me. Memes, discord, reddit, etc are still fun. My social life could be more active, but everybody expects you to put on some kind of persona or else you'll be socially outcasted. Online, you can socialize just fine and not have to deal with all that garbage. Don't get me wrong, I like socializing irl, but I guess I don't want to be the one planning everything and constantly being on my game for strictly following social norms lol.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Am I the only one? 
2	Not wanting to follow social norms seems to be an ESFP trait, and I feel you on hanging out not "working out." A lot of my friends are busy and introverts, or are just far enough where I can't just run over for the night and hang out.
2	Some of my favourite friday nights are not spent in a club, but instead spent texting randoms on tinder cause i want to sit at home in my undies eating kfc chicken but also talk to new people. 
2	What is your enneagram type?	I'm 7w8 and my tritype is 378
2	7w8
1	7w6 379 so/sx
1	I’ve never heard of this test before but I just did it. I got 2w3 
0	Are esfp girls slutty?	My crush is an esfp and it would literally break my heart if she wa that type of girl. \n\nAlso what are your thoughts on sex? \n
2	I have not great experience with ESFP but I guess sluttiness is more nurture than nature. \n\nt.isfj
1	you shouldn’t slut-shame, yung fuccboi
2	INFP/ESFP relationships	Heyo, what are your opinions on INFP/ESFP relationships? friendships, crushes, romantic relationships, hookups, I wanna hear it all. 
1	My sister is an infp and many of my friends as well. I feel that our relatioships don't last. I always get a feeling that they will never put as much into the friendship as I will or as I wished they did. Me and most of those infp friends don't talk anymore tbh...
1	Pretty good. One of my longtime friends is an INFP. We have always got along, even though unlike me he is pretty idealistic(but at the same time understanding) and our tastes in art are mostly different
5	ENFP Male Interviewing ESFP Female Andrea Kwan Se-Fi CP/B(S) MF	
1	Who’s Dave...?
1	just wondering how ESFPs would respond to this	[u/throwaway3n1p](https://www.reddit.com/u/throwaway3n1p) and I are currently working on gathering answers for how thought processes work in different MBTI types. This is just out of curiosity, not an attempt to stalk you according to how you think of grave crimes. All replies are appreciated!\n\nIf we count judgments of *moral obligation* out of the equation, \n\nQuestion 1: How is murder logically fine?\n\nQuestion 2: How is murder logically wrong?\n\nNOTE: Feel free to write down whatever thought you have, whether it is emotional or just plain retarded.
2	1. Murder is logically fine if the recipient of death is going to cause more deaths or worse deaths than their own death. It would not be wrong to kill someone if they are harmful to a great many people, aka Hitler, Stalin, and some current politicians I won’t name. Do the ends justify the means?\n\n2. In the same sense, murder is not logically correct because the people deserve to live and though they may have done wrong — we have prison for that sort of thing. Though it does leave you with the question — if someone asks to be killed or will live in suffrage, is murder okay? 
2	Murder is logically fine when you take a step back and note that it’s part of the circle of life. That animals have killed other animals for survival/for fun and that our remains decompose to feed the grass and trees. \n\nKind of like what Mufasa says in the Lion King
1	This question hugely conflicted me. I'm very much against killing, however if put in a scenario of kill or be killed I think my survival instinct would take over. However the question is excluding moral obligation, and purely out of a logical sense.\n\n1) I think murder is logically fine when defending yourself or others from someone from certain death. Logically speaking, you will be removing an evil, malicious person from the gene pool whilst potentially saving multiple lives. \n\n2) I think murder is logically wrong in all scenarios not described in point 1. I can't think of any logical reason murder is fine other than to defend yourself.
1	In my opinion nothing is right or wrong in itself, things only become good or bad inside of a subjective value system
1	1: I don't even believe in capital punishment, as long as we have means to detain dangerous criminals. Look at Ted Bundy, who was an absolute monster, but was useful in profiling serial killers that helped catch others, not only by studying him, but by him sharing his mind about what a person like that looks like, how they think... If instead of executing him, they kept him in a high-security prison, they could have actually made use of him.\n\n2: Without murder being illegal, society would crumble. You need to have a sense of security to self-actualize. Just look at Maslow's pyramid of needs. And without self-actualization, we don't make progress as a civilization. Mind you, we wouldn't be overpopulated, but...
1	1. Murder is never logically fine, if by *fine* you mean something *of high quality*. Is murder logically *right –* as in the proper inverse of (Q2.) *wrong* – and I am to assume by "right," you mean something "morally right" or *ethical,* then I would say: it depends.\n2. Now, how can murder be logically wrong? Or "morally" wrong? It depends. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI should note that I studied philosophy with an emphasis in David Foster Wallace in college, so I'm not so sure if my response above is indicative of "being" an ESFP. If anything, it's indicative of me being a complete cunt.
1	1. Killing people is bad. Justifying bad behavior is bad. So I won’t. It is not logical.\n2. Killing people is bad.
2	Survey on Personality and Flirting behaviors	 \n\nThe following survey has moderator approval. Hey I am a doctoral Student at a University in the South. I am studying flirtation behaviors, specifically trying to catalog specific flirting behaviors taken from several experimental studies. I was wondering if I could post to this community as it seems relevant to my topic. Thank you in advance for taking the time to take the survey there is an opportunity to win a gift card if the entire survey is completed. You can back out at any time.\n\nHere is the link to the survey\n\n[https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JMQP5PJ](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JMQP5PJ)\n\nThank you again for taking the time
1	Done! FYI there were a lot of repeat questions, and the question “there are rules men and women should follow” is too vague. In context, I can gather what you’re trying to ask but it’s likely you’ll want to dismiss those results from your findings. \n\n\nAlso what’s with the “Choose strongly agree” questions?? Jus curious if it had any purpose or just needed for troubleshooting problems 
15	Why do ESFPs tend to "win" in social situations?	Can anyone explain to me in Jungian terms (or really any terms) why ESFPs tend to be so good at being socially popular? I read once that this type tends to "win" in social situations and I find this to be generally true. \n\nESFPs tend to be stereotyped as being the class clown or like the pop star, but there are other less flashy, notable ESFPs who just know how to work a room. The politicians like Bill Clinton or Chris Christie are two examples. \n\nIs this a function of Extraverted Sensing? Given that they intuitively know what people in a group are looking for, so to speak, some ESFP's I've met seem to have a sort of version of Extraverted Feeling. 
13	I can only speak from personal experience. I feed off of the energy in a room and am pretty aware of the vibe and the roles everyone is playing in any particular crowd. Because I can get caught up in a bad vibe as well as a good one, I gravitate towards whoever has the best energy and then bring people into it ! It pumps me up and inspires me to try to include everyone in that bubble of happiness. lol. \nI also LOVE people. I love getting to know them and the feeling of breaking through social carriers with them. \nI can admit, however, that I won't stay for too long after I feel satisfied with the conversation. \nAlso, being as adventurous as I am, I always have a good story to tell. \n\nI hope that answers some of it. I feel like I ranted a little. \n
5	I would actually disagree with this to an extent. A lot of the people most assume to be ESFP aren't ESFP. The two most common types that are likely to be mistaken for ESFP are ENFJ and ESFJ, both of which have dominant Fe a focus on group harmony, which results in being either more adaptable to fit the group dynamic, or by being more capable of influencing the group dynamic to suit yourself.\n\nI wouldn't say that ESFPs are popular per se. Some are very much so, others not at all. ESFPs value Fi, hence are individualistic, and are only willing do to so much to adapt to the social situation. However, they are an ethical type, and they lead with dominant Se, which enables you to perceive the world through opportunities, being aware of the environment, giving you a heads up to adapting. The popular ones are popular because they are fun and fearless. Also, if they have a more 'cheerful' Enneagram type, paired with dominant or auxiliary social instinct, they will be more likely to be popular than an ESFP Enneagram 6, with a 4 fix, that is sx/sp or sp/sx, which will stick out like a sore thumb, may attract a more cult following, but definitely fails at social.
3	It's easy for me to tell the moods of everyone around me and I'm confident, which attracts people. Another thing is having the right words to say, which I attribute to Fi and Te, I find it easy to talk to people in their own language so to say. Instead of trying to bring everyone into my own world I use phrases and examples that *they* can understand and relate to. Also the general awareness of my surroundings, I can notice something that's happening that will interest everyone and generally check on people in my group to see that everyone is good
2	I would say I am too fickle and selfish with attention to be any other type. Although it's exciting and I like to inspire, I also know I'll become disinterested and move on once I get to know them. \nBuuut, im new to this stuff. There's an awesome group chat that might help. It's in WhatsApp. Want me to see if I can send you the link to join ?
2	I relate to a lot of things about ESFP, but this is definitely not one of them lmao. For me, it’s more **HOLY CRAP A BUNCH OF PEOPLE I WANNA GO TALK TO THEM XDDDD**, then I go and most likely make a fool out of myself, or they laugh, who knows. But I definitely don’t “intuitively read the room,” in fact quite the opposite. I just go off and be myself, and if I get rejected, shiieeeett, if I don’t, noiicceeee. lol \n\nI also suck with social cues, it’s not that I don’t see them, it’s because I feel like “ONE DIRTY LOOK AIN’T GONNA SHUT ME DOWN ECKSDEE” and I keep going. Bites me in the ass a lot tbh but I’m working on that
2	In my experience I genuinely enjoy meeting new people. I'm excited to hear their story and tell them mine. I always welcome new friends and opportunities to be social. I'm also goofy, energetic, and always looking for something fun to do.\n\nI've been told I come off as approachable for this reason.\n\nI tend to make friends (and boyfriends) easily.
1	You don’t. 
1	Se/Fi\n\nthe Se gives the here now thing (as we all know), and this generally works the best in average sensor-based social situations (which, if we run the numbers, are far more common than intuitive-based interactions), and the Fi auxiliary tends to give the user a greater sense of empathy, so what i assume is happening is that here in the conversation right now, the esfps are easily able to connect with many persons' emotions in encountering everyday problems. this (for some reason, i personally cannot fathom why this is), tends to be a really attractive personality for this reason.\n\nalso, the Fi makes their social interactions a lot less assholey than estps, making interactions benign enough for the more sensitive types to be comfortable dealing with.
6	Jet's MBTI - Cast Podcast	Hey Reddit, my name is jetplane48 (ESTP 7w8 sx/sp) and I am starting up a podcast in relation to MBTI. Fundamentally, the goal of the podcast is to educate the viewers of several Typology systems through a series of one-on-one's with others who are interested in the same topics. I have been conducting interviews for many years (MBTI related) and this is just an extension of that, however, I want to discuss topics that the audience wants me to cover. Naturally, I'll come up with my own material but I would love to explore topics that others have in mind. I am busy with school for the next few months but when I finish, the goal is to eventually be more consistent with these podcast uploads if this turns out to be popular enough. I'm very excited to get this started, and let's see some questions!\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAR20eDTSOg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAR20eDTSOg)\n\n&#x200B;
8	Are you good with money?	There's a stereotype that ESFPs are bad with money and are always impulsively spending it. Personally I'm the opposite of that, people have called me stingy before, I never spend it on things I don't need and always save some. How about you?
4	I was super bad at saving money when I was a child, now that I am more aware of my shortcomings, I think I’ll be a lot better with money in the future!
2	I have been taught to save from a young age to save, and I don't have big weekly expenses so it isn't an issue much yet. I feel like when I move out, my spending habits will become more apparent. I tend to have periods of time where I spend a lot of money over a few days. I mentally feel like 'I shouldn't be doing thissssss.' But that doesn't stop me.
2	I'm by no means the worlds greatest penny pincher, but I use my poor planning to my advantage and always assume I'll over spend (which I rarely do). Plus with inspiration from The Now, I can always entertain myself and friends on a budget. So. In a way. I guess I am pretty okay with money.
1	I'm really good with money only cuz I'm minimalist and do a lot flipping, so I don't hold on to much at all
1	I can be better
1	I'm not good with saving any, but I have learnt to pay my bills before I do the rest. I spend too much on food and experiences. And whenever I try to build a buffer, there is some unexpected extra expense that has to go, so I never save anyway.
1	Not at all...\n\nBut I’m working on it :)
1	i feel like esfjs would generally be worse with money. just an intuition
7	ESFP and relationships	Hey, \n\nSo happy I found a community for ESFPs. I'm just wondering if anyone else of you have "problems" with settling down. I know it's not a must but what makes you to settle down with the one and only? I find it extremely hard to find the right person. I hate that I miss the feeling to be in love. I go on dates but blah. ESFPs won't settle and sometimes I feel it's a problem. Sorry for this opening up but jeez, I just feel lonely right now. 
8	I'm also an ESFP and I find that it's not I can't settle down, more I can't find the perfect one. I'll be up front and say I have an image of a perfect girl in mind and though I know a person might never really be like that, I tell myself I don't want to date till I find that person. I'm fully aware that it's a problem on me and not society but I think I'm happy knowing that I'm ok flying solo till the perfect girl in my eyes comes by. 
4	Totally. I read something hilarious somewhere (this sub maybe), that said 'ESFP's don't seek out a partner, they just don't get sick of someone for long enough for it to happen.' Exactly my situation right now. My bf is 5 years older than me and a lot more about settling down, whereas that almost scared me off at points. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think realising that anything meaningful has to begin small is important. Maybe someone can become the perfect person. The best relationships offer growth for the both of you. You learn from each other and can try to make small changes that are big for you partner, and vice versa. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe can't live in denial and think we are going to meet someone perfect, and realistically, we are nobodies perfect person either, because we are not perfect ourselves! We all have flaws, and the idea of the perfect person is only going to stop you from putting yourself out there. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEssentially, if the pros outweigh the cons, and you are both growing, they can become your perfect person, and you need to date a bit for experience to not lose them when you find them!
3	I don’t know if this is an ESFP thing, but I always want what I can’t have. I go for girls way out of my league and when I get one to like me back I don’t like them anymore. I’ve done this so many times and I regret not dating them. \n\nI legit think I’m afraid of commitment. 
4	HELP PLS	Hi ENFP male here been talking to this lovely ESFP girl as of late but I can't express this cauldron of emotions I'm experiencing to her in the articular manner I was before knowing about her personal life. \n\nWe were talking real dirty and then she opened up to me and now I just feel all soft and shit and wanna keep sweet talking her instead cause I feel like I care about her now as a person but obviously this is killing that primal flame between us. \n\nShe's been pretty patient with me for the most part but I really wanna treat her like the naughty little thing she is , it's her kink.\n\nESFP females, what do i do ? pls help me lol, I'm emotionally spazing out and i can't think straight 😂\n\n
7	I really don't know. I don't much care for people who center their behavior around me. It feels constricting. Focus on yourself. Sure, show interest, but I tend to be attracted to men who know their value. Also, I am *definitely* NOT romantic, and I find sweet-talk off-putting. That does not mean that every ESFP is the same, however.\n\nThe way people who were attractive before stop being attractive is by re-centering their world around me, instead of themselves.
7	Definitely along the same vein as u/horrorito!\n\nFemale ESFP here. The men I'm most attracted to are the ones who know what they want and aren't impressionable by me or anyone. Same deal with being almost instantly turned off if a guy puts me on a pedestal and tailors their behavior to make me happy.\n\nI don't know if this applies to all ESFPs but I'm really good at reading when people are insincere or their actions are calculated for some kind of return later - i.e. sex! As soon as that happens, I lose complete interest. If you were attractive to me before then you have no reason to start calculating extra shit! I will definitely get wild and dirty on you. :)\n\nI hope this helps... best of luck!
7	I’m so curious, do any other of you ESFPs have weird dreams? I have had really interesting dreams my whole life and I can usually remember them the next day. My husband is an INTJ and he says he has dreams (he thinks) but can’t remember them. What is dreaming like for you fellow ESFPs?	
2	My dreams are very vivid and based on reality, and all the while I'm aware it's a dreams but I'm separated like in two people; the one in the dream and the one controlling it who also hates myself. So dreams are always stress dreams hahhh But I only have dreams like 2 or 3 times a month and they're barely rememberable
1	I can barely remember my dreams reeeeeee\n\nBut I can only assume they’re about things I think about a lot, I bet I had a lot of typology dreams I forgot oof
1	No, on the contrary my dreams are all based on reality. I don't think it's type related
1	One of my earliest memories is a dream I remember I kept having. Growing up I also had super vivid and colorful dreams, but it also stopped for a while. Then I spent ages trying to lucid dream and when I finally managed my dreams went away again. Now I remember them occasionally, and some nights I know I had a dream but I can’t recall them. \n\nMy SO who is an ISTJ dreams a lot as well, and according to him he only remember snippets of them, sometimes the full dream, but more often just bits and pieces of them.
1	I would have very intense dreams when I take melatonin. It’s actually pretty cool for me and I end up remembering it the next day. Don’t really have the same intensity of dreams if I don’t take melatonin 
1	I also commonly dream of real life people I already know. I don't think they reflect my thoughts but definitely showcase possibilities. I particularly enjoy the unrealistic ones lol. 
1	Your dreams are probably more interesting than your life.  \n\nLove,\nINTP
7	What jobs do you ESFPs LOVE?!	Howdy all - I'm currently going through a career crisis as I'm not enjoying my job at the moment. \n\nI feel like I'm too immature for a lot of responsibility and can't have as much fun as I crave in such a professional environment! I also really struggle with doing anything related to planning or long term thinking which is kind of crucial for my current job. \n\nSO. What are some of the jobs that you ESFPs out there have and absolutely love? Or even what jobs do you not love?
8	I am a nurse and I absolutely LOVE my job! Nursing school was definitely not a picnic because it was hard work over two years. However, the hard work was definitely worth it, I couldn’t see myself doing anything else. I work in an emergency room and I love all the action, it’s like watching a crazy movie all day. I get to interact with lots of people and my fellow coworkers. Quite a few of my nurse friends are also ESFPs so that makes for fun shifts. I recommend nursing to people all the time because there are so many different types of nurses! You could be an elementary school nurse, a flight nurse, a medical floor nurse, a travel nurse, or even a sales nurse who teaches. Literally the opportunities are endless AND you make great money.  There are always shortages of nurses so you always have the chance to job hop if you hate the one you’re in.  A perk for an ESFP is that if you work for the state you’ll get a pension so then you don’t have to do all that long term planning for retirement, it’s win win!
4	Omg I can freaking RELATE.\n\nI am a coder. I sit 9h a day at a desk in a very small office, where my job involved immense focus, lack of social interaction, constant planning, and abstract ideas/concepts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am totally lost career wise once I realised I chose the whole freaking wrong path in life. Still young so I can change, but I am kind of paralyzed by a lack of certainty on anything. Such a shitty feeling!
3	Ugggggh   I hear this.  I went through something similar. It took me until almost my 30's to find a job I was excited about and could stick with.\n\nI felt that all the "real" professional jobs had too much responsibility and were too high level and abstract for my Se brain to be equipped to handle. Waaay over my head.   Or the other end of the job spectrum where it was mundane clerical work which intellectually I could do but my soul would die.  So because of my lack of direction combined with love of people, I kind of defaulted into low paying-barely-above-minimum wage customer service jobs for YEARS.  \n\nI eventually found my way into the airline industry and I love it.  I am still customer service facing but it is faster paced and  incredibly challenging at times but in a hands-on figure out a solution in the moment kind of way which works for me.  It still isn't the most lucrative career but for me the value is in the life experiences it allows me to have.  Yes shift work is hard, but it also means your schedule is completely flexible and you are not locked into a 9-5.  You are feeling bored, need a break or adventure?  Trade your last few shifts this week and head to Mexico for a few days!  No problem.   Once I was there for a few years and was feeling a little stagnant professionally, I moved into a teaching role at the airport as well.  I've always loved teaching and somehow just ended up taking on the role of training  wherever I worked anyway, but being an actual teacher at a elementary or high school felt way too structured and demanding. So it works great for me on all levels right now.\n\nNot to say I will in this industry forever, but for now it checks all my boxes.  You just need to find your version of this!   Challenging in the right ways, hands-on, work with a big team of people by your side and FLEXIBLE!  Work need not be a prison\n\nGood luck on your job search :D
3	I am currently a sales rep, and it's my favorite job I've had in my life. Things change day to day, and I'm able to socialize and talk to people.
3	I don’t have a job yet, but I’d like a job that’s flexible and allows me to talk to people and sit my butt on discord too haha, and have a lot of nice co-workers that I eat chick-fil-a with every Friday and have fun outings with lol!
3	I loved my job as a Park Ranger.\n\nThe problem is, it's not a viable career as a parent and someone whose spouse cannot work.\n\nStill, if I could afford to live on the income, I'd do this job gladly.
2	Why not try bartending? 
2	Don't really have a job yet, but I'm finishing up school for commercial photography! I'm entirely focused on portraiture (big surprise) but haaate having to setup and organize so much stuff for shoots. I actually plan on working in portrait retouching for a bit simply because I need the money and it's much more stable and I also don't have to worry about much discrimination thru my gender transition. I find portrait retouching great because every photo is different, and I'm very involved with at least a face 😂 I want to work more with lifestyle photography and fashion though, I love the more candid nature and reality in it. Product photography makes me want to DIE I'm actually great at it but hate it so much. I want to be talking with someone and creating a photo based on their emotions and what they're acting out. My biggest problem is I just don't do good at organizing and setting things up
2	I hate my office job, not because of the people or the processes, but just because I'm stuck in the office in the first place. What I really wanted to be is a fireman. Or a stunt double. Or a film director. Or, if I knew then what I know now, I'd have invested more in sport as a kid, and would become a sport instructor. Say, gym and snowboard instructor.
2	I strongly disagree with nursing and customer service, function wise it's terrible for an ESFP(if it works for you then by all means continue). Sounds a lot more like careers suitable for SFJs\n\nThe best careers for us would be in business, sales, entertainment, personal instructor jobs, diplomacy, interpreting. Just picture your dream job and put in the work to get it. Easier said that done, but that's pretty much the only right way to do it. Also try not to put too much pressure on yourself about it, just choose what feels right and stick with it
1	I worked in what was basically a factory, packing food trolleys for airplanes. It was extremely repetitive, like how I would describe an office job, there were no customer interactions and we weren’t really allowed to talk too each other much. It drained me and I would frequently cry before work or have anxiety attacks in case my job called. It was an on-call job, so I had to be available to work immediately or the day after. It developed into serious anxiety, especially after an incident at work, so one day I just stopped picking up the phone. \n\nIt took me over a year to finally be somewhat ready to apply for jobs again, so now I am hoping for a cashier job at a grocery store near me, where I can interact with as many people as possible, feel helpful and productive, and most importantly just be happy. \n\nMy “long term” plan/goal is to get an education as a pharmacy technician so I can work at a pharmacy, which honestly sounds like a dream job for me!
1	I agree with those saying nurse and sales rep. Both are reputable jobs that work with strong personalities and confidence. Nursing school was something I tried and realized I didn’t want to clean up poop though so... anyways, I work in the ER as a Medication Reconciliation Tech. I go in, ask about what’s meds they take, type it all in, and I’m done. It’s similar to what a nurse does in the sense that I go into a patients room and talk to them about their medications, but it has none of the negative parts of cleaning up or breaking your back, which is nice. 
1	Sucking dick :3
1	Probably any job that involves talking.
18	...I just want to dance	Ya know when your day is amazing and then the most beautifully upbeat song comes on and you just want to DANCE. Just shake it to the tunes!\n\nWell, I can’t cause I’m on public transport and I don’t want to be booked for being a public nuisance. So... sharing my joy with y’all here. \n\nHave a great day everyone!
3	Pssh... dance away.  Spread the joy!! XD\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGlad you're having a good day, though!  (n\_n
2	This has been me for the last few weeks, dancing and singing everywhere I go. I just met the most awesome guy, I've been on cloud nine.
1	Yeesss! Now I'm dancing!\n\nYou have a crazy good day!
1	For a male teenager who doesn’t know the slightest thing about dancing but wants to love it... how? 😅
1	I boo out on the train all the time. I feel u
1	I love dancing. For someone who never did a class I feel like there's part of me that wishes it was a part of my life.\n\nI feel a bit too afraid at 24 to start 😂

3	Help with ESFP Best Friend	Hey, \n\nI am an INTJ and one of my closest friend is an EXFP ( I think she is an ESFP ) and we do get on pretty well. We do live far from each other ( around halfway across the world ) but I guess our bond is special or used to be. Since a few months she has been different, I noticed a pattern that there is one day everyweek when she will just ignore me ? Like I can spot that she is online elsewhere but will leave me on seen. Happened on Sunday but on Saturday she was like “Love you Chloek07” etc etc, I don’t get this inconsistent behaviour. I do understand she has other friends. She is modestly popular. I have told her if she can’t talk, then she can just let me know. But she never listens. Lately she has been dating a lot as well, it all started around the same time. She started going out more, I am a bit worried right now because there has been this change in her behaviour. She is out on dates every week, which is fine but it’s been a bit sudden. This and the inconsistent behaviour has me a bit worried. Also, she sometimes dodges my questions, I will ask her something and she won’t even reply to me. Just ignore my question. Idk I am a bit worried right now. \n\nEdit : She also has lied to me on a few occasions and I found out about it. A lot of white lies and keeping things from me. 
6	I have an friend who I share this type of relationship with, she is like a sister to me as well. In the past, it sometimes got super overwhelming for me to always have one person fighting for my attention, especially because I make friends easily and just talk to a lot of people in general. I always try to keep everyone I speak to happy, and when I constantly have to make sure that this one friend is always happy, I get tired and grumpy. Instead of yelling at her (because there isn’t anything to yell about) I tended to just ignore her for a bit. It was never maliciously meant, and I always got back to her later.\n\nESFP’s tends to not like being held down, and generally flows from groups to groups. Doesn’t mean you’re less important to her, just means she might enjoy different company once in a while.\n\nAlso try and think about the topics your conversations consists of. If it’s always about the same things, that can also be a reason she sometimes pulls away. 
4	I think you are over thinking. It's a world of constant connectivity and I personally find that I have to be in the right state of mind in order to respond to people. I leave them on "seen" because I can't stand the unread notification or because I absent mindedly open the app or because I have the time to read, but not respond. But mindlessly scrolling through social media doesn't take any effort (sadly) and therefore ends up being a place to go even when I don't have the energy to talk directly to friends. It's sad but it seems to be the norm now. \n\nI think you have two options: \n\n1) Talk to her directly about these issues. If you feel that both of your maturity levels can handle the adult conversation without hurting feelings afterwards\n\n2) Deal with it personally. Live a bit further from your cell phone and from her life, connect with other friends \n\n&#x200B;
3	EXFP here with high NN and super high SSS.  So what exactly are you "worried" about?  That she has a life? That she spends time doing other things? That she isn't a methodically predictable set of properties?  LOL.  I'm feeling a bit of clingy all over you and as an EXFP girl my general reaction to someone I kinda value but kinda rubs me wrong sometimes, is to just kind of tune out or ignore more often, the more they do the undesirable behaviour.  Clingy is undesirable, btw. Best advice:  just start initiating convos WAY less often.  What's the right amount?  Somewhere around when you achieve 50/50 with how often she initiates.
2	Are you dating? Because if not she doesnt really owe you anything. I know you are worried and have good Intentions, but its also not usually a good idea to push people when they are showing you they dont want to talk about something. I think the best thing to do is find some dates yourself, let her know you are supportive and dont push back when she dodges questions. \n\nIf that's too much for you maybe just take some time away to sort yourself out. \n\nThe last thing you wanna do is push her away by being too assertive and getting involved further than she wants. You can't protect her or help her recover when she is down if you arent around.
1	You know, people move on. Find more friends trust me.

3	ESFJs?	I'm an ESFJ, and I'm wondering how do ESFPs get along with us? I just met an ESFP (pretty sure anyway) and while y'all are super fun, you stressssss me out with the way you are so spontaneous! Trying to plan a date with this guy is a whirlwind of confusion lol
4	ESFP's are most compatible with SFJ's, due to cognitive synchronicity (opposite functions match like puzzle pieces)
2	I find that ESFJs tend to want to do what is in our interest most, but if an ESFP is into you we want to do what makes you happy. If we really dont want to do it we will voice it, but generally everything will be good. Try to just have fun with it! Disclaimer: This is my opinion atleast.
2	I can get along with ESFJs just fine, but only on a superficial level, like most people say here. Like talking about clothes, food, movies and stuff like that. But when it goes deeper, it will create conflicts. I know this from my experience with my ESFJ mom.
1	I often get along with ESFJs. We share zero valued functions, but we have demo Fe and they have demo Se, so there are ways we can bond. I guess we don't have all that much in common in how we operate, but I like the ESFJs (the healthy ones) around me.
1	I like ESFJ's. I think the most accurate word I can use to describe my relationships with ESFJ's is... Pleasant?\nHaving said that, I don't have many super close ESFJ friends, it tends to run on a more superficial basis. Usually my MO to be tight with someone is through shared experiences. Go out, have an adventure, do ridiculous things that you definitely  regret but would never take back, and now have lifetime of stories together that bond you. Sometimes ESFJs can be a bit traditional or constrained in their behaviour /actions so it's hard to have the big adventures with them. Or they think you're off the wall for what you're doing and they laugh and enjoy but don't really partake.. So there's a bit of a divide. In addition we chat about a lot of stuff but it's generally more superficial (that's also me, I need the Nx's to bring that out in me out in me otherwise i have a tendency for small talk)\n
1	Thanks for the insightful responses guys!!
1	ESFP here, get along with ESFJ in most things.  Food, parties, movies, outdoor fun, going out clubbing, etc. Occasionally they get hung up on some decision or ethics like totally "stuck" on right/wrong instead of perceiving that it really comes down to the final result of how everyone feels from it all, is what makes it right or wrong.  But NOT if you feel bad for no reason you don't deserve to, like getting all upset or jealous or some other feeling that's on you and your bad.
1	wait why are you planning a date?\n\na general rule of thumb i use as a strong introvert (and this actually works for me) is to behave how the other person likes people to behave in order to get in their comfortable zone, then work out how each other behaves as your true self, and if that works out, then youre into their really comfortable zone, and you end up being close friends for many years (i think)
3	Who are some examples of ESFP characters in video games	Hey everyone, like the title says, I’m curious to discover opinions of who are ESFP’s in video games from old to current generations. Joker from Mass Effect 1-3 is a spot on one
2	Carl Johnson from GTA San Andreas(also the SF-UR radio host)
2	Rakan from league of legends?
1	Prompto from FFXV? ESFP or ENFP I would say.\nThen maybe Yusuke from Persona 4?
1	Nathan Drake from Uncharted 
1	The white haired, blue-handed kid from Devil May Cry 4, or so I hear.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA swift check of Google tells me the guy is called Nero.
3	Created a subreddit for SPs	I think there about 20-30 of us SPs who regularly comment on mbti related subs, so I created a new sub for us.  \n\nPlease subscribe to  https://www.reddit.com/r/TheArtisans/ 
1	Niiiiiiice!
2	According to the internet I an ESFJ Are supposed to be #2 in compatibility with you ESFP.	I’ve never met an ESFP so I wanna hear if anyone has met an ESFJ and why or why don’t you like them. Why would we be at the top of the compatibility chart? Why do you think I would like you and why you like my type?
2	According to who? We're not very compatible, both function wise and according to socionics. It's not the worst combination, but it's among the ones you probably shouldn't be actively looking for
1	I haven't met one but sounds like a dream for some, since both types get along really well but the J is gonna keep the P in check hahah I'm more into opposites tho so I don't know if I could date someone as similar as myself
4	An ESFP who only seems to connect with iNtuitives?	I'm an ESFP and all my really good friends have been, and are, intuitives (ENFJx2, ENTJ, INFJ, ENFP,).\nI find while I have lots of sensor friends I enjoy, I don't actually connect as well as the N types.\nDoes any other ESFP find this? 
3	I think it might depend on your upbringing too. I'm an ENFP and I have an ISFP brother, and ISFP mother, and an ESTJ brother. That means I'm really really comfortable around Sensing types even though we still clash sometimes because we're just not the same. I really appreciate the balance that sensors bring to my world and my closest friends are sensors who share my values. My ISFP brother loves hanging out with sensors, but ultimately finds them not interested in talking about the bigger picture, abstract topics he and I love talking about and I can only imagine that the reason why is because I forced him to exercise his Ni for about 25 years. :)
1	There are N types and N types.\n\nESFP uses the following functions - Se Fi Te Ni. As you can see, the last one is an intuitive function. Therefore, they'll relate to Ni users, to some extent. ENFJ, ENTJ, INFJ all use Ni as well. ENFP on the other hand is on the other perceiving axis, and uses Ne and Si.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI find that for a long time, it was hard to find people in my life that use Se and Ni over Ne and Si, so it was frustrating. But I get along with other Se users as well as Ni users.\n\nAnd yes, I also have Ne friends as well.
1	DEEP OCEAN ISFP\n\nPRESS DESU TO GO MORE DEEP
1	Not really. Most of my friends are sensors tho. Any NF friends I had all flipped out on me.
1	> I don't actually connect as well as the N types. \n\nshould actually be phrased as\n\n> I don't actually connect as well with them as I do with N types. \n\nthe need for communication is one of humanity's greatest flaws; please do your best to master language to avoid problems.\n\nthis sort of makes sense, as esfps (and isfps) are (generally speaking) the most spontaneous of the sensor types, making it a lot easier to connect with and understand intuitives. (what surprises me most is how you got close to an infj, as thats really tricky even for other intuitives)
5	Why is everyone on here to quiet?	I'm just curious as to why more ESFP's aren't really talking on here or interacting... \n\nI was excited to join a sub with my personality type and it seems there's not much going on with this forum. What's up guys?? \n
13	Generally, the issue with ESFPs, and Se-doms in general, that they're not the type to sit on the compute all day and chat. They're more the type that is out there in the world, and comments on a 'I have time now' basis. Which can sometimes be often, but sometimes almost never.\n\nESFPs like to exert themselves on the world, and are very much kinesthetic focused, doing shit.
5	We all have awesome ideas but procrastinate to much hahahahaha \n\nOr we are to busy absorbing everything on the internet \n\ntrying to be friends with allllll the other subreddits \nHaha\n\nI get us....
4	What kind of type are you guys attracted to?	Do you have a crush/in a relationship with/has been compatible with any specific mbti's?\n\nShare with the word!
6	I’ve been with two INTJ’s in the past. I don’t know why, but I seem to be naturally attracted to INTJ’s. I’ve had minor crushes on a few as well, even before finding out that their type was that. So it was never a “Hey, you are an INTJ, I like you now”-kind of situation.\n\nHowever, been with an ISTJ for 3 years now and he is great!
4	ISFPs. They just fascinate me and always seem so fun.
3	My fiancé is an INTP/J and I find him to be incredibly attractive in every way. 😄 always have. 
2	I've dated a lot of ISTPs (sexy assholes) and dangerously attracted to ENTPs... :| who knows if I'm compatible with them though cause I've never had a successful relationship with either
1	Unfortunately... ENFPs. Romantically 
1	INFP...still cant get over him after 6mths of breakup\n
12	How do you guys deal with awkward silences?	I find that if that person doesn’t talk back I tend to feel uncomfortable around that person. Do you guys deal with this or is it just me?
9	Depends, I guess. I don't find silences awkward unless someone makes them so. There is huge merit to companionable silence.\n\nI'll just check in once in a while to see if all okay, or if they want to join me in some activity, but if they're good, I don't tend to break it, unless I have something I *want* to say.
7	I try not to talk too much cuz I tend to ramble and have a bit of social anxiety, honestly I've been learning to embrace silence and try to enjoy just the presence of the other person. But yeah no I'd rather there be talking 😂
5	I do too. I realize I go to great lengths to avoid awkward moments. \n\nI feel second-hand awkwardness/embarrassment so strongly from people that it almost gives me a light sense of social anxiety.\n\nTo others, it looks like I have great social skills because there are no awkward moments, but in my head it is taking so much mental power haha.
3	Don't really care about it honestly, I just stay quiet and then start a new conversation or just move on with whatever I was doing \n\nWhat you're describing tho is someone ignoring you, which I definitely can't stand. It's not as much awkward as it's annoying. I just ignore them back the next time they start talking to me and in general stay away from these types of people
3	People not talking back kinda hurts my pride haha. But it’s alright, I also sometimes intentionally lead conversations to deadends when I dont feel like talking so I understand when other people do it. I used to be very self conscious with awkward silences, but I grew to not really care and now they’re just silences. Maybe that makes some people uncomfortable but that’s the price I pay to be comfortable myself.
2	just talk more, talk to someone else or pretend i need to pee. i dont deal with it well haha
2	They never happen, I always fill the silence! 😋
2	In business I have to use a TON of willpower not to fill silence. It’s as unnatural as holding my breath but damn it’s a good strategy.\nSocially, I keep the convo flowing. 
1	There's nothing wrong with peace and quiet.
1	Wait... People actually get hurt when I don't talk?
1	I have absolutely no problem with silence. Some people have told me I male them nervous when I allow the silence. Shrug
2	Bad Santa(2003) a whole lotta Se	Willie(Bad Santa) - ESTP\n\nMarcus - ESFP\n\nThe kid - INTP\n\nGin(Bernie Mac) - ESTP\n\nSue - ENTJ\n\nLois(Marcus's wife) - ENFJ\n
1	I do too
8	How many of y'all have mental health issues?	Hi there! I am an ESFP f/16 and I have been struggling mentally for all of my pre-teens and teens. I am bipolar and have anxiety, depression, abandonment issues etc.\n\nI wonder, out of curiosity, do any of you other fellow Entertainers struggle with anything? I mean we have a tendency to be more emotional and put much more effort into pleasing others rather than pleasing yourself, is it just me?
7	Yep!  Depression, ADD and slight anxiety at times since age 11. I’m 24 now and it’s uphill from here, but I still have my manic weeks. 
6	>we have a tendency to be more emotional and put much more effort into pleasing others rather than pleasing yourself\n\nActually quite the opposite.  We have Fi so we're concerned with our own feelings, and we have Fe critic meaning we are critical of other peoples feelings.\n\nI'm 18m ESFP and struggled with deeply depressive feelings, anxiety, and drinking every night.  I spent a lot of time digging as deep into my mind as possible, where all the skeletons lie.  It put me through a lot of pain, but now I'm much better on the other side.  Oh, and LSD helped.\n\nKeep on keeping on.  Meditate, exercise, eat well, and find the right therapist.  I think it also helps to read philosophy and psychology to build your life outlook.
3	Not really, although I did have some anxiety as a teenager and get the blues here and there. Food helps me a lot when I'm a bit depressed, gotta keep the blood sugar at a decent level. Weed helps too if you know how to use it(and a few other drugs), but I don't know if you should do it\n\n>we have a tendency to be more emotional and put much more effort into pleasing others rather than pleasing yourself\n\nI completely disagree
2	ADHD-PI (ADD) here. So yeah, I get stressed super easily, depression comes and goes and so does the anxiety. Got diagnosed four years ago at 26 years old.
3	me! \n\ni have bpd. it's pretty hard. people dont notice it until they get too close because i usually put on a show, but its so easy to melt down one second and then switch back to being entertaining and cheerful the next.\n\ni go to two therapists but most people cant tell and so no one asks. i too empathise with having the desperate need to please others, but through therapy im learning self-love and do things for myself.\n\nstay heads up girl! you'll be right. just remember its ok to not be happy sometimes, and its ok to let urself be happy.
2	I think most people cope with something or other, though not everyone knows the labels of what they struggle with.\n\nFor me, it's ADHD constantly. I tend to struggle with off and on clinical depression. If I don't do enough mental hygiene, I have anxiety and occasional panic attacks. Some of it can be moderated, the rest I just have to deal with. The upside is, it gets easier over time as you learn healthy coping mechanisms.
2	ADHD and some anxiety/CPTSD stuff stemming from a not so good first 18 years of life. I think ADHD plays a part with our F-P functions, as it relates to our emotional deregulation and impulses.
2	I’ve been seeing a psychologist for years and years now, buddy. So, yes, I have my issues 😎
2	Absolutely (m/20). Lots of ugly traits. I've come to terms with it, learning to get rid of them and control yourself is part of growing up, I'm sure. I think the most important part is to keep gaining experience and doing new things you never thought you would do, introduce ALL kind of novelty into your life to show you new ways of doing things and allow your brain to develop new pathways and challenge the old ones, the old ways of thinking, broaden your perspective, keep a conscious mental monologue so that you can develop. Since the beginning of 2018 to today I've changed so much it's amazing, and the thing that kickstarted that change was a completely new group of people with whom I would normally never hang out and "falling in love" so to speak. Then it all was just ups and downs and learning your lessons. Keep growing man, have enough love and respect for yourself to actively go out of your way to experience new things that will allow you to realise all the goods and the bads in you and to finally end up as the best person you can be. Not gonna lie, it's going to be an extremely tough road but happiness man, the feeling of happiness after you realise how much you've changed and how much you love who you are now is worth it all. Always put yourself first, your mental state, that's like #1 mistake, being unable to cope with being you and having to cling on to other's approval and shit etc. to feel good, be it parents, friends, partner, whoever. Caring first and foremost for your own happiness is the only thing that will make people you care about respect you enough to also care about you. You will still have your bad moments but with a proper foundation you are going to pull through anything and always come out on top in the end :))))
2	I was very isolated growing up and really socially deprived, which still gives me some social anxiety. That's hella amplified by gender dysphoria and being trans with low self esteem, and then that opens up a whole new can of depression worms hahah Honestly I think depression and anxiety is more common for us than some others
1	ESFPs in nursing, teaching, childcare etc?	How do you guys feel about this? To me it's a big fat hell no, can't imagine any worse careers for myself than that, but I'm wondering what you guys think\n\nhttps://www.capt.org/using-type/workplace.htm?bhcp=1\n\n"Examples of careers often chosen by ESFPs include teaching (particularly pre-school through grade 12) and coaching, childcare work, clerical and office work, recreational work, food service, nursing, sales, personal services, and religious work/education."\n\n"They are also found much less often in careers that tend to require a more impersonal and analytical approach to people, such as social science or law, or that have very little contact with people, such as research or highly quantitative work (e.g., research, accounting, auditing)."
3	I'm an x-ray tech and before that I had majored in education, specifically math.\n\nI love patient interactions. It's my best 'skill'. In my performance reviews I'm always commended for my patient care and chipper disposition. And I still think about finishing my bachelor's so that I can teach as a clinical instructor at some point. 
3	I'm going into school for child care 😅 It was between that and elementary school education.
3	It's not what I would go for, but still levels and levels above office work, which is what I'm doing now. That's the death of the soul.\n\nTbh, I have been a lecturer in an education and culture center in the past, having two workshops that I did for schools. It was on a topic that was too difficult for most teachers to talk about competently, so they outsourced to us. Hence, I had a different class every time. I don't know that I'd be able to keep track of one class over time, but this worked for me quite well. I felt confident in what I'm doing, I knew how to engage the students, and how to pass the knowledge to others, and I was center stage, which worked well for me.\n\nIf I should choose a career though, regardless of what is feasible for me right now, I would be a musician, film director, actor, film producer, or work in the stables, riding and teaching horses, and cleaning up stable muck.
2	I'm going to school to be a nurse anesthesiologist in the future
2	We are drawn to more social interactions while also helping people so naturally they cross our minds. Personally, childcare/nursing are not for me, but the social side of working in an office is the highlight of my day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy do those careers seem so bad to you? 
7	feeling lonely	how do i deal w feeling lonely?\n\ni feel like if i dont fill up my calender with plans everyday then ive wasted my week. ): what should i do
10	You should learn to embrace the alone time. It's extremely important for your well-being that you do that. If you fear it, do it! Do it, until it's no longer uncomfortable. Use it to read a book. Watch a film. Work out at home. Learn the guitar. Learn how to program. Learn how to do anything that you wished you did, but kept telling yourself you don't have time. Use the time to make journal entries. Introspect. Focus on what is important for you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPeople who fear loneliness too bad choose bad friends, bad partners, and don't have any power in the relationships, because everyone knows they won't walk away from toxicity if they fear loneliness. Empower yourself instead. Learn to see why you have value. To yourself, and to others.\n\nBeing alone is alright. It's got many upsides. But it takes overcoming the fear.
5	Do you feel like being social makes you well-liked? Do you base your self-esteem off of having stuff to do with other people? 
3	I think you've got some good tips from Horrorito, can't really add much to it. \n\nAs others mentioned, don't derive your self worth from the people you're surrounded by. As a high Fi user you have the potential to be emotionally self-sufficient.

1	well, you dont need to plan something, you just need to get off your ass and do people stuff.
7	99% sure I'm an esfp	I just have one question. Is it normal for you to feel introverted in public places? Then extraverted to family and friends? In public it's not to the point where I straight up avoid people, I just prefer being loud and annoying to my friends only, you feel me?
12	Cognitive extroversion isn't social extroversion. You can be an ESFP, and still be quite private, and like your time alone. It's more that your primary focus is to the outside world, and affecting it, as opposed to primary focus on introspection. Outside world does not necessarily mean people. Or conversation.\n\nI am an ESFP, but don't like a lot of social situation, and mostly do the 'extroverted' stuff with people I consider 'my' people.
5	Yee I feel you. It’s called being an Ambivert. A balance between introvert and extrovert. I used to be pretty loud in public places when I was younger but now that I’m older I’m only loud with certain friends or family. \nEvery once in a while I get anti social and don’t want to talk to anyone and lock myself in my room but after like half a day I have to leave to go socialize because I get bored being alone hahaha idk man. 
2	You mean you're reserved in a situation where you don't know anyone? Most people would be "introverted" in that scenario, especially if everyone around you is with someone they know. But I don't really feel introverted in public, I can easily ask people for directions or make small talk(although as a teenager I was more anxious and shy). At the same time I don't actively look for social interactions with strangers and don't really like a lot of group activities that most people enjoy. \n\nBeing loud by yourself in public would be pretty weird lol but with friends I can be obnoxious in both public and private\n\nAnyway, what you're saying sounds pretty ESFP to me
1	I’m ESFP and I tend to do things alone because my friends won’t do all those crazy stuff with me. They are too busy working their asses off.
2	My awesome girlfriend. Lol	Hello everyone. I’m an estp or entp. I’m not sure. My girlfriend is an esfp. She’s a teacher. Definitely an entertainer. Super personable and charismatic. She’s looking to get out of teaching and into another career and I’ve suggested she check out reddit for guidance but she’s very skeptical. Any advice? Heads up I’ll probably be showing her any feedback. Make it real af please! 
1	Anything involving speaking in front of people or being sociable in general. It’s funny she’s a teacher because I’m doing education too. But here are some other things I would consider. I really liked working in sales because I get to talk to people and educate them about a product. Being an event planner works well because it requires tons of social skill behind it. Anything where connections with people is the primary task will be a good bet. Good luck!
1	Are you sure you've typed her correctly? If she's really an ESFP tell her to Fi and Ni the fuck out of that shit lol We all have different interests, so it's hard to give such advice to someone you know so little about. I'd suggest her to not take advice from reddit and to figure it out by herself, to think about the things she likes and things she's good at, preferably compile a list. From there it shouldn't be that difficult. Most importantly, tell her to not worry too much about it, she's gonna figure it out eventually and she can change her line of work later on if she feels like it
1	On a side note, I've seen a couple ESFP teachers on reddit, which is weird to me personally, because I couldn't imagine a worse career for myself. I can see ESFPs being instructors(fitness trainers for example), who work with clients individually, but not in a school with a bunch of smelly, disrespectful children, where you have to make them do things they don't want to on a tight schedule. I despised every aspect of school and didn't learn anything from there, except for social skills(which had nothing to do with the subjects I was taught). I don't like educating large groups of people either, when I find out know-hows to things I'm honestly keeping them to myself and will only reveal them to a select few if I really feel like it. \n\nI think that we're cut out for things like individual sports, entertainment, art, diplomacy, business/salesmanship

3	ESFP girl ghosted me	An ESFP girl lead me on a lot, and then just ghosted me. I do find this totally disrespectful and I cant possibly understand what kind of person would do this?( please don't feel attacked I know most ESFPs aren't like this at all) chances are she is still very immature.I tried not to push it,  waited about a week before trying contact again, didnt work. should I try to contact her in some time, and maybe bluntly state what I think, or just act like nothing has happened and be friendly? or most probably just let her go. \n\nI know I wont get closure, so maybe you guys can help me understand what could have happened and give me your opinions on what she did, and if you have ever done something similar, why you did it? \n\nlet me know if you want any more detail on the situation. love yall
4	Dunno what was going through her mind, but as a male I hate when people try to "play it cool" and would prefer for you to say directly how you feel. Honestly, it doesn't seem like she's interested in a real relationship, so if I were you I'd just probably ask her what's going on and if she doesn't reply then just try to move on\n\nPersonally, I never behave this way. If you're really someone I like and value as a person I wouldn't play you like that and if I don't really care about you then I won't give you any false hopes. I hate being ignored, especially in a situation where you're showing emotional vulnerability
2	But I’d also say it’d be good if you could give more details, maybe your story is different
2	Leading on is a very pregnant statement. What do you mean by that? What was it she said or did?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt can be a lot of things. It could be how you acted. Or it could not. It could be that she was interested, but not enough to go all in, and she got cold feet, which happens. And anxiety. The only reason I haven't ghosted some people is the level of maturity, and being able to put myself in the other person's shoes. Say, there was this really lovely guy last year, that we started something with, and even though he was amazing, I had a lot of baggage at the time (which he knew), and on top of that, I just didn't feel the spark, and for me, that's it. That's not something you can force or develops over time. What happened to me is I had severe anxiety when I thought about how I'd break it to him that I don't want to continue, because he was truly lovely, and nothing was wrong with him, and I didn't have a tangible reason to call it off, and I knew he was really into me, and also got his soul crushed by an ex. I really didn't want to add to that problem. And I didn't want to make him feel any less. So, initially, I just didn't make time to meet up, telling myself that I'll face this head-on, but always deciding that *not now*. However, I'm an adult, and I know that it's worse not to know what's happening, so eventually, I grew a pair, and formulated what's on my mind, and said clearly where I'm at. It was tough. It was really hard for me to say, and definitely hard for him to hear.\n\nOften, ghosting is just the result of anxiety of the person who wants an out, but doesn't have the courage to say so, and doesn't want to 'hurt' the other person. It always ends up hurting more if you're ghosted, but it's the result of a lack of decision, whereas facing it fair and square takes courage and accountability, and that's extremely hard.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIdk how old you are, but just think on it - have you ever been in a relationship, where you got in it, because you were really into that person, and then over time, months or years, you realize, that you just don't love them anymore, and don't want to be with them. But at the same time, don't think they're bad, or have done something wrong, it just fizzled out. Did you sit the partner down as soon as you realized, and told them in the face something along the lines of *it's not you, it's me?* Or did it take you a long long time, sometimes months or years, just telling yourself you'll do it, and then putting it off until some other time, just hoping the person screws up, so you can blame it on them, but they don't?

1	These things happen. People are selfish and assholes. The world isn’t fair, and you won’t be able to make sense of everything. Best to cut your losses, acknowledge what happened, and move on. 
0	Welcome to the club “ghosted by ESFPs” lol
0	Last try to get back with esfp girl	Hey guys, before I ask this, I acknowledge how wrong, stupid, idiot I am by wanting to do what I’m going to to tell you know, but still. Briefly: I can’t forget ESFP girl and move on, and although she once specifically said “I dont wanna be rude but I think you dont get that I dont want to date you” but my brains keeps bringing all the sorts of excuses why she said that. And although I have said slightly bad things to her like “you’re a party girl”, which means that I’m not supposed to continue liking her, but I still do. So anyway, so 2 times I tried to get back with her since we separated and every time I got hurt because of her disrespect (she once came to a party that I invited her and hanged out with another guy all night). So again no matter how stupid this whole thing is, if I wanna do smth the last time, what and how should I do this? I can’t text her because I deleted all her contacts so I don’t have any means of communication, but I have her sister on sc and that’s how I see her pics and miss her. Besides, I might see her at some bar because we live in a small town, there is a high chance for me to meet her. So how should I approach and talk to her if I see her at some bar? The problem is my last text to her was that she’s a party girl and I dont wanna be friends with a party girl lol *facepalm* I know there is no way for comeback 
8	To be honest... just don’t. She has expressed no interest and if you keep pursuing her it will just annoy her. I have a problem with an ex like this (INTP) and he is so annoying I’ve considered a restraining order due to his harassment.\n\nIf you still HAVE to try, just try to be her friend. Maybe if you run into her at a bar, you can ask how she’s doing, what she’s been up to, etc.. but if you pursue her more I guarantee she won’t respond the way you want her to. It’ll only push her away more. By being her friend there’s at least a chance for you to reconcile, get to know each other, and maybe she will develop feelings again. 
8	So, the best thing you can to earn her respect is do exactly as she says, and move on. ESFPs are pretty direct, and mean what they say. If she tells you she doesn't want to be with you, then the reason she says that is because she doesn't want to be with you. The absolute best way to earn a woman's respect is by respecting her personal agency ;)
7	ur creeping me out, leave her alone
6	Leave her alone. If she comes back around it’ll be in her terms. \n\nThe more people push when I tell them no, the more I feel my boundaries are being disrespected and the more distance I will create with them. 
3	Wow this is the first time I hear ESFP getting jealous. And I agree with what you said. I know all ESFPs here think I’m an idiot and creep af, but I understand that I’m wrong in some of the things I said, but it hurts me so bad that I can’t sit without doing anything about it. But at the same I’m planning to go to psychologist, I’m doing my best to get into her position, understand her and let her go.
4	What types have you liked dating the best?	What types have you had the best experience dating?ALSO,  what has your experience been with ENTP whether it was dating or friendship or just interaction.
5	Other ESFPs are not bad, I've had positive experiences with them(us? lol). I'm also into ENTJ girls, but haven't dated one yet. I think INTJs can be good romantic matches for us, as well as other introverts, ISTPs, INFPs, maybe ISFPs(I can see INTP working too)
3	I like other Gammas. Haven't dated an ISFP, but ESFP, ENTJ, and INTJ, I've done before. ENTJs tend to be my best friends, and are fun dates, but I find them too bossy and too cold for something where emotions should be involved. ESFP and INTJ were the best combos for me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nENTPs, damn... Usually I start off with being annoyed by everything they do, down to how they breathe. But we make good friends. We can't work together, or rely on each other's perception or activity, that's mutually frustrating, but we can have similar fun, and bounce off jokes off of each other nicely. Good for a back-and-forth. And despite so many ENTPs being major trolls, those I know actually have a really good heart and are really helpful when you need help. 
2	Dating an ENFP. Surprising amount of differences considering just a one letter difference. I love that we're both extroverted though. 
1	Well my boyfriend of 5 years is an INFJ and although we’re opposites in the way we approach the world we have the same values. This means we help balance each other out a lottt. He gets me to do boring tasks including taking care of money properly and I’m very grateful he does that, I get him out of his shell in social situations! 
3	desperately seeking advice	Desperatly typed this in on my phone, sorry for the bad formatting and any typos. Oh and I know this text contains cringe, I just don't know how to deal with this problem i have with myself.\n\nHi. I know it's a lot of text, but ive tried and tried and i've wanted to run away or give up for so long, but i refuse to do so. literally any help or just a kick in the ass helps and is appreciated. When I'm alone my head feels like its about to freaking burst sometimes and i get so depressed. im desperate to become the fun, outgoing and social person I once was, and my fear is just growing as nothing ever works.(ive had a shot at writing diaries, 1 month of therapy, Ritalin(ADHD medicine, going on vacations, doing old hobbies, exercising, nofap, lol this isn't even something id normally do, im just desperate to get well again)\n\nI miss my old view on life, not overthinking every little thing and becoming angry, being able to perform presentations in school, being able to sort my thoughts into words the way I used to. I know I sound really whiney but really I've been in this pit of working hard for two years now without getting a single step further! everything feels so wrong and i used to view the world as an art, or something beautiful, a gift. i used to have fun and not give a fuck, really. now i just worry, and seek help. and I'm wasting my life as an 18 year old. im useless nowadays and my close friends say I'm stupid as hell.\n\nthe only thing keeping me alive is my computer. i use it to escape and catch myself analysing people I admire so I can share the fun they have and be like them. i do this even though it is so unlike me, im just desperate and want to fake to be someone else while I'm this weak of a person. it makes me sad not to be able to go out and be the man i used to be and it makes me self conscious as heck.
3	Get your hormones checked before taking the step to get an antidepressant! You could have hypothyroidism (make sure to get a doc that really knows about this, preferably someone who lists bioidentical hormone replacement therapy as their specialty- most docs don’t really know much about the thyroid and only put you on t4 once you’re way too far gone) or hypogonadism (low testosterone- this is happening in younger and younger men). Get vitamin d, b12, and folate checked because all of those could play a role as well! 
3	Forsure see a specialist but try to remember the more you look for happiness the harder it might be to find. Take your days one step at a time. Focus on fixing one small goal and eventually expanding to bigger parts of your life. \n\nDon’t give up and good luck. 
3	Im in the same exact boat dude except im 23. I honestly thought i wrote this. I have all these same thoughts. No confidence in myself, always thinking and getting angry, etc. keep your head up because life is about ups and downs. Right now you’re in a down and it will get better.
2	Sounds like depression and or anxiety. Time to see your doctor or psychiatrist for new meds or to up your dose. Good SSRI should do the trick.
2	I also recommend seeing a psych/counsellor. I’ve been seeing one for 3 years now and she’s helped me relax my harsh views on myself and now i’m chill. Come chill with me. 
2	Find something you like and try to do it for a living. Simply try not to worry about anything. Live more in the moment and try to do the things you enjoy. Don't let anyone tell you you're stupid - no matter how intelligent you are or aren't it's not a thing a friend should be saying to you, try to avoid those kinds of people. Don't overthink things - usually they're a lot better than you think they are. Try to use your thoughts for something more productive like coming up with plans for your future and telling yourself that you're doing good
2	Sounds like a rough patch. Don't worry, it does get better, but will require effort on your behalf. I've been there. It really really sucks. Also have ADHD. I also suffer bouts of clinical depression, and occasional anxiety and panic attacks. At 18, you probably don't have enough of these cycles behind you to discover a trend, so I will share mine.\n\nSo, partly, I get depressed because it's in my nature, but winter makes it worse. Other than that, it's usually accompanied by lack of resources and time, so instead of going out there, discovering the world and experiencing it, I get stuck in my head too much, which makes me spiral. That also exacerbates the other issues.\n\nDefinitely see a specialist if you can. Talk about going on antidepressants for a couple months, to see if it helps. It doesn't mean you have to be on them for the rest of your life, but they do help you get out of the emotional whirlwind, take a step back, and look at your life with a more constructive and problem-solving mindset. Then, when your situation changes, and if your doc approves, you can get off them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOutside of therapy and medication, these are things that help me:\n\nGET OUT OF THE HOUSE! Work out. Do sports. I mean it. Get yourself sweaty at least 3-5x a week. It helps regulate hormones that affect your mood and cognition. When I don't work out, my ADHD becomes so unmanageable that I want to shoot myself in the head, and my depression and anxiety get so much worse. Go running, go to the gym, do HIIT at home, go swimming, or take up a team sport that you can do. Anything you can get your hands on. I mean it. This is the single most important thing in my life that helps me stay sane.\n\nDo you have an INTJ or ENTJ friend? Talk to them? They are good with problem-solving on a level you need. They won't get submerged into your emotional problems, and won't react with sympathy, but with solutions. Get someone who can give you tough love.\n\nFind something you can do, even with limited resources, that gives you a sense of purpose, or value, on a smaller scale. Not in a strategic time frame, but with almost immediate results. Do you have a creative streak? Sing. Play the guitar. Draw. Paint. Take up a drama class. Do standup. Whatever. Are you competitive instead? Do things that will get you immediate acknowledgment.
1	maybe im just sucking up to my feelings too much and should leave them alone? HRGJGjdjsss im a mess
1	Also, have you tried different ADHD medication, other than Ritalin? I have it, but haven't used it in almost 4 years, except for exceptions. And had to come back to it, because my ADHD has been acting up. One of the major side effects of Ritalin are anxiety and panic attacks. I've never tried Adderall, it's not FDA approved in my country, but has your doctor tried to switch you to something else?
7	What’s your fashion style?	How would you describe your style? Do you have one? Do you think about it at all? Share pics if you’d like!
11	My fave outfit has got to be my birthday suit. It’s just so comfortable!
6	Heavy metal fashion; jeans, boots, leather jacket and band shirt. Not really an all-seasons thing but I power through. The price of lookin' good. Haha 
4	I match clothes and make sure everything is clean. I like sports brands or designer things, but not the popular stuff. To really look good tho you have to be racked up, so I'm still getting there
4	Basically street punk without boots and with long hair (that's going to change) 
5	Always put together- I think about accessories like necklaces, earrings, watches, and rings a lot, especially the length of the necklace with my top. I like to follow fashion trends and make them as much my own as I can without just going for the next thing. I also just have a feeling when an outfit goes together right. I’m not really sure exactly what it is, I’ve just always had a sense of what works and what doesn’t and I feel uncomfortable leaving the house in a meh outfit. At my job I wear business casual with a lab coat and people always complement me for standing out in a good way with my clothing choices. I really fall into the ESFP fashion loving stereotype 
4	I would usually make my own style based off the trendy clothes. Like I would wear Fila Disruptors with Adidas 3-stripe pants or a pair of ripped jeans, add a denim jacket or a hypebeast style Parkas if it’s cold out. These are my favourite outfits. Oh, and also DUNGAREES omgg they are so awesome! I own a white pair and I wear it a lot! In summer, I would pretty much wear muscle tanks and beach shorts, with either sneakers or my favourite strap sandals from Nomadic State of Mind. \nI’m a guy btw.
4	Shirt and pants, I don’t care about aesthetics or looking flashy. Comfort ftw!
3	I’m late to the party but like this post so I wanted to share! I’m pretty flashy. I love designer shoes, glitter, short skirts, leather, sequins, you name it. I think part of it is because that’s what my friends wear, and it’s grown on me. Many days though, I just wear leggings and graphic tee shirts. 
2	I wear popular designer brands. I also try to match my shoes with my outfit. 
2	I don't have a unified style. Hence often people tell me I'm a chameleon. I dress how I feel like any given day. Mostly for comfort. Those that I'm known to wear often:\n\nSporty\n\nGrunge\n\nPin-up\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also enjoy shock value. Attaching what I had at Christmas.\n\n&#x200B;
2	@cassysamie check my Instagram, there is my style :p\n\nI would say I'm pretty esfp specific

21	Being Shallow (rant)	The stereotype that we are all shallow people with zero inhibitions and care for others, makes me so mad. In person we're  likeable but on the internet (especially myerbriggs forums) we get torn apart and called all types of names. Players, party animals, flakey, all types of things that act as though we're a two dimensional character in some shitty book who lacks inner dialogue and actual feelings.\n\nOf course I don't mean everyone, but do you feel like people think we're "shallow" because we dont wallow constantly on what is worrying and plaguing us? What constitutes someone as deep? Do you have to be someone who constantly talks about how you think life is meaningless, or what happens after death?? Do we have to make every conversation forcefully heavy and uncomfortable?? Maybe instead of spilling all our private and deepest thoughts to everyone, we like to keep it to ourselves!!! and only reveal it to the people we trust the most!!!!!! instead of laying all this shit on everyone else!!\n\nMaybe the reason why we seem so fucking stupid and flighty is because we're torn between not wanting anyone to truly know us, to wanting to be understood and loved!!! maybe we're afraid of being truly known. maybe we're afraid of being hurt. why does everyone reduce us to something so surface level and shallow? \n\nI don't know, this is a stupid rant but it just hurts to think some people think we dont have any actual feelings, thoughts or depth. Because we definitely do. I know it. Sure we enjoy life's physical pleasures but it doesn't mean our heads are filled with sand! just because we dont spew all the things we feel out to everyone, doesn't mean we dont feel.\n\nI'm tired of this stereotype. Like everyone, I want to be loved and understood. Not everyone can give you that though, so of course I'm not going to open up to everyone. I'm going to stay surface level with people who I believe don't connect with me on that level. \n\nsDHFJKDSHF anyways thanks. Rant over. 
6	A lot of people think like that, but honestly who cares? I know myself, so there's no need for the validation of others. If someone thinks I'm stupid then let them think that way. I like to act dumb on purpose to mess with people. \n\nIn reality, a truly smart and "deep" person is not going to look down on someone for not being sophisticated, because any intelligent person(who is older than 15) realizes that it's not wise to go through life trying to complicate everything. The happiest people enjoy simple things and are true to  themselves, while people who always put on an intellectual facade are barely enjoying themselves at all, so who's the dumb one at the end of the day?
5	I'm completely with you. I hate the idea of certain people or types being "deeper" than others. As if it were measurable, and as if it meant they would be overall better or smarter people. \n\n\nI think function orientation describes "attention" more so than it does "skill." So everyone has an intuitive function they can call upon to be "deep," or use to analyze and abstract their world. But they also all have a sensing function to use when dealing with the here and now, and getting things done.\n\n\n\nSome people might pay more attention to their intuitive function, myself included, but they doesn't inherently make them smarter and it has drawbacks in other places, such as less attention for your sensing function. I just think about Si things less than I think about Ne things. I need less of them, they are of less value to me. I believe the same goes for ESFPs and their Ni. \n\n\nEmbrace yourself, man. You have your own strengths and are a fully capable person in your own way. \n\n\n
3	Aww, I don’t think you guys are shallow. I think you guys can be extremely sensitive and kind, clever and honest. I think you guys might be a bit flighty, but there’s nothing wrong with that. The people who think you’re shallow are usually pretentious and close minded and who cares what they think anyway. They often think themselves into circles. \n\n— ENFP
2	Tbh, I think the "party girl/fratbro" was a stereotype that existed before MBTI got involved, but people were basically looking which type to slap that stereotype on, and it fell on you...\n\n> Of course I don't mean everyone, but do you feel like people think we're "shallow" because we dont wallow constantly on what is worrying and plaguing us?\n\nCome now, that's just you stereotyping the other side. The "N" stuff is more about the abstract, etc, than worrying per se.\n\n> What constitutes someone as deep?\n\nPersonally, I would say the time spent thinking about something, refining it to something simple, like Einstein coming up with that E=Mc² that summarize everything. A very novel point of view, one that just clicks, one that fits all the piece of the puzzle, that's depth. \n\nI'm not very receptive to Fi, but hey, seeing from what I saw of ESTPs, you Se-doms have a very simple, yet, very pure/raw way to look at things that is enjoyable too, you just don't express it ? If you say what matters is how true/verifiable a fact is, then you guys should lead\n\nI guess "depth" will always be associated with N, though. But well, when you have as much data as you guys do, isn't building a worldview rather easy ? You've got to concentrate/crystalize it in one point. \n\nTbh, taking the opposite of Se-dom, Ni-dom (INxJ), you get types that way over their heads, but appear confident. That's a mask. Calling them on their BS isn't that hard once you know the odds. \n\nAnyway, in a sense, I kinda consider you guys "deeper" than INxJ because at least, your stuff isn't wanky spiritual BS half the time.\n\n> Do you have to be someone who constantly talks about how you think life is meaningless, or what happens after death??\n\nFunnily, nihilism, at least Nietzsche's version of it, comes to that conclusion that life is meaningless, **and thus, that you should enjoy it.** He's typed as INTJ, and if you look at his idea of the "Ubermensch" or the idea of "will to power", well, it's pretty SeFi actually.\n\nWhat he recommands is to be like you guys. (Maybe because his weakness as an INTJ would be FiSe.)\n\nThe true lesson with this typology stuff is that we all have something other lack and want. \n\n> Maybe the reason why we seem so fucking stupid and flighty is because we're torn between not wanting anyone to truly know us, to wanting to be understood and loved!!! maybe we're afraid of being truly known. maybe we're afraid of being hurt.\n\nThat one goes for everyone I think\n\n> why does everyone reduce us to something so surface level and shallow?\n\nIf you talk about online, it's obviously N types who were bullied by/envious of Se types during highschool, lol. \n\nAs for IRL, are you seen as shallow too ?\n\n\n
1	Yeah, being shallow has nothing to do with your type. Being "deep" to me means that you are thoughtful and you put effort into knowing yourself. All types can be shallow by that definition. I am in touch with the way I experience things, and with my feelings, and there is a lot of depth to be found there. I'm not talking about myself necessarily, but Se and Fi as functions are just as deep as Ni or Ne or whatever else is considered "deep". There is a lot of meaning to be found in Se and Fi, just as much as in "deep" functions, and if you're willing to dive in and explore that meaning, to me you are not a shallow person.
1	200% this. I went to search esfp on all other forums and I wanted to cry :(
1	That's funny cuz I think other types are shallow. They're the ones being superficial by judging you, and they're the ones who are basically frivolus chatter boxes, gossiping about nothing, etc. Then they think you have no depth. Pretty stupid of them.
1	Iv felt that way about the stereotypes behind ENTP. how they are very non committed / sluttish/ always wanting to move on to the newer more exciting thing , "being bored easily with people" and just quickly moving on.. 
1	This speaks to me so much right now! I’m currently experiencing this in life in my surroundings. Lately I’ve been feeling like my friends don’t take me seriously and girls think I’m shallow. \n\nI’m just bubbly, with crazy ideas, and I just want to have a good time ..but I’m turning crazy to think that I have to show I’m not shallow. \n\n
3	When do you wake up?	If nothing is stopping me I'll defo sleep until at least lunch hours(I remember waking up at 5-6 PM for a while lol). I've always made sure my current job won't involve waking up too early, because anything earlier than 8-9 AM is crazy for me. I can't physically go to bed until past midnight, regardless of when I have to wake up. But if I have to wake up early for something exciting I don't mind waking up at like 4 in the morning\n\nHow is your sleeping schedule?
3	I always want to sleep. If I’m stressed, I sleep. Sometimes I’d rather sleep than eat if I’m tired and hungry. Sleep is my best friend lol. 
2	I’m the same way, I can’t sleep earlier than midnight. Right now I’m lucky I work nights so I can sleep in as long as I want. Usually I get out of bed around 11 or 12 though. 
1	I love sleeeeeep!!!!
1	I usually go to sleep around 1am or 2am and wake up around 750am. My dream is to never sleep at all and truly take advantage of the day. I hate wasting my day on sleep. 
1	I eather wake up at 3am or 3 pm. If I get under 8 hours of sleep I'm fine. Over 8 hours of sleep and I'm amazing, but if I get a "reasonable amount of sleep" I feel like crap.
6	As an ESFP what did you feel your parents did or didn't do that helped or hindered you growing up?	I'm an INTP and my son is a 13 year old ESFP. Looking back at childhood it's easy to see what my parents did or didn't do that really hurt or helped me, and I'd love to be able to change anything I'm doing that is really hurting him before he's already grown and it's affected our relationship negatively. Are there things your parents did that stick out in your memory as really affirming, helpful, or made you feel loved, cared for, and seen? Are there things your parents did that made you feel invisible, unwanted, misunderstood, cheated, or confused?\n\nThank you for reading and thank you doubly for any insights you can give!
9	Thank you so much for this post and caring about your son enough to write it.  This in itself makes me think that my advice is probably unwarranted.\n\nESFPs are still defining who we are when we hit out teenage years.  We’re not good at introspection or deep thinking.  Our Te and Ni feel practically nonexistent at this point.  We live very much at the whim of our Se and Fi at the moment.  Which means that we are easy to understand and easy to please.\n\nWe want to indulge our Se.  It can be anything from walking in nature, playing sports, or eating good food.  Ideally, we would like to indulge it with friends.  Make sure you give him a chance to get out, do new things, and meet new people... but don’t force it (as an INTP, I doubt you ever could).  Let him have his freedom to decide what he wants to do.\n\nYou may he surprised at how strong his Fe is, considering it’s an unvalued function.  It’s because we ESFPs need a lot of affirmation and validation, so we pick up and value social cues quite easily.  We’re not as rebellious as our ESTP counterparts... we follow the rules as long as they align with our Fi.  If we see something as unjust or unfair, we will join the rebellion, but if we think things are a little out of hand, we’ll step back and abstain from participating.\n\nWith Fi-aux, we like to go our own way.  We also like to have things our own way.  We can be demanding, controlling, and selfish.  But we are also about the good time and don’t really get off on hurting other people.  We’d prefer to validate rather than tear-down.  But we’re not pushovers.  If you have a complaint about us, state it rationally while validating is in the process.  We may blow up, but we hear your words.  Give us a chance storm away to calm down and we will return to the conversation later after we have thought about what you said.  We’re highly volatile so we explode easily but then we can let something go just as easily.\n\nIf we’ve done something wrong, remember that we are conflict adverse.  If we feel that we’re being attacked, it will trigger our fight or flight response.  We will do/say things that we regret just to get away.  If you see this happening, let us “escape,” cool down, and then come and have a rational conversation with us.  Show us that you understand what we might be feeling.  Validate us.  And then tell us the reasons why you confronted us in the first place.\n\nHope this helps, though this advice is based on my experience as a female ESFP.  Male ESFP mileage may vary. (n_n\n\nGood luck and know that he’s pretty lucky to have an awesome mom like you! 
2	That's a valiant effort, and I'm sure your kid will appreciate it. It's impossible to prevent all trauma, it's just about what trauma, and how much of it, parents inflict. It's part of growing up. However, looking at ESFP needs, and hearing your kid specifically will go a long way to create a nurturing environment.\n\nMy parents are a ENFP mom and INFP dad. They're both rather relaxed, and we had a lot of freedom, which I much appreciate. They gave us a lot of freedom, and instead of giving us strict rules, they gave us ethical guidelines, and accountability. We had a lot of power making our own choices, but were taught to understand the direct consequences, and causality, and to make informed decisions. So, we could decide. And we were accountable. Both our parents wanted us to be capable of critical thought.\n\nFor me, it's mostly things they couldn't affect much. We were in a financially unstable environment, sometimes almost rich, and other times barely affording food, and they were behind on rent. They couldn't afford to give us any pocket money, and I had to start contributing at 15, otherwise we wouldn't make it, financially. That was a lot of stress. Especially as they treated me as adult since I was 12, and I was in on any struggles they had. Financial, emotional, other. I think it contributed a lot to my depression and anxiety.\n\nThe other thing was typology related, so little they could do. Almost all my family are Ne-Si users, while I'm Se-Ni - hence, Si-ignoring. I am focused on immediate opportunities, rather than all possibilities. I always found it a waste of time and frustrating exploring all options. I wanted someone to focus with me on the now, and on a singular road to take, based on my specific needs. I live in the here and now, and am very kinesthetic focused. I would have needed encouragement to take up sports and be competitive, more so than being lead towards an intellectual direction. I'm intelligent, at least according to all measures, but I don't like to stay in the mind and explore options and subjective logic. I want to assert myself on the world and make my way in it, and find success and attention, and admiration. If your kid has a competitive spirit, and likes attention, encourage one, and indulge the other. That's something that broke my heart most.
1	The fact that you think and care about this is already a good start\n\nTo me one of the things that really made me like my mom a lot less growing up was how little respect she showed me(she's definitely a high Fe and Si user). I think that after a certain age you have to treat your kids as equals, instead she would keep trying to boss me around and disregard my opinions up until I was old enough to stand up to adults intellectually(and to understand that most adults are just as confused about life as kids and teenagers). Also another thing(which I'm pretty sure comes from their Fe and my lack thereof) is how they expected me to instinctively figure out some things(like social etiquette or chores), instead of calmly explaining to me why I should or shouldn't do something they'd just expect me to comply and get mad when I stopped to question it, which only made me confused and angry myself. Personally for me the best thing was to figure things out on my own. Even if someone was being patient and respectful while explaining something fairly obvious to me I'd still have to process it by myself to accept it as a truth(which is Fi and Te I'm guessing)\n\nI've always had a good relationship with my parents, but we were always on different pages about most things in life. I think as a parent the best thing you can do is be there to support your child if he needs you, but let him make his own mistakes and learn from them
1	Growing up I've never felt comfortable letting my parents in. I don't share my personal feelings with them. When I was young I felt they invalidated my feelings and it pushed me away even further. Now that I'm older they're trying to reach out but its difficult for me to trust them nonetheless. Be careful when your child is opening up to you. Most times I "test the waters" by alluding to something serious or open up a tiny bit. The reactions to these instances are crucial in deciding if someone is trustworthy or not. So my advice would be to be careful how you react to certain things. Try to keep calm and be careful about what you say. \n\nAt least that's what I think haha I don't study too too deep in mbti. But this is my experience as an ESFP
1	Retook test after a while ENFP to ESFP. Which personality types do you get along with best	Recent lifestyle changes and I agree with the results.  Used to believe I was ENFP for the past 2-3 years but had some friends ask out of the blue about my personality type.  Retook it and ESFP results was surprisingly accurate. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways as title says which types do you get along with best?  Do you guys tend to have a lot of friends?  What do they say about you?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
2	I mostly get along the best with NTJs, ISFPs, ENFPs and ESTPs\n\nIt's very easy for me to blend into a new social setting and I know a bunch of people, but I can't call many of them my true friends. People say that I'm easy to talk to, intelligent(lol it's pretentious to call yourself smart, but that's what I've been told), fun, but also headstrong and pretty secretive
2	I too struggled with identity of my pt but have come to the conclusion after trying ghat I'm esfp :) welcome!! 
1	Best matches for ESFPs are types that appreciate their Se & Fi and who can supply them with Te and Ni. These are NTJs. Other good matches are NFJs (value Se & supply Ni) and STJs (value Fi & supply Te) - [mbti types in relationships with esfps](https://www.personalitycafe.com/esfp-articles/290-love-types-esfp-3.html#post3910962).

19	INFP Opinion of ESFP	 I'm not sure why I have the urge to share this, but I just feel impulsive...forgive me ;) \n\n I only know one ESFP for sure, and only because I forced him to take the Myers Briggs on a long road trip. That person is my dad! :)\n\n If I'm judging ESFPs based off of my dad's personality, I'd like to say that you guys really are awesome people!\n\n My dad is funny, spontaneous, brave, charismatic, loyal, forgetful, kindhearted, and always does what he feels is right. He can have a great conversation with anyone about anything (which I admire greatly, since I'm shit at small-talk.)\n\n My mom is ISTP. They've been together for 21 years and they still love each other. Definitely some communication problems! But they laugh when they both come home with a gallon of milk without knowing the other was buying milk (they've done this hundreds of times over the years and not just with milk.)\n\n My dad loves to go on drives to places he's never been, loves to play pranks, loves the new and exciting, loves a good joke, and loves his family. I love that about my dad. He's really a big sweetheart with a million stories. If someone doesn't like my dad, then I seriously question their judgment....but I might be biased (I'm totally not.) \n\n\n\nTldr: From the daughter of an ESFP, thanks for being you! I'm glad you're out there in the world making life memorable for the ones you're close to. Continue being great and know you're appreciated!
3	Awww... thanks for this!  I usually see comments about how annoying we ESFPs are, so it’s lovely to read something affirming.  Your dad is lucky to have someone who understands and appreciates him for who he is.  (n_n
6	Well thank ya. I am an ESFP and my fiance whom I've been with for just over 5 years now is an INFP. It's definitely an interesting and amazing relationship.
3	With us, it's reversed. I'm the ESFP, and my dad is INFP. He's pretty cool, and creative. Has a talent for explaining things and getting people engaged.
2	I'm an INFP, and I sort of enjoy studying a good friend of mine who is an ESFP. I'm amazed at his ability to instantly relate with anyone. I'm really very envious and I try to pick up some of his behavioral habits.\n\n\nIf all ESFP's are as much fun as this guy, I would love to get to know more of them. I want to know the secret! How do you all do it? \n\nAlso, very refreshing to have someone around to take all of thel pressure off of me when I'm drained or struggling socially.
2	This is a sweet post! 
2	[deleted]
1	LOL screw u u ESFP guys are a bunch of wankers I’m INTJ INTJ gang rise up
1	What birthday gift should i buy for my ESFP friend?	She is a teenage Girl BTW.
7	Take her somewhere. That's what I would like, maybe invite her to a movie, unique city event, concert, get some food etc something she would enjoy or find exciting and pay for her. I don't really like items but I love having a good time if your friend is anything like me she will enjoy receiving an expierence as opposed to a physical gift.
2	I really like earrings that are pretty extra and unique. I'm a guy though :D
1	makeup. i would like weed but im a guy and a stoner
1	We need more information. What are some of her hobbies and interest?
1	Ask him/her. \n\nBut usually gift cards are a perfect gift. Its practical and they can buy whatever they want. 
3	What do you appreciate about relationships? What do you like?	I’m an INFP, and the person I’m seeing is an ESFP. \n\nWe’ve only went out about twice, but I want to make sure that I’m doing things right. I kinda feel like I’m boring her, really. \n\nThe last time we went out we just walked about a mall for 2 hours, is that good? \n\nIs there anything in particular that you guys enjoy doing? I feel like she’s actually kinda hard to talk to and open up.\n\nHelp me out\n\nThank you! 
4	Try a different style activity. Like you said, she sounds bored. Try to give her options that stimulate her more than your trip to the mall. You could ask about her interests and if she has any suggestions of things she may enjoy. Try go-karting, play a sport together, community event like a parade or festival, or go to a bar she’s never been to. Put the attention on her! Good luck :)
2	I know that if I like a guy and I'm interested enough to get into a relationship, I enjoy spending alone time together so that I can get to know him. Not all ESFPs want to be constantly going out, so keep that in mind. Personally, walking around a mall sounds reeeeeally boring especially if you aren't having open and invested conversation. I hate to sound pessimistic, because I'm not trying to be, but if you two don't really click then where was the draw to be in a relationship?
2	Ok (I'm a guy ESFP) but we appreciate spontaneity,a variety of different things because we do get bored easy which is why we seem fun, we just need to constantly entertain ourselves. However ESFPs are chatty but might be hard to open up, if she isn't talking much are you sure she is an ESFP?\n\nBut ESFPs are too spontaneous almost, so what is good for them is order
3	I think my husband is an ESFP	So, I don't know for sure, but he kind of fits the bill for it and I'm trying to gauge the best way to deal with our impending divorce.   \n\n\nI'm an ENTJ woman; I've always been the bread winner, always been the one with high expectations, driven, pushing him to be better, helping him with college, the military (I got him enlisted because it helped me), etc. I'm pretty sure the pushing finally got to a point where he couldn't take it anymore and we both just started losing respect for one another and couldn't communicate anymore due to him always taking everything I said as criticism and it was to the point that I used the same tactic I usually do with discuss of divorce and told him to leave and he finally did. He had enough. He's done.   \n\n\nI didn't realize he was really done though, so within a few days I'm trying to talk to him like we're just fighting per the usual, got us in counseling, we had some fights, and then 17 days after leaving, he was sleeping with someone else. Loyalty is a big deal for ENTJ's so this caused me to flip and go on the extreme aggressive side of things which included some vengeance, upping the ante, and of course none of that helped. But why - you ask - would I even want to bother with someone who is dead set on being done? Because we have kids. And part of what made me flip so hard besides the loyalty is that he wasn't really invested in seeing them during that time because he's too caught up in living in the moment.   \n\n\nWell, that girl lasted from Oct 17th to roughly Nov 11 and the last I heard they saw each other was Nov 26. By Nov 28th, he met a new girl and he's only known her for all of 10 days but things seem to be going well there and he's been staying over there frequently. During this time, he has only seen the kids 6 times (Mainly in Oct) and that's on both of us (I got petty on some stuff and he decided to concede everything to letting a court handle the situation).   \n\n\nI don't know if this is normal behavior for a ESFP type person but I do know he has a habit of basically hopping into a new relationship very fast to get over an old one and has a unique ability to just drop people when he wants. So I'm curious if this behavior fits the mold or if it's a different personality type. He's got great charm, charisma, likes to be the center of attention and is constantly changing his appearance to fit whatever job he's in (currently he's becoming more of a country guy and his new dig is quite country herself).   \n\n\nAnd if he is ESFP - what is the best way for someone with a more aggressive personality type to find common ground? We both currently have an issue with trust, but I need to re-establish at least some basic level of trust in order to work towards co-parenting with him.   \n\n\nWe have a custody hearing on Thursday and until tonight, he and I hadn't spoken or seen each other in a month, but I'm the pushy type so I sought him out. With all the deep diving I've been doing into my own personality type, we were able to have a much needed civil discussion of my expectations that his "living in the moment" doesn't affect our children and that he doesn't let the flings ever take priority over them. He seemed to agree, assured me he could "drop them" if it ever became an issue, but was reserved to admit his habits of going out and partying all the time because he likely feels like it's something I'd jump on and criticize. Which I likely would because he also complains of not having money when he just bought a 2018 car and is funding the attorney since he's the one who filed for divorce.   \n\n\nEither way - I just want to find the best way to move forward and understand him better so that I'm not causing the same waves I did with our previous relationship.   \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n&#x200B;
5	I do not have kids and am not married but I have been dating an ESFP for 8 years. \n\nI’m sorry you guys are going through a rough time. \n\nAs far as personalities go, my ESFP finds self-worth and satisfaction through praise and affection. You mentioned that many times you have pushed him into positions or self improvement but feel that your criticism is hindering your relationship. Perhaps try pointing out the good things he does do, no matter how little they may be. It may be hard for you see the good in him right now but when you look for them and point them out maybe it will get easier over time. My ESFP also positively reacts to truces during fights through a hug or a kiss. Physical affection brings out the best in him. \n\nPersonalities aside, I think trying to push people into self-improvement before they are ready or into a position they do not want for themselves can be harmful for both parties in the relationship. It might give you a false identity of your loved one and lead to your SO not only feeling unfulfilled with themselves but it might cause resentment. \n\nAlso, good step getting into counseling. \n\nI don’t know the relationship you guys have and I don’t understand the difficulties navigating a relationship with children but I hope this helps either way. \n\nGood luck. 
5	You look like someone who appreciates bluntness, so I will be that. ESFP and ENTJ share all cognitive functions, so can often get along great, although, if they spend too much time together, they both get frustrated, so they need their regular downtime.\n\nHonestly, from what you said, I wouldn't comment on loyalty, because you were split before he began anything. He's not necessarily behaving like an ESFP, he's behaving like someone who just got out of prison. You cannot overwhelm people. You have to respect their personal agency. And understand, that ambition isn't the be all end all, and if a person isn't ambitious, as long as they do their part, you cannot forcefeed it to them. It doesn't seem like he had much of a say in anything, because you steamrolled over him. And coming back with petty vendetta, and chasing him down like a harpy does no one any good. It certainly doesn't help him. But let me ask, how does it help you? Calm down. Take an analytical approach. Don't take things so personal. Doesn't sound like the marriage is salvageable, but if you treat him with enough respect, he doesn't sound like he's too bent on any vendetta whatsoever. Talk like adults. Don't make it personal. Take care of yourself.
1	I would like to suggest that going for cognitive behavioural therapy or dialectical behavioural therapy may be your best bet. It will help you, him and your kids.
6	ESFP's, what are your opinions and experiences with INTJ's	Just curious as to what your experiences are. What do you think about the INTJs that you've met?
9	I love INTJs! I married one! Ok, he's a little boring and never plans any surprises for me but I make my own fun with our kiddo (Getting a second one soon!) He needs 4h of "downtime" everyday to "reset", which I think is ridiculous, but he tries hard as a dad, eats my cooking sometimes, and gives me hugs most times I ask.\n\nI will (and have!) left him because post-partum he got stressed and didn't give me enough love or time for 1.5 years and prioritized his job. He's stubborn and didn't listen to me. So I left. \nI would do it again. We lived apart for 6 mo and shared time with kid before I moved back into his place again and things have been great since. We're better as a team.\n\nI like him cause he's smart, good looking, funny, good with tech, and can beat me in video games. He probably likes me cause I'm more fun and pretty. I appreciate that I can be artsy, creative, spontaneous and he'll go with most of my shot calls on fun stuff :) He's introverted so I don't have to do his boring computer stuff. It's a win-win from my perspective.\n\nA lot of what I've said I say the word "most" maybe even "some" of the time. It's because he never lets me make decisions for him. Is that an INTJ thing? It's actually good that way, I know my decisions are spontaneous so he's like my sanity check. Unchecked, and dude, I make some stupid decisions. I need that guy in my life. Don't tell him I told you tho.
7	Well, like a true ESFP I’m a social butterfly so I generally get along with everybody. However, INTJs can be pretty emotionless and arrogant which are quick ways to put you on my nope list. I’m patient enough to withstand being around INTJs but dear god I can’t imagine dating one. I’m sure it goes both ways too though, they probably can’t stand us!  
4	I love INTJs! They are among my favourite types. I look up to them because they can help me aspire my Ni and they are generally very willing to do so. For some reason, I don’t experience the same thing from INFJs. I think Ni Te just works better for me than Ni Fe. \n\nCould be biased though, since I am close to many INTJs. 
3	One of my best friends is an INTJ and I always wonder why he likes me. He hates so many things, many of which I feel like I embody, but for some unspoken reason I made the cut. We can talk for hours about anything and everything and it’s so organic.
2	This is my mum. We do not quite get along but share some humour. There’s a lot of potential for conflict but with adequate self awareness less so. It can be good. 
2	They are pretty dank
2	ESFP and confidence?	I constantly hear about ESTPs and ENTPs confidence. However, I'm wondering if this confidence applies for ESFPs as well
6	I would describe it as “above average”
5	I think all these types are confident in different ways. But this absolutely applies to ESFPs, probably more than to the other 2, because we are confident in ourselves regardless of anything, while ESTPs have to be in a good social space to be confident and ENTPs care a bit less what other people think of them(among these types).
4	Big dick energy up in here man
3	I wouldn’t say I’m confident. Id say I’m more gutsy.
1	Does confidence have to do with MBTI or upbringing/life experience? Can't any MBTI type be confident? 
1	Not related
6	Underrated and obscure ESFP from GTA San Andreas	Hans Oberlander from the SF-UR radio station. I've recently replayed San Andreas and I think that he must be an ESFP. Hilarious character, I think the idea was that most of the time he's doing ecstasy and going through euphoria where he's acting like a house music cult leader and saying that his listeners are bad doggies who are not worthy of the music he's playing, which is then followed by a comedown where he says that he loves his mother and needs to be held. Also SF is in the name of the pirate station he hosts, so that's gotta be something\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N04mX-Zyr1U
1	And CJ the man himself. Trevor too.
8	So ESFP really like INTJ	
6	Yes, where are you? Come find us!
4	For myself, yes. Sometimes, it's a rough start, but tends to go real smooth soon enough. They need a little hand-holding initially when it comes to physical stuff, but I'm cool with that, that's where I'm confident, and they offer the same hand-holding intellectually, so good growth both ways. 10 stars. Would recommend
3	Yes. XD
2	intj best type tbh <3 
2	Not a fan at all, contrary to what the compatibility charts tell me. 
1	Eek not a huge fan. I absolutely adore INTPs though
3	Confused ENFP with a very new ESFP (possible) boyfriend	Been friends with this guy for a while now, things started getting more flirtatious of late, but it could've been purely circumstantial (us being thrown together as two love interests in a recent production, etc)... we obviously like each other but I definitely get vibes that anything that seems too serious too quickly could really overwhelm him... not that I'd be taking any giant leaps like saying I love you this early, or trying to force an exclusive relationship, but it's more just that he seems to avoid any conversation about what his sudden affection meant, and he's got a slew of female friends that he also seems to be flirting with at any given time, although it seems like more of a playful kind of thing than sincere affection?? i don't know this rant is going nowhere point is i'm confused and he's hard to read and idk how to broach the subject of possibly dating/not/what does he want/what are his intentions.. i'm fine with whatever they are, but i'd honestly just like to know. anybody have any advice/experience?
6	[deleted]
1	ESFP here and a huge flirt too. I think it is a big part of our personality, and don't want to feel like being in a relationship will stop us interacting like we always have with people.
1	Am I the only esfp who doesn't flirt, or maybe I am and don't know? 
11	Advice for Dealing with Loneliness?	I recently went through a lot of changes and currently don't have a significant other, family, or many friends.  I'm in the process of a rebuilding from a fresh start, but without many people to spend time with I constantly find myself alone.  When I have to spend a day alone I just get so incredibly sad and bored... no matter how productive I am the day still feels like a waste without anyone to share it with. My hobbies stop entertaining me when it's all I ever have to do. I would really like to figure out how to enjoy my own company and be less dependent on attention from others.\n\nHow do other ESFPs keep themselves from feeling lonely without people around? How did you learn to enjoy your own company?
4	For me, I still have it sometimes, but it's not crippling or stopping me from enjoying life. I got cats to avoid loneliness. Pets that like cuddling really help. I have a hobby, that has people with it, so I establish some lightweight friendships in there. I also exist a lot online. And I still feel somewhat lonely. Not sure what to say. Learn some mindfulness. Explore why you find it so oppressive and anxiety inducing? Are you good at being alone?\n\nGood thing is joining different clubs, or sport teams, or gyms, and building a connection. Try find people in areas you are interested in. Express yourself.
5	I'm not the best example. I have only lived entirely alone in my own apartment for a month of life out of my 33 years. \n\nNow I live in a poly cluster with my husband, his husband, and our children. I love it this way. I am not sure if I really could live all on my own for extended periods of time. The truth is, I wouldn't want to do that. I live for the company of others.\n\nBut do I enjoy time by myself? Yes. My primary alone time is during exercise. Even so, my long runs are often a chance to reconnect with friends, so I only exercise alone sometimes - but this is the time I use to think, ponder, and wonder. Exercise is the best when the physical fades away - I can't even tell I'm running anymore because I'm floating away in my head. It's what I need, because I can't have my head in the clouds at home, so my long run in the mountains is the *perfect* mental vacation.\n\nI'm just glad that I have a big poly family to come home to after my little temporary escape to the mountains.\n\nMy advice is balance - find ways to enjoy your own company that allow you to rebalance and refresh. And there's nothing wrong with seeking out friends, family, and acquaintances for company most of the time.\n\nJust think of Eleanor Roosevelt. She basically became part of her personal doctor's family near the end of her life.\n\nPolyamory suits us ESFPs better than other types, I believe. 
1	Time. \n\nGo out. Gym and coffee shops. If you have a job talk to them. Ask if they know people who enjoy certain activities and ask to meet them or hang out.
1	I used to be worried about that as a teen, but right now I deal with it a lot more easily. I just kinda realized that I don't need to chase people to be happy. Being alone doesn't have to be a big deal. I go through periods of being by myself and then living an active social life, and when I'm by my solo I don't mind it. I really enjoy being around people I like, but I don't constantly need it. Weed also helps if you're into that sort of stuff.\n\nBe more active on the internet would be my only advice, maybe try to rekindle some old relationships in real life too
1	My son is an ESFP. I can see this type of pain in him when he doesn't have enough opportunity to get out with his friends or experience new things. [Meetup.com](https://Meetup.com) is a godsend, for both his development and my sanity. As an INTP I used it to explore my interests and ended up finding some of the greatest friends I've ever had. Friends isn't even the right term, they have become what I consider to be my real family. The beauty is that you don't have to rush into relationships (my pitfall when I used to let myself get so lonely I'd take whatever came along lol) as you can get to know people slowly and organically through the process of performing fun, healthy, inspiring activities together. \n\nI really don't think it's a good idea to try to learn to enjoy your own company for any extended period of time as an ESFP. Your strength, and my son's lie in your transcendent abilities in relational activity and to deny yourself and others of that would just be a type of "little death" that neither you, nor the world, deserve. If there isn't anything that interests you in your area, start your own Meetup!
1	Practice practice practice! I purposely moved out alone this year so i could spend time by myself without needing to rely on hanging out with other people. It gets easier with time (and I’ve actually turned into a little but of a hermit)
4	Unhealthy ESFPs, how do you act?	
19	Constantly spending money, making little lies, and going out drinking like every weekend are my main problems
12	compulsive drinking): exaggerating stories, excessive flirtatious behaviour, inappropriate sexual activity with a guy i probably shouldnt be banging, constant need for validation and attention
7	I think that in the context of mbti "healthy" is a word you have to be careful with, usually people only believe that their subjective beliefs about how things should be are what "healthy" is.\n\nContrary to what others have said, I barely ever lie(in the sense of making up things to make myself look good) and have always been good with my money. To me unhealthy ESFPs are the ones that are caught up in their inferior Ni. It can manifest in becoming existential, paranoid or believing crazy conspiracy theories. Craving attention and having random sex are not really signs of an "unhealthy ESFP"
4	Just a heads up, this forum doesn't have a lot of actively commenting people 
4	I get a ton of symptoms of social anxiety (which go away when I'm at my healthiest), shut myself away from everybody else, becomes super analytical about everything to avoid feelings
3	For me being unhealthy meant lying a lot to escape my responsibilities which led me to becoming really paranoid with everyone, and being completely disgenuine all the time I wasnt alone. I am as naughty with spending money and partying now as a more healthy person than I was when unhealthy. Probably more so actually.
2	What do you think of ISFPs?	
5	i have a crush on one! shes so cool and i love talking to her
3	ISFP is a pretty cool guy. eh have good aesthetic tastes and doesn't afraid of anything
4	ESFPs, how are you different than an average esfp?	
11	Fashion. Every ESFP has a different sense of style.
3	I don't really think there's an "average" ESFP. Eeeeeveryone has something that's different about them. :)
1	My weight 
1	Idk
1	More pessimistic. Could be a result of having an unhappy year tho.
1	MBTI Discord Server!	*x-posted to other MBTI subreddits*\n\nHi gang,\n\nI  just created Discord server called MBTI Penpals for any type of  personality to be able to communicate with others of any type of  personality. Check it out here:\n\n[https://discord.gg/pRRGnTd](https://discord.gg/pRRGnTd)\n\nCome  find more people of your type, or seek for others of compatible (or not  compatible) types! Talk with each other in real-time, either via text  chat or voice chat. Enjoy!
2	How do you motivate yourself to be more active?	Any exclusive tips on how to beat everyone's ass at everything and not be lazy?
4	Force yourself. Sometimes it’s the best solution.
3	I use the moments when I feel optimistic and energized about getting stuff done to accept responsibilities and make promises. I work better with the stick so I put myself into a position where if I dont get the thing done I’m in big trouble.
2	It takes time to make something into a regular habit. \n\nYou'll have to force yourself to go exercise for the first few weeks, but after that, you'll be missing it on the days you don't go.

5	Signs you are definitely not ESFP	Heyo, party people \^\^\n\nI am confused about my type and would like to hear what you, ESFPs, see as signs that one is definitely not ESFP.\n\nI'm excited for what you'll come up with \^\^
17	“Visiting a new country?!? Omg let me get started on a check list and timing schedule ASAP!”
9	If you think first before action 🤔😂😂 jkkkk
9	"I just love structure and routine. It makes me feel safe."
2	I mean there are loads. Being extra conservative, pessimistic, strictly abiding by all the rules.\n\nAs always - look into functions first and foremost and socionics if you feel like you might be an ESFP, but don't really relate to the most common MBTI descriptions

1	Personality types and underwear types? (x-post /r/mbti)	Hello there.\n\nI did a bit of research on that topic, but didn't find anything meaningful (searched through google scholar).\n\nI was wondering if I could find correlation (and perhaps causation) from psychological types to the type of underwear worn.\n\nHere's the [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Q0O9FFHmOZKay1ztg9g39iEsP9gjGIYwejsnFrjGZ9Y/edit).\n\nFeel  free to comment on those questions aswell (with your MBTI type  identified) if you want. I figured this sort of survey would be okay  since there was a fetish survey a week ago on [/r/MBTI](https://www.reddit.com/r/MBTI). Hope it's alright!
1	Could I be INFP, ESFP, or neither?	I’m fairly certain that I have Fi, but unsure if it’s dominant or auxiliary. I wrote a description of myself awhile back that was based on how others saw me, traits I saw in myself, and tried to cover different areas in my life. I got mixed results, a lot of ESFP and INFP. I’ve read about both and I can easily see myself as both, but I know I can only possibly be one, and I’m stumped trying to find out. \n\nI’ll make my case for each and try to include my motivations as well.  \n\n**My main reasons for INFP** are the Fi-Si loop: I‘m sentimental and nostalgic about certain events in my past and love sharing them because I’m not ready to let them go, and I’d like to think those around me care as much as I do. I have a lot of photos and remember the specific dates of the events that were emotionally relevant for me, again because I don’t want to forget, I believe that they aren’t truly gone unless you forget about them. I don’t care about my appearance as much, I obviously take care of hygiene but I rarely deviate from my normal clothing style because it’s comfortable, that and because I freaking hate clothes shopping in general haha. I don’t display a lot of your average Se traits, I’m pretty clumsy and uncharismatic, and you could see my cringe-worthy and awkward movements from a mile away if you saw me in real life. I’m not sure if this would be attributed to inferior Te or not, but I’m pretty un-assertive and I don’t like taking the lead for random things just for the sake of taking the lead. It’s not that I dislike the attention, I just hate asserting myself and trying to act as an authority figure. I wouldn’t like being above people, I’d rather be equal and liked than higher and powerful, and plus the added responsibility and pressure is not worth it for me. If it’s something that I’m truly passionate about though, I’m absolutely the first to speak up and let everyone know, whether I not I’d really “take the lead” that depends, but I definitely show a lot of excitement and enthusiasm if something I’m passionate about hits. \n\n**My main reasons for ESFP:** I feel like I’m too trusting and enthusiastic about the company of people to be an INFP. I’ve gotten feedback about being very naïve and open to strangers even as a child. Canceled social plans just cut so deep for me, I can’t even explain the overwhelming disappointment when I’m looking forward to hanging out and then it just gets rescheduled or cancled. I love being with people, especially when they allow me to be who I am and let me show my real self. I love telling stories, making friends, laughing my ass off, and being well known in the community/social life. I feel absolutely furfilled and hyped after a fun social night and I can’t relate to needing to immediately go home and be alone to recharge. Whole I don’t mind my alone time, I usually just use it to watch shows or make memes or something, I rarely ever go deep into my thoughts and get extremely depressed if I do. Life is awesome and I think being existential and over-complicated makes things really depressing and weighed down for no reason. I’ve never really seen myself as intuitive, in fact I’ve even gotten feedback for not thinking about future implications, “you need to look at the big picture,” think about the long-term etc. I sometimes blurt things out without realizing the consequences and doing absolutely retarded things in the moment and then physically cringing at myself as I look back and reflect on it. It looks like a great idea and it looks like the best option at the time, so I’d go ahead and then it just blows up in my face. \n\nBased on my evaluation (and if necessary, my profile shows my previous type me posts), what would you reckon I could be?
2	ESFP
3	Honestly? You talk too much to be an ESFP, I mean that in the nicest way possible! Look at all the other posts on here and how brief and void of analysis they are (maybe that was a little strong). You sound like a great person, my guess would be INFP/ENFP. 
1	Try carefully reading through socionics profiles and seeing which ones you identify with. These are more detailed than MBTI ones which makes it easier to figure out your type.  \n    \n[INFP by Gulenko](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=EII_Profile_by_Gulenko) | [INFP by Stratiyevskaya](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/42490) | [INFP subtypes](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/7432-EII-INFj-Subtypes?p=138200&viewfull=1#post138200)   \n   \n[ESFP by Gulenko](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=SEE_Profile_by_Gulenko) | [ESFP by Stratiyevskaya](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/42477) | [ESFP subtypes](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=SEE_subtypes)    \n
1	As an INFP I can tell that your not INFP. More like ESFP. 
3	All my friends are introverted	I have no idea how it ended up this way but I adopted all of them forcefully. I'm gonna be at their death beds.\n\nWhat's it like to have other extroverted friends? Genuinely don't know 🤷🏻‍♀️
3	We roll together
1	I’d say the biggest thing is we hype each other up, and motivate each other to go out of our way to do things.
6	Do you agree with this description of dominant Se?	I personally think it's mostly a load of bs from a judgemental intuitive lol what are your thoughts?\n\n>Extraverted Sensation Types\n\nExtraverted Sensation is the easiest function to understand as it simply coincides with what we observe in the outer reality, usage of the body, force, where objects are located in life and biological factors as well as observation of societal tradition and ancestry.\n\nThis type's thinking and feeling are mostly guided by the objective reality in general. They are the most ordinary in society and live life by the standardized rules and regulations. Depending on the subtype, one's ethics (Se-Fi) or ideaologies (Se-Ti) may keep them from going overboard as far as hedonism goes.\n\nSe dominants with Se subtypes are more hedonistic and have less developed auxiliary functions. (A few rappers belong to this type. Ted Bundy may have also belonged to this type and of course was an extreme case.)\n\nMost MBTI blogs don't mention the portion of Se that observes and celebrates ancestral history. However, Jung, Von Franz & Van der Hoop have brought this up. It is also a huge piece of information because it is why Ni dominants are said to at times worship ancestral figures or believe they are in "spiritual communication" with archetypes. (Feeling angels watching over them and etc.)\n\nSe doms are very much interested in biological facts and scientific research based on dissection of plants, animals and etc\n\nSe doms were the majority of western civilization during the time of Jung, Von Franz & Van der Hoop.\n\n[ Inferior Ni ] Se types are often good at writing Science Fiction stories or telling ghost stories for fun. The Sci-Fi movies are mostly based in fantasies that manipulate biology because they are aware they are absurd and have no chance of coming true. (As opposed to the Ni dom who is more likely to believe in things such as ghosts & etc.) Paranormal horror films such as The Grudge, Idle Hands, Pet Semetary& Sci-Fi movies such as Jurassic Park, The Fly and Tarantula are great examples of great extraverted sensing creativity in movies. (This isn't to say they are Se types but Se/Ni has been applied.)\n\nThey are the best at knowing how to use force, aggression and the body to reach their goals. This is why they are often said to be amazing athletes.\n\n[ Inferior Ni ] -- During times of stress, they may deviate away from their normal mode of common sense and become paranoid that others are doing things against them\n\n[ Inferior Ni ] -- In stress or considering people they dislike, they made attribute inaccurate intuitions about them\n\n[ Inferior Ni ] -- May suddenly become interested in eastern philosophy , unconventional spirituality or become interested in basic forms of parapsychology such as the "daily horoscope" and such. However, they truly don't understand the concepts of such things and leave that to Ni doms.\n\nOne of the most efficient and happy-go-lucky types out of them all. They can be happy simply being alive and make the most out of the moment.\n\nThey may like a neat and aesthetically pleasing house, dress according to the weather and sometimes like to flex material goods.\n\n[ Unhealthy Se ] -- They may have an intense ego if they are unhealthy and accumulate tons of money. They become flashy, extravagant, shallow, and egotistical. (Some rappers belong to this type.)\n\n[ Unhealthy Se ] -- They may expect special treatment due to status and can be classist. They may set certain standards concerning who's "allowed" to be seen with them or not based on morals or ideas surrounding materialism. (The women from the movie Jawbreaker and Mean Girls are included in this type.)\n\nSometimes Se types confuse themselves with feelers because reflexive emotions are sparked with sensations at times and can be intense. ( A woman may get a sudden intense sensation during sex or a man when seeing a woman he is super attracted to.) However, emotional intensity is mostly caused by perceptive functions instead of evaluative ethics.\n\n>Life Quote: " I'd rather pay attention to things I can prove and live each day as if it were my last. I want to make the most of my life and have no regrets. \n\nhttps://reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/9saeni/misconceptions_about_each_type_warning_long/

1	“Se-dom = conformist”\n\nLooooool. What about Bella Thorne?
24	Normal for ESFPs?	I Feel like ESFPs are seen as social outgoing people, which i am for the most part, but whenever I'm in a social situation where I'm the only one that doesnt know anyone or only know a few people i get really uncomfortable and become really scared to come on too strong or seem weird. Is this normal for you guys?
15	Very normal!\n\nI think ESFP's are better at projecting confidence, and hiding anxiety, but we tend to ease into situations once we are comfortable. \n\nSocial anxiety is normal for everyone to a certain degree actually, I think we just handle it differently from other personalities. 
4	Depends on the situation. For me, whenever I feel comfy, I instantly open up to everyone, even if I don’t really know them.
4	Very normal! I once went to a party not knowing everyone and could see people were gesturing 'whats this guy talking about' 'hes crazy' which definitely got to me (have a case of verbal diarrhoea when I'm in these situations'
4	I feel you. I hold myself back a lot in these situations, especially if when I do try and open up to everyone I get negative feedback. It’s very hit or miss for me though, because sometimes I could be completely comfortable with the people I’m with and just let myself loose and try not to let embarrassment hold me down, but most of the time I’ll end up sitting back with my mouth shut wishing I could speak up but can’t gather the balls to do it. I can absolutely relate to this. 
2	Norm!
1	I literally do this all the time
1	Me all the way
3	Can ESFPs be low energy	So I'm tryna type someone else here and he is everything ESFP except the loud and full of energy stereotype. Is it possible that he is still ESFP?
4	Yeah possible bro
2	Absolutely! You don’t have to fit into 100% of the stereotypes, and certainly don’t let it throw you off track. I think it’s better to look at the motives rather than behaviors, because people can do the same things for different reasons, and going by behaviors can be very contradictory and you’ll never fully be confident in the type if you’re constantly realizing that you’re not completely matching the stereotype. \n\nMaybe find out why he’s low energy? For me, I’m only really cheery and enthusiastic when I’m confident that the people enjoy my presence and I’m allowed to be myself. Otherwise, I won’t match the high-energy persona at all. Especially under stress. \n\nI wouldn’t completely discard ESFP as a possibility. This might sound a little cliche, but maybe ask if he feels energized/furfilled or wants to go spend time alone to recharge after spending time with people? You can be a low-energy extrovert or a high-energy introvert, it isn’t necessarily a causation. 
2	No we are all full of energy all the time. I haven't slept in 18 years. Please send help.
1	Does he smoke weed?
4	University life	How do you guys manage University life, like in terms of academics and social life and other activities?\n\nI just feel that I can’t keep a good balance between the two. It’s so hard to even have a social life if you are focused on studies or vice versa.\n\nAs for academics, Im currently on the failing edge in terms of academics, I don’t know man, maybe I just really don’t like the course of study I’m doing right now. But the thing is, if I quit halfway, how would my parents feel about sending loads of money only to fail after that.\n\nIs university life really hard, like especially for engineering students and shits or maybe it’s just me. I feel like I can’t cram in anything, like it’s so boring.\n\nWhat should I do? It’s been bothering me for ages.
5	Im in the same boat man. College is not a happy place for me, because studying, homework and work consume my life, and it makes me unhappy, because i really had no social life. I told my parents that and they told me to take some time off to think and reflect, so here i am taking the semester off, and I’m feeling way better. I’m not saying drop out, but take a step back at the situation, or a break to recharge.
5	We all must suffer one of two things: the pain of regret, or the pain of discipline. \n\nThis is life, unfortunately. \n\nI did a uni course I had no passion for because it offered a safe career. I put in my hard time during uni, and I’m cruising now. No regrets. 
3	I wonder if it's because it's hard for us to plan ahead and block off time. It's either all in or nothing. I'm actually an ENFP, but I think I know what it's like be S pretty well because a lot of people in my life are S's and I've developed some S tendencies. When I was more N I could block off time better - like I'll study for 30 minutes, socialize for 30, do my laundry, and come back. When I'm more S, I just work until I'm hungry, eat until I'm full, work until I'm bored, go do something, feel guilty about it, and have to get back to work. It's kind of stressful, honestly. My brother (who's an ISFP), suggested that I decide how much I need to get done to feel good about myself, and then decide to do other things. Maybe that will be a good way to keep things balanced. Hope that helps!
1	Can you guys also read my “type me” post and let me know what I should do about this if that helps
5	Have any ESFPs ever cheated in a relationship?	Any personality type is probably capable of cheating under the right circumstances, and ESFPs have a reputation for being the flirtiest type, but I feel like they are relatively unlikely to cheat for a few reasons:\n\n1. They would not stay in a relationship that makes them unhappy enough to cheat. They’re more likely to cut ties first. \n2. They don’t have the patience it would take to try to cover up their infidelity. This would require a lot of strategic maneuvering/planning that they’re not interested in. \n3. Because introverted feeling is such a major part of their being, they wouldn’t be comfortable with the “fakery” that would be infidelity. In other words, they need to be themselves so wholeheartedly that they couldn’t bring themselves to either stay in an unhappy relationship nor sleep with someone else while being in a relationship. \n\nOf course, there’s the possibility that an ESFP’s impulsivity wins out, and they do actually sleep with someone but soon after regret it and realize how much they love the partner they’re with. Has anyone ever been in this situation? Some people need to test boundaries and experience something before they can understand it, and I think ESFPs are definitely that type. \n\nAlso, what about sleeping with an ex? It seems like introverted feeling would stop them there as well. Obviously, you broke up for a reason, and introverted feeling tends to like emotional closure to a point where you wouldn’t have any interest in reopening that door. \n\nAnyone have any experience with any of this?
5	Like the other poster here, I put off dating for ages. It felt futile. Either I get close enough about the person to kind of be forced into monogamy and miss out, or I end up just amusing myself for a bit until it gets too serious.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am in a relationship now, and I addressed the monogamy thing with him and how much I was struggling with it (I was contemplating cheating), but it felt so dishonest and unfair I couldn't premeditate it. So the only times I am considering it is when I could potentially slip up in the moment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInteresting what you said about our need to be ourselves wholeheartedly in our relationships. After having the convo with my bf, I felt instantly 10x better having just spoke about it that the urge went away. I think we hate being told we can't do anything and need to make out own decisions. We need to know we have the freedom to act in a moment, rather than try and figure out some plan about that moment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut no to the ex as well. I think we don't like ambiguity and repeating our mistakes too much to do that most of the time. Unless it was an in-the-moment thing.\n\n&#x200B;
3	That’s why I never dated, I’m personally afraid of that.\nI just prefer fuck-buddies or one night stands, they are soo much better.
1	My boyfriend is an ESFP.\n\nHe has cheated on his previous partners, but not on me. (As far as I know. But I have no reason to believe that he has.)\n\nHis reason for cheating was that he was unhappy, and his relationship was incredibly unstable. He would get drunk and his impulsivity got the best of him.
7	esfp's of reddit, an intp needs your advice.	my brother, an esfp, just had his heart broken by a woman he was deeply in love with. just this weekend he shared with us that he was going to ask her to marry him, and now this happened. i want to do what i can to help him through this, but i'm at a loss of what i can do. he's the only feeler in our family since our dad passed away, as well as the only male. and i know zero about relationships so i can't even give him any helpful advice.\n\nif it was me hurting, i'd want to be left alone to think and process and analyze until i could make sense of what happened and how i feel. but i'm VERY aware that this isn't a method that works for everyone. \n\ni tried distracting him today with a new video game. we had a nice conversation about playstyles, battle preferences, and ranking franchises by the quality of their combat systems. it seemed to cheer him up, if just for a while. i also spent a few hours today texting him star wars memes. he loves those. even managed to find some he hadn't seen yet.\n\nhow am i doing so far? and any advice on what else i can do? i really am at a loss here. \n\nthanks for listening.\n\n-an intp
8	ESFP's will normally want to be alone for the healing process. You may find them declining to leave the house, or join their friends in activities until they are out of their rut.  ESFP's have a natural confidence in themselves, and being spurned by their loved ones can take its toll on their psych. We mostly need time to feel sorry for ourselves, and might actively prevent being cheered up until we do so. \n\nYou can speed this process by giving us an opportunity to feel needed.  Remind  us of our value by asking our opinions on things, asking us to help with something we are good at, and we will be our normal confident self soon enough.   \n\n\nGuys tend to take breakups harder than ladies, and pout for longer about it, so don't expect a dramatic return to form  for at least a week or two. But ESFP's bounce back to full strength faster than others, and we will be looking for something else to admire in no time. 
6	Just wanna say you sound like a very kind person. :)\n\nFrom my experience with break-ups or just hard times in general, being surrounded by friends and family who truly care about me is what ultimately brings me out of what feels like an emotional abyss. I know it's not always natural or comfortable to try comforting someone when you aren't an open feeler, but knowing that someone would even try can mean everything and make all of the difference.\n\nDistractions from thinking about the difficult shit is important. From what you've said, you sound like you know your brother well and you don't need advice from me or anyone on how to comfort him.
3	You're doing great! \n\nWhen I'm down I love spending time with those I care about and even if I'm not up for socializing I always appreciate an invite. 
3	Wow you’re so sweet! \nI would want to just have someone there with me.  After my most recent break up I ended up just bouncing from one friend’s house to another because I really didn’t want to be alone. He might want to talk about it sometimes and he might really not want to other times and both are ok. 
2	Just keep up with what you’re doing, you’re doing great! 
2	exactly what you are doing right now is awesome!\n\ngiving space but letting him know he can talk to you (without constantly repeating that) and distracting him with things he enjoys, will definitely help the grieving process. plus just being with someone he loves and cares about would cheer him up. \n\nit's a process, and he'll make his way out of it. dont worry. you sound lovely!
2	Thoughts on casual sex?	I'd say engaging in casual sex would match our stereotype, but stereotypes aren't often true.\n\nWhat are your morals/thoughts on casual sex?\n\nDo you think its fun and enjoyable, or do you prefer a stable committed relationship?\n\nLet me know!\n\nFYI: I'm torn.
10	I’d honestly rather not, I think sex is very private and should only really be had when you really love someone. The thought of giving it out for free and treating it like just another hobby is rather disgusting. I really don’t like that it’s apart of our stereotype. 
3	I’m not opposed to a quick poke here or there from a stranger
6	I have always been quite relaxed with it. I guess for me its more like casual emotional bonding. Like I love to get deep with someone even if we aren't that close.\n\nI'm a gay man and kinda always experimented/fooled around with friends throughout the years. This year I have got a boyfriend though and I **really** struggled giving up casual intimacy ahha.
4	It is what it is bro. We love casual sex. I did a hooker 2 years ago. Not ashamed.
3	I'd rather not. 
2	You’re all sluts
1	What is your favorite song?	What is the song you replay for many times? 
2	dont worry about it
2	amy winehouse songs !! all of them !!1 all the time !!!!!
2	The Odyssey by Symphony X. 
1	Definitely All star by smash mouth
13	Can you relate?	After spending a day or two alone without talking to anyone (just watching Netflix or playing video games or whatever) when I get out I feel really down and cloudy and irritable. But after a few hours of spending time with people like after hanging out with friends or going to a gettogether I feel happy and excited and talk more. Do you experience this or it’s just me ?
6	Same, I will want to be lazy and not talk to anyone or go out. When I do that on a Saturday, by 5 pm I feel like shit and want to socialize. After I socialize for a few hours I feel accomplished.
6	Yup that’s me too. There’s only a certain amount of time that I can withstand being alone before I start becoming moody 
2	Yeah same man
1	Yeah I always look forward to me-time cause I can do whatever I want then I feel like shit after a few hours and seek out my friends
1	YES. 
4	Youtuber C.S. Joseph Concludes That Taylor Swift Is ESFP	
3	no
3	*D A B*
1	Personally, I don't really agree with a lot of this guy's typing and I don't really agree that Taylor Swift is ESFP. So far in my opinion, I think the only typing he's actually done a good job on is Alex Jones but even with Alex Jones, I don't agree with his concluded typing. Generally speaking, conspiracy theories revolve around Ni and so ENFP for Alex Jones doesn't really make sense because of Ne. Alex Jones seems to be in the Ni-Se or Se-Ni Dynamic/Axis to me and I feel he's a J-type so some kind of NJ. I guess I can agree that Alex Jones is on the Fi-Te or Te-Fi Dynamic/Axis which leaves either ENTJ or INTJ and I'm leaning towards INTJ for him.
2	How do you guys handle when 2 of your best friends dislike each other?	Title says it all bruh
5	i just ignore the problem, hang with them separately. im not their mother, i wont baby them. they are fully capable of maintaining their own relationships and making their own decisions, getting me involved would be immature and childish. if they make it ur problem, tell them youre not responsible for their own happiness and friendship issues, and that you like them both but you dont want to choose
2	I went through this exact situation in hs. I basically focused onakng the both of them enjoying spending time with me to the point they could get over it. There were a lot of time we'd hangout and they'd only talk to me and there were no group discussions but eventually they grew out of it and get a long real well now. Granted they were friends before and went through a point where they just couldn't stand each other
1	Thanks for the responses guys haha. Currently the hatred isn’t that strong so I’ll ignore the problem for now. But when the going gets tougher, I would probably try to make peace with them, and if that does not resolve, I would retreat.\nCheers people 💙
5	Do you guys prefer travelling alone or with friends?	Because for me I would prefer travelling alone and meet new people rather than to travel with friends and probably get your freedom stripped off for the whole trip. Do you guys feel this way too? Or am I just different here?
4	There’s no way I could travel alone. I would feel adrift and awkward and out of place without other people. I’d rather just go with a group, I don’t know what I’d do on my own. But that’s just me.
1	I like travelling alone, one of my favorite things of my trips are meeting people in my hostel and going for pub crawls. Usually they laugh at me for being drunk, but I don't really care 😂
2	ESFPs?!-How do you usually get into a Relationship?	Please help me out! I want to understand it a bit more since I am trying to be pretty serious with my crush. We've been seeing each other for over a month and I have been letting him have free range because I know that's what he needs! But I know he will continue to keep coming back again and again. \n\nHow do you get into a relationship? Are you usually looking for one? Is it an accident? Do you like a relationship label or is a label unnecessary? Would a label feel constraining? Or would it make you warm and fuzzy inside?\n\nSpill the ESFP Beans Please
14	It’s always an accident\n
8	I'll be doing my usual thing, meet somebody, we talk, we keep talking, we hang out, keep hanging out, realize that we actually really like each other, and once it hits the point where I only like them I let them know and boom! relationship.
4	21/F ESFP. Always a friend first then I usually make it obvious that I wanna have them to myself, usually by getting physical. Then they're mine. :)
1	It comes when you least expect it. Don’t even try to look forward for it.
1	Lol can relate to the comments. Totally on accident. You just don't get sick of seeing someone enough to keep hanging out over and over and over oh shit now i have a partner. :P
1	Honestly accidentally I don't ask for it, it's rare when I seek out a relationship 
2	How do ESFPs deal with death?	I have an ESFP who has been grieving the accidental death of a very close family member for over 6 months. She barely goes to work, can't sleep, confesses that she's always irritated at things that would never bother her before, and you can tell when she's thinking of her loved one because she tears up but then refuses to talk about it. It's almost like she feels embarrassed or ashamed. I think she has a lot of guilt/blame/regret over her last interaction with this person. What she did wasn't ill-intended or even bad, but I think she keeps thinking that if only she had done something differently anyhow, it wouldn't have happened. \n\nShe had a brief period right after the death where she indulged in a lot of drinking and sex. That seems to have abated, but she won't go to therapy or a support group, and she won't go to the doctor and ask for medication. I've suggested some self-care things like exercise and writing but she dismisses those too.\n\nI know the grief process can take years, but I worry that she's not coping well. Then again I'm very different from her, so maybe this isn't as maladaptive as it comes across to me. What do you guys think? How do you deal with grief? And what approach would be most helpful to her under these circumstances? 
6	Not well. It’ll be a process. This will sound silly, but my friend got a puppy and it was adorable and brought it over for me to play with. She subtly asked if I could walk her. And it helped a lot. Maybe try getting her outside where she doesn’t feel like a burden. I get a lot of joy out of making others feel good while doing things that are good for me too. (Being outside, getting some exercise) \n\nSorry if this wasn’t helpful or the help you were lookin for. Just be there for her. Lots of hugs!
5	My now girlfriend (also an ESFP) had a similar experience.  A mutual friend of ours ubruptly/accidentally passed away and she was the one who had been performing CPR on them before they died in hospital a day later.\n\nIt was almost impossible to get any of her true feelings on how she was coping out, ESPECIALLY if she started getting emotional.  If things get too heavy she will completely shutdown, ignore it and/or cry intensely.\n\nShe’s much better now a year later. \nThe thing that got her through in the end was lots of support from friends and family.  As well as introducing as many positive things into her life as possible (e.g. new job, dating, new home etc.). I think for Better or Worse distraction as opposed to discussion seemed to have worked the best, which is very different from myself.\n\n\n\n
3	Also you’re a really good friend :)
2	I’m a ENTJ with an ESFP girlfriend.  I believe simply being there for your friend in the many and various ways speaks volumes to ESFPs.  Saying it is nice but doing things, small or large, says a lot.  Showing them you stand with them during this time will help. She feels deeply and therefor will grieve deeply.  Be there and expect no answers.  (I may be wrong so if any ESFPs want to help me I would appreciate it). 
1	we don't deal with it well. we don't like people seeing us cry even though we get emotional really quickly. We are good at reframing though, meaning if we convince ourselves to look at things a different way, we truly believe it. But it can't be coming from someone else, we have to somewhat discover it ourselves and believe it. I would say give her new experiences that she appreciates so her mind can flex and readjust. 
1	ESFP being a jerk to me	Hello I am an ENFP and I recently made a post wondering what was going down with my ESFP friend's attitude. \nShe's been blunt, rude, quick to lie, ungrateful, and anti-social for the past several days. \nShe's been like this before, but she always apologizes soon after and explains the reason why. It's usually related to anxiety. However, this time it's lasted for almost 5 days. \nThe only times she has been normal are when she's back around her boyfriend. She randomly will be amicable and laughing but only when she's making fun of me. \nShe's always been sort of pretentious, but always kind and complimentary. I know she's going through things with her family lately, and she can't go back home to see her family since they were affected by Hurricane Florence. They're all safe though, and last I heard doing fine. \nIf she ever looks grumpy, or angry, and I ask her what's up, she gets frustrated at me. \nThe other day, I gave her and several others a ride to a film festival 30 minutes away, and she didn't say thank you when the others did, and was a backseat driver the whole way. She was rapping along to her rap music, and I could tell got frustrated when I asked her to change the music because it was distracting. \nMy question is, \nany idea why she's acting like this, and also what's the best way to approach her and tell her that she's hurting me (or if that's a terrible idea), or if you have any idea when she'll stop?\n\nEDIT: We worked it out and figured out that she was just really drained that week, and it was partially due to my sheer energy level. So we reached a compromise of how if she feels drained because of that, that she should tell me because immediate communication is a lot less messy. 
7	First: You’re sure she’s your friend? \n\nAlso how did you come to the conclusion that she’s ESFP?\n\nAnd I don’t really think there’s a magical “ESFP way” to approach her or deal with this, she just sounds like passive-aggressive person and isn’t very interested in having a genuine relationship with you from what I read. It’s really up to you if you want to approach her about it or not but either way it isn’t healthy to cling to people like that.
3	Shes being passive agressive and isnt adding value to the relationship. Best thing is to confront her or drop her. The reality is that she just doesnt seem to give a shit how you feel and there isnt some magical thing you can do to make her care. You either value someone or you dont, and sge doesnt seem to value you.
2	Talk to her about her stank attitude. Come from an approach of understanding her anxiety/reasonable stress, but those factors don't give her the right to treat you like crap. Most people I know who deal with anxiety don't understand how they may be hurting people. If you bring it to their attention it may freak them out a little, but if they're a decent person they'll try to treat you better. \n\n\-and/or-\n\nFind someone who treats you better. \n\n&#x200B;
2	She does not sound like a good friend and you should drop her ungrateful ass. 
1	Confront her
2	Needing Help with an ESFP friend	Hey all!! I am an ENFP, and have a really good ESFP friend. Lately, she’s been acting really distant and just giving off a really sad vibe. She occasionally has these spells, but this has been the longest one so far. It started right after dinner the other night when we had a great conversation with another friend. As soon as we left, she came across like she was almost upset with me even though I did nothing. I asked her about it and she said nothing was wrong. She’s been like this before, but it was when she felt anxious in a crowded environment and she directed her discomfort towards me because she knew I could take it. The difference is that there she immediately apologized afterwards and explained what happened. \nAny tips or just general insight as to what she’s going through?
1	She’s probably just jealous that you had a VERY great convo with ANOTHER FRIEND. I relate to your friend sometimes. I get anxious when I feel that I am going to be replaced by someone else.
1	Maybe something about the conversation made her feel something was lacking in her life?
5	Careers and Creativity	Hey all,\n\nI feel like I am very much an ESFP, and a turbulent one at that.\n\nI started a job this year that kinda sucks. I sit at a desk 8-5 and type out code allllllll day. Sounds like torture for an ESFP - a fact I didn't consider when I was aiming for this industry. \n\nThe job has slowly turned me into a monotonous, pretty unhappy guy. I feel like I have lost my spark that I used to have during the day, and it will only appear on the weekends again now. What makes it worse is I left a good job which had a good balance of social to it to come here (and better $$). I keep beating myself up for it, but also too scared to go find another job impulsively due to how it would screw people over here, and probably not look good by any means. Ontop of that idk what role to even go for (Full Stack Developer atm, definitely not that :P)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI see a lot of ESFP's have a lot of creativity, but I feel like I never quite embraced it growing up, then went to a field that was not too creative either. Did anyone else feel like this? How did you find your creative passion? How did you find a career you enjoyed and didn't have to force yourself to every day, and spend all day counting down the minutes until you leave?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just want to be okay with getting up and going to work or being there, but I spend such a proportion of my day unhappy, its turning me into somebody I don't like.
2	First of all, are you absolutely sure you're an ESFP? Don't go off stereotypes, go through individual functions and analyze your behavior to see if it really fits you. Secondly, being an ESFP does not equal being creative. What are you good at, what did you want to do when you were growing up, why did you get involved in this industry in the first place, what were your motivations? Answer those questions and you'll figure out why you don't like your current job. It's never late to start over, better to waste some time learning something new, rather than constantly trying something you know you don't like. If you don't know what you want or like maybe it's time to do some soul searching and explore new ideas.
1	I have artistic people in my family, which definitely influenced me to do art myself. I also grew up singing karaoke and three-ish years ago I also picked up the ukulele. But these are all just my hobbies!\n\nLast year I worked a job that physically and mentally drained me. I basically worked in a factory, doing the same thing every day (I was packing those serving carts with coffee and tea pots for commercial planes), and the only time I got to interact with anyone was during breaks. It was so exhausting to me. At the moment I really want to work in a grocery store so I get to interact with people all day!
1	My partner is ESFP and a chef. I think that's common for sensory types. He is high energy and has a very keen nose. He likes the busyness and clamour of the kitchen.   \n\n\nCreativity is simply putting your energy into the world in some sense. Figure out what your best output is and follow it. If you haven't figured it out yet, like me, I guess just keep trying? Sorry it's not very helpful but it's all I've ever received as advice.
1	Why did you leave that old job?
1	If you don't want to waste your tech background and coding skills, you might look at related lateral moves that are more client facing and hopefully will give you a little more variety day to day. For example, tech sales, technical writing, forward deployed engineering, tech consulting, etc.
-1	Get a hobby lololol
5	Do you guys get depressed when you lose a hot girl/guy to your best friend in a nightclub?	Like when you guys are competing for his/her attention, and then when your Best Friend gets to hook up with him/her instead, you get grumpy and feel shitty all the way, stressed depressed lol.\nDo you guys relate to this?
6	Is this esfp stereotype satire?
3	This has never happened to me, but that's a pretty shitty thing to have done to you so it makes sense that you'd be depressed. I think that'd make anyone depressed, tbh. :(
4	Eh you dont want a girl who isnt interested in you anyways. Let them be happy, and keep making friends. 
3	You're supposed to hit on different people than your friends are you doofus
2	Yes, especially if I’m used to getting the person I want, just keep your options open and communicate better though!
1	dick move of ur friend lmao. 
6	Have any of you ESFPs confused yourselves as introverted? If so, how did you finally reach the conclusion that you were ESFP?	
12	I had a crappy childhood, so obviously I was home alone and didn't socialize. I was alone most of the time and thought I liked it. Then I did the test and was like "Oh, I actually like socialization and being the centre of attention... I'm just terrified of people because they're horrible."
2	Only when we feel either burned out or in a really bad environment
2	I'm an ESFP but have considered myself ambivert, smoking weed made me more introspective and comfortable being alone, but when I am in social situations my ESFP comes out, also anxiety is big for ESFP's (speaking for myself), when you love the attention but are also anxious a part of staying in is to avoid uncomfortable scenarios that I've imagined 
6	Is this an ESFP thing? Can you relate?	Sometimes I do something embarrassing, feel so damn crushed and made a fool out of that I don’t even want to stand up, but if someone talks to me or I’m notified of a social gathering or a chance to talk to people, I instantly feel better/ have more motivation all of a sudden. This has been happening a lot lately. Can you relate or is it just me?
4	Seems enneagram 6 than ESFP. But I relate to this haha
2	Yeahhhh.. I guess I have some social anxiety cause anytime I do something embarrassing, in my head I'm like, "well I guess I have to give up socializing forever now"... And then I can jump right back into it when someone gives me attention or asks me something. Yeah, now that I think about it, I can definitely relate.
2	yesss !!! so relate. idont understand it either but its like a weird bandaid or boost of energy
1	UUUHHH yeah. This is my life. Want to plan something and get rejected? Absolutely not. Get invited to plans and feel instantly validated? ✔️
3	how do u deal with break ups ?	just curious. going thru 1 myself (2/3 months ago) and was wondering if its similar for yall ? \n\nfor me, the first month was absolute shit. i cried all the time, drank for a week straight and emotionally rebounded with a good friend. the next month, i felt a little calmer + honestly numb but i would randomly start crying with random triggers ? eg. i could easily joke about the break up and stuff but then at some point when someone asked me what happened (plenty of people have asked before but this 1 time) i just started crying for like 3 hours.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nits been 3 months now and im recovering but i was wondering if its normal to feel like thsi ? i feel really numb most of the time and when i c him i dont feel much except for awkwardness but when he crosses my mind , thats when i feel sad ? ?idk\n\nanyways. share ur breakup stories i guess yea !
3	I recently broke up with my gf of 8 months. Best time of my life. It didn’t impact me as hard as yours for some reason even though I really loved her. I always guessed it was because of paranoia and trust issues that it didn’t affect me too much originally. I was depressed for a week then was fine. We had decided to be friends but I couldn’t stand seeing her anymore (ldr) and we cut ties a few days ago. It’s been a stressful week and I’m not sure how I feel in all honesty 
3	Hey!! if whoever you are, you'll be just fine. I promise. I have been cheated on twice. one after a 1.5 year relationship and the other a 5 year. it's tough. like that shit is beat. Buuuut after half a year, I found I love myself and that person doesnt deserve me. It takes one step at a time but if you tell yourself once a day, one day at a time, that you love yourself, you WILL make it through. Stay health, take care of yourself  and love yourself.
2	Oh no... break ups are the worst. I'm so sorry :(\n\nEvery one of mine has been different and it always depends on how strongly I feel about my ex. The worst I've had so far was my first boyfriend and I was 14. I guess I have horrible taste in men cause my other boyfriends through my teens were all douchebags... breaking up with them was never sad. I'm with an amazing guy now (3yrs) and I imagine breaking up with him would absolutely crush me.\n\nis this your first relationship? If not how did you react to your other breakups?
4	How do you study?	Hello fellow esfpsl, idk about y'all but I have a hard time focusing and studying. A college student trying to get the grades in I just force myself to study many many days ahead just so I get enough done in time. Can I get some advice on how to get work done?
6	I remove all distractions, focus on material for 30-40 min, then 15 min rest. I must live through the thing to get it, so I just do it until I get it.\nDon’t try too hard - it makes you rigid. Make studying fun by doing stupid things - playing with words, reading out loud in a dramatic voice or any other stupidity of your choice. Studying in a group helps me too.

2	i had my last crush shortly after my ex and i broke up. this guy was my ex's best friend, but also my best friend too. break up was about 3 months ago.\n\nmy crush supported me throughout the break up and was really sweet and lovely, and i fell for him real quick. turned out we both like each other, but we both agreed to not do anything bc it'd be disrespectful to my ex and also bc we're better off as just friends.\n\nwe flirt at school and ppl can c the chemistry even tho we try keep it subtle. we giggle a lot and get physical/tickle each other/shove each other around. he makes fun of me and i tease him, and we know a lot about each others lives and interests. i think i know him the best tbh. we text almost everyday and talk all the time at school too.\n\nhe got a girlfriend, and i got involved with a guy (we're now fuckbuddies and i still dunno how i feel about him). \n\nstill my feelings towards my crush are pervasive. i c him everyday and really like him, he's so sweet. he talks abt his gf sometimes, but when we're together we usually just talk about whatever. he told me he still liked me a little, and that made me get major butterflies.\n\ni accidentally made a move on him at a party. i got really drunk (and yes its my responsibility, im accountable) and sat on his lap and kissed his cheek a few times, and told him i still liked him. he was fine with it, it was a little awkward afterwards honestly but things seem back to normal now.\n\nanyways. he still asks me if im ok every few days, and tickles me, and we giggle in class together. and i still look forward to seeing him everyday. i love him so much even just as a friend, and feelings will die down, but im just so happy to have him in my life ! im glad his gf makes him happy and i would never get in the way of that again. \n\nhope i fall in love again soon\n\n\[esfp\]
