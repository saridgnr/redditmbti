7	25 Feb 2019: Rules Update & Community Topics	Hi everyone,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe wanted to thank everyone for participating in a trial of rule changes in how r/infj is moderated. We understand it was a learning curve for mods and users alike to move certain topics to daily threads, and we truly appreciate your patience. These changes have allowed us to focus more on the INFJ personality type and MBTI typology, but still allow a portion of the sub to talk about other topics and seek advice from other INFJs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**However, after experiencing it, and based on your feedback, we feel that** ***daily*** **changing topics may be a bit too hectic**. To make posting these rules easier to follow, and to make sure topics get the highlight they deserve, **we will be simplifying it to two stickied threads per week.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **Advice and Counseling**. *Stickied Monday-Thursday*. This stickied post will be for all advice on relationships and personal problems (romantic and platonic), career advice, or anything else. We think collapsing several of the daily topics we tried into one post for a longer amount of time will allow them to get more attention. We think this will hold true compared to when most were posted individually as well.\n2. **Curiosity and Self-Expression**. *Stickied Friday-Sunday*. This stickied post will be for any general topic not completely INFJ-related including DAE, General community questions, self-expression, sharing artwork, and memes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe think this system will be a nice middle ground. Main topics will still be more INFJ and MBTI focused, but the more general threads will be up longer and garnish more attention by being stickied. Having these posts up longer will also allow there to be a more involved discussion, make them easier to find, and make people feel like they don‚Äôt have to wait a week to post.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Updated: 25 Feb 2019- 11:23 am EST**\n\nFor those curious, u/Bubblesandsass put this together:  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. There was no real increase in people who unsubscribed from r/INFJ. There was actually a large increase in subscribers when the new rules were initiated but levels were relatively consistent. We've observed a statistically flat rate of subs and unsubs, implying no effect from the rules change.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. If we compare the four week period immediately before the rules change to the 4 weeks during the trial, there was a significant change in comments per submission (cps). The average for our February trial was 26.0 cps, compared to the 4 weeks prior where it was 19.7. This is around 4X the standard deviation from previous month-to-month comparisons and represents a statistically significant change.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTherefore we believe that moving these posts resulted in higher commenting per submission, and did not result in any loss of traffic. We are going to keep the new paradigm, but we want it to be as easy and accessible as possible, so we'll continue to update with small tweaks here and there to improve.
5	Thank you for putting this together! I feel like this will be a better change, since I also felt like daily threads disappeared too quickly to get much attention. Please keep up the good work! :)

2	What‚Äôs DAE?
2	Thanks! 
2	Great job from you mods. This seems like a good leap! 
1	I‚Äôm a little confused. Do I need to wait until Monday to ask for relationship advice? I don‚Äôt see a previous thread to comment on and I don‚Äôt want to get in trouble for making a new post. See, typical INFJ worried what people think! 
2	Curiosity and Self Expression - March 08, 2019	This is the place to post your community questions and express yourself via various mediums. This thread is dedicated to topics and questions that are based on personal experience and not MBTI theory. Topics appropriate for this thread include, but are not limited to:\n\n* Does anyone else? Is this an INFJ thing?\n* Poetry, artwork, rants\n* Memes\n* Generic community questions (favorite hobbies, books, music, games, etc.)\n\nYou may also want to stop by [our wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/wiki/index) and [our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/wiki/faqs) pages for more information. We have a number of topics there, including:\n\n* [our FAQ section on favorite things](https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/wiki/faqs#wiki_favorite_things)\n* [our FAQ section on the "INFJ doorslam"](https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/wiki/faqs#wiki_door_slam)\n* [our FAQ section on sexuality](https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/wiki/faqs#wiki_infjs_and_sexuality), including preferences, feelings, and approaches\n* [our FAQ section on type disambiguation](https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/wiki/faqs#wiki_what_is_an_infj.3F), including INTJ, ISFJ, and INFP).\n\n*It's important to separate unsupported stereotypes from MBTI traits that are grounded in theory. While it can be fun to see if other people share your traits or quirks, it is important to distinguish whether these are normal human behaviors or whether they would truly tie to being an INFJ. Keep in mind that internet users are their own subsection of humanity - more likely to be depressed, more likely to be anxious, more likely to have social deficiencies, etc. Agreement on this sub doesn't make something an "INFJ thing". A majority of users might like pizza, but that doesn't mean that INFJs like pizza because they're INFJs.*\n
2	Does u/lzimmy like pizza because she's an INFJ? üçï
2	My name is Ayene Light, the story "begins" at my childhood.\n\nIt ends when I'll wake up from the state of Mania. (Enfp shadow)\n\n\nI will start anew from a dream state, mindful and accepting.\n\nThank you for reading.
1	I'm a guy, and I seem to be really swayed by and attracted to confident girls for some reason. Like, I find them really amazing, even though I scream inside myself that they might not really be "nice" or..you know..genuine.\n\nIs it an INFJ thing, or just me overanalyzing? Thanks!
562	Is this why INFJs are so rare?	
109	I feel happy and personally attacked at the same time. ‡≤†_‡≤†
52	Ok this ones funny
46	I THINK I FEEL good about this one.
21	Feckin hilarious üòÇüòÇ
7	I feel attacked
9	Just at me next time 
11	HahahahahahahaHEY.
8	Hahaha this is great. Yeah, it can be pretty difficult to deal with. I feel like there‚Äôs a slightly cold, logical side but also a very artsy loving side to myself.....\n\nI think this confuses people.
18	This made me laugh and proud to be an INFJ. I think and feel too much and majority of the people I‚Äôve met can‚Äôt handle that. Oh well, I may be alone but at least I‚Äôm special.
4	lmaoo
9	HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA this is SOOOO ACCURATE!!!!!!!!!! we are annoying and unsatisfactory to BOTH CAMPS! lol
2	Too relatable 
1	Yessss
1	I think, I'm feeling good man
1	So true, sometimes I feel like an alien from another planet and Galaxy
1	... Pow, right in the kisser.
1	That would explain a lot, honestly. 
1	I feel so seen...I am bathed in the terrible light of truth
1	INFJ's are delusional when they think they can be both a feeler and a thinker at the time.
7	I don't like being so easy to talk to	Like most of you I'm sure, I'm a pretty shy person when interacting with anyone but those I really trust. I think I must do a great job at hiding it though, because strangers constantly want to talk to me about themselves and their problems. I'm not trying to be an asshole, but I really just do not care. I wish I did, but I don't. \n\nToday I went into a novelty store to purchase something I collect and the clerk, who I'd never met before, launches into her life story including her recent traumatic surgeries and various ailments. I wish I found this sort of thing interesting. Like wow, a fellow human sharing their deeply personal story of tragedy and perseverance with me. How lucky am I? But I'm not that good of a person, and instead I end up thinking "how the fuck do I get out of this without looking like a dick?" \n\n"What do I even say in response here?" \n"Is she buying my feigned interest?" \n"Can she tell I'm beginning to sweat?" \n"What would happen if I just ran out of the store mid sentence?" \n\nAnd most importantly, "what would a *normal* person say or do in this situation?" \n\nThese situations always leave me feeling really terrible about myself because I don't enjoy them, and I'm not sure how I even could. I was actually thinking while she was reeling off a list of her medical ailments, "what could I say in this spot that would make this an enjoyable experience for me?" And I came up with nothing. I know I tend to put others first far too often, but in actuality I think that's because I really don't want much from others. What I want most is NOT being stuck in these types of situations. \n\nTell me it's not just me. 
1	I mean, if a store clerk launches into their traumatic life story with someone who's just trying to buy something, I think that'd make anyone feel awkward. But saying something as simple as "I'm sorry to hear that. I hope it gets better." and then being on your way can be a respectful thing to say without being rudely dismissive. 
17	I feel like I need a big mission or purpose	I just have this great desire to do something great that helps change the world in a big way, but then I shy away from challenge and being the center of attention. Im 18 and a senior and cant pick a path because Im so worried of taking the wrong one. Anyone else?
8	I'm going to be real with you, I still feel it at 25. Hope it gets better for you soon. No real advise just solidarity.
2	Don't worry about a big mission or purpose. Trust me, things will change.. by the time you get older, you end up taking another different path. So just focus on the small projects and goals. Take your time and don't rush, so many college students make the mistake by picking a path so quickly just because they're afraid. Maybe spend time searching for your interests and discover what talents you have and how you can use your talents to serve others in a positive way. The biggest things are sometimes the smallest things.. such as making 1 person smile or happy today. You can't change the world, the world is uncontrollable. You can lend a helping hand however. 
4	This is just teenage angst. It goes away. What you really need to do is just be in the moment for a bit and pick the path that brings you the most joy. If you didn't have to work to pay your bills what would you do each day?  After a few months on a beach you'll get bored. Trust me I've spent my time there. Would you write every day? Play music? Workout and get jacked af? What's around you is just a backdrop. What you're doing is more important. Who's around is the most important.
1	don't feel the need to pick your lifelong path right away. i'm 19 and in college, and i was in a similar position as you about a year ago. i'm not sure if you're in the US, but here there's a popular narrative of having to pick one "road" to go down for the rest of your life straight out of highschool, i.e. when you've barely lived any life. Just try things. If your intuition tells you to try a particular field, academic or otherwise, just go for it. even if you spend multiple years trying something only to find that you don't actually like it, you'll only be in your early 20s and will have your whole life to try other things.  \n\nLife is short, but life is really fucking long. it's not worth doing something you hate just for the paycheck, take your time and listen to your intuition 
1	If I could give 18 year old me any advice, top of that list would be ‚Äúdo not shy away from challenges‚Äù. Challenge brings growth, self improvement, and often results in potentially exciting/interesting opportunities. You‚Äôre at the best time of your life to really push yourself. Don‚Äôt worry about picking the wrong path, you can change later if you really need to. Picking something is better than picking nothing.
1	My husband, who is 43, feels this still.  He chose one path and it was right for several seasons, and now he's in search of another.  I think the important thing is to hold steady and true to what you want for yourself.
1	How can an INFJ play hard to get?	How would you gals/guys do this? Its just a skill i really want to learn and to keep myself more private.  to get into relationships and friendships slower instead of dumping all of my thoughts out when someone asks.  :)\n\nthank you
1	What (and how) can I (INFP) say to my girlfriend (INFJ) to make her feel better about herself?	What, and more specifically how, can I tell my INFJ girlfriend to make her feel better about herself and stop doubting herself when she mentions something self-negative? Because she really is wonderful in all ways and I want her to know that.\n\nSo far I haven't been able to say the right thing for her to feel better. Whatever I have said have almost seem like she took it as harsh criticism. But then it's all okay again after a few seconds.\n\nWe're incredibly in love with each other and I'm prepared to fight for our relationship for the rest of my life. I have never felt like this for anyone else before. And it's important to me that she's positive about herself.\n\nWe are both in our late 20s so we're quite mature and can have a serious discussion if needed.
1	Whenever I was in a low funk like that, I honestly needed to be distracted. \n\nThe best way to do so was by going on little adventures (as I would call it). Taking hikes or trying something new and different to take my mind off things and get excited. Not something where I would have to interact with anyone (like restaurants).\n\nGoing for hikes or walks in nature was a HUGE help for me. It gave me time for self reflection and the fresh air and scenery would always be a good lift of spirits. \n\nJust continue what your doing and be supportive, don't try to pry or push. <3
1	If she's feeling hard on herself, she might be stuck in a Ni-Ti loop. Get her out of her head and onto something objective. You can either engage Fe (get her around people to bounce off of) or her Se (get her to do something to get her mind off of things). It's awesome that you're encouraging her, but if she's anything like me, words of encouragement ends up feeling like platitudes without objective measures. Sometimes I need to know how my actions affect others in a positive way. For example, if I mentored a child, seeing him succeed in the class or topic is much more meaningful than just him telling me he liked the class. I used to teach, and while my coworkers told me I was doing a great job, I still feel like crap because the students that I was teaching weren't getting it. Alternatively my music teacher says that I'm learning to sing well, but I need to hit those notes or get encouragement from the audience, since they are my targets. \n\nEdit: Another helpful thing is to ask her what makes her come to that negative thought. Engage her feelings and logic and just let her talk. Sometimes frustrations are just building up and rather than take it out on the source, we swallow it and burden ourselves.\n\nI hope this helps! All the best!
1	Tell her what you admire about her, constantly remind her of her good qualities, and give specific examples of times you saw her good qualities in action.
13	Being perceived as analytical instead of amiable?	Has anyone been perceived as more analytical instead of amiable in reference to social styles? \n\nI do see the similarities between Ni and Analytical behaviour but I thought my Fe would have projected a stronger people-oriented external image. \n\nI have always considered people's feelings and expectations before making any decision yet my peers at work don't seem to be aware of it, they are strongly convinced that I'm not a people pleaser\n\nI wonder if it's because my charade (as a budget lead at work) is too successful. Or could it be that I'm developing my Ti in a wrong way?
4	This happens to me too. I think the Ni stare plays a lot into it as well. Even if I act selflessly it doesn‚Äôt stop people from thinking I‚Äôm ‚Äúup to something‚Äù. I‚Äôm not sure if this is something that can be fixed.
1	not an Infj, though i have an infj father and my mom thinks he's very selfish (towards his family)
1	Fe is not people oriented.
53	Is John Mulaney an INFJ?	What does your intuition say?\n\nI‚Äôm torn between INFP and INFJ. He definitely has the reserved, weighed wit that is different from the lighthearted and energetic extroverted cheer. \n\nSomething tells me he‚Äôs an INFJ but I can‚Äôt pinpoint why. Google says the Internet‚Äôs consensus is INFP.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/-mSGwndFMp8\n\nAssuming he‚Äôs an INFJ, what a fitting job he has! He gets to polish and use his wit. He makes people happy with laughter. He brings laughter from the people‚Äôs hearts, lets it cleanse their minds, and receives its positive energy himself. What a way to feed his Fe.
34	I don't think he's an INFJ, he has a very Si brand of humor.\n\nHe's witty for sure, you have to be to be a famous comedian, but when I watch him I feel like his presentation is more silly than witty.\n\nI could be over generalizing, but INFJ public figures that I've known aren't very comfortable with being portrayed as silly or not serious. 
10	I‚Äôm the kind of INFJ who loves to publicly speak and perform. Generally people almost always guess I am extroverted. From the very first time I heard Mulaney I suspected he was INFJ. Imo his material isn‚Äôt as much of an indicator of his type compared the delivery/structure of the material. 
17	i love John mulaney. he's big on dark/sarcastic humor. I can see INFJ for him so easily.
3	Hi there! Big Mulaney fan here. I think, yes, he is an INFJ.\n\nNi - His humour is based on not just observation but suspicion. He loves to err on the holistic/spiritual side of the world, like ghosts and causes. He talks about how his gut feelings influence his decisions. I saw an interview of him in which he considered leaving/left a booked room where he was staying with his with because he had a bad feeling about it. He talks about "vibes" a lot, or how he "just knew X was going to happen". \n\nFe - He is fascinated by social norms and wants to know how other people feel. He is conscientious to a fault. He's polite to everyone (Best Buy), he has an affinity for animals (he loves to personify and care for his dog), and he is outwardly warm, caring and vulnerable. He's also clearly something of an old-fashioned romantic with his wife. \n\nTi - He crafts his jokes as a bit of a logician, following one thread to the next and unfolding them piece by piece. His stories often have to do with how he strove to be an academic but was not always the most successful at it. He makes fun of technology often (prove! PROVE!). He is also a bit of conspiracy theorist - in interviews he'll talk about his feelings of paranoia or \n\nSe - The Se shadow seems prevalent in him. He was never athletic, has a poor relationship with knowing his own body at times (doesn't know where all the sweat came from, doesn't like his own hair, etc), and always goes overkill on having fun. Drink a whole bottle of perfume kind of guy. He used to have a drugs/drinking problem, even at a young age. He's occasionally wicked, occasionally is encouraged by friends to act on it (Salt and Pepper Diner, y'all). He is generally perceived as wholesome but "ruins parties". \n\nI think INFJs also have a certain delivery onstage. They're incredibly professional but also very engaged and smiley. Compare that to an Fi user like Bo Burnham. He's likeable as hell but will call audience members out, scowl, or be outlandishly offensive. Fi users tend to get sucked into their own performances. Fe users tend to try to please their audiences. 
3	Is Emma Watson an INFJ? I think she is.
4	Someone like Keanu Reeves is an INFJ, very soft spoken, mysterious, creative, deep thinker, and enjoys being alone and out of the spotlight. I find it hard for an INFJ to be a comedian.. a comedian takes a lot of social energy in which what extroverts have and project, though I don't think it's impossible.
2	 I have JUST discovered John Mulaney. I‚Äôve binged every single thing he has on Netflix over the past 72 hours. \n\nI would be willing to bet that he is an INFJ, maybe INFP. I‚Äôve definitely thought about it, his personality is extremely unique and witty.
1	Just a question, is this pure interest or do you guys have any advantage in knowing what type "random" people have? It's interesting to know if you get to know a person yourself but analyzing someone from afar without their own judgement/results is still pure guessing.\n\nbtw I'm not too deep into the MBTI personality indicator, is it actually possible to determine someones type without, say, a session with a psychologist?
1	Is Johnny Depp an INFJ? 
1	I believe John is an INTJ. His Ni connects many things quickly, inferior Se (wasn‚Äôt athletic), and he keeps a very logical outward appearance (Te) and talks about keeping his feelings to himself (Fi). That‚Äôs what my intuition tells me from what I‚Äôve seen!

24	The Theory of Everything- Jane Hawking Wilde INFJ?	So I just finished watching the autobiography turned movie of Steven Hawking's wife Jane Wilde and in the first 20 or so minutes I was shocked how much the onset of her and Steven's relationship resembles so many of my previous ones (I am a notorious INTP serial dater). She pursued PhD to find her own place in academia to not live in the shadow of her husband. She did this while juggling kids and caring for Steven during the early stages of his ALS. She even married him when he was given a two year prognosis and tried to make the most out of those two years.. honestly, everything about her kindness, selflessness, intelligence, and strength resonated with me.. has anyone else seen this movie? I am thinking she is an INFJ, but even if she's not-what amazing strong female role model to look up to. 
3	What demonstrates her Ni?
25	Do i have a chance or am i wasting my time?	Hi there, I'm an ENFP and i got chatting to an INFJ on Tinder. We took it to WhatsApp on the first day and also had a pretty interesting phone conversation where I wrote her some songs on the guitar (I'm a pretty good improviser and talked about the things we had in common). She said she she really liked my accent.\n\nI'm new to the MBTI thing but she said she knew and got on well with ENFPs and was even in love with one in the past. So far, so good. She said she liked my saxophone and singing (saying it was "sexy as f*ck) when I sent her a video of my doing it, so obviously, I'm thinking the is all good.\n\nShe was going to be in my hometown the day after we chatted for work but I was ill the whole of February so I couldn't meet her, sadly but we arranged to hit up some museums and stuff when I am better. We chatted a bit longer and she said she liked certain styles of music, which I said I hardly listened to.\nThen complete radio silence. \n\nI asked her if she didn't want to meet me and she she did but withdrawing is just something she does. I'd send her messages without hearing anything (which made me feel like I was bombarding her with messages) and when she deleted me from tinder I figured that was it. \n\nI wrote her a song in one of her favourite styles and asked if she would want to meet and she said yes (with three "X's, which she didn't do before) and she was available on the weekends but she was currently ill with the flu.\n\nThen a couple of days later, she super likes me on Tinder and we begin talking on there again. I'm unsure as to whether she remembers me. She said she was unsure about dating because she is getting divorced after 7 yrs and to reassure her, I said meeting as friends is possibly best. She shut this down as "dishonest". Then I bombarded her with messages again to try and explain myself and then more radio silence.\n\nSo I'm wondering if you think I have a chance with her. Like I say I'm new to MBTI so not sure if this is a thing that could work out.\nShe says she has been separated for a while but will be divorced soon. Would this hamper things and if I push it am I likely to get door slammed or could her lack of response be a door slam?\n\nSorry for the wall of text, I just like to give as clear an account as possible.
59	I think the better question for you to ask yourself is ‚Äúshould she have a chance with me?‚Äù \n\nKinda sketch that she seems not to remember you. Plus, if she‚Äôs really going through a divorce after 7yrs of marriage, she‚Äôs probably not emotionally equipped to start anything with anybody. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if she was seeking attention/validation from dating sites with no real intention of actually dating. 
21	It sounds like has some baggage and needs time to resolve it before getting in the dating game maybe? Just be careful. Don't put yourself in a bad position. 
5	Yeah she's getting a divorce and since she's an INFJ she'll suffer a lot from it because she'll have been really invested in her marriage I'm sure. I think you need to look for somebody else who isn't in it for a rebound
5	She's going through her own stuff,  and it really sounds like she needs some space to figure that out in order to be present or fair to a new relationship. 
4	I wouldn‚Äôt pursue someone who is hot and cold. There are plenty of people out there who are confident and ready for a relationship you could pursue instead. It‚Äôs healthier to find someone who is in the state of mind to commit. Regarding the INFJ aspect, as an INFJ, if I feel an emotional connection, I‚Äôm passionate about the person and extremely dedicated. I wouldn‚Äôt falter like this. I wouldn‚Äôt take it personally though, it sounds like no matter who you are, it‚Äôs her life that is too chaotic for anyone to join it at this time. She isn‚Äôt ready to date yet and I wouldn‚Äôt wait because that‚Äôs not in your best interest in my opinion. Of course, it‚Äôs your life and you know what‚Äôs best for you. If you must continue trying to win her over, at least stay open to dating others in the meantime so your state of mind isn‚Äôt 100% focused on her and you‚Äôll have other options in case it doesn‚Äôt work out with her.
5	She deleted you from Tinder; what more do you need? 
2	For one, whether or not you two are compatible is going to likely be completely independent of personality types so don't worry. For another, she doesn't seem that into you. Plus divorce is messy. 
2	Playin music to her straight away may be a bit overwhelming for an INFJ...women like attention but don‚Äôt give out all your tricks and play all your cards.\n\nStay mysterious. I advise you to listen to the words of ‚ÄúCorey Wayne‚Äù on YouTube.
2	I think you are wasting your time, plus she is using dating apps while she is still married to someone else? doesn't sound good.
2	Tread lightly, especially if she's getting a divorce soon. Each dating app attracts certain types of people. On Tinder, many use it to hookup or some women use it to "get over their previous relationship" AKA find a rebound relationship. They are still going through problems with their previous partner and have unfinished business.. so if you hope for too much too soon, you might end up hurt or disappointed.\n\nINFJs don't like when people are too pushy, though sometimes you can convince them if you keep trying. Just take your time and don't creep them out with too much.
2	Sounds like a fucking shitshow to me.
2	Often, a women getting out of a relationship will not want to jump right back in to the contraints of monogamy. It sounds like she wants something casua given her 3X signal, but casual hookups do have the possibility to turn into something real... Happens all the time. So take her out, have a good time, but keep the emotional/puppy love shit to a minimum. And remember that she is an INFJ. Which means she has a built in lie detector... so be honest with her cause she'll know if you aren't. Good luck friend
1	I don‚Äôt think this has anything to do with MBTI; r/datingadvice would be a better sub to post this in.
183	INFJs Need Hope, or else We Become Depressed	This is a theory based on my life experience, particularly about being lonely.\n\nI realized that most of my life was spent visualizing all the ways things may go wrong whenever I want to do something. For example, I remember my Dad would invite me to attend events with him, but I always had the pessimistic view that no one would want to talk to me. Hence, when I do go to said events, I end up not initiating conversations with anyone, already certain that I would be left alone. Which creates a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRecently, I thought about and wondered, what if I try to "hope" for a better outcome? In order words, what if I choose to "hope" that when I attend social events, I will meet someone that I can talk to and get along with? Will this trigger me to be more open, meet and talk to more people and so create another self-fulfilling prophecy?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWill probably need to try it out to be sure. But what do you guys think? Are INFJs driven by grand visions/dreams, and are we sad and hopeless without them? Like literally can't get out of the house hopeless?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 1: What I mean by a grand vision and how it relates to hope is as such: Going back to previous example, let's say I hoped that I would meet someone that I enjoy talking with at a social event. That didn't happen. However, because I have a "grand vision" of improving myself is all aspects, I can look at this setback as a stepping stone to improve my social skills which would ultimately serve to improve my odds of meeting such a person, eventually.\n\nSo what if there is no grand vision? What happens when the "bigger picture" is not considered? Well, I guess that any small setback would be enough to crush my hopes, and I don't think I can go very far in life without the motivation that hope provides me to get things done.
70	I think everyone needs hope. 
28	INFJ‚Äôs need hope and purpose - without it we‚Äôre lost 
20	Yes, I also think this is connected to the fundamental properties of Creation (the Matrix). Call it confirmation bias, or thoughts are things, or Schroeder‚Äôs paradox, or the simulation we call reality, or simultaneously co-existing realities or a plastic universe, it seems to me that my experience is a direct mirror of my beliefs and attitudes (and also, a terrible reminder of my immature inability to maintain mental discipline over my thoughts and the emotions my thoughts stimulate). I‚Äôm working on it. Practice that is strong gives me consistently positive results. But I still sometimes get swept up in old mental habits or the effects of bad nutrition choices or getting caught up in my reactions to conditions around me. I‚Äôm trying to practice tuning into the aspect of me that is un-condition-ally satisfied (higher self).
18	Maybe I‚Äôve got the wrong idea, but perhaps we could replace ‚Äòhope‚Äô with purpose? I think a strong characteristic of INFJ‚Äôs is that we need purpose in life, or else we get lost and perhaps even depressed.\n\nOf course everyone needs purpose in life but INFJ‚Äôs in particular. We can‚Äôt just do something for the sake of doing it. For example, if the agenda every day is to go out to do something that serves no purpose (like, doing some IT job with no chance of advancement or socialising/working with people who you don‚Äôt click with), then we will either do it half-heartedly or not at all. \n\nSo going back to your example of the social gathering; I guess, if you felt that you weren‚Äôt going to bond with the people there or if you were just gonna make a heap of ‚Äòpointless‚Äô acquaintances (that‚Äôs how I see it anyways haha...), then you‚Äôre not going to make an effort. \n\nAn INFJ that loses their way/purpose/hope in life is a dangerous thing...I think that‚Äôs why we are strong self-reflectors. Constantly ensuring we‚Äôre on the right path and keeping in touch with our values.\n\nTalking from my experience anyway.
13	Everyone needs hope, it‚Äôs not a type thing 
6	You choose your perception and you choose your emotions.  What you feed, grows. \n\nOne of my mottoes. :)
3	This is me.
3	I think this applies to everyone. We are what we think. The world is a reflection. You go to this event with your dad, you can set your intentions (meet new people) without attachment, this is important. But infjs want to grow and better themselves in particular. So ya got to have the vision accompanied with the hope/faith. 
3	I'd say faith. Not even religious faith but just the faith that it's fine if things go wrong as it won't even go that wrong. 
1	For me it goes like this, I hope that no one bothers me, or talks to me and someone comes along and I enjoy talking to them. When I hope I can find someone I enjoy talking to it never happens. üòÇüòî
1	Hope is something we should all have as humans, honestly. It can be a very powerful thing. As far as having grand visions and huge dreams, I think we all have those. 
1	I always need to have a goal. I need short-term one and a long-term one. Say right now I have a general goal in life of living to 103. I know that‚Äôs a silly one and all that, but I want to do it nonetheless! So I try my best to remain healthy. It‚Äôs also one of my biggest goals that has kept me from spiraling into suicidal thoughts and such. Then short-term I have things like, which school I‚Äôm trying to get into currently, so that causes me to better my grades. Then there‚Äôs the next school in some years that I need really good grades to get into, meaning I have to be at the top of my game! For me, my life is build up of things I want to achieve. Events and such that I want to happen, so I work to achieve them. \n\nEverything needs meaning though. I cannot for the life of me, learn a math equation if I do not understand the math behind it! It‚Äôs the same with a language that I‚Äôm learning, I‚Äôm usually great at language, but this one. My motivation is in shambles. I cannot predict an outcome in my life where knowing this language will somehow give me a greater advantage. Especially because the goal of the language course is not fluency. I don‚Äôt get that. How can you set aside 3 years to a language and not want to work towards fluency afterwards? When stuff don‚Äôt make sense, and have no meaning then I just... I can‚Äôt do it.
1	Didn‚Äôt even read the whole thing - can absolutely confirm when I lose hope I become severely depressed.
50	Any INFJ's read 'The Little Prince'? // why you should	When I look for books, I always have particular things in mind; I want something that is deeply thoughtful, symbolic, allows me to think deeply about the meaning of life (in any sense) or the struggles that humans face. I also like stories with a mystical or magical nature. Essentially, the perfect book has me looking at life from a new perspective and self-reflecting for days, and I absolutely *love* this. Any INFJ's relate?\n\nThere are several books I have read like this, but the Little Prince is a strong favourite. For a children's story, it absolutely had me in self-reflection mode and truly enchanted. I think it's a book all INFJ's should read and believe it is particularly symbolic for us. Its themes of sensitivity, purpose, loneliness and love are ones that particularly resonate with INFJ. For example (for those who have read it), the deep, un-relentless love the Little Prince has for the manipulative rose. The value of imagination and also how the story finds underlying meaning to everything is great.\n\nAnyways, I really love this little book and think some of you INFJ's would too. :)   There‚Äôs also a movie...   \n\nAnyone also love it?   Or also look for the same qualities in a book? 
7	It is crazy how spot on your description of the books you love matches mine. These are exactly the books I‚Äôm drawn to. \n\nI did really enjoy The Little Prince. I also really love The Elegance of the Hedgehog and Never Let Me Go.\n
7	I've never read the Little Prince, but will get it on Kindle so I can read it. Yes, I do love these exact kind of books too, you described it perfectly. And thank you for the recommendation. :-) \n\nMy favorite book of all time is Watership Down for a lot of the same reasons.
5	I remember loving it as a kid. Forgotten now, will read again. Thanks.\n\n
4	- 9 years old\n- I like to spend time in the library (more than the school wants to)\n- Everybody says the books is great\n- Go to the library\n- Ask for the book\n- Took some days without recess to read\n- Ended the book\n\nNothing happened. \n\nI grew resentment towards the book (Specially because people saying how great it was, and nobody ever said that about the books I liked. In fact "boring" was the only word I heard. I liked to spend time reading the dictionary, juvenile science introductions, tech magazines and adventure stories like "Treasure Island"\n\n20 years later I take the book and understand what's about. Human life stuff and it's ok. I just wasn't the person for the book then. Kind of sad because I had expectations for a book dedicated to children.\n
5	It's my favourite book actually! There was a period of time where I would read a snippet of it every day before bed, to finish the day on a perfect note. 
4	Oh, I love the little prince. It is my favorite book of all time. My first copy was given to me by my English tutor when I was 12. I‚Äôve read it countless times since then. I gave away my first copy, bought a second, gave it away ... I‚Äôve probably bought it up to 8 times to date. I give it away every time. I like to share it around. Everyone must know about The Little Prince.\n\nSecond favorite book is Watership Down.
4	I've read it once early in school and also I got back to it recently, already as a grown-up. With the second attempt, I cried.
3	What you love in stories is exactly what I love in stories. Also what I hope to achieve in the stories I write. \n\nI haven't read the little prince but did see the movie. I liked it quite a bit, but I remember not liking the second half as much as the first half.\n\nI recommend watching the movie "The Fountain". It ticks every box you mentioned there. :)
3	If you haven't read it yet, read Momo by Michael Ende. 
2	Something Wicked This Way Comes -Ray Bradbury
2	Every time I reread this book, I still cry to my favorite parts even if I know what‚Äôs going to happen next. I just love the relatable, raw emotions, underlying meanings, and new perspectives this book has to offer. \n\nYes, I deeply love those kinds of books. Maybe that‚Äôs why I loved English Literature in college since the readings always gave me a new perspective in life. 
2	never liked the book. and tbh I think it's more to INFP's liking
1	Have you tried Maps of Meaning audio book? That'll make you think deeply about life. 
80	Ni-Fe: Perfectionists sensitive to negative social feedback, 5 tips on how to deal with criticism	
23	This isn't an article about INFJs, but something I think a lot of young INFJs could use. Ni-Fe (introverted intuition plus Extraverted sensing) is a killer combo when it comes to feeling guilty or overly-sensitive to negative feedback. INFJs try to be "socially perfect", so hearing something negative to something you've created or done can be cutting. This is just a simple little article about dealing with that in the workplace.\n\n&#x200B;
5	I like the seek to understand bit. I think INFJs need to always remember to understand first, judge second. When we‚Äôre defensive we tend to jump to judgement. 
1	Trello of all things?! WTH is this world coming to ... first dog pics on LinkedIn, now this...
2	Article about a new book which discusses the history, criticism, and benefits to MBTI and the beginning of personality type tests in general.

6	I've found statistics that tie INFJs for the most common type. What are your thoughts on this, commoners?	
11	That's not the general population.
9	Well, I wonder how skewed the data is, because the "most common types" shown are often those most interested in personality typing systems and probably would search out this test.  \n\n\nHowever, I'm *extremely* curious to see what would happen to the self-reported level of INFJs if it was associated with being a very common, or even most common, type. I think we'd see a huge lack of interest in INFJs in general, far fewer blog and tumblr posts about being an INFJ, and a huge bump in mistypes of other types like INTPs, which are probably just as rare as INFJs are now and who would be the new "most rare" personality. 
6	I wanna live wherever this statistic was made
6	We're the most likely to be on the internet & most likely to take jungian/mbti tests.......
3	For a type who wants to find their place and know they‚Äôre understood that‚Äôd be great! I really personally hate how much people go on about it being the rarest, it doesn‚Äôt feel good to hear that and why does it really matter? I‚Äôm pretty happy for this little corner of Reddit just for the fact it feels less rare and more like a community, personally!
2	I don't believe that INFJs are only 1% of the population. I don't think surveys of how common any personality type is are going to be very accurate (even if it could be randomized) because of the difficulty of typing. Most personality tests are kind of garbage ...like, they focus on characteristics associated with the cognitive functions rather than the actual heart of the function. For example, I have ADHD, so while I prefer to be organized and structured, I am not GOOD at being organized and structured and am therefore often thrown in the "P" category. Also, while I absolutely make decisions based on feeling, I am often swept into the "thinking" category because I am in a technical field and feel that I have strong logic & reasoning skills. But from my own personal observations/intuition about others (:P) I think INFJ is fairly common.
1	From the about section of the link you posted: \n\n>All the statistical data is based on the socionics test results (approximately 100k), **thereby limiting (1) the ability to make any broad inferences from the data and (2) its application to the general population**.\n\nEmphasis mine. \n\nHere's how I interpret it: Socionics is even more of a niche product than MBTI. Most people that take an MBTI test won't take a Socionics test because they usually get their 16personalities result, put it into their Tinder bio and are done with it. \n\nSo what the statistics really say is that INFJ is one of the most common types of people that are into personality tests so much, they even take a Socionics one. \n\nI find that more plausible than saying that INFJ is one of the most common types, especially since this gets disputed by other statistics, some of which are more reliable. \n\n
1	Response bias. 
0	Y'all ain't psychic. Stop assuming things please.	I'm gonna be speaking generally here so please hold your #notall comments. Feel free to delete this if it's "too mean" or whatever but don't think a couple of internet down arrows are going to even slightly alter my choice of words.\n\n\nI'm an ENFP, for those curious, and while I don't hate you guys, I just can't fucking stand you most of the time.\n\nYou take the traits typically associated with the infj personality and you exaggerate the living shit out of them for the sake of identity and individualism. Especially when it comes to "struggles" and "advantages". Let's talk about advantages first.\n\n\nYou guys are supposedly good at reading people, right? Oho boy lemme tell you something. The vast majority of infj I've met in real life are people who could be, and most definitely were at some point but then lost it. Why?\n\nBecause instead of continuing to be observant, you start thinking of yourself as "good at reading people" upon learning what mbti is and keep trying to use your ability on purpose. What you SHOULD be doing is continuing to train your eyes like a muscle, because that's exactly how reading people works. It comes from WANTING to know, not making all these guesses and deciding you're right because "I'm good at reading people".\n\nIt's not some latent ability you get to keep for a lifetime once you work towards it. You stop looking at faces, and you stop trying to know what's going on with people around you, you stop being able. Simple as that. Sure you can have the habits down from childhood but that doesn't mean you're gifted and will automatically understand people without effort. A lot of you seem to think you can.\n\nPeople like this apparently always "know" that I'm lying or feeling "sad", but not only that, they take the whole "psychic" thing to a whole nother lever and start saying cringey shit like "I feel like you're the type of person that *insert a personality trait I most definitely don't have*.\n\n\nOn this subreddit for example, I made a post about how ghosting someone without warning or any good reason is wrong. One of y'all said "I'm sorry that happened to you" when I made no indication that the post was motivated by any personal reasons. I made the mistake of trying to explain that what led me to making the post was a friend of mine who got ghosted by someone out of the blue by someone he was close with.\n\nOf course this was met with not only downvotes, but people dismissing my explanation entirely and continuing to speak like I was the victim of being ghosted.\n\nIt's as if y'all had this unspoken rule there that I was obviously lying and that you would ignore the real truth because you "knew better". Let me tell you something motherfucker. I am still livid about how MY FRIEND was treated. \n\nYou are not this special race of people who are "capable" of feeling empathy for others. Everybody fucking does that. Almost every person on this planet has at least one person that they could feel anger on behalf of. The fact that you're split second assumption is that a non infj is lying, makes me wonder if any of you have a fucking clue what's going on around you in your day to day lives if you're so fucking "observant". Don't act so god damn familiar with me that you can just decide you're my shrink all of a sudden. I'm not having that self indulgent bullshit.\n\nAnother example was this fucking kid I knew in highschool. God damn was she a smug little ass. She was pretty good at reading people, but once she knew it, oh boy she may as well have had all her mirror neurons removed because she couldn't understand another person to save her life. It must've been miserable living that way, but she insisted on crafting these fake personalities of all the people around her and refusing to see the difference between her overactive imagination and her "ability" to know things about people.\n\nI have resting bitch face if I've been sitting in my own headspace long enough (yes extroverts can do that too) and every time that happened she'd act like I'm a dangerous sociopath who was gonna shoot up the school. Hell at one point she somehow decided it was her job to prevent that I guess?? I had no interest in shooting up the school, or even any enemies at the time. If she's anything like the infjs I've known in the past she probably still tells the story to this day where she "saved the school" from being shot up by "talking to the troubled kid". \n\nAnother one of your favorite "advantages" y'all like to pay yourself on the back for is being able to avoid sketchy situations with your intuition by knowing about them before they happen. Let me just tell you right now that this is a trait that a pretty decent majority of people have. There's really no "I disagree with that" here because this is just a fact.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let's talk about the struggles and disadvantages you guys face. I've seen them, I know they're real, but boy do you love to exaggerate.\n\n\nFirst off being "too empathetic" where everything that happens to everyone else is just sooooo painful for you guys. I can understand not being able to watch the news, or having to suppress the knowledge of all the fucked up shit that happens in all the fucked up corners of the world, not being able to let go of the memories of all the younger kids you knew who died long ago and would be the same age as you are now, etc. \n\nOf course that shit's gonna keep you up at night, but if you try to tell me that you're so empathetic that you accidentally bumped into someone earlier and you lost sleep crying over it, I'm gonna tell you to shut the fuck up because that's entire horse shit. Get the fuck out of here with that "but how do you know" nonsense because nobody like that would be on the internet in the first place, and if someone like that did exist in general they'd drop dead at the age of 15 from all that stress. That's happened to at least one person I'm sure, and here you are making a mockery outta them.\n\nFinding people to connect with; that's a good one. I'll actually tell you that this is a legitimate issue that y'all are genuine about, but here's the catch though: \n\nYou do this to yourself when it gets to a point where you're "testing" people to reeeeaaaally make sure they're a good fit for you because you're just so complex and they just have to be able to read your mind and win all your games. And a lot of people can. They can say and do all the right things you wanted them to, but let me ask you this,\n\nDo you deserve for anyone to put in this much effort to understand you without any verbal communication from your end?  Are your vague hints and clues really that justified when they're going through so much pain for someone who's just as much of a "good person" as your average well intentioned person? How about you fucking drop the "mysterious unicorn" persona for a bit, put yourself in a more vulnerable position where your pride is at risk, and fucking let people in for once. It's no wonder some of you stay single until the age of 25.\n\nEither you feel the same way or you don't. If you have someone still killing themselves by waiting around for some sort of response after you've led them on so long, how about you go ahead and cut that shit out now if you're so "empathetic"? \n\nI've personally never tried to date one of you watered down jesuses but if what any of my friends or the stories from this subreddit tell me are even slightly true, you guys are some dramatic motherfuckers sheesh. Like why make people solve puzzles and shit to figure you out if you're so goddamn lonely all the time? It doesn't really add a lot of depth or intrigue to your personality because "I'm so complicated" it's just cringey and sad. You'd probably be better off in some fictional world where people are hyperattracted to that.\n\n\nIntroversion: \n\n\nI'll keep this nice and simple; introverts are not deep people who just "get it", and extroverts are not the opposite. An extrovert who asks people why they're being so quiet is not a less intelligent and less tactful person who can't "understand your struggles", they are an empathetic person trying to help you out. They don't expect their comment to be hurtful, not because they're "dumb" , but because those comments and questions objectively are not hurtful. You're choosing to be offended by them.\n\n"How dare he ask me why I'm quiet!"\n\nHell some of you even take it to the next level and decide to mumble a snarky reply as if you're being challenged by the extrovert. They're just trying to be friends. Relax fuckhead. \n\nIntroverts are not inherently more observant. I'm sorry but this belief is just wrong. Extroverts think of all the same "deep" things you do. I can guarantee you that there's a lot less going on in your mind that would blow theirs wide open than you think there is. I've met some of you who have unironically said shit like "I kinda feel jealous of extroverts since they never really struggle with thoughts of mortality as much as we do" like what? Get the fuck outta here with that pretentious bullshit. Calm down there Aristotle you're not that unique.\n\n\nOne more thing: for the love of fuck on a sandwich can YOU PLEASE stop trying to shrink me? I don't fucking know you. Do not ask me probing questions and then get that smug little smirk on your face when you notice that I'm avoiding a topic. You accomplished nothing there. Unless making me uncomfortable was the idea.\n\n-end of thread-\n\n\n\nExtra shit that's not really criticism:\n\nDid you know that acting like you're a licensed therapist when you're not can be extremely harmful? Sure you can be there for your friends and let them vent and stuff, but if you're dealing with a suicidal stranger and they start venting to you, it's probably not a good idea to let them use you as your primary source of support.\n\nI mean yeah in some ways that's technically the right thing to do, especially if you're good at supporting people but in matters of life and death you'll wanna get others involved. Long story short I accidentally killed a man once just sayin'
1	Hey there! A few notes from the mods:\n\n>Feel free to delete this if it's "too mean" or whatever\n\nNot a thing we do. We remove abusive and harassing posts and comments in that vein, but uncomfortable opinions are neither of those things.\n\nAlso, this post is very rant-y, and it's pretty borderline for a standalone post under our [new rules enforcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/aulxa0/25_feb_2019_rules_update_community_topics/). Your post would be clearly on the side of acceptable if you referenced MBTI explicitly. By grounding your analysis of the type in MBTI, rather than in personal experience, we can have a discussion about INFJ as an MBTI type with specific cognitive functions and how those interact with each other and also components of personality outside of MBTI. Observations based in personal experience are not inherently based in MBTI just because you observed them in an INFJ (mistypes and typing others is, of course, a confounding component in this).\n\nBecause you're *so close*, we thought we'd give some MBTI context to start the conversation. A lot of what you're describing here is unexamined Ni, paired with Fe, which creates (a) a false sense of "rightness" because of the nature of Ni information, and (b) a lot of assumptions about others based on how NiFe thinks they *should* behave. This is particularly exaggerated in younger people who have not had the realization (outside of MBTI) that the way they think and conceive of the world is not the same way others do. For instance, being upset that someone is asking why you're quiet is a product of assuming their intentions - because the only reason *you* would ask someone why they're being so quiet is because you want them to stop being quiet (or some similar thought). In this case it also probably has to do with being asked that question a lot, which is frustrating to anyone regardless of type.\n\nINFJs tend to grow out of this phase (though not all, obviously) when they start to value the contribution of the lower functions in their stack - Ti and Se. Ti tells them when things are consistent and rational (e.g., when Ni is giving you something that might be bullshit), and Se grounds you in the moment (e.g., gives Ni continuous up-to-date info instead of letting it run with the first impression). You mention the lack of Se, by implication, in your first part about "not looking".\n\nThe bell curve of trust in Ni is pretty predictable. On the low end, you aren't really aware of yourself and haven't observed or qualified the way your brain works, and so you simply operate on instinct. In the middle, you start to analyze yourself and notice that you think differently than others (again, true for everyone), and you start to claim and value your own strengths. In many people, this shoots past a reasonable confidence into an inflated one. On the high end, you start to *critically* analyze yourself, purposefully try to avoid confirmation bias, and start to think more before going with your impression. Consistency checks (Ti) and double-checking your Ni in different contexts (Se) makes for much more reliable Ni overall and a much less obnoxious person.
27	"Stop assuming things"\n\n*writes a long rant full of assumptions*
9	[deleted]
9	You seem to have a lot of anger towards INFJs specifically lol.  Maybe it should be targeted towards the individuals that triggered this rather than towards a generalized type. 
16	TL;DR. \n\nWhat motivated you to bother writing this screed? 
8	Well I can‚Äôt say I didn‚Äôt see this coming. 
7	All I am gonna say is that these groups where we can chat with other infjs make our quality of life significantly better. Instant connection through sharing a meme about overthinking for example. Another infj just takes the emotion right away and you empower one another. That is why we like to emphasize our qualities in certain places on the internet. It's not as serious as you think, it's all about *expressing* and connecting through Fe. We get a good feeling from it. That's all. We don't really have to defend ourselves about it. 
6	I read your post and I can understand where you are coming from. Every type has a weakness, and no type is better than the other. \n\nBut the real danger is when we start generalizing people based on their types and also when we use these personality types as our utmost personalities. Remember, mbti is just meant to be a guide, not your whole being. When we identify ourselves as INFJ or ENFP, or ISTJ or etc, we often forget the fact that we are more than our types, and not every one will be the same. No two INFJ's or ENFP's are completely alike since we are all different people, with different lives and experiences to begin with.\n\nPlease don't assume that you already know what all infjs are. Generalizing people in regards to their type is a slippery slope. In your post, you hate people assuming what you feel/think or what you're whole personality is (in relation to a kid you knew in high school who assumed things about you). I get it, I hate that too. But please, realize that what you're doing, posting something like this, is also taking a similar stance to what that kid did to you - assuming things about people.\n\nNot all INFJ are like what you just posted. Don't assume stuff about people and MBTI is not the whole personality of a human being.
16	Ok but did you know you can make a point without being an asshole?
6	> > Do you deserve for anyone to put in this much effort to understand you without any verbal communication from your end? Are your vague hints and clues really that justified when they're going through so much pain for someone who's just as much of a "good person" as your average well intentioned person? \n\n>>Like why make people solve puzzles and shit to figure you out \n\nI'm an ENFP too and one of my closest friends is an INFJ and I do admire most of his qualities. But only these things irk me so much. He said it can "take a lifetime to figure him out". I think it takes a lifetime to figure out anything and anyone, not just INFJ's. I do think a lot of INFJ's see themselves as a "rare unicorn" especially concerning their introverted nature, being "mysterious" but it can be so annoying. Fucked up so many good things because of that instead of just telling me what's actually going on in their heads. It's like they expect us to care so much about them that we analyze everything they say and do our utmost best to "understand" them and that way we'll magically know what they think about us or what they want. I just wish they'd be more verbal and actually put into words what they think and want. But I still think they're wonderful people. Us ENFP's have enough annoying traits too, every type does. But can't neglect the good traits. The bad that happens just stays engraved in our minds more since it's some kind of survival mechanism to remember bad things more than the good so we often paint a more negative picture of people than is actually the case. Try to think about the good things too, more conciously.

Sorry, I know this was meant to be a serious post, but that caught me off guard.\n\nOverall, good points. I'm not offended. You have some valid criticism. We do have weak areas that we need to work on. I think the immature pretentiousness we might have gets amplified when we learn about MBTI. I roll my eyes at a lot of exaggerated INFJ abilities and struggles.\n\nStill, I hope you can be patient with us and help us understand how we can grow to be better for both ourselves and others because, at the end of the day, that's what we INFJs ultimately want.
3	I think you're mixing enneagram type 4 with INFJ personality, INFJ type 4 is the most prone to have the things you have mentioned.
2	I appreciate this post and the lively debate it has brought.  I'm a firm believer that INFJs who consider their "rarity" to be this amazing thing are just jerks... you can still be an INFJ and a jerk.  This isn't limited to personality type.  I'm also a firm believer that anyone that thinks that their type is their whole purpose and meaning is a bit ridiculous.  No two people are exactly alike, and although people who are INFJs have a lot of similarities (obviously), you a) don't have to be *exactly* everything the type says you "should" be and b) you should not aspire to be exactly as the type says you should be, just so you can "fit" it.  \n\nOne last thing, I don't believe that anybody is one particular type, and I also believe that you can change throughout many different types as your personality is not one set thing for life.  I know I'm definitely not the person I was 10 years ago.  And in case anyone is interested, I mostly vary between INFJ and INTJ, depending on the day, my mood, the situations I've been in, who I've been around, etc, etc.  That's just my two cents 
1	Haha gosh this made me laugh, because this also hits me hard as an enfp, I myself have issues with telling people how I feel all the time, because I am not always healthy, no one can be. there not always answers to everything. It just is at it is.\nAlso because everyone need space and attention, just in different forms, and sometimes it's better to talk to someone else maybe and not just your infj's?? \n\nI would say do not come to conclusions to fast, but it's understandable that we try to do because we try to understand everything to some level.( this is directed to both parts.) \n\nSure I do get angry with the infj silence, it does sometimes gets me to the nerve as well I am hella happy since the space/time should be taken care off, since sometimes its just not the right time to talk, (no one should have the feel they always have to be there for someone. It's stressful, and may do more harm than to have a break and then catch on later. (Love/hate relationship to this.)  \n\nIt does also make me sad angry at times but that because I value communication. Honesty and want to talk out the problem straight ahead to not dwell on it. ALSO understandable if somone does not know what they feel that they withdraw, to come to conclusions and then return when they feel ready so nothing explodes. \n\n\n(Sorry if I am all over the place, have any questions feel free to ask?)\n
1	OP don't take forest for the trees
1	I'm probably alone here but I just want to say I was laughing all the way through your post. Hilarious word choices, I could picture it being performed as a monologue - you have a gift! \n
1	I read the first main part and yeh, i‚Äôve noticed Ni inherently provides inklings that may or may not be true, or is half true, or at least sounds very plausible. That‚Äôs part of the fun of it. In my younger years, I used to troll people with it.\n\nI‚Äôm playing with the idea that it might be best and the most free when dealing with predominately creative and fictional feats, e.g. video game character development.
1	This hit me hard in some respects and I'm an INFP \nI think people need to hear this bluntness sometime. Thanks. 
3	This is interesting	So today, the company I work for sends out a mass email telling everyone about a new program the company is starting. If we wanted to be apart of it, we had to fill out an application and take this "personality" quiz. Once we finished the quiz, we are instructed to screen shot it and attach it to an email. This was all voluntary. Anyway, I took the quiz. I could care less about the program. What I didn't expect was the results. At the end it said "The Advocate" (INFJ-T). I didn't know what that meant. I read the description of what that personality traits was and I was blown away at how relatable it was to me. A few hours later I just did a Google search for INFJ-T and apparently this is a "rare" personality type? What does this mean for me? I'm just finding out about all of this. I just started therapy and I have my 4th session coming up. I've been going through hell recently, and I need answers. Can someone,anyone, tell me what this means? Any experiences? Concerns? \n\nShould I have a physical done? \n\nBtw...28M...straight white dude. Basically the enemy of everyone apparently.
16	Two things:\n\n> Btw...28M...straight white dude. Basically the enemy of everyone apparently. \n\nYeah... um... get over that, real fast if you can.\n\nSecondly, it means that you're likely quite sensitive, emotional, heart on your sleeve, highly empathic and stuff like that. These sensitivities are your strengths, and learning to use them isn't exactly easy. When you do, life gets so much more bearable. Once you realize that a lot of the way you feel isn't actually yours, but crap you've absorbed from people around you and in the ambient field of things, figuring yourself out becomes easier.\n\n&#x200B;
5	The first rule of INFJ club is: you don't talk about INFJ\n\nThe second rule of INFJ club is: if it's your first time, you read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/wiki/index) out loud
3	So I always like to tell people the tests aren't the best way of determining mbti, I've gotten infp, intj, and intp before I was sure that I was an INFJ. Understanding the psychological jungian function theory behind it can help. Basically it arranges individuals by thought process typing split into 8 functions those are the following: extroverted and introverted feeling(F), sensing(S), thinking (T), and intuition (N) (note that these function letters are different from the mbti category letters such as INFJ etc.). Basically for those four things each individual has a preference for introversion or extroversion respectively and a hierarchical order of importance or strength. Infj has the following 4 functions as preferential in this order Ni Fe Ti Se (introverted intuition, extroverted feeling, introverted thinking, and extroverted sensing). As a comparison a similar type the ENFJ has the same functions but in a different order Fe Ni Se Ti notice how the ENFJ primary function is Fe which is the INFJs second function, in other words the extroverted ENFJ has an extroverted function first while the introverted INFJ has that same function second and an introverted second function of the ENFJ first. Understanding functions can help you better understand how others value ideas differently. For example the INFJ has a preference for Fe or extroverted feeling thus they often focus on a collective feeling rather than their own, while an Fi user or introverted feeling individual often care about how they feel first rather than how the collective would feel. You can read up on the INFJ functions here: https://www.typeinmind.com/nife
9	How do I tell the difference between a healthy INFJ and an unhealthy INFJ?	 I have realized I may not know a single INFJ that I'd ever consider psychologically "healthy."
30	I end up talking about my INFJ every single time I see this question. He is 100% what id consider a healthy INFJ. I don‚Äôt know any unhealthy ones, but frankly just look at this subreddit at least 60% of the time and you‚Äôll see plenty of unhealthy habits/qualities/mentalities. Some of the most noticeable differences I see in my INFJ is that he‚Äôs secure. He knows he‚Äôs different and he‚Äôs not ashamed of it, nor does he feel bad for himself. He can understand different perspectives and empathize with others, but still has high standards. He focuses on self growth and constantly wants to improve while also not being so harsh on himself that it prevents growth. He can admit when he‚Äôs wrong and changes his perspective when he needs to, but stays consistent on core beliefs. He‚Äôs dedicated to the things he believes. He has perfectionist tendencies without expecting perfection from others. I think this is all INFJs and not just healthy ones, but he‚Äôs almost cold to those that don‚Äôt know him, because he has a nice big wall up, but he‚Äôs super warm to me. At least I think he is. I feel comfortable opening up to him for the most part. I don‚Äôt think for a moment he would ever speak ill of me or share any private information with anyone else. Dunno. I can answer specific questions if you have any. 
10	Look for the person who's constantly self deprecating and can't accept a compliment without more self deprecation. That's the mile marker of an unhealthy INFJ.\n\nA healthy INFJ can accept compliment by saying "Thank you! It's nice to be seen!"
12	Me neither, tbh. We‚Äôre a pretty neurotic type. \n\nBut I do think there can be vast differences between us in how we manage and cope with difficulties. The unhealthiest INFJs I‚Äôve known have let their perfectionism wreak havoc on their mental health. They‚Äôve been kind of image-obsessed, too focused on people-pleasing, letting resentments fester. This can also lead to frequent and unnecessary door-slamming. \n\nI‚Äôve also seen this lead to INFJs imposing ridiculously high standards on their partners as well, to the point where it‚Äôs definitely a form of emotional abuse and manipulation. People aren‚Äôt ‚Äúprojects‚Äù to be worked on. \n\nAlso, they can be surprisingly materialistic (low-key guilt-ridden shopaholic). \n\nBeing a (relatively) healthy INFJ might not mean being free of these tendencies, but just better at managing them. Perfectionism wreaks *less* havoc, or they practice setting boundaries more often, seek treatment for anxiety (or other mental health issues), etc. 
5	**Genocide.** üòú
12	A healthy INFJ probably doesn‚Äôt pay attention to that fact they are an INFJ and is less likely to be looking for answers online too 
4	When posts on this website about INFJs seem offsetting and different. \n\nI don‚Äôt relate or feel comfortable, or feel like, I think and feel like the posts on this Reddit  anymore which doesn‚Äôt mean that people that still do are problematic or need to stop. \n\nI‚Äôm just in a different mindset than mosINFJs on here now and I think that means I‚Äôm healthier. I don‚Äôt feel like the world is too big for me or that I won‚Äôt ever be completely happy. \n\nI still have certain days and moments were I do start overthinking and feeling, but it‚Äôs not constant where I can see it happening for the rest of my life. Or so much that it‚Äôs overwhelming.\n\nI‚Äôm slightly more optimistic and just a tiny bit more confident in myself, but I‚Äôm still searching for that ultimate connection, I still want a deeper sense of purpose and meaning in my life, and I still want to express how I feel things deeper than most people, but I don‚Äôt have to talk about it so often. I don‚Äôt put that much value in being an infj. There‚Äôs only so much mbti can help you with.\n\nI don‚Äôt know how all healthy or healthier infjs feel, but this is how I feel.
3	I've seen it referred to as being "in the grip". This article describes it quite nicely, IMO. [https://www.psychologyjunkie.com/2016/12/16/infj-grip-stress-experiences/](https://www.psychologyjunkie.com/2016/12/16/infj-grip-stress-experiences/)
3	I think we often have a tug of war between feeling and thinking that we swing towards one extreme to the other. One thing I've seen in myself was how I let the Ti coldness take over instead of the more connected and forgiving Fe. So I swing from moments of Fe giving to Ti rationalization and get very, very close to door-slamming. \n\nThat's what some people call the tertiary grip (or maybe the Ni-Ti loop if you go into the spiral of thinking all the worst syntheses in a given situation). I guess healthier INFJs or those out of the Ni-Ti loop are able to put Ti in the service of their Fe. That we do not shut off relatedness, but are able to establish healthy and non-destructive boundaries.\n\nI've also been under crippling perfectionism, probably due to all our functions (Ni wants the ideal vision, Fe wants it to be ideal for everyone, Ti wants it accurate and Se wants to perform the ideal). Maybe that's why a lot of INFJs type as Enneagram Type 1s. But we have to learn to curb this... Maybe thru learning from the Se-types to JUST DO IT. Especially when it's crippling.\n\nAlso, generally, an Ni-dom in a stable state of mind is able to synthesize and visualize into one direction or vision of the future. There is a clarity involved in our Ni perceptions. The clarity is probably the reason we learn to trust the Ni vision. In times of high anxiety, these syntheses can turn very, very dark (I have experienced this as a "I see no light at the end of this tunnel") and all fogged up due to latent fears. All we are able to visualize is the negative turn of events. This is probably an indication that anxiety has taken over and has clouded the Ni.
2	Im working on creating a youtube channel for this very reason.\n\nLook for them to have very abstract views on the world not only seeing problems that most people might not see but solutions to these problems.  Very well developed Ni and Fe\n\nIf you or anyone has any ideas or problems they would like expansion on or another perspective, it would help me put together a list of what people actually want to see
2	I have been a healthy INFJ (currently going through unhealthy period however...) but for a few years I was healthy. \n\nDuring a healthy state, I‚Äôd say I was more secure within myself. Also very focused on self growth and wanting to develop myself. I wanted to do things that have purpose towards a cause I feel passionate about, like my ambition/drive went beyond doing things for myself. \n\nOne other thing that stands out, is that I was mistaken a few times for being an extrovert. I can see why, as I felt more confident to talk and share things about myself with others, even new people. It‚Äôs like I had a new kind of energy for life?  An energy that allowed me to go out and push myself more and enjoy the company of others without as much anxiety. Although I certainly still felt exhausted after socialising! I just enjoyed it more.\n\nI was very focused on self-image however and very perfectionistic. But the consequences of this were positive...I just worked hard for what mattered to me and got the results. 
2	Are you asking what are possible red flags one should watch for in people? How would that be exclusive to a certain type?
1	I‚Äôm surely unhealthy 
1	Unhealthy INFJ act like:\n1. Unhealthy INFJ can't see the future, he get stuck in the past. Sometimes concentrated into details when usually he can't see. Ni without Se lost the sense of reality. \n2. His Fe function turns into Fi. This way he struggles in his own emotions, lost the balance. When healthy INFJ uses Fe to help others, to avoid conflicts, to please people around.. unhealthy one would turn from passive aggression into obvious attack, shout out loud, critisize and blame everyone around, but not himself. Also can be hellish-like sarcastic. \n3. He use Ti instead of Fe. Overthinking about past mistakes, feel guilty, ashamed. Brutally door slam everyone around, cut off the connections, isolate himself from real environment. \n4. He starts to eat, drink too much, which talks about Si. In this phase it is enjoyable for him. \nLook all functions turn into introversion. What does this mean? This is the end ladies and gentlemen. Path of suicide, complete isolation. 
1	For me I would say, if I let someone in.  I am accepting an open minded of most, and know I am different and have my values.  Don't care if people have my same views and values, as long as they are  accepting, loyal, honest, truthful and there for me. I am warm to those I love, and even strangers. When I have been unhealthy I have been COLD, and just don't let people in. Something I think INFJ struggles with, and can lead a healthy one into an unhealthy one (from experience at least) is being quiet about my emotions or if something hurts me, and people keep on doing hurtful things, until I kinda just can't have enough and door slam, or get very cold. I hate that about myself, but I know that's how I am so from now on if something bothers me, I have learned not to be ashamed of how I feel and just say how I feel and have the mindset of I can't control other peoples reaction, and the way they react speaks more of them not me :) often in the past I have dealt with trying to confront and people making excuses or lying or not wanting to own up to anything or apologize. Like I said, I would secretly harbor resentment which would hurt so much... which was very unhealthy and absolutely consumed my mind!  INFJ's i feel want peace and don't want to fight, or confront, and I feel I took a lot of blames for a lot failures... it would depress me... so I think a health INFJ is a little more assertive but in a kinda way, and speak their needs in a gentle way :)
-2	measure the frequency at which their auris interna is vibrating: if it's ~~high~~ low they are healthy, if it's high ~~low~~ who knows
15	How do I (INFJ) deal with not allowing people to walk all over me just because they belong to a persecuted minority group?	I got really obsessed with SJ activism in my teenage years and read a lot of literature on power dynamics, oppression, and privilege. Now every time someone hurts me, I unfortunately empathize with them because of their status as a minority (i.e. a person with a disability, person of color, LGBTQ, etc.).\n\nI finally had enough so this weekend when a dude was taking advantage of me at a competition in which I did all the work and he took all the credit, I called him out on it. However, I felt immensely guilty afterward because he has a disability and is a PoC. I kept looking at the "bigger picture" and thinking about how I have privilege over him in some aspects. I know this isn't my concern. I need to get my Ni-Fe to really calm down. but how do I do it?
25	Just because someone was/is oppressed for their minority identity does not give them the free pass to be a jerk to others, even though you can empathize with their struggles. Good job standing up for yourself. You did the right thing. I hope that encouraged you :)
16	Hi, INTP here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo this is a spiky issue. I come from a very different point of view than you, of course, but I would like to posit the following ideas.  All this with the caveat that I may be massively over reading your situation, and just came from a discussion about this topic in another post...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHave you considered that your walking on eggshells could actually be hurting those you empathize with so much?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThink about it like this: if you had a child with disabilities or a certain "social disadvantage", would you want the world to conform to his every whim and benefit, without ever allowing him to develop the strength and character that every healthy person needs in order to succeed? Will you shower him with participation trophies, blind him to any possible offense he may ever encounter? Or would you show him unconditional love, but also push him to go over his own limitations when possible, to confront or learn to deal with those that look down upon him, to gather the tools necessary to succeed in an "imperfect" world. I think I know the answer to that...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI recommend you look into Jonathan Haidt's research into the current "social justice" culture. He presents pretty compelling evidence to the fact that many vulnerable young participants of this phenomenon are actually being deeply hurt by it. The outrage and coddling culture it engenders is in itself a promoter of emotional distress and unhealthy coping mechanisms, and comes often from a place of hurt and immaturity, not from a genuine disposition to mend and grow.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf somebody has a traumatic experience with spiders and develops a phobia, the treatment will NEVER be to rid the world of all spiders, spider imagery, spider allusions, etc. just so the person can "live".  The reasonable thing to do is, instead, to give that person exposure therapy or something alike, so that the person may gradually learn to face his fear of spiders by exposing himself in a controlled manner t the thing that troubles him and learn how doing that DOES NOT DESTROY HIM. That is not at all the same as going a getting bitten by an actually venomous spider and just "manning it up", that would be just dumb, but it also is not the same as living in fear for the rest of his life. I'm not saying this is what is actually happening in people getting triggered, offended, and hurt by other's expression and not perfectly careful actions, like you wanting to get the reward you actually won even though the one who took it in a dishonest way was disabled, but it is something to consider. What do you think?
16	>I finally had enough so this weekend when a dude was taking advantage of me at a competition in which I did all the work and he took all the credit, I called him out on it. However, I felt immensely guilty afterward because he has a disability and is a PoC. \n\nHow is this not condescending and patronizing to the other person? Pardoning that behavior kind of implies you don't think they're capable of doing better. The situation has nothing to do with their skin color or physical ability - they're taking credit for work you did. Learn to assess things in the proper context and hold everyone to the same interpersonal standard of conduct.
4	It sounds like his status had nothing to do with his behavior or anything related to the competition, so it shouldn't be a factor in whether or not you feel guilty calling him out. 
3	Unlearn all the sjw bullshit would be my bet 
5	From an ideological perspective: IMO the 'power/oppression' analysis is completely superceded by one simple prescriptive axiom: "Don't be a dick". It doesn't matter if you're interacting with someone far below you in terms of power, or astronomically above, or the same. Whoever you're interacting with in any capacity, at any time: *"Don't be a dick"*. That's it. Just follow this principle, and the ethical requirement for your possibility-actualization will be fulfilled. Simultaneously, hold other people to this same standard. In your situation, you were right to object to that guy's behaviour, because, stealing credit for other peoples' work/not giving credit were it's due, is a *dick-move*.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrom a temperament perspective: Yes, being assertive is a stereotypically difficult thing for INFJ's. I think it's part of a wider phenomena of us being extremely averse to inducing discomfort in others, along with conflict-aversion. It's self-evident that the ability to withstand conflict is a necessary thing for living. But perhaps a more obscure insight is: *It's also good to possess the ability to induce discomfort in people -- but, also, simultaneously, to have the wisdom, or judiciousness, to not use it*, or rather, to use it only when necessary. That's where the true virtue of the matter lies, IMO; as opposed to being toothless and defenseless as a staticity.\n\nFor me, what's worked is to take baby-steps, over a long period of time. To instantiate defensibility and contingent-assertiveness as an ideal, and to work my way towards it. Specifically, included, is to appreciate when I successfully be assertive in an appropriate situation. And I think that's what's appropriate here: You managed to stand up for yourself in a stressful situation, and even further, in spite of potent exacerbation from an interaction between your temperament, and an ideology that you hold. That is no small feat. That's good work; and you should be impressed with yourself. I am.
2	As a mid 30s INFJ, I totally get the "guilt" even with dealing with a life threatening issue in about to defend myself with lethal force.  I totally empathized and realized the guy's rage was him letting off emotional steam and I happened to be the bowling pin in that situation.\n\nThe only thing I can think of and this comes from more of an esoteric | mysticism perspective (because obviously i dont know how to describe it in everyday language) is to focus on where you want your life to go and dont think about stupid negative scenarios (which is what i did for a couple of weeks which probably placed me right in front of this guy)
2	 Go hang out on /pol/ for a bit. You filled yourself to the brim with sjw propaganda so go to the other side of the coin and get some perspective. 
2	Maybe consider that when you do this kind of thing, you're dehumanizing the person in a covert or subtle way? Making them into an object instead of relating to them as a real human being?\n\nAlso and related, even when there is value in looking at power dynamics, getting all tangled in your own guilt just perpetuates the dynamics anyway, since you make it all about your own feelings instead of, again, relating with *real* respect to the person/people around you as real complex human beings.
3	Ok I'm sorry but this is so fucking stupid. In every way. Being a 'person of colour' or from any of those groups you mentioned doesn't mean you should feel sorry for them, and worse, think it's fine to let them treat you like shit simply because they're a 'person of colour'. Are you literally out of your mind? You don't need to feel sorry for anyone and those groups you mentioned aren't persecuted. You sound very delusional to me. And, as a 'person of colour', your mentality and 'sympathy' is quite offensive.\n\nIn fact, you may not realise it but your post demonstrates racism. You think of yourself as 'higher level' than people of colour, to the extent that you allow them to do wrong because you feel sorry for them, simply for the colour of their skin. Literally, who do you think you are? Absolutely delusional. 
2	INFJ's don't tolerate injustice, which has nothing to do with any majority or minority.
1	Step back, pan the camera out, look at the big picture and assess the claims.  Use that Ti and that intuition.  If anything is fishy, then that's because it is and you should bail.  Don't let your Fe get involved, no matter how hard it seems, because they eat that for breakfast and will **never** reciprocate or feel any semblance of remorse for their cruelty.  If they're nice all of a sudden, then it's always a trap.  You can never fix these kinds of people.\n\nThat's actually the advice I have for identifying narcissists.  That's because the person you're talking about's main interest is themself, how they are amazing the way they are, pins all their problems on others or the world, uses guilt and shame to get others to bend to them, and is convinced that they are mistreated by society.  Sounds like a narcissist and you should treat people like that like narcissists
1	Probably you should judge people on how they act and what they say and not on how their skin is colored. Don't be a pussy
1	So you‚Äôre mad he was claiming all the credit, at a competition...\n\n
1	There is empathy and then there's codependency. Don't become codependent on other people's issues. Don't let anyone abuse your goodwill. Set firm boundaries and let people know what those are BEFORE they cross them. What behavior do you want to tolerate and what behavior can you not accept? Why? What kinds of resources are you willing to expend on this project/person? Let Ti assist you in this process, it is there for a reason. Once you've figured it out for yourself, make sure you communicate these boundaries to people you work and live with. Don't mistake mercy for justice and vice versa. Aka you can sympathize with people,  you can help them, but don't take away the consequences of their actions thinking it'll fix their problem, it won't.\n\nI think we INFJs can sometimes have problems with setting and communicating boundaries because we see what other people's boundaries are without them having to tell us - and we try not to cross them. So we expect the same favor in return. In other words: we need to learn to communicate our needs better.

56	Just some thoughts.	Hey guys.\n\nI don't know if I'm really allowed to share thoughts like these here.. because one of my earlier posts got removed..\n\nBut..\n\nI was just thinking about how I have this mindset, somehow, that I'm not supposed to have fun..?\n\nI'm kind of sure many people do experience this thought process, I'm not sure whether this is something that INFJ's tend to do.. probably not.\n\nHave any of you watched this anime movie called "A Silent Voice"(Koe no Katachi)? There's this scene which hit me hard, and led me to think about this feeling. I'm always restricting myself in a sense.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/c7i8vX4ZpEg (here's the link to the clip, there's that part at the beginning)  \n\n\nBut it's not like I'm very outgoing or someone who has "fun". Yet there's this feeling.\n\nAnd..it kind of is upsetting that where I live, nobody is really into any of the stuff that I'm intrigued by, or I'm interested in. I have all these experiences..but nobody to really truly share them with. And yes, I could find people online, but I'm kind of fed up, I guess?\n\nNowadays, I feel that typing stuff out is tiring too.\n\nI don't know why I'm posting this here.. really..maybe to get some insight.. some thoughts? I'd like to hear what you guys think.\n\nHopefully this doesn't get removed, lol.\n\nThanks for reading through the mess.
1	>I'm not sure whether this is something that INFJ's tend to do.. probably not.\n\nHey there! The mods aren't removing posts to be mean and make people feel bad, it's not a personal thing. This is now into the second month of clearly stated new rules, which we're just trying to enforce: [https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/aulxa0/25\_feb\_2019\_rules\_update\_community\_topics/](https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/aulxa0/25_feb_2019_rules_update_community_topics/)\n\n**If you haven't read those yet, this is the summary:**\n\n\-If your post directly relates to MBTI theory, cognitive functions, or more objective/universal INFJ theory, then it can have its own post on the main page. Awesome!\n\n\-If your topic is about subjective, personal experience that's only "sorta" about INFJ, questions if other people have the same quirk you do, DAE, journally rants, career, relationships, mental health, and all that other good stuff, we're trying to redirect those posts to the stickied community topics where *basically anything that has to do with you as a human can be discussed.*\n\nWe 100% welcome posts like this on our board--they're fun! But like you even said yourself, this has nothing to do with MBTI, and as mods of an MBTI board,  our one job is to make sure the content here is appropriate. In the future, please either directly relate your posts to MBTI or ask them in the community thread to generate interesting discussion! Thank you!!
17	I like the idea of having fun, but I almost feel guilty about it - as if there is always something more important that I ought to be doing. \n\nI am 53 years old now, but I‚Äôve been this way my whole life. It‚Äôs not like being depressed, it‚Äôs more like an overreaching sense of ‚Äúduty?‚Äù I am reasonably successful and content, but I‚Äôm still trying to find genuine joy in my life. Without it, I feel incomplete. \n\nKeep trying to have fun - and do make it a priority! 
11	I think it's called growing up and happens to everyone.  Good or maybe not really good but slightly reassuring info is that most people while "playing" adult don't have that much time anymore and start loosing time to hang out with life-long-friends so after some time most people are surrounded mostly by family. Good part is that you are not alone and there is more people liky you. Ofc it could be just trying to find your place in the world or ...depression.\nsry 4 bad englando
5	Same feel here. Best solution so far is to plan out for spontaneity/fun/guiltfree time. I know it sounds dumb but I haven't found another way.\n\nAbout the people side, I've set myself to look out for people with similar interests in times and locations where I think / it's scheduled they'll be. Requires lots of work (social battery upgrade from 15 min to 5 hours) and time (years) but I'm happy with the results.\n\n For starters I was expecting to be alone forever.
5	I can relate with what you said about all the experiences and no one to share them with. I believe it‚Äôs a consequence of our minds enjoying experiences that most other people find no value in. They might think of them as too hypothetical or abstract to bother thinking about. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so hard to find anyone who can relate. Being how we are causes so much internal conflict, it‚Äôs frustrating and exhausting when we are caught up in our own heads. It‚Äôs bad to go without someone to pull you out and whip you back into mental shape. All of us INFJ‚Äôs need a grounding point and I hope you find someone that can help you. Thanks for sharing your thoughts.
3	Definitely related to this and me entering adulthood, just graduating high school ( just turned 20 years), it's really hitting me hard as the world/people don't care about me or aren't so "deep/sensitive" as I am and already have their family/friends of their own to fall back on. To circle back to "not having fun" topic, I've kinda had envy over people who can say screw there responsibilities to a job or school and go have fun, and other people are right along with them. It's unique few that have quite telling me to keep doing what I'm doing, that it's right (and that's what I been looking for all my life) but.... There really hasn't been any kind of reward and my back can only stay so straight for so long. Maybe it's knowing and accepting we have to do what's right to succeed yet knowing we can't always succeed and know someone else will pick up the torch/mantle, onward or until we can pick it back up ourselves. Part of me can't accept letting go of this torch aka my responsibilities/duty, yet others have to have a piece of the pie or have a time to shine. Sorry for the cheesy metaphors, just got out of Spider-Man Into the Spider-Verse so maybe that can explain some of my text. I love the movies but there's definitely this interesting void feeling after leaving the picture.\n\nBack on topic, I agree with others, definitely set out time to enjoy yourself but I believe we do have some enjoyment in fulfilling our duties, seeing more grand things come to life and take effect, sometimes with small inner connected puzzle pieces waiting to be solved. Sorry for my weird rant, hoped this was somehow interesting.
2	I just saw this movie in a theatre with my friends on a week day! I feel like it‚Äôs relevant to the topic of feeling bad for having fun because I truly considered declining their invitation and staying home to do homework. I thought about it a while and decided my relationships with these people matter as much or more than my grades so I gave myself permission to have fun! It‚Äôs definitely easier when someone you‚Äôre comfortable with invites you to do fun things but I have to tell myself all the time that life doesn‚Äôt have to feel like a chore. Sure there‚Äôs things you have to do to get ahead, make money, become educated, pursue skills and interests but at the end of it all you‚Äôre the only one experiencing your life, you‚Äôre the only person you‚Äôll ever be so if you want to do something, you don‚Äôt have to wait for a more extroverted friend to invite you. I feel like INFJs have a special ability to really enjoy spending time alone if we practice! I like to plan small adventures for myself or sometimes spontaneously on my way home from class. Usually it‚Äôs just going to a store or a coffee shop but going by myself gives me the freedom to spend my time the way I want and think all my thoughts uninterrupted. Maybe that‚Äôs something that appeals to you too, I hope this is helpful  ‚≠êÔ∏è 
2	How many answers were satisfying? I‚Äôve come across this kinds of post so many times and had posted them myself as well, there‚Äôs always this feeling of not being able to let everything out exactly as you want it and then if people answer it‚Äôs always unsatisfying or as usual misunderstood. I believe you have grown up being thought respect and composure, always keeping yourself under control. All of this + not finding compatible humans never allowed you to experience that feeling of letting go, that ironically is so common around you. I‚Äôm afraid that it won‚Äôt go away until you interact with that someone that will allow you to feel listened and understood like never before. I fear that‚Äôs also due to not quite being in the right technological period where you could just find people with similar brain frequencies and interact with no matter where. I might be wrong, but still what you said felt very familiar
189	Signs of unhealthy infjs.	
88	Well fuck, looks like I am really unhealthy... 
48	This is why Im so obsessed with MBTI and my type in general. Everything I ever read about INFJ's is so damn accurate and personally relatable. Today I confirmed Im an unhealthy INFJ. Im at such an unhealthy point in my life in general. No goals or rather the motivation and ambition to reach them. Completely stagnant and scared to move forward or do anything. Yay
31	Triggered 
27	Oh wow, even though I've hit every single one of these, I feel like I've been slowly getting better at them. At least enough so I don't feel hopeless about it. This is the first time I've read one of these kinds of articles and haven't felt defeated afterwards. Yay! 
23	10/10 hits.. ;/
20	Can I get 10 ways to fix me as well? 
18	Well, I can say I hit quite a few of those a year ago but not anymore. Feels good to have become more healthy once I started reading more about my personality type.
16	ouch okay way to call me out.\n\nbut for anyone else also dealing with these issues: take this post and use it to better yourself. truly realize that these are your issues and that they can be fixed if you work on them. all the best.
15	Spot on, especially the overindulgence and over-sensitivity.
12	TIL...I'm an unhealthy INFJ.  I was just recently identified as an INFJ and wish it had happened much earlier in life.  The traits are spot on and have helped me to understand a bit more about why I am the way I am.  So how do I become a healthy INFJ?  (I only reread/typed this 3 times üòä).
6	Can anyone relate to #7 a lot? I have had binge eating disorder which I am now free of - YAY! But it's more the compulsive disorder of when I start something I dedicate myself fully into it to the point where my life might be controlled by it.
6	That's me! Do I get a cookie?\n\n(Seriously, that made me kind of sad. Why are we so complicated?)
5	I feel attacked
7	I am not unhealthy! How dare you random article! I'm enlightened as fuuuuck 
5	BUT HOW DO I FIX IT ALL 
5	I‚Äôm only mostly unhealthy!
7	Nearly everyone on this sub is an unhealthy INFJ. It‚Äôs very sad
6	#1 absolutely called me out.
3	I started off thinking, "hey I'm quite healthy so far," then it went down fast. Haha. \n\nThis is very, very true for me. Like to a scary degree. I'm glad to say that with some of them I have either almost gotten completely better or am in the process. \n\nI kinda wish, binge eating and binging Netflix turned into binging exercise though haha. \n\nI also realise that maybe my life around me since childhood has really hindered my development in life. Although I also think certain aspects of it have benefited me. I just have to make the best with what I've had and just try to improve. That's all I can do.
3	This is bizarrely accurate 
3	I think I‚Äôve previously read this article. I‚Äôm definitely unhealthy. Trying to flip it but it isn‚Äôt easy.
4	But *I am more enlightened than others*...
4	Fuck
2	Surprisingly, I'm actually not thaat unhealthy? 
2	I was feeling really down so it just came to me that we never see something about unhealthy infjs so i looked it up and was shocked like most of you guys, i almost got them all some them are an on-off thing but they are all there\n\nTbh when i first learned about my type i was kinda excited and feeling special about it, being the rarest type and all. But as the days go by i started gradually hating my type feeling like am being cursed by it and i actually hated myself more and more in the process. So yeah story of my life
2	while I relate to all 10 of the items and there‚Äôs parts of the descriptions tailored to the INFJ, I can see most other people agreeing with at least 7-8 of these as these weaknesses are so general... :(
2	Well, let's see. \n\n1: I know how and when to say no.\n\n2: Sometimes yes, sometimes no. I've to work on it...\n\n3: Well... yeah... but-\n\n4: That's something I really had make progress on. \n\n5: Fight me, bitch. \n\n6: ... idk\n\n7: fuck... \n\n8: Really no, sometimes is the other way arround. \n\n9: Yes. 10/10. Yes. \n\n10: That's someting I work a lot in. 
2	Holy crap the 0 tolerance for conflict was a personal attack and I need this article to apologize or I‚Äôm leaving. 
2	Seems like the library....... is OPEN üìöüòê\n\nI‚Äôm currently avoiding a group chat that just went political and my ‚Äúfriend‚Äù (who I‚Äôm thinking of doorslamming) is espousing all this racist alt-right populist bs that I can‚Äôt even respond to. It disappoints me and saddens me and I get too emotional lol.\n\nAlso reads me for being super reclusive (me and perpetual singledom) and yet indulging in bad habits whenever I can... drinks, drugs, partying üôÑ
2	Oof the pretentious one really got me\nIm trying really hard to stop being like this lol sometimes I say shit and the moment it leaves my mouth im like ‚Äúwhat did you get from that??? You literally got nothing AND you sound like an asshole!!!‚Äù \nIt‚Äôs a learning process i guess !
2	Is one of the signs refusing to read the list because I am afraid of being called out 
2	Some of these really are me. Still not sure how to start thinking my needs matter. They‚Äôre just...not high on my list of priorities. But I‚Äôve become resentful of several close friends to the point of nearly doorslamming them and it‚Äôs all because I keep putting their needs before mine with no reciprocation from them. So I guess there‚Äôs a practical reason for looking after myself. I still wish I didn‚Äôt have to do it though.
2	Dae find that chemicals etc (caffeine/medication/vitamins, etc) really change this - I can be more "healthy" when on a certain medication and then after years of work turn to "unhealthy" when it stops. All the work I put in feels like a waste, even though it wasn't completely. But it seems easy to think that with hard work you can fix these and become healthy, whereas I've found it depends a lot on things out of my control, too. 
1	Guilty of 6 & 10 from time to time. The others I've struggled with at one time but worked it out.\n\nThese are veeery true.
1	and what about it?
1	Okay, ouch lol 
1	i felt this way too hard üòì
1	But I like being the misunderstood misfit! 
1	Oh. I guess that‚Äôs me. Terrific. I thought I was getting better, but apparently not!
1	Hmm, I‚Äôve never really done most of these and some of them like reading body language I feel most of us do naturally. \n\nCareful not to associate an action with a reason someone else has said and make sure you actually do these things for that reason before you declare yourself unhealthy.
1	Honestly every single one
1	Okay, well...looks like I have a lot of things I need to work on!! 
1	Well, shit.
1	Damn. Unhealthy.
1	This just reaffirms my need for therapy, if I'm ever able to afford it.
1	*Sighs* yup, got it, for like the 15th time. 
1	Are all of these that far into being unhealthy, can't some of these just as easily and quickly be a strength? 
1	Oh shoot! 3, 4, 7 and 10. 
1	Oh this is me. 
1	I'm aware, unhealthy, and actively trying to fix it :")\nBut oh so very unhealthy 
1	Well that sucks, guess I‚Äôm unhealthy, dang it 
1	As a self-proclaiming healthy INFJ, I remember suffering from #6 and #8 in my teens. I can't take credit for my overall healthiness; I was blessed to grow up in a household and social environment that was healthy. Being a hermit and thinking you're better than others share a common root in that it's due to the lack of exercising Fe and interacting with others.
1	andddd this is why I am in therapy. 
1	reason # 1 thats why i stop helping people
1	Surprisingly good article
1	oh. i‚Äôm so unhealthy
1	Wow. I don‚Äôt know how to be healthy 
1	Damn it
1	After reading the list of unhealthy characteristics of an INFJ, I identified with #3 (They can be over-sensitive and self-absorbed) and #7 (They struggle with regular binge-eating, over-exercising, or impulsive behaviors), although I don't believe binge-watching Netflix is necessarily a bad thing. Overall I would then consider myself to be a healthy INFJ with sensitivity and Netflix issues. :-D
1	I fit into all of these. Should I be worried?
2	INFJ 4w5 sx/sp and SOOO CONFUSED	Hello! So, I have always been typed as an INFJ. I recently have begun wanting to further enlighten myself and maybe have some sense of understanding? Anyways, I have taken tests and I always type the same. A huge issue though is that I can never find any info on the type as a whole! Can anyone share some info or their personal experiences with me please? 
2	Speaking as an INFJ myself, the best thing you can probably do is a)somehow meet another INFJ, and somehow trust each other to talk about experiences, or b)do research, and i mean a lot, a huge varied scope. If you‚Äôre interested, hopefully it shouldn‚Äôt be a problem. But I‚Äôve found that by combining both (lucky me, I‚Äôve got a friend), you can figure out the stereotypes and media produced misrepresentation, and cut down to what could be considered the ‚Äútrue‚Äù traits of an INFJ.\nJust remember, because people are people, be flexible with what you learn: INFJ types, like any other, will always be different from each other (ex, people are sensitive on different scales, not just both extremes). \nHopefully if you do that, you can find out more about yourself, theough yourself, because its hard in my opinion to find any ‚Äúgood‚Äù information.\nAlthough I would recommend this guy called Frank James...he‚Äôs pretty good.
1	I hope this helps, there are some infjs on YouTube and stuff that talk about mbti, the youtubers that I watch are Ren's Room, Frank James and Boom Shikha. And there is something called functions in mbti, which is something that a type has, every type has a different order and there are 8 types of functions Ni NE SI SE TI TE FI FE. Here is a website that tells you about the functions. https://www.careerplanner.com/8CognitiveFunctions/Cognitive-Functions-Simply-Explained.cfm\n\nAnd here is something that tells you about types. idk if all of the descriptions are accurate for every type\nhttps://www.16personalities.com/personality-types\n\nHere are the youtubers\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/ploufpingouin\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxc0c4cOfFmSUnzX9uY7Jww\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCArXog3YJr77XI12O183miA
1	I would suggest going to personalityjunkie and personalityhacker for starters. But learning the cognitive functions in depth will take you a long way.
1	I prefer not to read too deeply into it. I did drywall and now I notice bad walls, I was a painter and I notice bad cutting and I did tile now I notice bad floors. I know if I were to over educate myself with personality typing, the same thing would happen.\n\nEdit: Oh what I would give to unsee the part of my rental‚Äôs kitchen wall paint that was not coated twice.
24	Anyone else notice that Jazz helps with our hidden Se?	I‚Äôve noticed it can help me when working with my hands, cooking, cleaning, etc. 
9	Try ambient like Biosphere substrata or psytrance and let me know ;)
6	Yes! I feel the same way, but with listening to down-tempo EDM music instead of jazz. 
4	for me, it's melodic death metal. [skeletonwitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBnhx7N1y5Y), [amon amarth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFYVcz7h3o0), [at the gates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQt8RyGihu4), and [the black dahlia murder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voxtdphvP5k) are some of my favorites. i'm always able to focus much better with real world tasks if i can listen to my metal. 
3	What do you mean by our hidden Se. Like what does it feel like when it is "helped"?
2	I love Buble on Alexa when I'm doing house stuff.
2	Would anyone mind sharing their favorite jazz albums so I might take a listen.\n\nMotown does this for me in some way too.
2	I think you just mean music in general. Plenty INFJ hate jazz lol
2	I always dance to Jazz, I used to be in Swing dance club! Jazz always gets me stepping to a rhythm which may help me with chores. 
1	I'd say that for any type of music depending on what you like
1	EDM, Hans Zimmer, and anything by Banks work for me.
1	I don't think physical things like that have a lot to do with Se for INFJs. I believe they're mostly processed by different parts of the brain than the higher executive functions. Especially because they're repetitive and methodical. Se is more picking up new bits of information from the immediate environment semi-consciously. Probably an unpopular view here though -braces for downvotes-. It also has something to do with knowing how much energy or force is required in the immediate environment. I don't understand that part too much yet, though, but I imagine it works similarly to Fe, but more.. sensy.
29	Out of 16 types, 8 are light and 8 are dark. INFJs are one of the 8 light types:	
42	Aah, so we got heroes and villains. Lightside and the darkside. Good and evil people. Good to know that science is being put into good objective hands...
35	This is dumb.
8	I mean I think your theory sounds really interesting. But I just wonder about how the distinction between what makes a person "light" or "dark" relates to mbti? And how come being "subjective" equates to a dark outlook and not the other way around?
12	An ENFJ is a dark type? That's very unusual in my opinion.
4	Personally I think INFJs tend to be more concerned with morality and question their choices and what moral impact it will have causing them to strive for good morality.\n\nI get people do bad things but if you are guilty and strive to be better I think you fall under a good person
4	i have INFP and i am very kind
8	uhhhhhh
3	Wat.
3	> People who are objective (light) in their values are better suited for the public sector, and people with a subjective (dark) outlook are **only** suitable for the private sector.\n\nLol.  I‚Äôm glad we have people with such objective outlooks leading us.  Why are INFJs always so ready to fire up the ovens?
3	Surprised INFP‚Äôs aren‚Äôt light types as healthy ones have probably the most empathy and kindness of anyone and therefore good for education or any social interaction jobs.\n\nPeople should probably not take this that seriously. The light and dark aren‚Äôt implying good vs evil, just which types are better suited to which paths. Though maybe light and dark aren‚Äôt the best choice of words? Hmm..
3	thanks for posting this, immediately got a divorce from my INFP wife! 
3	hello infj\n\nlets die alone together\n\naha cant stop laughing at infp being dark tho
9	I don't even
3	MTBI is the theory of the process of how you intake and process information. there are a lot of posts that ‚Äúzodiac‚Äù MTBI that irritate. but let‚Äôs not perpetuate stereotypes or label types it‚Äôs reductive. 
4	Well isn‚Äôt this the most bullshit post I‚Äôve ever seen in this subreddit. To claim people are good or bad based on their MBTI type is the most ridiculous thing I‚Äôve heard today. There are some ridiculously shitty people in the ‚Äúlight‚Äù side and some wonderful people in the ‚Äúdark‚Äù side. Maybe, just maybe, MBTI has nothing to do with that. Each type has qualities that would make them good and bad for the public and private sector. I‚Äôll talk about my type, since it‚Äôs the one I know best and it‚Äôs one you‚Äôve damned to the dark side. ENTPs can be selfish and they typically don‚Äôt care too much about others feelings. They‚Äôre also extremely curious and desire learning more to come to a conclusion and will often consider other perspectives. By your standards, ENTPs should not be judges. By my standards, they should be. See how your idea is flawed? Each type has positives and negatives. Stop trying to demonize some, we have enough division amongst people over pointless things, we don‚Äôt need MBTI added to it. 
1	**\*Rude Buster starts playing***\n\n***Deltarune intensifies***
1	Wait, Am I dark?\n\n&#x200B;
1	Have there been many INFJ leaders?... just curious. What are some examples other than Hitler?
1	For what I know of the INFJ, and my personal expirences, we are more neutral. We can be a cinnamon roll or the lord of destruction or both at the same time. 
1	Hitler was INFJ.
83	got diagnosed Schizotypal and it's funny how close to being INFJ it seems	this is only a part of it of course, but some similarities i saw were making random connections to seemingly unconnected events, speaking in metaphors, viewing everything from a meta perspective, "odd speech patterns", sounding lost in their own words, "few close friends", everything having meaning,  ...... :(  ( the difficulty in maintaining close relationships perhaps?)) \n\nI just happen to also get pinched by imaginary bugs quite often before bed \n\n
39	I think finding the connection between Schizotypal and INFJ might be one of those loose associations that are characteristic of Schizotypal disorder.  \n\nI think it‚Äôs kind of a dangerous game trying to correlate different personalities from the MBTI to different DSM diagnoses. \n\nThe MBTI was designed to account for variance in personality in a normal (not clinical) population. The DSM was designed to explain deviances from the norm which are also associated with profound differences in brain chemistry and brain structure. \n\nThe issue is that if people start claiming that ____ disorder is associated with ____ personality, it could lead to stereotypes. ‚ÄúOnly ENTJs are narcissistic,‚Äù or ‚ÄúDepression is such an ISFJ thing‚Äù. These stereotypes might prevent those who type as one personality to not seek help because their disorder doesnt fit the stereotype. 
11	I'll also add that those traits sound somewhat like Asperger's as well. (Recently found out I have Asperger's at age 29. It often goes unnoticed in girls and women). 
25	Yeah you‚Äôre juuuuust inside the age limit for that diagnosis so I‚Äôd watch that if I were you. I was misdiagnosed when I was much younger by a well-meaning mental health professional. 
7	Chilllll...\n\nInfjs display faux symptoms from a wide range of mental illnesses combined and taken out of context. \n\nI've been able to track it down to this weird mix between extremely empathic autism, Asperger's and small amounts of controlled DID tendencies. \n\nWe work like that. A ton of boxes could be checked by a psychologist if they had the wrong eyes on you. We're weird but very misunderstood.\n\nI'm so demoralized when I hear about young infjs being diagnosed with a list of things and then numb everything down with drugs. \n\nYou are not like people around you, - that will confuse them. They will force that upon you, - sometimes with the best intentions. Learn to understand where those false symptoms comes from instead, and you'll see everything. You will relate to a person with Asperger's, but you also need to see the million things that makes that statement a paradox. \n\nMy parents has run me through every cog in the machine and I see why. \nObjectively, I was a weird fucking kid. I needed routine, liked hanging out with friends but would pull my arms out of my sockets if I didn't feel like going out. Literally. Several times. I had to get creative to put my message across. Smart with some things, a complete idiot with others.  I understand why my parents were confused and desperate, but they were only reading sideeffects from something else entirely. \n\n Growing up, you're trying to figure out why the fuck your brain is off compared to your friends. It changes rapidly in the early years. We try to read and absorb the world like we do best, but an undeveloped brain gets overwhelmed. We lash out as children, often with extreme rage.\n\nI made a list once with accompanying descriptions. It's a long list with a lot of big, solid boxes. It's a minefield. One bad therapist and you're being treated for something completely unrelated that is just a branch of your fucked up personality. \n\nEdit: Of course, you can actually also have a ton of those things, so do talk to someone experienced that you trust completely. Don't just pick the nearest therapist. Be up front about what your know about your personality now. All the quirks. \n\nI've always wondered how many of our traditional diagnoses are built upon misunderstood, broken children. I'm looking at you Freud. 
9	According to to DSM everyone is crazy - it‚Äôs how they ( pill  industry) makes money.   Only a few years ago they wanted to add Introversion as diagnoses -  DSM is written by extraverted pharmaceutical drug reps.   
3	Hey, INFJ here. Last summer during a bike ride I went into a delusional state. I've never experienced anything like that before. If I had gone in, I'm almost certain I would have been diagnosed as paranoid/delusional. What bothered me most is that I've always taken pride in my levelheadedness. Interested in hearing more about your experiences if you were ever open to chat.
1	This worries me, hmmm how huge of a problem is this disorder? 
1	Uh I do everything on this list, am I schizotypal? Does asking this question make me more so?
1	Dammit this is not funny!? \n\nI am gonna overthink this now
-1	Ugh is everything being diagnosed now I don't feel like that's a mental illness. My bros a GENIUS literally an absolute brainiac but he's this way. So am I... (but ya not as brainy haha)

2	Hi, for starters I curious to know any of you fellow INFJs' stories from being a hopeless romantic to now being in a successful relationship. If you do want to tell about not finding love/a partner for awhile, finding one, then it failing, that's ok too but definitely tell me what you learned from the relationship and what's keeping you motivated to go your next one or just content.\n\nNow about myself, I'm 20 years old, yes people will say I'm super young but you know that good ol INFJ old soul feeling? Anywho, I separated from a friend I talked to super often long distance that I was into. Long story short (I can PM anyone the details of why it didn't work out, or if you've seen any of my posts/comments from last year you may know) it didn't work, it wasn't a break up because we weren't dating but I felt relationship or friendship was at that point to go to the next stage because of how personal we were. As that ended, I got a job and met this lovely woman that has been nothing but kind and understanding to me since I walked through those doors. Thing is, she's 8 years older than me. People I have asked around have said this fine in modern day or I just have to be pretty mature (which I am, and sometimes too mature... But I definitely seen my mistakes and retreated each I've had an out burst and handled something immaturely). I'm constantly paranoid about this and it wouldn't be my first choice to marry someone this much older but I guess we don't get to select everything. Continuing on, I have shown quite the hints I like her by leaving some comics for her one night months ago and recently a Valentine's card for my appreciation of her. I believe she reciprocates this by doing practical things for me like getting me water, small tasks to get away from standing 4 hours straight, etc. But I'm stuck on if these are actions of such and such or just gently letting me down. Maybe not letting me down but maybe I'm too much in haise for love and I really only see her in the workplace. I've ran into her once at my college (twice really and she was RIGHT NEXT TO ME and....I split hot tea of myself (which she didn't see) and I ran away lol). Few coworkers I've told about my liking of her have said ask for her number and that's just crazy talk, like? Rather fight a shark...\n\nAnywho, besides your thoughts of that situation above, I got some questions relating to such\n\nDo any of you date anyone significantly older or felt some gap of maturity?\n\nI believe she's INFJ as well. I felt I have dealt with that last relationship but the one thing that has stuck with me is I don't want to be lead on again (and again, I can go more into about this in PM and it be argued "lead on" isn't the best words but I'll never post this if I'm going to sit down fix every error) and I can be too hasty and having too high of expectations. Before others point it out, yeah I don't feel too loved or appreciated at home or by "friends", learning how the adulthood is cold and I don't want to be swallowed up and be bitter. I unfortunately but truthfully feel the need to live through or love someone, to connect and feel appreciated/accepted or whatever. I tried many things and I don't mean for this to sound depressing, I'm at least ok now and kinda in the present but I know I like thinking ahead or having a decent blueprint of my future. Thanks for reading, please be mindful and I'm free to PM.
2	I posted to INFJ for the first time today. I also found out today that I have this personality. I don't know anything about it. I am in therapy right now for the first time in my life and I am looking for answers. I feel like I am learning who I am for the first time today. I also don't know how real this is. I'm a little nervous to latch on to this because I don't want to use it at as a label for myself. But if it's legitimate, I want to know more. Will someone please give me some info? Experiences, habits, relationships, really just anything from someone who has known this about themselves for a while. Thanks

1	Hello! So I have some 80 euros that I‚Äôd like to give to charity. In the past I have donated food, clothes, hair and blood, but this is my first time donating money freely.\n\nI know there are [many](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/nov/14/orphans-cambodia-aids-holidays-madonna) [issues](https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/peter-worthington/africa-aid_b_1657872.html?guccounter=1) related to giving money if these resources are not properly placed, even when well-intentioned, as well as problems of transparency, for-profit organisations, etc. As such, I am requesting help from people who have experience in donating or know how to donate responsibly, or if you know of any specific charities which you can vouch for.\n\nHere are some topics that are important to me:\n\n- Animal rights\n\n- Big human‚Äôs rights issues (such as the Rohingya situation, Boko Haram‚Äôs horrible actions, world hunger, sexual slavery in the Philippines, wars, etc.)\n\n- Women‚Äôs rights (especially relating to rape)\n\n- Immigration and refugees\n\nI‚Äôm seeing a lot of advice and recommendations online for American charities, but not many from my country (Spain, or even just Europe) or affecting international issues, which is what I‚Äôd be more interested in.\n\nThank you for any help!
1	Has anyone found a group or ‚Äúclique‚Äù to belong? Where an INFJ personality would be very appreciated?
1	Hey! I am having a really difficult time. My housemate and best friend is extremely depressed and won't seek treatment. They usually come home from work and go into their room and shut the door, and are growing more and more emotionally closed off. I am trying so hard not to take it personally but it's so painful I just want to cry. I know they don't hate me but that's what the behaviors feel like and I can only be strong for so long. How do I stop feeling all the dark "energy" for lack of a better term?
1	More of a lurker but... looking for insight, might delete :[. How do you manage a thought that is just all consuming? I deep down dont believe in myself and have low self esteem. This makes me procrastinate and stay away from being vulnerable. I did counseling, which helped. Stopped 5 months ago but I think I need to start again. I wish my brain could have a clean slate, clarity. Its all I want. I'm so tired of my thoughts going down the same road. When I read about controlled dosing and therapy, I'm intrigued. I've never drugs but at this point, I need something to change, a miracle, a wake up call. I dont want to be hard on myself anymore, i want to believe wholeheartedly in me. I dont know why its gotten this bad... guilt/shame cycle. Probably my upbringing etc, but fuck im sick of it. Im completely apathetic :(
1	Any INFJs that are coaches or therapists / counsellors ?\n\nWould be interested in knowing how this profession is turning out for you! I am interested in people and psychology in general, love helping others bring out the best in them but I‚Äôm also thinking whether it can become exhausting to constantly be interacting with other people ? 
67	That one word you‚Äôre looking for being on the tip of your tongue	I‚Äôm not sure if this is an INFJ thing or a human thing. But does anyone else sometimes struggle with writing your thoughts, and you come to a point where you know there‚Äôs a perfect and precise word you‚Äôre looking for, right on your tongue‚Äôs tip, but can‚Äôt ‚Äúfind‚Äù it? It‚Äôs like that word you want is swimming in this sea inside your mind with you reaching around, trying to grab it knowing it‚Äôs super close by, but it‚Äôs swimming around you evadingly? And then you finally catch it by remembering which word it actually is, which is basically synonymous with the famous ‚Äúaha!‚Äù moment? It‚Äôs almost like ‚Äúfeeling‚Äù the word before you recognize it if that makes sense. \n\nI can‚Äôt remember who said it or where I read it, or even when, but I once read it has something to do with the Ni function. That may be incorrect, but I‚Äôm curious if this affects other INFJ‚Äôs frequently. 
23	I also struggle to recall words that I would imagine to fit perfectly within certain settings and situations. 
12	This is totally me. At times when I write an essay, I use eloquent and precise words but oftentimes, I just can‚Äôt seem to find the exact word like I was struggling with the word ‚Äúvexed‚Äù but I kept typing ‚Äúannoyed‚Äù or ‚Äúbuttons pushed‚Äù
8	I do this too. In addition to writing, even while having a conversation, when I am telling something that I find interesting, I struggle to find the right word to describe a thing or a feeling. I get really lost when that happens and eventually sadly, the other person loses interest in what I am saying. This really annoys me. \nI loved the way you described it..
8	We shouldn't interpret every kink that happens to most of us here as an INFJ trait. I've heard several people talking about this phenomenon and I've even seen a meme about it once.\n\nNot being offensive here, I am just a bit annoyed by other people claiming the MBTI is some kind of made up 'horoscope' fraud where every personality type fits to everybody.
6	Similar problem here. Whenever I start writing something I always find better ways to write off the sentence. And in some rare cases I can immediately start another sentence mid-sentence without deleting the last few bits and afterwards I read the confusing mess I wrote.
5	Yes! A thesaurus is my best friend when writing for this reason 
4	My permanent state of mind. \n\nUsually happens when I'm demanded by an external situation to recall on something out of my natural order of ideas.
4	It‚Äôs totally a human thing. It‚Äôs called the [tip of the tongue effect. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tip_of_the_tongue) 
3	All. The. Time. I hate it. \n\nOther option is to know the exact word I want to use, but second guessing its definition and having to pause momentarily to look it up before I go making a fool of myself, even though I had it right to begin with. 
3	Infp here. Absolutely. I think it can have something to do with being intuitive. A lot of the information  we process is unconscious (maybe more so than sensors, even though I don't have any hard evidence for that). So it's like the word or piece of information is just on the border of obilivion and lucidity. Just in sight so we can see it, but just out of reach so we can't grab it. My guess.
3	Nah, this is just called being a human. Of course we all feel this way‚Äîeveryone feels this way. So many posts in here are just plain, normal, human experiences. Not everything is attributed to your Meyers-Briggs 
3	Happens all the time, i even sometimes just ignore this and write anything with the same meaning, because if i focus too much on getting the right word I'll just lose my train of thoughts for the whole piece\n\nI think its kinda makes sense cause Infjs prepare what they're gonna say or write before they actually write it, so maybe you know this word before from a previous preparation 
2	Happened a couple of times just today
2	Yes! As a writer I always get this feeling. I know there is a perfect word to use and I know what it is, but I don't *know* what it is. Haha.\n\nThe way I deal with it is googling the meaning I'm going for or using a thesaurus with similar words. Sometimes that won't work and I'll end up just getting it like you said in that 'aha' moment.
2	it's got something to do with interaction between your right and left brain hemispheres
2	Totally me. When this happens, I just sit there staring ahead until the word finally comes to mind. 
2	That's me all the time: in writing or talking: when writing I always have to edit to find more sophisticated wording especially if there are word limits. As I speak, I have to pause at times to find the right word that I want to say 
2	I do this too!! Pretty sure it‚Äôs an Ni thing. I once thought ‚Äúdeodorant‚Äù was ‚Äúdetergent‚Äù. I even convinced my friend that it was true.
2	All the time. I always attributed it to multilingualism and being confused with the languages but many times I can't think of the perfect word in any language although I know it exists, so I guess maybe it's an INFJ thing then? When I'm writing I usually use a place holder so I can give it time for the perfect word to come back to my mind.
2	That's why we find outlets in form of art.. art, literature, and writing are ways we express ourselves. If I can't find a word for a feeling, then music will help translate that feeling for me.
2	The correct verbiage for an INFJ is essential... we know exactly what we're trying to communicate and is practically our duty to use the absolute correct word to get our meaning across.
1	I think everyone experiences that phenomenon tbh, not a type thing. 
1	I think thats most people. Its just your neurons wandering around trying to find the connection inside your brain to give you that answer. perhaps change your environment, like walking to a different room, or think hard when and where you might have uttered it before.
1	It is definitely a human thing, though perhaps more an INFJ thing as there is so much unsaid at all times, even trying to word it is difficult 
1	I feel like i always experience this but once i find the word it still doesn't feel like it was the right word. Like it felt more powerful than it is when its actually written. Also i find that I can feel my memories but struggle to describe them in words sometimes. It is either i'm the most articulate person who can speak about complex topics with ease OR i dont know what to say at all.

1	Caught between a INFJ rock and an INFP hard place: What do you think?	Hi everyone.\n\nA little background: I have been following MBTI for a little less than a year now and I am still uncertain of my personality type. The first time I took the test, I got INTP but felt like this was inaccurate. I have taken several tests and get caught between INTJ and INFJ. I am aware that the tests are limited by the fact that J and P can be inaccurately attributed to the result of the user based on their ability to plan and organize. An investigation of the cognitive functions and an analysis of my overall behavior relative to other J and P users (in terms of language, socionics, the types of discussions on the INTP, INTJ, INFJ, INFP forums) has led me to believe I am either INFP or INFJ. For starters, i've noticed that INFP and INTP tend to be more specific in their method of communication (correct me if i'm wrong). They tend to use their past experiences and more concrete reasoning when describing their thinking/feeling positions. The reasoning does not have to be "logical", but it is usually more grounded in experience relative to the dominant Ni users. This makes sense given that Si is shared by dominant Ti and Fi users as a sort of background function. I think I do the same thing in an effort to organize my own thoughts and/or feelings, because they do not make sense when they sit in my head. Writing my thoughts/feelings down and trying to distract myself with music, work, exercise and food keeps the demons at bay so they don't pound their fist on the cerebral door. I know I am an introverted intuitive. But I don't know what my strong functions are. I usually get Ni and Si pretty consistently on the cognitive function tests (such as through keys2cognition and idrlabs), but that is a contradiction. Ti and Te are usually in balance on both. Fe is much higher on the idrlabs measure than the keys2cognition measure, but relatively balanced in keys2cognition. \n\nIn my head, there is a war going on and its name is the "inner critic". It takes in and processes so much information and it doesn't know what to do with any of it. It's like an inefficient machine that takes in events, conversations, information and spit out useless garbage that I take to truth. And I never feel like I have enough of this information to come to a conclusion. I sometimes feel like I'm living a lie because I create my own stories from this faulty machine and I have to tell myself that it makes sense and that I should live by these "truths" because it gives me a sense of direction. The machine throws around these thoughts/feelings without me knowing until I very rarely obtain something that has any meaning. In the event I DO get something that has potential, this intangible thought or feeling gets beaten up until it's meaningless and I have to go back find something else or think more to get closer to my answer. Going out in public, taking part in conversation and observing people only makes me think about this further. I'm also an HSP, so most of the situations I find myself thinking about don't manifest in positivity. More often than not, daily life only gives me more questions that I can't seem to answer. This process occurs until I find myself back at the original question of "Who am I?". And this loop (intentional word use) is causing a lot of mental exhaustion. I probably could have learned a new language or done something more meaningful with the time I've spent pondering this. I spend months on four letters while others improve humanity every day and try to keep the world from breaking apart at the seams.\n\n\*This sounds a lot like OCD now that I am reading it over\*\n\nOn a more personal note: I am currently in a transitionary period in my life and do not know who I am or what I would do with that information if I knew who I was. I am feeling increasingly depressed because I am losing a sense of direction by looking too much into myself. My inability to come to a conclusive decision is making me feel anxious and uncertain. If I do not know my "type" or how I act among myself and others, I feel aimless and do not have something to look to; like i'm walking blindfolded in a world full of people who have managed to take theirs off and pity the people who haven't removed theirs.  I feel disconnected and avoid people, justifying this behavior by telling myself things like "It's because I know too much" or "All these people are going to hurt me emotionally", "They say one thing and do another", "You can't trust them". **I understand that such an answer is not required in my life or the life of others, but I feel this information is necessary for me to unlock my potential and produce some feeling of closure/rest**. The first step (concluding my "type"), however, has served as a roadblock to being "me" (despite not knowing what that is). I feel like I could move forward without four letters or stupid enneagram numbers, but my need to know has been an itch that i'm trying to scratch.\n\nIn conclusion: I would really appreciate it if anyone with some MBTI magic can dissect this post and produce some sort of answer (whether it be INTJ, INTP, INFJ or INFP). Feel free to ask questions if you think they will yield an answer. You are all very insightful people and I am always surprised by how much you all know about typology.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\*EDIT: added some related information on cognitive functions\*
3	This might be a close one. I'll address the most obvious culprit. J/P. J's prefer structure and organizing thoughts. P's tend to be more creative and uninhibited. But both are deep thinkers.
1	It sounds exactly like INFJ in Ni-Ti loop.
1	just say youre infx, honestly, the dichotomy system is a gradient, so i have no problems with people who dont clearly lean to one side\n\nbut trust is an issue for both infps and infjs
105	What‚Äôs the worst thing you could say to an INFJ?	I‚Äôm taking the idea from r/INTP, and I‚Äôll start:\n\n‚ÄúYou need to realize that anything could happen, it‚Äôs like you don‚Äôt even care about others with that know-it-all attitude of yours.‚Äù
112	Not sure if our friends are going to make it tonight, but they said if they can they might bring a few new folks along for the party. Apparently, they love political debates and beer? but one of them is vegan...that's all I know, but sounds like fun, right Hon? Oh, and they thought you might like to watch the kids a little bit during, since our friends already warned them you may not be in the mood for the political debates. Isn't that thoughtful? \n\nHey, is that the phone? Could you get it, it might be them, I gotta run to the store real quick. 
65	"Everyone you care about doesn't really like or respect you, and we're all just pretending to tolerate you."
123	"INFJ, mind getting up in front of the room and giving a quick update on your work?"
171	Just fake it 'til you make it \n\nJust don't think about it \n\nYou're so serious\n\nWhy are you so quiet? 
52	Why are you so quiet? 
100	The worst thing you could say to me is... nothing really. Like just keeping quiet or straight up ignoring me when I ask a question, give my opinion or provide a suggestion. 
87	"I know you better than you know yourself."\n\n Me in my head "you know what I let you know, don't get cocky."
40	"We'll cross that bridge when we come to it."
98	I HATE the word "maybe" like if I ask someone if they want to do something and they say maybe....\n\nTells me nothing and makes planning for the future difficult. \n\nTELL ME YES OR NO. 
64	"Sometimes, you just have to do what you have to do, no matter how little sense it makes."\n\nAlso: "Don't question it. That's how it's always been."
30	Why? *Because it always has been like this*\n\n
38	"Grow a thicker skin" because crying at work. After 40 hours a week of constant verbal abuse  for YEARS, it warps you as a person.
26	‚ÄúLet‚Äôs all go around the room and introduce ourselves. INFJ, you can go first‚Äù
75	"Oh by the way, I've invited some friends to join us for dinner, you're going to love them!"
25	"You worry too much!"\n\n... yeah, thanks for making my anxiety worse üôÑ
24	‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not very observant huh?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about it‚Äù
50	"You're really selfish/ you must not care about others"\n\n"You're pretty oblivious"\n\n"You're annoying"\n\n"It's not a big deal"\n\n"You're too emotional"
23	"You decide..."\n\nNo, please! I have to think of so many variables and I don't want to choose something and not be sure if the person actually wants that too... Aaargh
19	"Just trust me."  - I hate that one.  It means I definitely can't trust you.   I liked you a second ago.  Now, not so much.  
21	"You are too sensitive"\n\n"Why you make things complicated?"\n\n"Why you worry about this?"\n\n"You're so quiet. Are you ok?"
17	‚ÄúJust say it!‚Äù  While I‚Äôm trying to think of the right way to phrase something 
15	"You're so fake, you compliment people for opposite traits"\n\nIs it my fault that I can see the good side to most things?\n\nAlso "you're too sensitive".
13	‚ÄúAll you care about is yourself.‚Äù\n\nCue spontaneous combustion.
29	From my Ex- ESTJ "You hate people, you hate everyone"\n\n....No, I just see what people really are, and I don't want to associate with them, unlike you who needs everyone to stroke your ego. 
12	"Way to go buddy". Like how dare you!
14	I'm pretty jaded with people and the world so not much makes me mad anymore.  I've learned that being mad is just wasted energy that I would rather be using on something else.   But if I had to pick it wouldn't be any specific thing but the tone of how something is said.  I can't stand a bullying or condescending tone.  I have a boss right now that I'm about to snap back at if she won't stop speaking to her employees like pee-ons.   
12	Honestly? The worst thing to say would be "you are too much." Guaranteed to have me never talk to you about anything ever again.
12	"Chill out. You're problems aren't so bad. There are kids in Africa who have it much worse than you."\n\n"Why don't you think about yourself for a while. You're always putting others first"\n\n"I love you"... "Aren't you going to say it back? Don't you love me?"\n\n"You're so smart. You've GOT to meet my friend Mark. You two would get along soooo well."\n\n"That sounds like a good idea, but it's so much work. I can't devote that much time to your thing."\n\n"I hate (thing I love) it just doesn't make sense"
10	Feelings are not facts
9	Thanks, I hate every single comment here
9	*2 hours before event*\n\n‚ÄúSo are you still doing that event thingy? I forgot to ask my parents, so I won‚Äôt be coming- but I hope you guys have fun!‚Äù\n\n*followed by other people cancelling for the stupidest reasons*\n\nYou really can‚Äôt make plans when people just don‚Äôt care!  This has happened countless times! My friends can‚Äôt even meet if I don‚Äôt take the initiative to make plans!! It already takes so much energy for me to show up as is!!!\n\n
7	"I am not lying."\n\n(Even though every fiber of your intuitive being says otherwise)
9	"It doesn't matter how you feel."
8	My ex-boyfriend (ENTP) would always tell me:\n\n*"Why you always try to find a significant meaning on everything? You have to know that not everything you perceive as deep is deep".*
8	For me... I can‚Äôt think of worst thing to say as everyone‚Äôs already mentioned it. But I will say that if you look at me with any form of Judgment I will cut you out so fast you won‚Äôt even know I ever existed. Work with someone who did this and I despise every minute I‚Äôm forced to spend with them. Doesn‚Äôt help that they coupled it with ‚ÄúYou are such a nerd.‚Äù With no sarcasm or joking tone. They called me a nerd like it was god damn 1985 and I should be insulted.... being a nerd has been cool for AT LEAST 15 YEARS! But hearing it like that gave me ptsd. ~alright I‚Äôm empty~ needed to let go of that. :P \n\nTLDR; Don‚Äôt make fun of us.
8	Why dont you just listen to me!\n\n*me internally: are you fucking shitting me right now? I know your entire history by heart and I can predict what you're guna do before you even do it. But right now you're behaving like a petulent child so no I will not listen to you, you're driving me insane!"*\n\nMe out loud: ok I'm sorry
8	"Yeah, all what you have done isn't really what we need. It's going to the trash can"
6	"Your insights aren't helpful."
5	"Is it cool if I bring the baby I'm watching on our double date?"\n\nThis actually happened to me. It was not cool.
5	You're ordinary. 
6	"why don't you talk?" \nI talk just not to you \n
22	‚ÄúStop thinking so much.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúJust pretend.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúDon‚Äôt trust your intuition.‚Äù
4	You‚Äôre too sensitive (to noise, stimulation, etc). That hurts because I can‚Äôt control it. I can handle it for awhile but I start to lose it if I can‚Äôt leave the situation. We used to live next to a couple that had 4 kids who had no bedtimes, rules or discipline and I would get so moody because I couldn‚Äôt make them quiet down. My husband (ENFP) was fine with them. So we moved and I am so much happier!
5	You're being rude\n\nI've invited some more people, I hope you don't mind\n\nThis has to be done quickly, get to it\n\n\n\n\n
6	--------\n\nYou're stupid\n\nYou're lazy\n\nYou're not doing enough, not trying hard enough\n\nI don't want to talk to you anymore\n\nI wish I never met you\n\n--------\n\nUgh I'm sensitive OK 
5	"Unlike you, I think about stuff before I say it."\n\nSaid during a heated argument I had with a family member. Just because you and I didn't reach the same conclusion doesn't mean I didnt think about it thoroughly before I verbalized it.
4	‚ÄúI don‚Äôt trust you‚Äù
3	‚ÄúRelax‚Äù\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôre too sensitive‚Äù
4	Nah I have to go for the *worst* not just something vexatious. I'll see what I can come up with.\n\n"I understand your despair, and I understand why, and I just don't care about your despair."\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey didn't mean it quite as tersely as that, but it sure came out rough.
5	When someone condescendingly asks me if I am okay it unleashes an inferno of anger deep within my soul. Sorry I am not visibly BURSTING with joy at every moment but I can assure you I am JUST FINE THANKS! 
3	"You just want to be babied."\n\n"You have a weak personality."\n\n"But that's not how the real world works."
5	I've lied to you this entire time
6	[after a long, meaningful conversation where I bared my soul]\n\nMe: So what about you?\n\nOther: Hm?\n\nMe: *tell me about your experiences*\n\nOther: Oh, I don't know, I don't really have any. I'm not very interesting. I'd rather just listen. I love listening to you.\n\nRinse\n\nRepeat\n\n*hollow relationship inevitably ends*
4	You think you‚Äôre really special but really no one else does. You‚Äôre a fucking know it all and you can‚Äôt take your own advice because you‚Äôre too weak and sensitive.
6	You never make any jokes.\n\nThat‚Äôs a weird idea...\n\nYou‚Äôre not trying hard enough.\n\nYou‚Äôre so boring.\n\nYou hurt me when you did/said that...\n\nCould you make a phone call to XXX?\n\n\n
3	Why don't you go out more?
3	You look sad. 
3	"_____ is better than _____."\n\nAs someone who has felt like I fit on the second blank, this sentence grates on me, especially if they're acting like their opinion is objective.
3	I am fine when you clearly are not. I dont trust your intentions. Why do you always read into everything?  Stop catastrophizing everything. It will just work out
3	[deleted]
3	‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just your imagination.‚Äù
3	You're a fake
3	"You're never there when I need you!" \n\n...even though, you know, I've previously been on the phone with them for several hours while I'm supposed to be working on a big assignment due the next day, or something. 
3	Yea, I tell people that I take maybe as no now. Like if you can‚Äôt give me a straight answer and commit then I can‚Äôt rely on you to say yes
3	Background context: once I worked for a brokerage firm as a stock analyst. We do weekly report on companies that we cover and monthly report for the sector as well. But there was a monthly conference call presentation that often presented by my boss/GM. \n\nThe fucked up: i was a new analyst with a minimum experience. I had just published 2 reports on bloomberg under my name. English is not my first language. Even though all the report were in english, I was not comfortable with my spoken english as I use my english passively (reading and writing report). One day, my boss and GM were so busy that they could not do the monthly conference call. Since my report was the latest report published ,my boss asked me to do an overseas phone call to USA,UK and Singapore to present my report to our affiliates. He wanted me to do it on the very same day he told me to do it, no preparation whatsoever. \n\nMy face turned WHITE. \n\nI ended up asked for a help from 3 of my colleagues who have more experience than me to sit together with me in the conference room and helped me answer all the question I could not answer. 10/10 not gonna do it again. 
3	Months of no substantive communication at work and suddenly, "Hey, we need to talk to you about your performance."
2	‚ÄúWe‚Äôve all been talking and we really don‚Äôt trust your motives and intentions‚Äù.
2	"Just go and enjoy yourself"\n\n"You're not prepared" (I thought about everything in minor detail for the last couple of weeks).
2	‚ÄúYou would never understand‚Äù \n
2	I‚Äôll quote my ex for you\n\n*Hugely disappointing, I thought you of all ppl would never be like this, some best friend you are, exactly like everyone else..*\n\n\nGot that message two weeks after she broke up with me, when she said she still wanted to be friends, and I replied that I‚Äôd try but that I would probably be completely broken for a while and not be able to take initiative in that time.\n\nShe got mad because I never messaged her, even though I explained two weeks earlier (because I knew she‚Äôd expect me to be the same way and would get mad if I didn‚Äôt) that I was literally too broken.
2	That's just the way it is.
2	"what do you want to eat"
2	Honk at me while driving and it will ruin my entire day\n\nYou look really uncomfortable \n\nWhich one do you want? (And not knowing which one they would want so you can choose the opposite)\n\nYou‚Äôre so _________. Insert literally any word and I will question what that statement meant until the day I die\n\nAll you do is laugh at everything \n\nAnything about being oblivious to what‚Äôs going on 
2	I realllllly hate being called a liar 
2	"I'll call you sometime this evening."
2	[A thought for INFJs when someone chooses to use our own sense of guilt against us.](https://pin.it/gatln646oxfhos) 
2	When you‚Äôre quietly enjoying the endless stream-of-thought vacation in your head and someone interrupts just to fill up the quiet with mindless noise because they can‚Äôt stand the silence. 
2	‚ÄúYou‚Äôre too hard on yourself‚Äù. I expect perfection of myself knowing full well that it is not attainable. I believe they call this insanity. Yep, people just don‚Äôt get my brand of crazy 
2	I can relate to so many of these posts! #MyTribe ‚ù§Ô∏è
2	When a significant other says "I'm fine." When I know damn good well you're not. I am I'm going to figure it out and fix it or die trying.
1	Yea it‚Äôs difficult dealing with perfectionism.\n\nYea most of my friends think it‚Äôs boring and don‚Äôt get the appeal, which I understand but still like it‚Äôs so good. They get to season 2 and quit
1	Could you link the post from r/INTP?
1	Dude you‚Äôre such an asshole. You never talk 
1	"You're thinking too much"
1	‚ÄúThat shirt doesn‚Äôt really look good on you‚Äù or something really insignificant that isn‚Äôt really bad but is negative. That single comment is going to be the only thing I can think about the next four days and completely change my clothing style.\n\n\nThis can go the opposite as well, and that‚Äôs probably the best thing ever
1	don't stress it - it's no big deal. 
1	- calm down\n- you're being selfish\n- get over it\n
1	You don‚Äôt care\n\nJust let it go\n\nLet‚Äôs play it by ear/we‚Äôll see\n\nStop worrying\n\nYou‚Äôre so quiet\n\nOkay, let‚Äôs break up into groups\n\ntheredbirdchase, do you mind jumping in here?\n\nCan we talk/I need to talk to you
1	"I can't stand being around you."  I think this one would make me go running off a tall building.  
1	It takes two to tango\n\nCan you give me a ride?\n\nYou're so quiet!\n\nNo pun intended
1	Not right now, but it could happen down the road. 
1	You're so sensitive\n\nSmile more\n\nTalk more\n\n
1	You think too much \n\nSaid to me from my parents 
1	‚ÄúI expect you to stop doing what you are passionate about, and look after my needs instead‚Äù ( queue end of the relationship) 
1	Your start OP really doesn‚Äôt bother me. I‚Äôm not sure what your purpose is which makes me laugh (in a good way). Sorry this just wasn‚Äôt offensive in the slightest. Perhaps it‚Äôs cause I‚Äôm an INFJ that can detach some... I don‚Äôt know - a little worried now üòÇ. Should this bother me?\nI‚Äôll be happy to aid in your experiment as I feel I‚Äôm walking into a roast. This should at least be entertaining and perhaps if something bothers me maybe I can figure out why so no harm done; only learning. Give it your best shot OP And redditors xoxo. I promise that even if I take offense to your offense I won‚Äôt react offensively although I may express a point to correct you some lmao!!!\n\n\nEdit: it bothers me when I hear other INFJs being told these things. Bothers me a lot! 
1	*You don't know what you are talking about.*
1	My pet peeves. \n\n"Don't think about tomorrow or even a year from now. Just live for the moment."\n\n"You are too sensitive. Why do you have to overthink about everything? Just relax and stop being so serious."\n\n"Stop being so serious. Go with the flow"\n\n"Life's about taking risks, big or small."\n\n"We will get to that when the issue comes. Stop trying to find solutions for everything."\n\n"You are too stubborn and self righteous."\n\n"Why can't you just let things go?"\n\n"You overcomplicate everything."\n\n"You simplify everything."\n\n"Why are you so shy? You need to get out more"\n\n"Why are you so quiet?"\n\n\nJust want to clarify there's actually a lot of truth to what people are saying in the above. INFJs are notorious for being stubborn and self righteous when they are fiercely passionate about the morality of what they are defending. I'm also extremely introverted even for most INFJs I hardly have a social life and don't really have anyone I can call my close true friends. 99 percent of the time I am alone even as I feel lonely. INFJs are also known to be perfectionists and although it's important to know how to live in the moment, I find it's pretty impossible for me to do that. When people look down on the fact that I HAVE to think about the future and the impact everything makes no matter how small, it irritates me. I am future oriented to the core and nothing will ever change that. 
1	I‚Äôm late to the party but figured I‚Äôd give it a go.\n\nThe worst thing for an INFJ to hear is comparable to other NF‚Äôs‚Äî‚Äúyou‚Äôre inauthentic/fake/insincere, empathetic/sympathetic/a bad listener/don‚Äôt even try to understand people, and evil/immoral/callously negligent/abusive/malevolent.\n\nSpecifically hitting their inferior function‚ÄîeS, which is like the landfill of the psyche (fears, projections, worries, etc.). So telling an INFJ ‚Äî ‚Äúyou manipulate people like tools, are simply an overindulgent shallow charlatan that cares more about being heard/social-impact than having anything worth hearing to say.\n\n\n 
1	Being critiqued by someone you don't respect or whose opinion you do not value.\n\n\nMy reaction: nothing. Total silence, I'd hate to have conflict. I go back to what I was doing and pretend the awkward silence didn't happen. Continue to be polite and cordial with the person who critiqued me after having a moment to chill my thoughts.\n\n\nMy mind in the moment:\nLike I know the secret depths of your soul Susan how dare you say I loaded the dishwasher incorrectly. You have no idea who I even am SUSAN. Your simple mind is laughable in comparison to my infinite wisdom on dishwasher loading. Don't you know I've spent 13.47 hours of my life contemplating these matters! The proper form and most efficient dishwasher loading is not your strong suit clearly. And while you simply place the dishes I happen to do so in a calculated manner while SIMULTANEOUSLY arguing world peace with very important imaginary people. Oh and I'm winning the argument because I'm clearly better than you. I hypothetically saved humanity, you're welcome Susan! How dare you question my well thought out skill?\n\n\nMy mind a few hours later: \nWow what an overreaction, I'm psycho. But I still can't stand Susan. lol\n\n\nIt's good I usually keep these thoughts to myself. How embarrassing lol. I hope this makes sense to other INFJs.

1	"What are you thinking about?" - hmm...about that..
1	That we‚Äôre Fake. Liars. Cheaters. Anything to point out any immorality we may have that we sternly are morally against. \n\nFor example...my husband and I were long distance for 10 months. Across the country in the US from each other. He suspected at some point that I might be cheating (he‚Äôd been cheated on a lot, but that was no excuse to project onto me) and I was extremely livid and hurt that anyone would see me that way. I was extremely taken back and confused...until I found out he‚Äôd been cheated on in every relationship but ours. Understanding to me is the key to success as an INFJ. \n\nIf we dare to understand those we know, we forgive much easier for their faults or immoralities. We can be a bit judgey I‚Äôll admit, though it‚Äôs always in good faith to us.

1	The dreaded, ambiguous ‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard a lot about you.‚Äù
1	"You over think. You should stop." \n\nI admit I do, I'm trying to fix it because it is a problem but to say that after I addressed a problem in our relationship and they think I'm pulling this out of thin air. No I didn't, I thought this through and through, our history, yours, mine and our present situation. No dip sherlock I had my doubt before I sent this, analyzing myself and looking throughly in our dilemma if my intuition is true. I was certain the friendship between us was unbalanced, I was an open ear to your woes, your cheerleader in passions such as art and your friend during tough patches but when it came to me doing that exact same, sharing my personal life or daily excitements, something I absolutely don't do to just anyone, I was met with a muted response. At times a jealous or careless reply. I hate that so much. I care so much about us I had to bring it up so our relationship doesn't wither like all other friendships you've or I had dammit. I tell you solid advice and you virtually send back a two worded response and I feel let down..
1	* gives an INFJ a look that says I either didn't understand what they were saying or didn't appreciate it and that I think they are from a completely different planet [and probably an icky one which I don't want to visit] but I'm too polite to say it  *

1	Rubbing your mistakes in your face during times of high stress and low confidence. Most of my friends know I'm very harsh on myself and know better than to try to rebuke me when I'm freaking out, but I have one that insists on reminding me of how any given stressful situation is 100% my own fault and how I should have listened to him about unrelated things years ago and stuff. My other friends don't do this because they know it will throw me into that "omg, I'm the worst human being imaginable" spiral and do absolutely no good whatsoever, but he just insists on doing things his way. Irony is, I'm pretty sure he's quoted Einstein's definition of insanity to me before. He's typically a good friend, but I've learned to avoid talking to him when I'm upset.
1	Me: Hi! i‚Äôm already outside the party and you?\n\n\nFriend: oh, I‚Äôll be late, I‚Äôm having dinner with some friends but you can go in now and I‚Äôll be there in about 45 minutes! \n\n\nMe: üòµ ( debating between standing alone at night on the street or going into a bunch of  strangers)

9	Anyone else in the middle ground between INFJ and ENFJ?	I scored INFJ by a narrow margin and I feel I‚Äôm more ambiverted than anything. Like I hate hate talking aloud for EVERYONE to hear (a nightmare talking to a whole class, crowd) BUT I enjoy talking to smaller groups. Like interviews and meeting new people, I am very cheerful and can talk nonstop even to people I don‚Äôt know much. 
10	Like Jualkyn said, you're either one or the other.\nYou mention you hate talking aloud for everyone, but that could simply be a sign of shyness. There are introverts who have no problem with public speaking , and that doesn't make them any less of an introvert. It's where you get your energy from!\n\nAnother difference between the two can be found in cognitive functions (which a lot of people use for typing, but it's not required). ENFJ's lead with Fe, meaning they highly value group harmony. INFJ's lead with Ni, which relates to how they gather information. For a VERY simple explanation, an ENFJ would be "lost" without being able to help others, whereas INFJ's would be "lost" if they were unable to relate their information. (Badly explained...but that's kind of the jist of it).
2	that's Fe in an introvert. you're unlikely to be ENFJ. ENFJ would have very little problem talking to a group of any size at any given moment imo.
1	The only way that you're an ambivert is if you're talking in relation to cognitive functions. Everyone has an equal number of introverted and extroverted functions. In that sense, everyone is an ambivert. But for all intents and purposes, you're either one or the other, as others have explained.
1	You might test one or the other but the functions change the dynamics of their expression. Meaning, its not one thing, its everything, INFJ and ENFJ are very different. Just check out their functions and see which applies to you more.
1	I am. I‚Äôll consistently test as an INFJ or another introverted type, but I could be misjudging myself in some way.\n\n I like my alone time, but have a hard time motivating myself to work by myself. My office allows us to telework at least twice a week, but I prefer to be in the office, and hate the idea of working in an empty room by myself.\n\nAlso, I don‚Äôt typically socialize with my coworkers, but I enjoy running meetings.
1	Your either one or the other. There are ambiverted people but they still will lean towards one or the other. \n\nThe quickest way to tell is how do you like to be at your natural state 99 percent of the time and do you gain energy by being surrounded by people or social activities ? Or do you charge while you are alone ? This should answer your question. \n\nIt also changes with age. When I was younger I was super extroverted or at least more than now. But as puberty hit and then adulthood, I knew at my core I truly am an introvert. 
0	You can be on the border between the two types, they both have completely different cognitive functions. Get informed on the subject. 
8	INFJ and Covert Narcissism?	So, it's been a while since I've made a post about covert narcissism, and as strange it is for the idea of an INFJ being a narcissist, because we're usually made out to be extremely empathetic, highly sensitive ect; I know the main reason an INFJ could be one, are symptoms of BPD, but I mean strictly Covert Narcissistic traits. \n\nWhat do you think a narcissistic INFJ would look and act like?
4	Covert narcissism¬†is a more discrete form of¬†narcissism¬†displayed by a person with a more shy and reserved personality. It's characterized by grandiose fantasies and thoughts, a perception of entitlement, and a general sentiment of being better than others. \n\nWe all have narcissistic traits to some degree or another. There's a difference in traits and the disorder.\n\nMy experience with them is they are all cookie cutter. The same tactics just different theatrics. The same goals. The same ego...etc. \n\nSpeaking of ego. Our narcissistic traits all stem from ego. Everyone has ego to a degree too. I think the difference is your motives. Do you really want to build others up or tear them down? Everyone with NPD regardless of covert or overt have the same soul stealing destruction desire as the other.\n\nConsidering, there is no real self with NPD. I think it would be impossible for one to be of any MBTI archetype.
2	INFJs are kind of grandiose and chameleon-like in nature - we have that oft-hidden Se which makes us a little sensory and impulsive. I think many of us romanticize our own lives through our imaginations, too. We can be kind of Quixotic. Kind of...\n\n"I don't want realism. I want magic! Yes, yes, magic! I try to give that to people. I misrepresent things to them. I don't tell the truth, I tell what ought to be the truth. And it that's sinful, then let me be damned for it!"\n\nSo are INFJs covert narcissists? I think a lot of them are, yes, in varying degrees. Some see this in themselves and actively try to get better. Others run away with their entitlement under the excuse that they're "naturally empathetic" or "fundamentally good". Every type needs self crit, though, and INFJs are not the only narcissists in the world. No one type is strictly narcissistic. 
1	i'm diagnosed BPD and am an INFJ and have also struggled with experiencing (sometimes alarming) traits of narcissism! this is all rather interesting that you put the 3 together
1	Hitler did nothing wrong.
0	From my personal experience I have this "covert narcisstic traits" but it's always lurking in the shadows so I don't use it always but sometimes i will  rage mostly because I consider my own self critical talk more valuable than obvious clues told by others, like I already know it and am more critical about myself than about others, so no need to tell me what i already know.\n\nKeep in mind im infj/infp so it can affect it largely, infp's tends to be overly critical and emotional sometimes. (especially when internal values threatened)
12	INFP to INFJ	I was in a conversation with a friend the other day about MBTI and the types. We were exchanging our types and ideas on them. My friend looked at me with a puzzled looked and told me he found me to be more of an INFJ than INFP. I wanted to prove to him that FP is where I have sat pretty for quite some time now so I decided to take the test again.. To my surprise the results were INFJ. My eyes were wide when I read this and of course my ENFP friend over here laughed and sipped his coffee, pleased with my results and himself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo you guys think its common for people of these types to bounce back and forth so to say when it come to that last function?
10	There are many interpretations of MBTI from various schools of thought, but in general, the MBTI testing instrument is used only as a starting point of analysis that suggests what types you could potentially be by narrowing down options - the test itself is never the final answer.\n\nINFJ and INFP individuals may resemble each other on the surface (both are people-oriented, etc.), which is why the MBTI instrument is unable to reliably distinguish between the two consistently. Therefore, it's not that your J vs. P type has changed, it's just that the test is imperfect.\n\nIn other words, if you're familiar enough with the theory behind MBTI and you have sufficient evidence that suggest you are INFP and not INFJ, then you are INFP regardless of the test results.
4	It depends on how deep you want to get into MBTI. If you're only looking at it as a hobby, there's no harm, type yourself however you want!\n\nBut if you're looking for a more in-depth analysis, a lot of people reccommend reading about the cognitive functions. They go deeper into MBTI, and explain more how each type works and how they think. Obviously, you don't have to use cognitive functions - it's a personal opinion! Neither letters or functions are "better". But by looking into functions, it can help you decide which one fits you better.\n\nINFP's two most influential functions are Fi (values authenticity), Ne (gets inspiration from the outside world) and INFJs have Fe (Values group harmony) and Ni (Information is spread out yet can be joined). These are very bad descriptions, and there are more functions. It's just something you could think about!\n\nSo to answer your question, if you're only going off letters, it's pretty common. - But they're actually quite different. :)
2	I have had the same experience with Myers Briggs and it is possible to assimilate between J and P. I am an INFP who is at times, an INFJ
2	Yes! I feel like it does change for a lot of people. Or rather it‚Äôs more tricky to decipher. But my instant cue of knowing whether someone is INFJ vs INFP is to ask them if they make lists and need structure. If they are the type to say they don‚Äôt make lists and prefer to just go with the flow, than I‚Äôm definitely talking to a INFP. If they need lists and to plan out their future. Than I‚Äôm most likely talking to a INFJ. INFJs like to have plans. INFPs are more of free spirits. The two are almost like identical twins, but there‚Äôs where you can spot the difference.
1	Unfortunately no. INFP and INFJ have completely different functions. Although, outwardly they may appear similar the way they‚Äôre situated on the functional stack.\n\nINFP = Fi Ne Si Te\n\nINFJ = Ni Fe Ti Se\n\nWhen I first got into MBTI, I got both results. After reading into each type, my friend convinced me that I was INFP due to my rose-colored glasses nature at the time. I went with it, but soon discovered he was completely wrong. The way you answer the questions can change your outcome, but that doesn‚Äôt change your personality. People tend to have preferences, some stronger than others.\n\nWhat I suggest is actually studying all 8 functions and how they interact with each other. I‚Äôm not saying your friend is wrong, but you have the best understanding of yourself. Through MBTI, I discovered the kind of person I truly am and why I behave the ways that I do. It all made sense to me once I discovered my actual type.
1	Functions evolve with age, maybe you tricked an older test into thinking one of your primary functions was a lesser function or the other way around. It depends on how old you are, ut youare always one personnality, it's just that in certain points of life, this underdeveloped personnality could look like another mature pereonnality, probably like in your case.
1	I'm in the exact same boat as you, actually (my F and P are only ever apart by, like, four percent). I sort of found it that questions on the MBTI and sites like 16Personalities have general questions that might change depending on what your mood was at the time of taking it... at the same time, it depends on how deeply you really want to look into it. Your own personality is too complex to be put into such a subgroup. I have *traits* and *mannerisms* from both, but I feel as though INFJ suits me best, and that's what I go with, personally.
1	Yep! 1st time I tested I was infj. I've tested like 6x over the past 8 years and flip flopped between INFJ and infp even though I am an infj. Test is imperfect. Consider it an educated guess for you to fill in the blanks with.
1	Omg now that you are INFJ you can prove that MB types are not permanent that your brain can just one day whoop and flip around and put preference on completely different set of cognitive functions! Easy! You might even get a Novel prize I'm not sure in what category though...
5	I've got a question for INFJs	ENTP here, I got a question for the INFJs (or NI doms in general, but I thought I'd ask this sub first). I've been thinking about something, lately, and I haven't been able to find a satisfying answer looking on mbti related pages so... \n\nHere it is: What exactly is Ni and what are its practical uses? People talk about it as a "sixth sense" or something of that sort, but I don't see how that could be at the core of someone's cognitive process, I just can't understand it.\n\nCould someone explain Ni to me in a practical way? \nThanks :)
10	Ni is more like a perspective, just one with a particular orientation.  Objective Se data is subconsciously being gathered and organized into a subjective arrangement of relationships and connections. When additional data or information is collected, it's added to the web of connections, expanding it and improving the accuracy. Often, INXJs have a subconscious drive of finding a perfect perspective that is so all-encompassing that it can account for everything in the universe fitting together in a way that makes sense. That's why they often flock to philosophy, science, spirituality, or religious systems.  Basically, Ni doms are taking objective data and giving it subjective meaning based on context and drawing conclusions based on that. A Ni-dom's insight is only going to be as good as the data they're working from and how well it's been tested and they can trust it.\n\nNi-doms have it hard that their dominant function is completely subconscious, so it's very hard to explain to other people.  I like to think of Ne doms as "out of the box" thinkers. Your ideas branch and go in every which way, compounding possibilities. Ni-doms are more "in the box" thinkers, meaning it's often more interesting for them to take what exists and spin it in new ways and directions to create novel ways to look at things which open up a greater understanding, insights, and observations of a problem. Ni doms are very aware of how context changes meaning and the relationship between ideas. However, everything is connected by their own strings of understanding. So if they have bad information, they can make faulty assumptions.\n\nUnlike ENTPs, INFJs ideas can be personal. If someone criticizes an ENTP's point of view, your Ti will simply see if what the person said  made sense or not, and simply adjust. It takes a lot longer for an INFJ to simply adjust, because it means subconsciously resetting the connections of what they know, and that takes a lot of time and effort. Often the thing that is most sensitive is the idea they are basing their master perspective on that orients the meaning of all their connections. If this is a religion, and someone says, "religion is stupid and nonsensical and riddled with factual inconsistency and has no point", that INFJ might get offended because you are insulting the lens through which they view their cognitive web of information, and actually, even their whole idea of how the world works. That's not to say they can't adjust, we also use the same logic ENTPs do, it's just that it has to go at the INFJ's own pace as they test their system for inconsistencies against the new point of view you just gave them.
2	Cognitive functions orient individuals to a particular aspect of reality. Ni is a cognitive function that focuses on information about how things are related to each other. These relationships inform Ni about the underlying meaning of an object/event/person. \n\nFor Ni doms, they take this as their main approach to life and apply it to all objects/events/people in their life including themselves, which is why they naturally tend to seek a sense of direction, purpose or deeper meaning in life, etc. The reason they do this is because they feel (unconsciously) insecure of inferior Se, which orients the individual to how the world is constantly changing and "messy." Thus the Ni dom is motivated to extract some purpose in life as a defense against what they perceive as a meaningless existence. (The conflict between Ni and Se is often summarized as the conflict between the timeless and the changing).\n\nNi is "practical" in the sense that it is future-oriented, able to achieve long-term goals and eliminate distractions that don't directly serve their long-term vision. But like all other functions Ni has weaknesses if overused, and if it gets too disconnected from Se it may: become too isolated from the external world, become too serious and unable to enjoy life, express unhealthy perfectionist attitudes, become cynical and judge other people as "superficial," etc.\n\nFor most people (including me tbh), Ni operates unconsciously, and so Ni doms are maybe unaware of the process and thus call it a "sixth sense" instead. By unconscious I mean I'm unaware of where my intuitions (about people for instance) may have come from, and I have difficulty verbalizing my thought process. But I am working on improving that :)
1	I doubt anyone can really explain what Ni is or how it works in terms of how they arrive at an answer. It is related to "insight". It processes ideas the bigger picture (macro), and makes it comprehensive. Something that would be too tedious for you to figure out consciously, so the brain figures it out unconsciously, and the answer just comes to you, like a flash of lightning "Eureka!". Perhaps thats why INFJ seem old souls, because it may seem that they just "know" things, without really learning it.
13	INFJ Male Romance Preferences	What MBTI type, or personality characteristics have INFJ dudes found most satisfying in a romantic relationship? I did not find ENFJ quite as fulfilling as some seem to think.
20	Haven't really discussed MBTI with partners so I never knew theirs. \n\nAs far as characteristics go: Kindness to everyone and respecting others even though they may not deserve it. A sort of wide eyed wonder about the world and the ability to appreciate small everyday beauty. Having a passionate interest in some hobby or idea that is very important to them. Honesty.
14	My crush is an INFJ, and the reason I like her is because she always makes me feel good. She never fails to make me laugh, always takes care of her friends, and has a really good understanding of others.\n\n\nWe recently watched La La Land together, which is my favourite movie, and I pretty much always cry at the end. Before we started, she said that the only movie that made her cry was when she watched Titanic when she was 8, and she probably wouldn‚Äôt get that emotional. \n\n\n(I really don‚Äôt want to spoil the end because it‚Äôs such a good movie and I recommend everyone go watch it as soon as they can (preferably with someone they‚Äôre close to).\n\n\nTowards the end I pretty much only looked at her because I wanted to see how she reacts to it (and I think she‚Äôs really pretty so that‚Äôs a bonus). She was definitely crying. A lot. Then when Seb and Mia (the two main characters) looked at each other the final time she was so upset that she was almost screaming that it couldn‚Äôt end like that. We cried for about ten minutes (I was laughing while crying because her reaction was really funny and the movie was sad).\n\n\nThe next day was pretty bad for me, and I felt terrible. I checked her story on snap from the day before, and apparently she filmed me when I played Mia and Seb‚Äôs theme on piano and it made her cry. Seeing this instantly made me cry again, and made me extremely happy. I love how genuine she is. I also love La La Land, but that‚Äôs not important right now. (Seriously, go watch it)
11	Personally I go for INFJs or ENFPs personally. I like the contrast with ENFP but I also love the understanding from INFJ
5	Only 2 that I've known their MBTI type. One was ENFJ. Lord let me tell ya! Way too over the top for me. Extroverted people are great in micro doses for me.\n\nThe one I'm with now is INFJ. She's been the most lovely of them all. We're far from perfect. So far though, this has been the best and most confusing relationship ever.  As far as I'm concerned, she's my preferred type. Like who I've been looking for seems like my whole life.\n\nIf this all doesn't work out. Guarantee, there will never ever be another extrovert in my future.
4	ENFJs are great, but have some "my way or the highway" qualities from my experience that conflicted with my own preferences (since we are both judging types). I've had the best connection with ENFPs. I like their positive energy, open-mindedness, and the way they see the world.\n\nFull disclosure: I'm basing this on a small number of experiences, but in reading about their types, my conclusions check out to me.
2	This is going to be off in left field, but I often find myself attracted to ESFP's. IDK why. I think it is because they are even easier to have quick connections with then ENFPs. Now i don't think ESFP is ideal, unless both have grown up. The only thing that make an ESFP grow up enough for an INFJ is if they become parents. Otherwise. No Rules, No boundries. Not At All great long term. But they get a bad wrap, but some of the most caring people i know are esfp females. I've Found INTJ females are either cruel and have incredibly high expectations, almost superficial, from a man, because as a female they were able to do it, and any dependence on them will surely cause them to slowly hate you. I think the INTJ/INFJ thing work better if female is infj. 
1	I'm very curious; why were your encounters with ENFJs not fulfilling?

1	INTJ, partners in crime
1	Personal Preferences:\n\nINTJs - The high level intellectual growth doesn't seem to slow down but accelerate. Intellectually passionate. Independent.\n\nINFPs - Idealistic and from a different place, somewhere internal and deep. Artistically creative in a way that I admire: Writing style. Deeply caring yet independent.\n\nPersonal Dislikes:\n\nA possible ESTP but that might be unfair to ESTPs as this person truly has a PD: NPD. I know/knew a couple of egomaniacs but I never got close enough to know if it was full on NPD. It took me two months to confirm it wasn't me being unreasonable then I watched and studied for another month before getting the hell out. I'll admit that I can be vain regarding biological traits we value for typically good reasons yet some of those surface traits are quite fleeting as time passes. She was incredibly intelligent as well and I let my better judgement fall away and move towards the trap of hoping for change because of: beauty + intelligence. Narcissists don't typically phase me but it is because I don't let them anywhere near me, here I failed to let my intuition drive and my lower brain functions took over with regards to gene propagation. AKA, take this with a grain of salt as I was to blame, I knew better.
1	I haven't felt truly attracted to another person in years. It feels like I've lost that side of me.\n\nIn general I like a partner who doesn't try too hard, is kind, & conscientious of herself and her actions.\n\nI'm not really hard to please, but I just don't find people I'm attracted to anymore. I wonder why frequently. Any other INFJs share this feeling?
1	Personally, INTJs. Unfortunately, INTJ females are the rarest type/gender combination. I love how logical and responsible they usually are, and I feel their logical, almost robotic way of going about things and my manic emotions and ideals balance each other out really well. No one brings out the best in me like a INTJ. At least, so long as they do acknowledge the importance of my FE.
1	Signs of an INFJ	Recently I have come to be believe that it is possible I am an INFJ. What are some of the signs in someone that is INFJ? I want to see if I can spot them in myself to either confirm or deny my theory.
21	I‚Äôve taken many different personality tests lately, as well as done some research of my own on what makes an INFJ. It would seem that I am an INFJ myself, however I am sceptical to latch onto this typing since I know INFJ are infamously difficult to type (or is given as an incorrect type).  \n\nI would say the most key feature of mine that screams ‚ÄúINFJ‚Äù is my unwavering feelings of separation from the world.  Not isolation, but like I‚Äôm stuck on the other side of a veil.  I‚Äôm able to interact with people, but never quite able to connect with anyone profoundly.  Sure everyone feels they aren‚Äôt always understood but through my research and experience, I would say that feeling  inescapably ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù is one of the most prominent INFJ qualities.   It‚Äôs not always an obvious feeling, but one that can never quite be ignored.
5	You get random inklings into things. Your most prominent thoughts seem like intuitive guesses. Some are more true and fixed in reality than others. Depends what you‚Äôre doing. For example, if you‚Äôre focused on a task that is very logical, the ‚Äòleaps‚Äô aren‚Äôt quite as noticeable. Other times you come up with things that *could* be true, or half-truths. \n\nOne of our knacks is picking up small bits of information that allow us to know larger phenomena, and tripping people out by knowing them.\n\nWe generally need to take time to process information to make decisions. Therefore we are mostly future oriented. However, sometimes we give in to spontaneous curiosity.
5	1. do you hate people and love them at the same time.\n2. are you constantly questioning "what am I doing here"\n3. are you a walking paradox.\n\nIf you answered yes to these, then you have increased your probability of being INFJ
8	I've now helped typing 5 people with these questions, please, answer them and I may help you:\n\n1. Do you consider yourself introverted yet you have random extroversion outbursts?  \n2. Can you feel/figure out that someone is sad/mad/not right without them telling you or being excessively obvious about it?  \n3. When talking to other people, have you ever figured out one of them was starting to be bored about what you were talking about (not by telling)?  \n4. Do you enjoy thinking about things that are theoretically possible?  \n5. Do you feel more confortable when you have any kind of plans for your day or week/do you dislike having those plans changed on short notice?
3	You wake up one morning and there's somebody in the mirror with a knife in one hand, long dark sleek hair covering their face, blood splatters on their worn, crumbled clothes. Instead of getting spooked you want to hear their life story.
1	Do you think it's possible to be INFJ, but have a very developed "outside" personality that I automatically use when talking with people? I am often typed as ENxP, but I sympathize with a lot of things that people here wrote. I have a tendency to tell people what is right for them, although I try to rarely act on it, because I know how annoying it is to people. I don't usually feel disconnected from reality in the present, but often when I think about my past memories I feel like I wasn't speaking my mind clearly enough.\nI don't like conflict and drama, but when I'm high on energy and confidence, I usually act ENxP and sometimes create small "fun" conflicts, that are just joking around. Though as soon as someone starts showing genuine feelings of exclusion/upsetness I am keen to stop myself very fast.\nI have no problem talking to people, even trying to express my emotions and feelings, but I feel like I never truly say everything. Like I'm always holding myself back, perhaps hiding the most negative ones, because I don't want people to think my intentions are wrong.\nCurrently, I'm dealing with an issue with an ESTJ friend, who absolutely drains my energy whenever I talk to him. He's ignorant, very full of himself, even though he doesn't really want to be an ass and I don't know how/when to explain my shit to him. As one other person said here, I basically just stay silent when I get annoyed. I am really trying to push through this, but I can't bring myself to start arguing when he needs shit to completely explained and repeated 50 times to be assured and then he goes into depression/anger, because he's hard on himself that he did something bad.
5	When needing time to process things, how do you go about it?	I have read a lot about INFJs needing time to process things before moving forward in a relationship (friendship or romantic) or making a decision about something. What exactly are you processing? Are you thinking about different outcomes or how depending on the choice you make how it could affect the future? Or could you need time to be open to the idea of something. \n\nJust curious to find out as I know a lot of INFJs and they sometimes say how they need time. While I don't understand the need for the time to process things, I do respect it. It would be nice to have some type of understanding though.
11	Imagine every little detail that you pick up on during a day, you write down onto a post it note. Pretty quickly there will be a lot of disorganisation or clutter and it makes it stressful to deal with as you don't feel in control or organised.\n\nSo downtime helps with categorising and sorting the post it notes into piles or groups and storing them away so that they can be easily found later on. Usually this means being left alone for a while and decompressing while doing something relaxing.\n\nWe tend to absorb more information then we can handle as we want to achieve so much that we burn ourselves out. We also try to look for every outcome for a situation and try to make the best outcome possible for all parties so everyone is happy.\n\nAlso failure is not an option for INFJs and they tend to be perfectionist which means high amounts of pressure on themselves as well as making sure that everything works out perfectly. 
5	I think about everything, to the point of overthinking. Say for example my friends are asking me if I wanna go to the movies this Saturday. Here's my thought process:\n\nHmm so Alice, Betty, Charlie, Dwayne and Eddie are going? I'm quite happy with these group of people. But wait, if I don't go, what would I be doing? Probably watching Netflix or playing games at home. Actually, that's all I would be doing for the next couple of days. I guess going to the movies once won't hurt. \n\nBut then again I would feel more comfortable just staying at home. Besides, things might not always go accoriding to plan. What if someone isn't free last minute? What if the movie we wanna watch is sold out? Actually, what movie are we even gonna watch? If its Movie A I don't mind, but if we're watching Movie B I'd rather stay at home. There's a high chance we watch Movie A though... \n\nBut let's say I do in fact decide to go. Do I reach early? Or do I reach right on time? If I reach too early there's a high chance Alice would reach early as well since she's often early, but I tend to be awkward around her. I guess I should delay my arrival abit... But what if my bus is late? I would hate if I delay everyone! I'll reach early and hang around the meeting point and spot if anyone else is there from a safe distance. Yes that's good. \n\nBut what if I get spotted? What will they think about me hanging out suspiciously at the wrong spot? Let's see, I don't mind chatting with Dwayne and Betty, but it'll be troublesome if it's Alice, Charlie or Eddie. I just can't seem to maintain a non-awkward conversation with them. (I proceed to think up mock conversation topics for each of them so I'm prepared for possible outcome. I think of what they like and their hobbies etc so I have something to talk about)\n\nBut isn't all of this really troublesome? I'm gonna have to recall what I planned out for every scenario. Isn't it just better if I stay at home and not worry about anything? But I'll miss out! What if they have a particularly enjoyable time? What if they think I'm more anti-social than I already am? What if they stop inviting me to go out with them? \n\nI could go on for ages about what else I would be thinking, but this post has been long enough lol\n\nTL;DR  I think of every possible outcome for a decision, and weigh the pros and cons. This means I need a lot of time to analyse and process, so please give me some time to think :) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n
2	Agreeing with all the 'ovethinking' comments. For me it comes down to trying to get the best out of a situation. Like jotting down all the potential routes, all the pros and cons. \n\nA friend of mine recently told me that she never worries about me or my decision-making, because she knows that when I do something I've thoroughly considered the outcomes. 
2	I try to find the source of why I feel the way I do. Most people view emotions as fleeting, but they are precursors for a deeper underlying issue. Similar to a root cause analysis, you keep asking yourself questions until you know why something is.\n\nOur choices and our behaviors have to fit into this framework of reality that we have. When reality and our understanding of reality are not the same, it causes us great distress. Probably because of our preference toward harmony. That would be what we consider internally. Externally, we would have to consider how our actions would affect the people around us and whether or not we are okay with that outcome based on our framework.\n\nI think INFJs are extremely open people, in the sense that we are thrilled to listen to new ideas and have the patience to try to understand certain viewpoints. We try to accumulate as much information as possible so that we‚Äôre able to see the whole picture and not just part of it. That we‚Äôre able to understand how certain conclusions came about. If you ask us what our stance is, we probably won‚Äôt have one yet because it takes time to sift through all these observations. Can the information be trusted? Can my judgement on this information be trusted? How does this fit into what I already know? If it doesn‚Äôt fit into what I already know, does this mean my perception is false? Or does this mean the information is false? How can the former or latter be false?\n\nMy SO initially had a very hard time dealing with my silence after a disagreement. It infuriated him that he couldn‚Äôt talk to me because he is the type to talk things out. He actually would prefer me to yell or do something, so he could gauge me. It was difficult because he would push me to communicate, and I would have no idea what to say because I really don‚Äôt know yet. After a few hours, I would finally articulate how I felt, why I felt that way, the events leading up to it, and how it impacts our relationship. I‚Äôm not sure how you can come up with this on the spot without carefully considering all the factors.\n\nBut I understand other people think differently. My SO (ENTP) happens to approach problems from a position of reasonableness and silos an event as it‚Äôs own. Whereas, I find a pattern in repeated or consecutive events that lead up to the surfaced issue. Now that we‚Äôve been together for a while, I can process much quicker. I can also articulate how he feels and the reason behind his actions (he doesn‚Äôt like talking about feelings much). He‚Äôs also able to identify patterns with me, much more open to understanding what it is that affects himself/me, and tries to do his part in resolving any issue. Our most recent disagreement really showed me how far we progressed in communicating with each other. I‚Äôm so appreciative of him and proud of us.
2	The best way I can explain it is that it's like Dr. Strange in Infinity War when he looks into the future and sees 14,000,605 outcomes. We will play out every scenario in our head to see what is the best course. If we dont see a best corse we will end it or wait before making any sort of commitment. 
1	Speaking for myself:\n\nIt often takes me a while for the patterns I perceive to surface into visibility into my conscious mind. This is partly because I take in lots and lots and LOTS of information at the perceptual level before any actual assessment (judging function) happens. \n\nI'd guess that as an judging dominant (assuming your ENTJ flair is correct), you have a way to filter the information you take in as it comes into you. As Ni-doms, INFJs don't have that. Without lots of unfiltered information, it would feel like our oxygen flow is constricted, so it's not something we prefer or desire to do (filter it first). Combine that weith other stuff, like Se material also flowing in at the unconscious perceptual level, plus how Ni works in processing and there's a lot of our need for lots of processing time.
1	For me it‚Äôs like a video game where I have all the choices and dialogue options laid out for me, and I‚Äôm constantly trying to see which one would be the best route to go since we don‚Äôt get to save and have a do over. If I have to go out and get something I‚Äôll spend hours at the house deciding if I really need it as well as the pros and cons of having said thing. 
63	Conflict and Confrontation	Hey, ENFP here. A couple INFJs I know avoid conflict like the plague, and would rather actively distance themselves from people than call them out on bad behavior. Is there any reason why they‚Äôre doing this? I don‚Äôt really understand it. 
65	All I can do is speak for myself and say I hate confrontation, I'm not very good at it, I tend to apologize when I'm in the right and the other party is in the wrong.  It used to feel like Vietnam in my head, when there was a confrontation.  Now I try to be careful to stick to guidlines.  I never allow anyone to raise their voice to me.  If they do, I walk away.  I just got into it with my 21 yr old son earlier.  Mild confrontation, asking him to stop correcting me constantly.  Didn't work.  I ended up in tears.  I think that is one of the down sides of being so sensitive.
40	I hate being confronted as well because I just want to be nice all of the time and do a good job. When someone confronts me, I take it very personal and I can‚Äôt help but do so. If it was me on the other side, I would be very gentle. I think other personalities don‚Äôt know how to approach us. Not that you have to treat me like a baby, it‚Äôs just that I feel more. We have more empathy.\n\nProbably not the greatest answer but that‚Äôs my point of view.
22	I hate conflict and confrontation for sure. But I will say something, especially if it‚Äôs a close friend, but probably over text/message haha. I still panic about the response though, and it‚Äôs probably because I‚Äôve had so many bad experiences with confrontation before. People will just hit back twice as hard with a billion things *you* did wrong and try and say things just to hurt you and defend themselves and try to spiral to the argument out of control so it becomes about a million other random details rather than the actual issue at hand. So it‚Äôs not even productive conflict. I would rather get at what we‚Äôre trying to get at, and move on.\n\nIf I‚Äôve realised that they‚Äôre the kind of person who‚Äôs never going to be able to have a ‚Äòproductive‚Äô argument with me, I‚Äôll just cut them out. If all they‚Äôre going to do is fight fight fight and try to manipulative the situation so I feel bad about myself, and actively try to say things to *hurt* me, I don‚Äôt see the point in keeping them around. \nIt‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm not willing to look at myself. Because trust me- whatever is said, I will fully ruminate about for years afterwards. If you say something about me I will think- what if it‚Äôs true, what if it‚Äôs true!? I will actively try to become a better person if something is pointed out about my traits or behaviours and will reflect upon it and try to change it. \nBut I don‚Äôt see the point in keeping people around who enjoy fighting, or enjoy arguing, or are clearly more interested in getting their way or fulfilling whatever need they have to be the victim, than having a fulfilling, meaningful friendship. \n\nIt‚Äôs not like that with everyone. I‚Äôve had conflict with my best friend before and we‚Äôve been able to move past it because we‚Äôre both reasonable people who are willing to talk about things, say our piece, respect that we have different opinions/thoughts, and are never out to hurt the other. The discord and lack of harmony makes me feel physically sick though, until the storm has passed. \n
20	I think it's because we hold ourselves to high standards and don't always reach them. When others point it out it's usually not in a loving manner so we feel that malicious intent and simply want to not feel it anymore so we avoid it.
19	The way I see it, it's not worth the effort. Unless they are doing something super morally wrong or, more likely, mistreating another person without dignity, I don't see the point in interfering. I analyze if the person is capable of being open-minded or civil enough to understand another perspective or accept his/her wrong position (most people are not in the heat of the moment). Unless I can see that my "confrontation," which is more tactful discourse, will yield a change in their behavior, I won't bother. It's a waste of breath, energy, and nobody wins at the end. Most fights end up boiling down to dick-measuring contests, anyway, with both parties struggling to preserve their fragile egos by trying to demean each other. It becomes a lose-lose situation. INFJs use our radar to avoid people and situations like that in the first place so we are not caught up in it. But if push comes to shove, you'll be surprised at how confrontational we can be.
19	Hate it. Hate it. Hate it.  \n\nMakes me feel icky.  I can‚Äôt verbalize my emotions when I‚Äôm in the moment so I just end up shutting down or exploding into a crazy rage monster.  I need time to process how I‚Äôm feeling about things so I can communicate properly and productively.   When I‚Äôm on the spot I can‚Äôt do that.  Then if I say something that doesn‚Äôt communicate clearly what I‚Äôm feeling or something that I feel is wrong I will endlessly guilt myself about it.  Or works don‚Äôt come out, tears do because my emotions have to release somehow and if I can‚Äôt do it with words, my eyes decide that leaking is the best way to get it out.  \n\nEmbarrassing.  It‚Äôs all just embarrassing. 
13	I personally feel obliged to maintain the balance in social situations; I want to do right by the greatest number of people, while remaining sensetive to the specific needs of each individual. \nI think the nature of Fe is to focus on the values of your community. \nI am confrontational if I feel someones behaviour is upsetting the balance of a community. \nIf I get into a conflict with one person, it might ripple out and negatively impact my relationships with others. I try to work out the best way to address an issue with minimal fall out.\nUnfortunately trying to calculate those variables is draining, so sometimes it's easier to just fade someone out. 
11	I think all of these answers so far are correct. All of the above, and to continue, we hold ourselves to such high standards and we feel so intensely, that I personally find it very difficult to not break down into tears whenever I‚Äôm having a confrontation with someone, and I *really* hate when I do that because other people perceive that as ‚Äúweak‚Äù. I don‚Äôt. However, the fact they perceive me that way is doubly upsetting on top of the sometimes hurtful words people say to others while in the heat of the moment, whether they mean them or not. \n\nEdit; also, I know when I was a little younger I used to think ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the point of me saying anything? If that‚Äôs really the way they are, they‚Äôre not going to change. I‚Äôll just find a new friend.‚Äù Hence, why I have no friends. 
5	Harmony and a general feeling of homeostasis is more important to me in most cases. I pick my battles, and they have to be worth fighting. I'm usually pretty tolerant, to a fault. There have been some times when I've acted impulsively--a couple of times when I've road raged. I really regretted them in hindsight. I almost always regret when I don't think and let my emotions out without thinking it through first. Thinking about when I've done that is kind of embarrassing/cringeworthy actually.\n\nIt's actually a pet peeve of mine to be around someone who is not very choosey with their battles. There are times when it just kills the mood and makes things less fun. I'd rather enjoy life and not worry about issues that will mean nothing the next day. But if it's something serious or long-term that needs to be confronted, that's different.\n\nEDIT: Here's a funny example of what I mean: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qswjaM5yCro - I have been on a less extreme version of a date like this, haha. There is such a thing as standing up for yourself too much. It can become a real killjoy for others. Obviously you want a healthy self-esteem, but you've gotta pick your battles.
4	There is so much involved in the full answer to this question, and we can't possibly cover it. I'm in a mental situation right now where I really want to talk to my boss...who is also my friend....who i objectively know respects me and my opinion...and whom i deeply respect. I don't even want to confront her. I just want to ask her a question. That's it. I feel like my position in our organization has not been well defined, and i want her to clarify it for me, and i can't even rehearse the conversation in my head without crying. I'm not traumatized or anything but I think it's the vulnerability of it that is so freaking scary.\nReasons I'm not going to enter this conversation:\n1. Crying when I should just be talking makes me feel stupid and out of control. \n2. I'm afraid that revealing that I have this question somehow reveals something about me that I should be ashamed of. \n3. I don't want my boss and my friend to think less of me if I can't keep it together long enough to have a calm rational conversation. \n-----------edited to add---------------\nI was making myself frustrated and depressed over this.  So yesterday I finally composed a personal email asking for clarification. \nShe responded that we could discuss it in the morning. \nI'm getting a promotion and a raise at next budget. \nThanks for the encouragement. 
5	In any relationship the sad thing is that the infj can see where that relationship might end up most likely because of our Ni. It might not be right but it‚Äôs what I do sometimes. It just happened with this girl who I was considering being friends with, there is just too much trouble that follows her and I could see our relationship bringing me trouble and also just not being worth it. I think other INFJs do this too. If there is going to be a lot of trouble and conflict we don‚Äôt wanna deal with we‚Äôd rather walk away because we can see where it most likely will end up. 
4	For me it depends on how bad the behavior is. It would have to be pretty bad for me to consider confronting them (since I fear confrontation), and it would already be clear to me that they don't care about other people's feelings/opinions if they would act in such a way in the first place. Based on that, they would most likely get defensive and turn what I intended to be a low key conversation into an argument and I just don't have the energy for that, it stresses me out.
4	I can‚Äôt often because most people I know are extremely defensive, offenses easily, and/or have short tempers. I was raised in that environment and to this day many people around me are still like that. So yeah, confrontation isn‚Äôt easy even if I wanted to. I‚Äôm never mean about it either I try to say things in the nicest way possible but even then some people can‚Äôt handle being asked to do something differently.. It shocks me when some people handle criticism well because I‚Äôm not used to it. I can‚Äôt speak for all INFJ‚Äôs but that‚Äôs how it is for me.
5	I personally don't hate confrontation, nor do I actively avoid it, but I don't act immediately either. I tend to immediately think from the other person's perspective. "Imagine how they might feel? What if they are having the worst day today? If I get angry and say something will it make it worse?" That thought process is fast as lighting and in the end I decide if it is or isn't worth doing. Most times it isn't. \n\nAlso, there are many types of confrontation. While returning food your unhappy with at a restaurant isn't confrontation I think is worth it. Confronting a friend, a loved one, or enemy about something difficult is easy for me. I can sit down in front of or call someone and ask "what's the problem we're having?"\n\nIt could be what you define as confrontation.\nIt could be a fear of being hurt or hurting others. I've noticed that INFJ are very empathetic and introverted, myself included. The two don't blend well. \n\nBest thing to do in these situations is to not expect a crazy reaction and try to understand it from their perspective. 
4	The other thing we do often is that we empathize so hard that we empathize ourselves out of conflict. So if a person is making us upset or hurting our feelings, we can tune into their emotional frequency, see things from their side, and know that it‚Äôs not that they are doing something to us.  We recognize quite easily that they have unresolved emotional conflict within themselves, like anxiety, avoidance, aggression, etc. \n\nSo we don‚Äôt get into conflict much because we very rarely see conflicts as black and white with some enemy to fight. We empathize automatically, many times, even with our enemies. \n\nIt‚Äôs almost like a situation where your kid is mad at you and says they hate you. You know that they are too young to realize that they‚Äôre tired from a long day at school and they still probably feel bad about their test score from the day before and they aren‚Äôt looking forward to health class tomorrow, etc.. So why take what your kid said personally? There is no conflict. There are emotions. But the conflict isn‚Äôt about you. There‚Äôs no need to fight. \n\nA lot of adults operate with not much more emotional awareness than kids. So we do the same thing with them. We analyze the root cause of the conflict. Know it‚Äôs not us. And don‚Äôt take it personally. 
3	Yeeeeaah, I don't usually like getting involved in other people's conflicts. Mostly because we don't want to add more wood to the fire, especially since we jumped in as well.
3	If you want an INFJ to like you, just be nice. Simple. If they really like you though they won‚Äôt get offended. 
3	I do this for quite a few different reasons depending on the situation or the person that is causing the issue. If it's a family member of a person that I have had in my life for an extended period of time then it is usually because I have already confronted them about the issue that I am having with them. Previously, nothing has come of it so it's less exhaustive to just avoid them while making time for better people in my life. I have extensive experience with this one in particular.\n\nIf it is a person that I am not close with or will not be around frequently then I won't even waste the energy on it. This is for more of the friends of friends situation. I'll just choose not to hang out with that group when said person is around. I have plenty of other people to spend my time with including myself so why bother with someone that isn't important?\n\nIf it's a co-worker, or a situation that I am forced to interact with less compatible personalities, then I try to give the person the benefit of the doubt. We are both forced to be together for no other reason than work so either of us could have some attitude over something entirely unrelated to each other and be rubbing each other the wrong way. I try to keep in mind that they could have some stuff going on that I am not aware of that they don't feel comfortable sharing with me. I also have noticed that I am particularly prickly on certain days of my cycle (I'm a female) and I usually don't realize until after the hormones subside. I don't want to confront someone about something that really doesn't matter to me the other 27-28 days of the month if we aren't great friends. If it's a pervasive issue in the co-worker scenario then I will kindly confront a person and resort to higher ups if the issue persists after a discussion with the offending party.\n\nI have found that in most situations, except family, I will not initiate a confrontation if I can avoid it. It makes me cry and become physically ill to do so. If anyone else initiates a confrontation in a conversational matter I actually do enjoy it because I feel that it is a learning experience. However, if anyone confronts me in an aggressive or hostile manner they better have their ducks in a row because they just poked a sleeping bear. I have a massive temper, this is the main reason that I am careful about confrontation, I want to make sure that my temper isn't getting the better of me. My temper is closely linked to my perfectionist tendencies, for both myself and others. I haven't figured out how to explain the connection without writing a dissertation so I'll leave it at that.\n\nEdit: A word.\n\n&#x200B;
3	I don't often get into conflicts but I grew up in a house that had constant conflict... Still does actually. I hate conflict. But I understand sometimes it needs to be done to resolve things. I hate conflict that ends with animosity between people and they don't talk to each other. I really want to resolve things but conflict itself feels horrible inside me. Everytime I get into a conflict that I actually defend myself in, I leave and feel sorry for the other person and feel bad for what I said. Even if I was actually in the right. 
3	I have never regretted something that I didnt say. The thought that i could handle the conflict in the wrong way and regret the outcome is probably what stops me the most. Even if someone is pissing me off, the last thing I want to do is hurt them. I think like other people are saying, our empathy is stopping us. We even empathize with how someone MIGHT feel if we actually went through with calling them out on bad behavior. 
3	They just don't want to deal with the drama.. it's UNCOMFORTABLE. It's like awkward, especially for an INFJ to get angry and yell at someone, they don't enjoy doing that. It's really a waste of emotional energy, not just for INFJs but all introverts. Extroverts have unlimited social energy and will never get tired being social or being in similar situations... being in a confrontational setting will drain the life energy out of them, changing a good mood that they have that day into a very terrible mood and run ruin their whole day.\n\nWhat's the best way to confront a very bad person with bad behavior? None. Ignore them all together and don't waste your time or energy around that person. Being angry and yelling honestly does absolutely no good, it will not fix any conflict. If you know someone well enough, confrontation will just lead to useless arguments that two people will defend their ego to the death. From my experience in long term relationship, providing DISTANCE and allowing time to pass is the best way to deal with a situation or problem.. tackling it head on is useless because no one will come to any agreement. Time is the best healer and people's level of respect will be reset.
2	I try to avoid confrontation when I can and will let some things slide occasionally just to avoid it. It‚Äôs usually not worth the hassle for me anyways in most cases
2	I hate it because it feels like a job. Takes time and energy. Fail to conflict and worse stuff lies ahead!
2	Poor sense of self, not much care for confrontation, need to be prepared for an engagement
2	Personally I'm just terrified of confrontation. It's unbearable when someone is mad at me. Even if I know I'm in the right I usually don't challenge people. I don't get angry easily, usually if I have a problem with someone my natural response is just to distance myself. We are often altruistic and sensitive. Usually I'd rather just let things be than cause a scene
2	What is it about us ENFPs and being on everyone else's MBTI reddits seriously and genuinely except our own. I'm ENFP myself. On our own enfp mbti page we just post memes.\n\nSo about your question, ENFPs tend to avoid conflicts too right? Depends on the % of your T/F I feel. I'm borderline ENTP and I damn love conflict hahaha! Same with INFJ and INTJ => depends on their t/f, just my opinion. 
2	Because it takes a lot of energy. Let alone argument, conversation already drained me, but I'll step up if it's really really required 
2	Yeah you‚Äôre right. Good advice. Thank you.
2	I actually quite like conflict, or at least I enjoy it.  Like others have said, I'll almost never initiate unless it's important, and I take it very personally.  But there's something about being forced to defend actions you've made and opinions you hold.  Emotions start to rise and you can float on top of them, picking which ones you want to influence your words.  I'm aware of everyone's emotional state around me and I know how to rile someone or calm them, I guess I just like feeling in total control of the situation.  If it doesn't effect you, and you can see it effecting the other party, you win.  I'll be brutally analyzing my behavior for months after though.  \n\nIf it's a conflict where I can't retaliate and have to take it, like getting told off by a boss or something, then it hurts and it's taken pretty seriously.  Same with criticism. 
2	As all of you I like to avoid conflict with anyone. And reading through I found out we all have incomon a fear of something going wrong. That we will say something wrong or just think what kind of line would finish the conflict. And by the end of the discussion we said just a couple of words, added couple of sights and just fell small, uncomfortable and as don't understand where it all came from since we do the best we can.( At least we think so until that conflict arrives). \nSo thinking about that problem maybe I have a solution and correct me if I'm wrong. \n\nThe nature of conflict is that the other side wants something and I think that if you go and turn that emphaty in yourself you will find that they are in "pain" for not getting it. So it's your job to show them what it is in a compassionate way (as we all are).  Just ask why are you angry? And why this? And why? Why? Communication is the key and it's hard if you don't know the outcome. I know :) \nBut the worst thing in that you'll found something new about yourself and other person. \n\nI'm just broke up with my girlfriend after 7 years together and I would always go into my own world after and during conflict. What I learned is that it's okay to be honest about what you fell. \n\nSo act from within yourself.\n\nWow this really was a little letter for myself. I wish to thank you guys for reading this.
1	Well written statement...I agree. I have a friend who yells at her kids all of the time. She‚Äôs definitely not an INFJ. It‚Äôs the complete opposite of what I would do. So I guess it comes down to how you were raised and personality type.\n\nAnd it‚Äôs not so much about a lack of self esteem, though that is an issue for me. It‚Äôs also about us INFJs holding high standards for ourselves so when you get confronted about something, it is hard not to take it personally (at least for me it is).
1	As an INFJ myself I find actual conflict annoying, bad behavior even more. It's not my right or responsibility to call someone out on their opinion or behavior.
7	No Internal Monologue and Ni	I was wondering if anybody thought Ni might be related to not having a stream of consciousness, and occasionally finding it quite difficult to tap into a train of thought. If I had to guess I imagine it could be because Ni is much more oriented towards imagery and patterns.
8	That's an interesting question. It's hard to answer because I process my thoughts in a variety of ways depending on what I'm doing. Like, "pure" Ni insights can occur to me like either an instinctual urge, image, or like a memory I already knew but was just noticing for the first time.\n\nIf I'm studying or taking in information verbally, my brain is making active connections with existing data, and sometimes that's just as concepts but can also be reduced to imagery. Symbols and imagery are really powerful because they can have layers of meaning and a lot of data packed into a small amount of information which lets me connect them easily to other concepts in my brain.  I've noticed I will sometimes "zip" rather complicated situations and interactions down into a simple package of an image/sensation tied to an emotion when I file it away. If I need to access that information later, or something triggers that image, it all comes back to me in detail when I summon it. \n\nHowever, for a lot of other situations and social troubleshooting, my brain just produces a variety of visual narratives that I simply watch or can manipulate. These "scenarios" are how I process a lot of my decisions and think through what I want to do. A lot of my "thinking" is actually just manipulating my own inner world where I can create anything and simply watching what happens when I tweak different things.
3	> because Ni is much more oriented towards imagery and patterns\n\n:thumbs_up: \n\nindeed Ni is seemingly executed by prefrontal cortex
3	I think about this often. I would probably never admit that I don't have an internal "self talk" the way most people do. But my mind is very "quiet" and always has been. I'm good at meditating, great at reading between the lines, excellent at thinking in abstract/metaphorical terms not easily distracted or jittery. It's hard for me to actively picture or rationalize things the way my xNxP friends do so easily. And while they struggle with not engaging in their environments, I often struggle to be actively involved in the world around me.\n\nI can be quite the daydreamer, but that's not quite the same as internal monologue. But I've read that Ni is a mostly subconscious process. So the more you lean into it, the more in touch with your subconscious is. This might explain the phenomena of INFJs lacking what other people describe as "internal monologue".\n\nThe way I picture my brain is this: there's a deep, cloudy pool. There are big things moving underneath the water. I can stand aside and watch the ripples of the waves, and I can see that there is movement in the water. But I know that it might be hard to resurface if I jump into the pool or reach into it. And then, every once in a while, something pops up to the surface of the water, and I'm able to pluck it up and give it a careful look-over. It's an epiphany, a fresh idea, something kind of profound and refined. Where did it come from? Not sure. But here it is at my disposal and I'm gonna run with it.\n\nI think everyone has internal monologue, but for us INFJs I think it's more instinctual and or/subconscious.
1	Whenever I hear someone say they don't have an internal monologue I instantly think they're crazy. Everyone has a voice inside their had. How often it is there is entirely different, but it's there. It's common knowledge upwards of 90% of communication is done non verbally. Imagine how little of it needs to be verbal inside your own mind.  If you have difficulty tapping into a train of thought that's more of an ADHD type thing and not something that is because of Ni.
4	Did you mistype when you first took the test? If so, what did you mistype as?	I typed as ISFJ the first time I took the test. It wasn‚Äôt until I started studying the functions that I realized I was in fact INFJ. 
6	I mistyped as an INTP, I think it‚Äôs because Ni is so poorly explained and Fe seems to be coded as quite kind. I figured it out when I understood that a lot of the things I experience and couldn‚Äôt quite explain (mostly obsession with imagery/metaphor/a sense of unease without knowing why) could be attributed to Ni and being ~Analytical~ about other people was just Ni-Fe. 
3	Yeah the test actually always tells me I‚Äôm an INFP but INFJ definitely seems to fit me more 
4	I typed as infp initially. Got into the functions and everything and went around thinking I was INFP for 2 years. 2 YEARS! Recently I took the functions tests and got the INFJ functions. I think I wanted to be INFP and so would make up reasons or manipulate the system of how functions worked to fit with me being INFP. At the end I just accepted it and I'm pretty sure I'm INFJ. Although I now have an insecurity that maybe I was INFP. But I'm pretty sure INFJ is the right one now.
3	I mistyped as an ISTJ in the beginning, because of my childhood i didn't really get to develop in a optimal way.
3	INFP until I studied the functions.
2	I thought I was an ISFJ for like 5 years before I had a real interest in MBTI. Then I typed as INTJ and INFP. Out of all those types, I related to ISFJ the most but could never relate to the description of their high Si (surprise, INFJ has Si as the lowest function). I never typed as an INFJ. I do remember being 50/50 on the T/F and P/J, so the result depended on a couple questions that pushed me one way or the other. I had to read through people's experiences and the cognitive functions to realize I was an INFJ.
2	[deleted]
2	I got INTJ. There are many similarities, enough that I didn't realise it was wrong, but I do think INFJ is the better fit now that I've read into it more and matured as a person.
2	I got ISFJ the first time, but didn‚Äôt really give it much attention. Two years later I retook the test, got INFJ, and really started to get interested in MBTI. Read several places that a lot of people got mistyped as INFJ, so really had to do research to see if this really is what I am (it is). 
2	No matter what test or how often I test I get ENFJ, but I'm definitely introverted, so: infj
2	Infp 
2	Im just 17 but I first took the test when Iwas either 11 or 12 and back then, I kept getting *ISTP*... Somehow...
2	Yes. ISFJ, INFJ and INTJ. After doing more research I feel like I‚Äôm a INFJ more. But I‚Äôm still in the process of understating all of these things 
2	First time I took it I got INFJ. I rarely mistype, but when I do it‚Äôs either INTJ or INFP.
1	First time I took the test when I was like 12, I got ESFP (which makes sense for that age). I often get ENFP, sometimes ENTP but I have gotten ISFJ once, INFJ a few times and INFP once. I'm 18 atm, but I am still in the midsts of puberty, so who knows what kind of changes will it bring. I like the idea of INFJ for some reason, but I don't know whether I really am an INFJ. Reading one INFJ's post about his line of thinking, I do sympathize with a lot of it. I used to overthink things and try to perfect the outcome, but I don't think I ever went into such depth. At most I imagine entire conversations and the possible answers and what kind of reactions those answers could give and how should I react. I think this kind of thinking only stems from not being confident and/or feeling a little down.\nIt's weird, because I can be very extraverted and attention seeking once in a while, but then somebody says something that spooks me into thinking I did something very bad and people are going to hate me and I get snapped into absolute introvert overthink mode. Well, I guess maybe I am an INFJ.\nWhat do you think?
1	I also typed as ISFJ the first time I took it.  A friend of mine sent me the test, telling me it had had a huge impact on him, but when I read my results I was really underwhelmed and wrote it off as a horoscope-type thing, where you'll read whatever you want into it.  Parts of the description resonated with me but most of it didn't.  I retook it several months later and got INFJ (across a few different tests) and reading the description blew my mind.  I felt totally understood and could finally articulate feelings I'd had my whole life.
1	Was trying that out for many years. Always was getting ENFJ and but I can't call myself an extrovert tho. But I must say I'm really close 50/50 state between extroversion and introversion. 
1	Mistyped as an INTP all of high school. But started typing as INFJ when in college. I started vomiting Fe when I was 19 years old+ and when looking back at high school. I realized I was always an INFJ just didn't have too many social interactions to develop or use any Fe practically to know myself well enough when answering the questions for MBTI. 
7	Curiosity and Self Expression - March 01, 2019	This is the place to post your community questions and express yourself via various mediums. This thread is dedicated to topics and questions that are based on personal experience and not MBTI theory. Topics appropriate for this thread include, but are not limited to:\n\n* Does anyone else? Is this an INFJ thing?\n* Poetry, artwork, rants\n* Memes\n* Generic community questions (favorite hobbies, books, music, games, etc.)\n\nYou may also want to stop by [our wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/wiki/index) and [our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/wiki/faqs) pages for more information. We have a number of topics there, including:\n\n* [our FAQ section on favorite things](https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/wiki/faqs#wiki_favorite_things)\n* [our FAQ section on the "INFJ doorslam"](https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/wiki/faqs#wiki_door_slam)\n* [our FAQ section on sexuality](https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/wiki/faqs#wiki_infjs_and_sexuality), including preferences, feelings, and approaches\n* [our FAQ section on type disambiguation](https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/wiki/faqs#wiki_what_is_an_infj.3F), including INTJ, ISFJ, and INFP).\n\n*It's important to separate unsupported stereotypes from MBTI traits that are grounded in theory. While it can be fun to see if other people share your traits or quirks, it is important to distinguish whether these are normal human behaviors or whether they would truly tie to being an INFJ. Keep in mind that internet users are their own subsection of humanity - more likely to be depressed, more likely to be anxious, more likely to have social deficiencies, etc. Agreement on this sub doesn't make something an "INFJ thing". A majority of users might like pizza, but that doesn't mean that INFJs like pizza because they're INFJs.*\n
3	I love [this](https://i.imgur.com/lDWeO96.jpg). I recently went to Madrid for work and managed to escape for a few hours to visit the Museo Thyssen. I just stood there looking at all these beautiful paintings. Impressionists, Expressionists, Les Nabis, Tonalists... they knew what was good. \n\nStudying graphic design was a series of Bauhaus this, Andy Warhol that... it made me forget what I loved about art and the world around me. I think I've found it again now.\n\nAlso, [this](https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2014/jan/30/kenya-turns-flip-flops-into-art-in-pictures) is really cool. Imagine someone asking you "what do you do for a living?" And you say "flip flop artist!". They are doing such a great work.
2	Here's my week old video about the topic on how I like to give and receive feedback from others, and how I usually don't get the right kind of feedback for the best development. I am sure a lot of xnfjs will probably relate to this \n\nhttps://youtu.be/gXCSdnoaJio

2	How to tell a looped infj and an intj apart?	I have trouble typing a close friend of mine, he has gone through some emotionally damaging things growing up, so I'm aware that because of that his personality might not be possible to type (he struggles with emotional empathy), but I'm sure that he's 100% an Ni dom.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have no experience with loops, so I hope you can help me out\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(posting this on r/intj too) 
2	I'm not well-versed in this so I can't type people myself. But I asked my family to just take the test and they all enjoyed it (the free on, 16personalities). We read the results together and laughed at one another. If you're close, maybe you can ask your friend to take it rather than struggling through the typing yourself haha.
2	Te is more engaging than Ti
1	I scored as INTJ for a while when I was in a pretty bad one sided relationship. I was chastised for having emotions then chastised for not being sensitive enough towards her emotions.\n\nAll of my emotional energy went into carrying someone else, and I wasn't able to express myself, ever. So I stopped feeling.\n\nMaybe its something similar?
12	Dynamic duo: ENTP x INFJ friendship?	Sup advocates.  I'm wondering what y'all think of us ENTPs.  I believe my best friend is either an INTP, INTJ or INFJ but he's convinced he's INFJ.  I assumed he's INTx, as he has absolutely no issue with my snarky, and occasionally highly offensive and politically incorrect ENTP humor.  He does have extremely strong principles...though that seems like it would be more of an xNFP thing, due to Fi.  However, he's also extremely aware of my mood (this would be excellent Fe, increasing the probability of him being INFJ) to the point he can tell how I'm feeling better than I can.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow do y'all perceive us ENTPs?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nmuch love
11	Since INFJs usually like keeping the peace (Fe), they aren't as confrontational as an INFP if you do something "offensive". Also, many INFJs can come across as Ts because we're not as touchy-feely as the rest of the NFs and can be far more analytical. That's not to say your friend is definitely an INFJ though, just that it's possible.   \n\n\nI personally get along well with ENTPs. When I was younger I found their behavior would hit against my boundaries of what I thought was socially ok more often, but now that I'm older, I often don't care and we get along without any conflicts for the most part. It can be a really fun match, but there's also a high potential to drive each other crazy.  I personally find all those types (INTJ/INTP/INFJs) to make good friends and be pretty chill for the most part. I know some ENTPs who get along with INFPs better, because of shared Ne. 
9	As an INFJ, I relate to your friend‚Äôs behavior. I‚Äôm very rarely put off by offensive/non-PC humor. Oddly, my principles kinda demand that I don‚Äôt shut down freedom of expression and hear all sides ‚Äî if that makes sense. But I also respect other people‚Äôs decision to not listen to something if it‚Äôs deeply upsetting. We‚Äôre an odd bunch. üôÉ
4	I love ENTPs and thought most INFJs felt that way too. I think they make a good pair especially because they both lead with intuition and are pretty authentic (usually) 
3	This is directed at 1 ENTP in particular:\n\nYou think you're all that. Well, I have news for you: YER NOT.\n\nBut otherwise, y'all are cool. I guess. Also, your friend could very much be an INFJ. I think more developed/older INFJ learn to have more flexible sensitivity boundaries. I know I relate to what you're describing. 
2	I'm an older INFJ, and yeah us getting older we tend to slack off on *certain* boundaries, and firm up others. Like I'll be cool with joking around and stuff, but woe to you if you do something unethical. The (I'll call them minor here, to keep things short) minor functions get filled out, the older we get and work on ourselves we do, thus balance, and that's a thing I've been working on too. So my Ti, Te, and Fi are more rounded out. AFAICT anyway. Heh
2	My most cherished friendship I have is with an ENTP. You guys are my favorite people to be around.
2	Ah the irreverence, the open disregard for bootlicking, the ability to hold ambiguities in the mind without needing to shove everything into a black-and-white dichotomy, the wittiness, the neverending ideas  -- and yet utter charm and sweetness. ENTPs are my favorite. Been married to one for 16 years, too. We can talk for hours. His mind is a continuous source of joy, inspiration and fascination to me.  
1	I find ENTP girls attractive as hell, even more than ENFPs. Something about their wit and humor gets me going. 
1	I have a good entp friend. We click well and I think he is pretty mature. I'm just sad that he was a little socially stunted the last time I saw him and a bit of an ass. His Fe is still in development I guess. Unfortunately he had this fight in our circle of friends and he left the circle out frustration. 
74	I am an INFJ with no sense of self.	I have no goals or passions. All I know how to do is do for others in almost a harmful way. I read that INFJ personality types are particularly sensitive to other's emotions, so I assume the two are connected. I can tell when someone is bothered, and it's intensified to where I feel anxiety if I know the person well enough. I notice these things and immediately rush to try to fix whatever problems they may have. I have always had to put others before myself because my upbringing made it necessary. However, as an adult this has kept me from doing many things and eventually I had nothing. My life revolves around my S/O and his goals SOLELY because I only know how to do that anymore without feeling guilty or selfish. People think it's consideration, but it feels like a curse.\n\nIs there any advice you could give to help me with any part of the above. I've never met any one like myself.\n\n\nSorry for the rant. I'm very new to Reddit and INFJ research, so if I need to fix anything please kindly let me know.
31	Hello! The function you're describing here is Fe (extraverted feeling) and is something that INFJs can have a love-hate relationship with since it can feel like it comes with a sense of obligation. However, what you've described are issues with Fe (being focused on the social environment and the condition of others) taken to an extreme point where it borders on a behavioral issue and is outside of the realm of MBTI.  All INFJs use Fe, but not all INFJs develop codependent behavior. This is where many INFJs can learn from their Fi (Introverted Feeling) friends like INFP/ENFP/ESFP/ISFPs.  Your own wants, needs, and feelings have value. You are not required to give up your sense of self for others, your individuality is important. This is something that requires work for a lot of INFJs, but it's incredibly important.\n\nI'd recommend reading up on establishing boundaries and codependent relationships, it might help a lot!  Also, definitely read up on Fe vs. Fi so you can learn to tell the difference between sensing the needs and feelings of others vs. your own needs and feelings.
19	Similar feelings felt here. Honestly, you need to practice some self care, and I mean that as-go find yourself. Do some soul searching. I realized something a long time ago that kind of has only come together recently. The way we see things is that everything is a part of a whole.\n\nAll the things you love are your passions and you can use them to find goals. I like bugs. Does that mean I‚Äôm going to be an entomologist? Nope. But I like art so maybe I‚Äôll paint them. I love ancient Egypt. Am I going to become an archaeologist? No, but I love to write so maybe I‚Äôll write a story implementing that.\n\nI had a friend who once said, ‚ÄúI wish I had a passion like you‚Äù I told him he did. He loved history and geography and japan. ‚ÄúBecome a travel guide or historian‚Äù I said. And he told me those weren‚Äôt passions. I‚Äôm sure he won‚Äôt remember this but today, he‚Äôs living in japan teaching English and just traveled to Taiwan because he ‚Äúlikes travel‚Äù wonder where he got that idea from ;)\n\nSo let go of the world. It will still be there when you get back. It will be fine without you for a moment and it will be better with a new and more rejuvenated you returning to it later. Make yourself a priority and express that to your partner. They want you to do just as well as you want them to do. 
7	I had the same issue all my life being a people pleaser. Eventually this is where you have to put your thinking skills in perspective. At the end of the day most people don't give a shit about you and you only have one life to live. It is tough because as an infj im also all or nothing. Either I'm intensely devoted or I stop giving a shit completely I cannot do mid ground. I can't offer any great advice because of that, it's not good to be all or nothing as balance should always be reached. I guess what I'm trying to say is try to have a different perspective about this and repeatedly drill it into your head that your life is yours and nobody else is going to live it for you. The same goes for their lives it's not your responsibility. I've gone more now from being a people pleaser to being extremely independent and careless because of that. I've even shut down my empathy almost completely but I also was attracting toxic narcissists so this is sadly my only self defense that's remotely working for me right now. Good luck 
5	I‚Äôm a guy and This happened me in my last relationship. I left, got in touch with things i love and have never felt better.  Find something you love to do. Cling to it. For me thats the gym.
3	I think what‚Äôs helping me is really looking at my favorites. I find that when I am looking at it listening to something that is my ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù I am suddenly more aware of who I am ego wise. Try it? 
3	I'm an older INFJ, who has spent a lifetime learning about myself.  I remember, at one point in my youth being very out of sorts with others, hurt all the time, angry at people for not being more sensitive with others.  I always felt overloaded with empathy whenever I encountered people with problems.  I became depressed pretty fast.  I did a lot of self-help and counseling to stabilize (didn't help matters that my childhood was pretty crummy too).  Much of it was hit and miss helpful/not helpful, until I was introduced to MTBI in 2014.  I think at my age (almost 50), I've had a fair bit of self-analysis.  I even earned a Masters in Psychology.  I was pretty determined in figuring things out so I could finally relax into myself.  Everything you do to understand yourself better, adds up!  Believe me, it's worth it.  1) Accept yourself, with all your "faults".  Nobody is perfect.  2) Next, throw that out and damn it, love yourself as you are.  You are beautiful as you are.  3) Just be you.  Just do you.  And relax in that.  You have nothing to prove to anyone, it's not necessary.  \n\nSo, you can sense/feel what others are feeling, yeah.  So, you need to learn to set up some boundaries, otherwise you'll keep absorbing that from everyone around you.  It's unhealthy for you.  I believe this is why most INFJs tend to be introverted.  We have to bow out of the social world (work, friends, whatever) to conserve and recharge our energy.  Nobody is going to do that for you.  You have to figure out what works for you, and BE OKAY with your solution.  No guilt about it!
2	Yes, extrovert feeling can cause that. What about finding a person with introvert feeling who knows a bit psychology and is willingly to help? That person might be able to make you awaken your independent feelings or make you more conscious about them. You are emotional, but your emotions are caused mainly by outside factors.\n\nYou can have goals without a strong emotional drive, too, but it can be hard to have motivation to obtain them since there are no emotions pushing you.

2	I used to put others needs before my own 99% of the time, no matter who they were or what impact they had on my life. People were just always above me, like their emotions and needs mattered more than my own. I think the one thing that brought me out of that mentality was that I got so frustrated with never receiving that same intense level of care or concern back, therefore it felt like all the energy I was dishing out was exhausting me, and draining my soul in a really unhealthy cycle. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I still love giving advice and helping people! I think empathy and compassion are some of the most beautiful qualities that humans can have. You just have to understand as an individual that your own needs matter too, and you're absolutely allowed to do your own thing and have your own hobbies or passions without ever needing to apologize to anyone (a hard thing to do, I know)\n\nPutting yourself first is way easier said than done, but it's definitely a process you can take baby steps in. Before you shut yourself down and start apologizing or feeling selfish/guilty, please realize your self-worth and understand that being such a kind, caring and considerate person makes you so valuable to humanity. You're not just a tool used to assist other people, y'know? You're a wonderful human with your own baggage, and you deserve love, attention and care just as anyone else does. Try and remind yourself of these things before you put yourself down. Start exploring your own hobbies, passions, or anything that feels personal to little ol' you. :) I hope this helped in some way; it must've not been easy to talk about your own problems so openly on the internet so I admire your courage to do so! Wanting help is the most important step in getting there. \nGodspeed to you my fellow INFJ! <3
2	I don't think Fe is your problem. Sounds like you have a critical parent (Ti) issue. \n\nBasically, you want to get to a place where you are taking care of yourself and not feeling guilty about it. One thing that might help you get there is to remember that your Fe (interest in meeting the needs of others) can't be effective if you're not first ensuring your own needs are met.\n\nGet your headspace right and the other stuff (identity, passion, creativity) will come. 
1	The moving on quickly is very new information, but it makes a lot of sense. Thank you 
1	I am the same way. Far more concerned with other people's desires than my own, to the point where I don't feel like there's anything I really want. That's not true, though. There are things I want - I just don't usually know that until I've allowed myself to miss out on them.\n\nSpending time alone helps. Use that time to things you want. Not things you need to do, not things that will benefit other people. Seriously. Just take a day and listen to your own desires during that allocated time and do things purely because you want to. Read. Lay in bed. Eat junk food. Go for a stroll in nature. Don't shut down your desires because they don't serve a useful purpose or help someone else.\n\nI've also found spending a lot of time with the right Fi user can help. I usually don't get along with Fi users but I've been dating an ISFP and he constantly forces me to make decisions. He will say to me, "What do you want to do?" And when I name whatever thing I imagine will please him most, he says, "No, that's what *I* want to do. Tell me what *you* want to do and then we will find a compromise that makes us both happy." And we do.\n\nYesterday, I explained to him that I care more about harmony than anything else and I'd prefer others to be happy than myself. His said in reply that harmony means BOTH sides are happy. If one side is feeling fulfilled while the other is quietly not, that is not harmony. And it can lead to resentment and other problems down the track. 
1	Sense of self.... that's an interesting topic all together. I still don't completely understand what that is as a definitive and certainly am not sure I know what it is for me.\n\nI'm not saying you are in an abusive relationship at all. Though it does sound like you've experienced some sort of long term abuse at some point.\n\nI grew up abused and often felt that way. Sometimes still feel that way as a middle aged adult. There was even one abusive relationship I was in. I couldn't tell where they ended and I began. It was surreal!!!\n\nIt's sometimes hard to be assertive and express your needs without feeling obligated.....much more so guilty. I think you're on the right track. You can see this and realize what is going on. Even more so, you're reaching out for understanding why you're that way. It's a hell of a journey for sure!\n\nI would suggest you take some time alone if possible. Maybe 30 minutes a day. For this allotted time only think about you. Think about what you want, your interests, dislikes, what makes you sad, what brings you joy, beliefs. Try to think about how you feel. In time you may be able to sort all of that out.\n\nOn top of all this. It's a good idea to get some therapy if possible. There is nothing wrong with that. It's just like going to school to learn skills of your trade. They'll teach you other skills and help you along your way of self discovery.
1	My 2 cents are, well I somewhat struggle with the exact same thing. I'm not sure how you came to get a S/O. I guess things are different since your a woman.but what I'm working with now. Like my new perspective on things. Is to practice the art of being CHILL. Don't atangonize when it's no need to too. Etc. Being chill dosent mean to be nonchalant or not to think. It's more healthy trying to be chill. Than to like to close your heart. 
1	If you hold stock in Meyers-Briggs, check out Eriksons stages of development. Sounds like an identity problem that needs resolving in the era of role model dissonance. \n\nDid you have to start being a grown-up too early?\n\nIf so, someone let you down in the mentorship department during the window of identity formation & you never resolved the conflict:\n\nWho are you, really?\n\nIt's a shame you're not in Boston, I've dedicated my life to helping people answer that question.\n\n
1	One thing to be noted.  If you were in some sort of abusive relationship early in your childhood, you may have serious self esteem issues that you may not realize.  Fe is very easy to wrap ourselves in as a blanket of comfort, helping others to ease the pain in ourselves, instead of actually resolving some intense inner conflicts.  It can be hard to ever see ourselves as a person, because we are so self critical, after establishing a very low baseline of importance on our actual existence.  
49	Does anyone relate to being an Infj with developed Ti?	When I interact with other infjs or read descriptions, I find that some things apply, however, I don‚Äôt experience being so ‚Äúfeely.‚Äù For a bit I was considering that I may be an intp or intj, but neither is as relatable as the infj. I‚Äôm beginning to suspect that it‚Äôs due to a developed Ti. I used to be very feely until maybe a year and a half ago when I started to get treatment for my depression. I also suspect that in order to cope with my depression I started to develop my Ti in order to function in society? Has anyone experienced this? Also, I used to type as a 2w1, which never felt right, and after treating my depression I typed as a 5w4, which feels right.
18	The problem you're having comes down to what you mean by "feely."  Look at the functions Fi and Fe.  Once you got out of your unhealthy self obsession (fi) you started using Fe. A healthy INFJ isn't some emotional wreck. If anything they're emotionally detached with a keen insight into the other (fe) 
12	I've observed this behaviour in myself on several occasions. \nMy dad is an istp, so sort of insensitive logical thinking was a big part of my childhood. \n\nI adopt those qualities when I'm in a hole I can't see my way out of. The hole could be made by stress, depression or whatever. The main focus here, is why those qualities pop up. A frontal collision is easier to survive, if you don't have to deal with the pain. My subconscious knows this, because I've observed my dad for years. He dealt with issues without flinching. Not in a client Eastwood kind of way, but he was so fast to decipher the actual issue and work out a solution. It wasn't always an easy solution to handle, but a solution none the less. \n\nIf the hole is too deep, you get stuck trying to think your way out of it. It's easy to lose yourself in this phase. To paint a picture, you take on a whole new *temporary* brain inside your brain to help deal with internal sinkholes. \nIf you're not aware that you're just borrowing it, things go numb. Fast.\n\nThe subconscious is a funny entity, because it's sort of like having training wheels on your bike of life. It does a thousand micro shadow-decisions on your behalf every second, generally ensuring that you stay safe and happy. Happiness is of course extremely relative. \n\nMindfulness is a great thing to read into. It lets you observe what your subconscious is trying to achieve. It's like looking at a drawing you did as a kid. Sometimes you can just see raw feeling manifested on paper, but you had no clue at the time you drew them. \n\nI've found that Infjs already practice mindfulness, unknowingly, and can very easily start seeing a purpose with it. You can begin observing your thoughts and easily map out what things you've "borrowed" from others and what things are truly your own. \n\nFinding the tether to *you* is vital. It won't kill the beast, but you will be able see it. Clearly. In broad daylight. That's pretty cool üêá.\n
10	Yes. Subjectively it appears the emotionally healthier I have become, the closer to an INTJ I skew to the point I don't really fit in either box all that well any more.\n\nI don't mean to imply INFJs are unhealthy but in my case, as I worked to remedy my unhealthy emotional state it necessitated strengthening my Ti, at least relative to my Fe.\n\nThis might be better described as my increasingly developed Ti as a side effect of working on myself or that the Ti came along for the ride ... or even letting Ti do more of the driving as opposed to mainly handing the wheel to Fe by default.
7	I kinda feel like I‚Äôm not always as feel-y as the INFJ is painted and I‚Äôm not always as logical as the INTJ is painted. Like somewhere in the middle of the two. Whenever I take the test my T and F is always basically 50/50. But I guess with only 16 types and billions of people in the world you‚Äôre always gonna end up with some crossovers. 
5	The opposite happened to me, in a way. I suspect I was an INFJ in denial, because I kept getting INTJ on the tests. I think, as a teen, I used to "look down" on feelings, that thinking things logically was somehow better or more clever. I would often ignore my feelings and not take other people's ones too seriously, supposing that thinking would always get the best results. When I got depression, the "ignore my feelings" started working against me. It isn't until I started to really care for myself honestly, care about my emotions and who I was, that I began to improve. I do have a highly developed Ti, but I think that Fe is where I strive.
3	My wife who is INFJ relates not so much to being more Ti but being more analytical and ‚Äúcold‚Äù in her decision making. I believe this is due to Ni making decisions offline so that there is distance between an object and the decision regarding it.
3	My INFJ has a pretty developed Ti. He‚Äôs not very feely at all, which is just how I like him. Sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm the feely one, and people complain that I‚Äôm really not feely. Feely doesn‚Äôt sound like a word anymore. 
3	I definitely feel this way. When I am around feelers, they are way too emotional for me - they stress me out. When I am around thinkers (INTPs), they are too cold and logical for my liking - they don't realize how hurtful hard logic can be. BUT I can keep up with the thinkers intellectually - this is where there seems to be a divide on this sub. It seems like people paint this picture of INFJs as being these super empathic, emotional people who only use Ti when they are "stressed". I have always tested as very smart by every "standardized" test I have taken. I feel like my ability to both empathize with people and accurately think through complex ideas and situations is one of my greatest assets. I am a THINKING feeler. I want to know what is accurate and true (not what feels right), but only in the context of what is helpful and applicable when dealing with others.\nSometimes, Ti hurts me and I overthink/get stuck in loops of thought, but it is also very beneficial for me.\nMaybe this is why I had trouble when I was dating an ENFJ, because her Ti was substantially lacking.
2	Balance is key! 
2	yes. but i am a 5w4, and have a terrible childhood which fits the 5 type, so it's probably that.
2	I'm very much the same. INTJ is always my type every time I take the MBTI on different sites (even on myersbriggs.org). For the most part, INTJ really resonates with me but as I get older I have started to realize that I might be INFJ with repressed Fe. I have read about the cognitive functions in depth and comparisons between INTJ and INFJ... but I can't figure out if I use Te vs. Ti or Fe vs. Fi. For the most part, when making decisions I consider what is rational and logical for the context. If other people could be impacted by my decision, I consider them first and weigh the pros and cons. I also consider what would happen if I made a different decision. I care a lot about ethics. I work in healthcare and became physically sick when I saw that my company was potentially putting people's lives in danger through negligence and greed. I became tenacious in my quest to get them to see what they were doing by speaking up on every call, scheduling meetings with my boss where I blatantly stated we were jeopardizing patient safety. I had little regard for my position and just said what I was thinking. This says INFJ to me. However when I am thinking through a problem or under great stress, I organize everything by writing it down or doing something in my environment because I can't sort through tons of information just in my head. (INTJ?) I don't care if I hurt people's feelings if is a better alternative for them that they just can't see yet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI started showing symptoms of depression when I was 9 years old. I wrote in a diary that "today was a grey day" when I was that young and just felt dead. Fast forward to now, 21 years later, and I still battle it but stay on medication to function. Under extreme stress where I can't really do anything about the situation, I brood and think about myself in a negative fashion and think about how I can "think" myself out of the situation. If I think I can do something about it, I feel better by doing as much as possible to fix the situation (like applying to jobs if I am upset with my work). Very much resembles a Ni-Fi loop and Te. At the same time, if I am in a group of people, I pay attention to whether people are having a good time or not and try to engage a person if I sense they are not. I also get fulfillment out of "developing" people or help them figure out what they aspire to and help coach them to their goal. I'm super awkward though with feelings and other people. At work I also don't really keep track of people's personal lives easily/naturally and usually stick to business-talk only. I love solving a good problem and only like solving problems with people from a distance, although I don't have a problem with confronting someone if it has to be done for progress to be made. It's a constant battle and I behave differently depending on the context. My brain is always conceptualizing how my actions can impact the world. I play out scenarios in my mind and replay things that happen "in the eyes" of the other person to make sure that I didn't say anything offensive or come off in the wrong way. It's also VERY important to me to be and to appear competent. I also re-read anything I type after I send it and try to picture how it might come across if I wasn't me. This is something I do naturally and it drives me nuts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMuch like you, I think living with depression for so long has caused me to develop coping techniques so it's difficult to know what is the "natural" state.
1	Yes. I think I have strong Fe but I can easily "turn it off" almost. I read INFJs on here say how they always feel the emotions of people around them so strongly, and it's like I can do that but in a way that it doesn't really affect me. I think I'm somewhat logical but make decisions based on what I want to do/"feel like" doing, which makes more sense to me as far as Thinking/Feeling goes.  I want to think it's because of a developed Ti and developed Fe, too.\n\n\*Edit: also I focus on Fi a lot so that may be part of it??? Not sure if that's even possible
1	When I began learning programing it vastly improved my Ti. The principals used here can apply to so many areas of life. I also now find it easier go too deep into Ti, in an unhealthy way. But then at times, I get way too feely as well. It depends on the situation. I think, like in all things, we need to find a stable and healthy balance.
1	Ni is not feely at all.  \n\n\nFe being the second function actually means INFJs can control it better than say ENFJs for whom it is the main driver/raison d'etre. What is impossible to shut off for an INFJ is Ni, not Fe. We can and do shut off Fe. Fe is there to help us express Ni, not the other way around.  \n\n\nNi can sometimes feel like Ti. And we do use Ti a lot, but not in the natural way an INTP does.
1	I am a totally warm fuzzy-feely INFJ who has been in a super analytical, problem-solving STEM program at university and can totally relate to this. My Ti was underdeveloped until I took all those math and science classes. I think it helps me with executive functioning tremendously. But yeah I was also stuck in Fi and am trying to get out of it, which it sounds like that was part of the issue.
-1	INTJ by myself when I'm alone... no one around to catch feelings from, INFJ when I interact with people -\_-; \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI thought this was normal? \n\nBut yeah my whole family are probably T.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
71	Scientific evidence for MBTI	Ever since knowing about mbti, I've been skeptical about its validity. There has been little scientific proof to back it up, and most scientists think that it's stupid, even comparable to something like astrology. However, the more I look at the world, I realise that mbti is actually so accurate, and wish there was some kind of scientific basis for it.\n\nRecently, I finished reading a book on neuroscience, and there were so many times throughout the book where the model of the human brain described in the book was so similar to the model that uses cognitive functions.\n\nI'll name a few examples. At one point, the book talks about there being an area of the brain that focuses on concrete data and details, and then there is another area that is used for extracting a theme/meaning from given data. These brain areas are next to each other, so someone who has a well developed 'concrete' side will have a comparably weak 'meaning' side, because more neurones are being used to focus on the concrete data. As I was reading this I thought that perhaps someone with a strong 'concrete' side would be a Sensor, while someone with a strong 'meaning' side might be an Intuitive.\n\nAnother example was about people who detached from their feelings. If I remember correctly, this was due to lack of parental attention as a child, leading them to not talk about their feelings with others. I thought this might correspond to being a 'Thinker', because they usually repress their feelings and focus more on logic.\n\nSo here's my hypothesis:\n\nCognitive functions correspond to different areas of the brain. For example, someone with dominant Ti might have more neurones and connections in the brain areas used for calculation and logic. These areas will therefore have more blood flowing to them, so you could probably demonstrate this with a brain scan. And your mbti is probably shaped by a combination of your genes as well as your early life experiences. When you're very young, your brain is extremely plastic, so every experience you have actually contributes to the structure of your brain and changes it. As you grow up, the brain becomes less plastic; at this point, I think that your personality type has been set in stone and it is now too difficult to change your preferences.\n\nHehe sorry for the long post, but I just wanted to share my insights with you guys, to see what you think, and if you have anything to add :)
34	MBTI was never meant to be scientific in the sense of calculating brain patterns, brain activity, or what have you, but as a tool used for psychologists and therapists to help better understand the people they work with. We learned about this and other similar cognitive tests in Psychology class (which was years ago but I‚Äôm sure the reasons such tests exist remains the same). Could scientists someday use this as a guideline to help further study thoughts and our brains? Sure. For now it doesn‚Äôt have a place in physical scientific studies, but it doesn‚Äôt need to imo, that‚Äôs not what it‚Äôs purpose is.\n\nSo in other words it not only helps psychologists understand their patients but helps us figure out ourselves too. I was so frazzled before I typed as INFJ, wondering why I was like this and then it made so much more sense. Is it 100% accurate? Probably not. There are a few INFJ-specific things I don‚Äôt relate to. But in general it helped me understand my thoughts/feelings. So if it helps us do that then why need some official study behind it? 
3	What book was this and would you recommend it?
4	You gotta read Dario Nardi's book. This is kind of what he researches and he actually does show how different areas correspond to different functions! (Or, how a bunch of different areas correspond - Ne is described as a "christmas light" brain, with a lot of disparate parts lighting up at once). \n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Neuroscience-Personality-Brain-Insights-People/dp/0979868475\n\nAs I remember, it focuses on type & functions as linked with fMRI data from his research. \n\nFascinating stuff that it sounds like you will absolutely love. 
3	I love personality tests. But I understand how to interpret the results and the fallibility of them. I know that I have biases when filling them out and that the results are basically reframing whatever I put into them. I like finding people with common overlaps to myself though, so I enjoy it. 
3	If you think about the history of all things science, at one point, all the shit we know today was considered hogwash at some point by humanity.\n\nThe brain is complex and we have only touched the tip of the iceberg when it comes to personalities. The science could very well be there, it's just that we're not advanced enough yet to turn it into "hard" science.\n\nMy personal theory is that it all has something to do with brain structure. Pretty much like your hypothesis except you said it much better.
2	So where the hell does intuition come from? \nInfj of two sensors, very spooky
2	Science means testing a hypothesis to find a truth, not deciding that something you already believe seems like the truth and finding evidence to retroactively prove it.\n\nI think there are some interesting insights in MBTI but it's not scientific.
2	fMRI
2	Yes, you are right. Cognitive functions are just a hypothetical model, as there had not been adequate means to inspect human brain. Nowadays, we have PET and other solutions to study our psyche.\n\nOne could say that the theory is obsolete... but it still gives us a good basis. We just have to take into account new scientific discoveries.
2	I once ran across some site on the internet that tried to bridge MBTI ideas with claims about the relative distribution of particular neurotransmitters in the brain.  I admired the attempt, but I don't know how accurate it actually is.
2	I think part of the problem is *political*.\n\nNo one's going to test the MBTI model because it's not politically popular with scientists.\n\nThey already have a half-dozen other models (like the Big Five model), that have a lot of political support (and living advocates in the scientific community with vested interests).\n\nScientists really aren't terribly interested in proving some old, dead psychologist right.\n\nThey're out to make their own name with their own theories.\n\nThere have been some tests of it, though.\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8473967](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8473967)\n\n"Evidence for the bipolarity of the introversion/extroversion dimension was weak, and findings did not support the bipolarity of the sensing/intuiting or thinking/feeling dimensions."\n\n\[Which is interesting because "The Big Five" test that scientists like also uses "Extraversion" as a bipolar category.\]\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2709300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2709300)\n\n\[note:   this second study was by McRae (the same guy who made the Five Factor Model)...so I'd take it with a grain of salt - he obviously is not "objective" (as he has a vested interest in his own model).\]\n\n"Consistent with earlier research and evaluations, there was no support for the view that the MBTI measures truly dichotomous preferences or qualitatively distinct types; instead, the instrument measures four relatively independent dimensions. The interpretation of the Judging-Perceiving index was also called into question. The data suggest that Jung's theory is either incorrect or inadequately operationalized by the MBTI and cannot provide a sound basis for interpreting it. However, correlational analyses showed that the four MBTI indices did measure aspects of four of the five major dimensions of normal personality.   The five-factor model provides an alternative basis for interpreting MBTI findings within a broader, more commonly shared conceptual framework."\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd, on the flip side, I don't see *any* studies at all on PubMed re: the "accuracy" or "repeatability" of the Big Five Personality Test, so...who knows why they prefer it.
2	It might not have any scientific proof behind it, but I think the mere existance of this very community is some sort of proof. If it works, it works, and right now, I think it works well enough
1	There is some correlation to personality type and most activated areas of brain but still it's hard to call it as scientific evidence. More to read here:\n\nhttps://www.psychologyjunkie.com/2017/08/10/use-brain-based-myers-briggs-personality-type/
1	Your very welcome and I wish you well on your journey üòä. Our development has many possibilities after all. It‚Äôs a joy communicating with you. I like the direction your going no matter the path you take. You‚Äôve been very inquisitive, caring and courteous.Thank-you.
1	The problem with *any* psychoanalytical theory, is that it is not scientifically (or if it is, it wouldn't be ethically) testable. Psychology is philosophy. Anybody who says otherwise is deluding themselves. I do not mean to say that the study of the human mind is not valuable--it obviously is, however, a science it is not. The term "soft science" gets thrown around and I would tend to agree with that description. There is certainly a scientific process, which gives psychology validity, but "psychology has failed to produce a cumulative body of knowledge that¬†has a clear conceptual core that¬†is consensually agreed upon by mainstream¬†psychological experts."^(1)\n\nMBTI is based off of clinical research by Carl Jung (the founder of analytical psychology), which was later interpreted by Meyers and Briggs. It's about as scientific as you're going to get in the field of psychology.\n\n1. [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/theory-knowledge/201601/the-is-psychology-science-debate](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/theory-knowledge/201601/the-is-psychology-science-debate)
34	infj + intp relationships: strengths and weaknesses?	So, I‚Äôm interested in an intp, we briefly dated but i ended things for personal reasons. I expressed wanting to be with him again and right now we‚Äôre seeing how things go and he‚Äôs still figuring out whether he wants to give it another go. Anyway, what are some strengths and weaknesses you guys have experienced/observed in this pairing?
20	This is only my personal experience and going with what limited information you've given...\n\nCommunication is key. INFJs wear their heart on their sleeves but a lot of the time it can be misinterpreted. Be honest with how you are feeling because when you say you are 'fine' or 'okay' the INTP will take that at face value.\n\nMy INTP is the only one who has ever really seemed to 'get' me. Before I say something, even if it is obscure, or related to something in a weird way - they know what I am thinking. Share and embrace your weirdness. \n\nDepending on the circumstances the INTP may be hesitant to open up. They are tough nuts to crack. When you do get that 'in' with them it is a bit of a vulnerability. \n\nIn general - like with all relationships no matter what type the people are - just be open, be honest etc. I think looking at specific issues in relationships is easier when looking at MBTI types because then you can adjust how to approach the topic that they will understand. For example if you're upset about X - approach your INTP with a sort of cause and effect approach (x happened which lead to y) whereas this would not work with all types. \n
10	The strengths that I'd appreciate from an INFJ perspective would definitely be potential intellectual discourse, generally being logical and usually having somewhat of a geeky nature which results in a lot of deep and fun, sometimes weird interests. The main weakness would be a relatively low capability and need for processing emotions on a mature level. That would be the hard part in the relationship.
9	I've been dating an INTP for over 3 years. (Male INFJ, Female INTP)\n\nOver the course of our relationship, we've definitely learned a lot from eachother. She has taught me to consider possibilities that I would have otherwise filtered out, and I've taught her that emotions are real things.\n\nWe both think very differently due to her EN vs my IN, and this can create a communication problem when discussing ideas. We can both have the same logical conclusion, but take very different routes to get there. To me, her logic can seem un-thought out, and to her, my logic can seem shortsighted.\n\nWhen asked "does X make sense?", I check it against my existing knowledge base to see if it fits. If it doesn't fit, I discard it and say it doesn't make sense. She however, has a lot of simultaneous smaller knowledge bases that aren't necessarily connected to eachother, and is more likely to find a spot where it fits.\n\nIf you think of it as a jigsaw puzzle, I like to build the frame first and build inward, where she likes to build a lot of small clusters and hope to eventually connect them.
10	I'm with an INTP, and I'll say right now it's the most fulfilling and comforting place I've ever been romantically.  It's a challenge in many ways, but oh so worth it - and I feel like they are challenges that really help me grow.\n\nOur strengths seem to come from a balance of our dominating functions. We are both strongly intuitive, although in different way (Ni vs Ne), which makes us both in tune with each other without having to explicitly say everything.  We have lots of laughs together by noticing things around us at the same time, not having to explain where our heads are at to be able to bond over a similar reaction in the moment.  Our conscientiousness together is really rewarding, the little things we do for each other and even those around us because of these traits really brings a warmth to the relationship.\n\nIn the past, I dated other "feeler" types. And it was exhausting.  My Fe is particularly strong, and can absolutely overwhelm me. Having someone not only a dominant thinker, but leads with thinking and paired with an extroverted intuition means my worst stormy feeling moments are tempered almost effortlessly by my partner's steady Ti.  I also have Ti in my stack, so what my partner communicates to me almost always makes sense, but it is never dismisses my emotions for making it hard to accept. A feeling type feeds my emotional fire, while a less understanding thinking type is too dismissive of my emotions to get me to come around.  With an INTP, there's a more noticeable consideration even if the emotional side doesn't really make "sense" to them.\n\nSo that brings me to the weakness...the Fe is SO weak with INTPs.  Mine in particular has expressed to me just how frustrating it is, and has said they worry about being enough of an emotional support for me because they just don't "get' that stuff.  Personally, I think my INTP expresses emotion and supports me way more than they realize, but I'm getting better at taking this into account when I'm trying to plan things my Fe would love - because it's just not a comfortable place for them to be.\n\nThe other thing is that INTPs are much more in the moment, where as I'm always looking at the future. It's hard to discuss future plans with them, because unless it requires immediate action they don't see much point in dwelling on it. It's a strength, though, to have a balance of these two perspectives, because neither one is always right or always wrong.\n\nI rambled a bit, but only because I've been so happy in my relationship.  I recognize the weak points, but more importantly I see where our strengths will be able to support those points through tougher times.
9	I had a crush on an INTP coworker and although we never dated, I could tell it would be a very fulfilling relation in terms of intellectual stimulation. Strengths would be in communication and while it would be great to understand each other on a whole another level, a weaknesses would be the emotional stuff. INTP will try to understand but their lack of Fe development wont always work with INFJ. INTPs have this chill factor, they always tend to be laid back at times can be frustrating for INFJ. But because INTPs are always open to learning, they'll try to see your side.
7	Currently an INFJ (F) in an INTP (M) relationship. \nYou‚Äôre in for a really really wild ride and regardless of the compatibility between you and your partner you WILL grow a lot. My INTP and I have broken up and gotten back together a couple of times. I‚Äôve never felt more comfortable around anyone else, ever, but I do struggle getting him to understand how I process and feel things. 
6	Female INTP with a female INFJ. We share a lot of interests with each other and that's great; we're both big gamers. I'm going to school for engineering, she's going for bioinformatics, so the STEM connection is also great. We avoided some pitfalls while falling into others sometimes; I'm very open with my affection but expressing negative emotions is like pulling teeth, and sometimes when she comes to me for reassurance I go into fix it mode and offer advice instead. Also this really fun thing where it drives her crazy when I nitpick certain details in her arguments that bother me and she feels as if I'm ignoring the whole point of what she's saying just to be irritating. \n\nWe are good at being apologetic when we mess up, and understanding of each other. Be patient and kind, and communicate. If your INTP interest is like me, then it would probably help if you prompted about their mental state sometimes  - it is really hard to do so on my own. 
4	Male infj with a female intp here. Only person to ever see my core, and I love every minute of it.
6	I want an INTP!  :(   \n\n\nINFJ here and I've loved every INTP I've ever met.  Yall are so dorking cute.
4	INFJ (f) with my INTP husband. We've been together for almost 14 years. I think the biggest strength and weakness in our relationship has been communication, in that it can be great but could also be a downfall. I think that both types greatly value being genuine, so communicating what you actually feel and think is so appreciated by both. However, showing your true self through overt expression means different things for both personality types. I think you have to figure out each other's communication style. I have found that I tend to expect my husband to know what is covertly behind my words when they are maybe vague, but he is understanding me through my overt expression. This can turn in to me becoming frustrated about why he didn't think I felt a certain way since I would have looked beyond his words for more meaning. That said, I think we have both gotten better in that I try to say what I'm really feeling and thinking in clearer ways, and he tries to understand me beyond just what I say. We are at a point where our communication is great and I think we understand each other better than anyone else; I even think he understands me better than I understand me, which is interesting. It's the best, most interesting relationship in my life and he really is my best friend. He has also helped tame my anxiety around having everything always planned out, which has made me feel so much better about the things I can't control over the years. He helps keep me grounded and enjoying the here and now rather than always focusing on the future and what comes next. Good luck in your relationship! 
4	INTP(f) with INFJ (m). We probably haven't been involved romantically long enough for any major issues to come up yet (or maybe we really just vibe that well?).  But it's been pretty great in the 5ish years I've known him. Echoing everyone else in this thread, I've never felt as comfortable with anyone else. We're very open and honest with each other, and the unconditional and endless support we share is so important.  I think we both want to be the best version of ourselves and encourage each other towards that, though we know and accept the other as they are (if that makes sense?). We both understand and appreciate alone time and giving each other space; we do pretty well with balancing spending quality time together and keeping time for ourselves. Ni/Ne sometimes makes it seem as if we're reading minds (we're both still getting caught unaware when we jinx each other or make a freakishly accurate prediction of the other's behaviour). I love that we're able to joke about tinfoil reddit theories and almost imediately switch gears to philosophical analysis.  It probably helps that we have a lot in common and share a similar level of curiousity and open-mindedness when it comes to our differences and new experiences. \n\nWe can both be a bit caught up in our own worlds though, and it's a struggle to keep each other grounded at times.  We get lost, forget, and walk into things fairly frequently. I can also be extremely vague in my instructions, expecting him to be able to inference information that seems clear to me. So far it's not been a major issue thanks to frequent and (I think)good communication. We're also very quiet people, which some may see as a problem in a relationship. But mostly we're just sorting thoughts out and suck at putting them into words, and we understand that.  He's also much better organized and more of a planner, while I revel in chaos and spontaneity. I forsee that may come up if we ever live together.
1	I (INFJ) broke up with my INTP half a year ago after 6 years, the second half of which were brutal on us both. Definitely agree with everyone pointing out the amazing intellectual compatibility, we could discuss concepts and ideas for hours on end, the sex was great and I've never felt closer to anyone else in my life. Even before we actually got together, we both sensed we could be safe and secure with each other, and when we did get together, there was an emotional intimacy the kind of which I've never felt with anyone else. We were best friends and loved each other so much, I still struggle to understand how it could all go so wrong, even though rationally, I know we both lacked the emotional maturity to handle the challenges/weaknesses of our types - both of us have ADHD and unintentionally hurt each other a lot, he was depressed and I grew anxious, and the more he withdrew, the more I tried to help and disregarded my own boundaries and needs. Eventually things boomeranged to me becoming resentful and frustrated, and him feeling like I was prying, nagging and had too many expectations. All of this was exacerbated by us both being in difficult situations professionally. If we had been under less stress and better able to see our relationship clearly, we would've realized that we weren't right for each other, but the idea of losing each other was too scary too entertain, so we clung to each other instead which only prolonged the pain. We were only able to relinquish our hold once we overcame our professional difficulties, and by then we were exhausted from trying, and getting progressively more disillusioned with each disappointment. \n\nSometimes I think that, if we had met each other later in life, which the experience we have now, we could have maybe made it work. When things were good, we were amazing together, but when things went south for one or both of us, we weren't able to be there for each other constructively and pulled each other down instead. Imo this pairing needs a lot of emotional maturity, self-awareness and the willingness to be humble and patient for it to flourish.\n\n&#x200B;
15	INFJ (Female)/ ESTP (Male) romantic relationships	I just figured out my boyfriend is an ESTP. It‚Äôs taken 9 months to type him... which is an unusually long time for me. Has anyone else been in a relationship with an ESTP? \n\nI think we work pretty well together. Better than my two other relationships which were with an INFP and ENTJ. We have the same functions, just reversed, which I think comes in handy. The only thing that truly irks me is his self-proclaimed ‚Äúrealistic‚Äù view on life (I personally think his view is pessimistic not realistic). \n\nWhat are your guys‚Äô experience dating ESTPs? What worked and what didn‚Äôt? Thanks!
6	I personally could never have a partner whose outlook on life is pessimistic. I'm very sensitive to other people's emotions and that kind of thing would just poison me, you know?
2	My "realistic" ESTP friend is draining his relationship with his pessimism. Good thing that you spotted this behaviour. 
2	Sorry not to be offensive but I would avoid es types like the plague when it comes to dating. Ive met a few and while they can be fun people life of the party types , they cannot hold a deep conversation or have any interest in abstract conceptual thinking. Their extroversion is literally exhausting and neither of us feel comfortable in each other's energy. I'm fairly attractive so I have had some es types chase me before but they give up quick when they sense how deeply introverted I am. I'm also not attracted to their 'here and now sensory' mindset instead of looking at the big picture and being future oriented. \n\nMaybe I'll meet an exception but so far I haven't seen any. I pretty much will only date intuitive types as we can have the best conversations. 
1	I've tried this, but in my particular instance it didn't work out. I was the one who made the first move (uncharacteristic for me), and I felt like we were on the same wavelength at first... Until I couldn't deal with his lack of regard for time and plans. I'm still not sure if he just wasn't that into me or just is horrible with time, but I cut off contact after explaining to him why it wasn't working for me. I tend to think you make the effort if you're into someone, full stop, but I posted about the situation on the estp sub (second in my posting history if you're interested in the full story) and got a lot of feedback to the tune of it's a characteristic of the type to be flakey about plans and although it was rude, I might should have given him more chance to reveal himself. Eh, whatever. I need to feel respected to open up and enjoy someone's company, and that was lacking.\n\nHowever, with a more mature or developed ESTP I'd be willing to try again. The things that were great about our dynamic were really damn great. I usually gravitate towards introverts for romantic relationships, but I'm beginning I might need a more extroverted, full of life energy / playfulness to bring out the best in me. I also think I have a strong sense of inner peace that can bring out the best in some of the more live-in-the-moment types.
1	Complex meet simple
8	Update on the MBTI website and the like minded individuals for the 16 personality types have been rearranged...	Now what am I suppose to think?\n\nSo I've been studying this for a long time, pride and true INFJ, went from Turbulent to Assertive, which I think is the confident individualism they added to it (the healthier INFJs I'm assuming, I'll thank my therapist and some drive within).\n\nI've been using this Meyers Briggs model, and even seeing the I and E version of each type as nearly the same in different situations and circumstances, but the model has been effective I'm my predictions and planning with making new friends and getting along with the kinds of personality types I'm able to recognize, and even types I have clashed with in the past, before knowing the reasons why we were bonking heads. Basic mistakes in getting along with others, but things I wanted to get better at. \n\nI'm not discrediting the model and how someone uses it or how it's helped them, but when the website categorizes celebrities that we get to see their behavior and personality show (interviews, podcasts, way to pick up on behavior vs. acting in a movie of course), and then whoever is organizing the celebrities and what their types are decides to switch everything around, there's a lack of consistency that would need an explanation if they have made corrections to their examples.\n\nPlease others, share your thoughts and feelings. I still trust myself and what has been working for me, and I'm always considering new ideas and perspectives, even if it doesn't always change my mind, you have to be open to new ideas and change.\n\nEdit: re-read this myself, and figured the people who decided fo categorize celebrities just aren't qualified. You have to meet the person yourself to see how you interact with them and watch what they do to know who they are.
10	I think with the flux of people suddenly communicating more about this, information changes. I‚Äôm not saying that the new information invalidates any person but does open new ways to reflect. Personalities are on a fluid spectrum, so even tried and true INFJs can tether between similar types. \n\nThis kind of reminds me when astronomy discovered the Ophiuchus constellation and made the implication that there was 13, not 12 astrology signs. You are what you feel you are, I don‚Äôt think any sort of rearranging is going to change that
7	What is this website? Also, the MBTI is not even an original theory. It‚Äôs developed from Jung‚Äôs psychological types. So if you don‚Äôt like the theory of some website, you don‚Äôt need to adhere to it. Develop your own. 
2	> even seeing the I and E version of each type\n\nI don't think you are in a position to discredit the model... really...\n\n> I still trust myself\n\nthat's good and important, you go you
20	INFJs and criticism?	I can't I can't I can't take it. I appreciate criticism of my work because how else would it be perfect  right? I can even take criticism about my way of living and my performances because that's  what will help me improve and change and give me insight into what's accepted, what's not.  \nBut what I can't take it criticizsm of my personality. No no no it kills me it kills me,  now as a very low Fi user I barely know what I feel most times, it's just the feelings of those around me and so I have pretty much -100 self esteem or worth. \nNeither can I offer it criticizsm, except with a mix of compliments that aren't even false because I do see the best in people.  \nMaybe I just need to tame my Fe to accept my flaws?  How do you infjs deal with criticism?
11	Is the criticism solicited? \nDid the criticizer ask permission before doing the deed?  It did they just spew?\n\nI don't tolerate unsolicited advice, because I always ask permission to be that forward. \n\nUnless I truly value the person. Unsolicited criticism is fucking rude.
5	I personally let it roll off me. Possibly pretentious but what do they actually understand about me? They only see facets of my personality through my work, my words, my attitude. So why does it matter?
3	I'm in the same boat. My greatest fear is letting the people around me down. I cannot handle someone being disappointed in me. I hate conflict and will let things slide until that door slam vibrates the building. My self esteem is nil. The only time I feel pride is when someone compliments my work. I am uncomfortable when someone compliments me because I feel like they're just saying pretty words and don't really mean them. I don't see why anyone would compliment me for being me. \n\nI mean, I'm just.... meh.
3	If it's genuine & caring I'll at least consider it as I would want people to have the same headspace when I give them advice.\n\nThe intent of the criticism or advice is exactly what dictates how I feel about it. I try to put my ego aside and consider what is said.
3	I take criticism extremely hard. It's because I'm such a perfectionist, so hard on myself, that if someone else is critical of something I feel like I should have already recognized and dealt with it. And if it's something I didn't realize was wrong then what if there are other things I think I'm doing well that I'm not? And I'll sort of go off on that spiral.\n\nI'm getting better about shifting it to a positive, recognizing it for a chance at growth, but it's not my go to perspective.
2	maybe it's rather a problem of return information as you do not have it as an infy in self-destruction
2	I actually don't mind criticism of my personality, with negative Fi it kinda doesn't stick really, unless it's an opinion or angle I haven't considered before, then I'll be mulling over it awhile.
2	Develop a better understanding of where such criticism within people is born. I have been a highly critical person in the past at times, but with more experience and self-inquiry I came  to see how much my criticism was more about my inner-landscape and relationship to self, than anything someone outside of me was up to. Such self-awareness can be quite painful to develop, I had to work through a lot of shame and disappointment to really own it, and to this day there are past exchanges I tend to reflect on and still feel very 'icky' and embarrassed about. But I'd start with that, understanding the psychological nature of the need to criticize. It'll not only reinforce how much it isn't about you, but may even allow you to develop great empathy for your critics.\n\n‚ÄúNo human face is exactly the same in its lines on each side, no leaf perfect in its lobes, no branch in its symmetry. All admit irregularity as they imply change; and to banish imperfection is to destroy expression, to check exertion, to paralyze vitality. All things are literally better, lovelier, and more beloved for the imperfections which have been divinely appointed, that the law of human life may be Effort, and the law of human judgment, Mercy.‚Äù \n‚Äï John Ruskin
2	My parents were verbally abusive. My father in particular was really astute at knowing just the right thing to say to crush me or make me doubt myself.\n\nMy rule is the same for all criticism across the board: unless it's constructive criticism with a suggestion I could implement, I assume they're saying it to be a dick. I find that the more personal the criticism is, the more likely the person is just being a jerk.
2	For sure my biggest issue in life that I need to overcome to be even better adjusted person existing in this world is my ability to not internalise criticism.
2	I don‚Äôt know if you guys can relate but I hate when I‚Äôm talking about something I like/know a lot about and someone comes with criticism or saying that they are better than you in that. \nFor example: I was talking to my friend about some makeup look I wanted to do (I do my make up everyday) and she lectures me like I was a noobie and every time I tried to make her stop she would keep going after a dirty look
2	Maybe it's because I was raised with very narcissistic family members and people in general who basically told me I was a worthless piece of shit since I was born but I've gotten desensitized to the point (and jaded ) where I don't really give a FK. \n\nOfc if it's from someone I really care about and love it will hurt but at the same time I just have become numb to it so it really doesn't bother me that much. I'm extremely introverted even for infj standards so I am kind of deep in my own world. I retreat into the recesses of my mind and I tell myself that deep down I know what I am and I can see what they often can't about me. \n\nSome criticism I genuinely understand since I am highly critical of myself as well, and when I can logically understand it doesn't hurt as much somehow. If it's actually a problem I try to work on it. INFJs aren't perfect nobody is. We all have our own flaws and we have to be tough to face it and change it if it's a problem instead of feeling sorry for ourselves forever. Nobody can change you other than yourself. 
127	DAE try to avoid going out as much as possible due to being sensitive to others emotions?	For the life of me I feel nothing when I‚Äôm by myself but as soon as I step outside it‚Äôs just so many emotions and I‚Äôm sensitive to every single one. I‚Äôm sometimes so sensitive to others emotions I have to tell myself to chill out because I get lost in feelings and I can‚Äôt decipher which emotions are mine and which are others. Most of the time I can‚Äôt even recognize what the actual feeling is, unless I think about it. I‚Äôd rather feel less by staying inside more and maintain a normal emotion level than to go outside everyday and feel so much.\n\nIs this Fe?\n\nIf so, fuck Fe. 
39	Yes, this is Fe. It takes practice to learn how to protect yourself from everyone else's emotions when you leave the house, especially if you would prefer to not feel everything from everyone. One idea is to try using various visualization exercises whenever you're out.¬†\n\nFor example, imagine that you are completely surrounded by a beautiful protective light of your favorite color. The light is all around you and goes everywhere you go. It is always there, protecting you from everyone's emotions. If someone's emotions start to overwhelm you, turn up the brightness of the light in your mind as you're talking to them, so that you're protected even more. When you get home, turn the light off in your mind. Turn the light back on when you leave the house again.¬†\n\nIf you're around someone who is especially draining, you can put up an imaginary wall between yourself and them, essentially putting a strong, protective barrier up in your mind. The wall can be made out of anything you choose. Imagine the wall and also turn up the brightness of your light. You'd be surprised how this kind of imagery really works if you try it. Plus, the more you use this imagery, the better you'll get at it and eventually it will become second nature to use whenever you need to. You can do all of this secretly in your mind without anyone being aware of it.
11	Very much so. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where I know why people are feeling a certain way, which is a whole ‚Äònother level of wtf. When I was younger it would just about break me every day because I didn‚Äôt know how to shield myself from it all. I would come home at the end of the day feeling completely drained. Even now I still have days where it gets the best of me. It makes me feel sick to my stomach sometimes if I get overwhelmed with others‚Äô emotions. Other times it makes me anxious. So overall I just try to avoid people as much as possible.\n\nHonestly at first it felt so mean to me to block people out because I like helping people, and feeling their emotions helps me with that. It felt cold and callous to me, like I was disregarding their feelings. But I learned that my own emotional health has to come first or I‚Äôm not going to be in any shape to help anybody, and it‚Äôs hard to know hey this person is struggling with an assault or this person is worrying about money, because I can‚Äôt always help them or fix things for them. I also block my loved ones out completely out of respect for their privacy.\n\nBest advice I have is that even if you feel emotions you don‚Äôt want to, work on letting them go. Let them bounce off of you. Pick your battles - not everyone or everything is something you need to pay attention to or help fix. Easier said than done but it‚Äôs possible.
8	I see everyone as a character that I've already seen.  Except some people have the same character and different backstories.  I've learned that only the novels I want to read are the ones I care about the outcome.
6	You are very HSP (highly sensitive person).. you are sensitive to STIMULI like most introverts. Have you read Susan Cain's book? She explains this very well.. she's an introvert herself and the book really has good tips and suggestions, I highly suggest you give it a read.
6	Totally was in those shoes a while ago. Eventually I realized on my own that the only way it's going to be less of a problem is if I can accept it being apart of my life and work with it the best way I can. It's still difficult to really know most of the time, but I feel more familiar with it and prepared for it, especially if I go out with people I already feel comfortable letting my guard down around, and sometimes it's after the day or the week that what happened that day makes sense, and sometimes not, but I got better at letting go of what I can't control which can be empowering.\n\nI also still require a lot of alone time, and probably always will. But it's much easier than it used to be for me, which I think just comes with experience and understanding who you are, and that's how you grow and change, so there's hope! Don't give up!
5	I don‚Äôt know that I actively avoid it.  But I find my own home peaceful and it‚Äôs just where I want to be when I‚Äôm not working.  I go out when I need to.  Or when I‚Äôm heading out for a hike with my dogs.  
4	Only time this bothers me is when I actually talk to people. So I just hide in the corners and enjoy the energy in crowd. I get pretty uncomfortable in large groups, so I stay away usually. One person not bad, especially if drunk. Then I can laugh at them and ignore all feelings. Very easy lol I like live music for hiding in corners. 
4	I think it's the Ni-Fe that causes this, not as much just Fe on it's own. For me it's more of a sympathetic feeling than an empathetic one. Not sure if that helps. I'd imagine Ne-Fi users (ENFP's) can perhaps "feel" others emotions in the more empathetic way, as in they actually internally feel it, which sounds equally as terrible haha (or awesome depending on who you're with). For me, I just *understand* other peoples emotions really well, I don't actually feel them as much. The level of understanding can be intolerable at times, I agree. Especially if I'm around people with anxiety or are not genuine. Then it reeaaaally suckksss.\n\nI'd love to hear an ENFP's views on this because this is just a theory I've noticed anecdotally with an ENFP friend I have.\n\nOh, and alcohol. For me, drinking alcohol depresses the heightened sensitivity of Fe, I've found. Alcohol probably affects each type differently, which is interesting to think about...
1	You can leave the fucks at home and go out
1	i wish i could relate to that, but my biggest problem with being around people is that i analyze them to the point where i notice minute inconsistencies in their appearance/behavior and my Ne compels me to point out and everybody thinks im weird
1	Yep fuck Fe!!!!! I don't think I feel nothing. It just seems that way after the barrage of others baggage. I do sometimes get angry or frustrated at them. Like, holy green hell! Will you people just quit???\n\nOh? You see the color orange....why does that feel like something to you??? Oh great now it's yellow,....why are you so damn excited??? Don't you dare fuck! You did didn't you? You saw green! Great!!!! Now I remember your great grandma Bertha's house too!!! üòÇ
-4	Could you be anymore dramatic?
5	My guts says INFJ, my brain says INTP, and they're at an impasse; What type do you think I am?	
4	The test is only a good way to ballpark your MBTI type; the result is inconclusive. The wiki states these facts and more, but in addition, you may find [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ir-ypPLUdxY) to be helpful. His other videos state other methods that one can use to type themselves/others.
1	I wouldn't rely on opinions or these charts, but try to relate to your own experiences. Since it's a matter of Ni vs Ne, maybe think about how each function can apply to yourself. Personally, Ne has me always picking up new interests even if I give them up later, or being quite impulsive with my thoughts. I cant tall about Ni a lot, but from what I've heard there seems to be a more confident, decisive, thought out approach towards your future or life concerning Ni.
1	im betting on intp\n\nalthough the chart doesnt 100% determine your type\n\ni personally have a very strong Fi (even though that should be the weakest for intps)\n\nmy functions (in order from strongest to weakest) go something like this:\n\nTiNeFiNiSeTeFeSi\n\nas you can see, this sort of looks like intj squashed with intp\n\nand honestly, just go with your intuition\n\ninfjs are avid thinkers\n\nintps are not the emotionless robots everybody thinks of (intjs are tho)
1	A unicorn-shaped snowflake. USSF for short.
1	**Read-up on inferior Se, and see if it resonates.**
1	Usually, guts are correct. However, I have helped some better then a test could. Asking questions over behaviours is usually, I think, a better indicator. If you still havn't found the answer, could you answer these questions?:\n\n1. Do you see yourself as introverted but sometimes randomly extroverted?  \n2. Have you ever felt like someone was sad/angry/other unusual emotion/state without them saying it or being obvious?  \n3. When talking to people, can you pick-up when they are starting to be bored of what you're talking about?
1	nobody ever stays one type. carl jung said this himself. i wish i had the context, don't remember when and where i read it
12	Wanting to be Honest?	Bit of a question!\n\nOftentimes when I'm at work I notice my coworkers, if they're having an awful day or they're family member or whatever texted them angrily, on their period etc. They show it. They get testy with others, or are just very morose, are short with customers etc. I always feel like I want to be the same way sometimes.\n\nI just want to be upset, and actually show it just a bit, but I can't do that without fearing being looked into too much, or worrying that I'm being an inconvenience or an asshole. I'd love to just show emotion so I wasn't always so ridiculously fucking tired when I get home, but I feel like an absolute nuisance. \n\nI don't know how to even approach this situation because all of me doesn't want to be any more inconvenient than I already am because of an occasional mistake.
4	I think showing those kind of feelings doesn't belong to a work place. Except maybe period pain, that's physical and can't always be controlled.\n\nMost people think that they are stoic and put together, they are just not very aware of themselves. So they don't always understand how they can be read like an open book. Of course there are people who think they have the right to burden coworkers with their bad feelings and do ot on purpose, and those have to be put into their place pretty bluntly.
2	have any close friends who wouldnt mind if you vent out at them? thats what i do
3	NO I GET THIS ^^^^\nAnd you wonder how people can just say what they‚Äôre feeling so effortlessly, and you wish you could just let loose and say whatever and not worry about being a burden, but it just feels so unnatural and you also don‚Äôt want to deal with the pity/misunderstanding/other reactions that your honesty would lead to. Yes. I know exactly what this feels like. 
108	Not good at seeing how i'm perceived	I know my internal self but have trouble seeing how others see me from an external perspective. And this is kinda why I don't like being filmed/listening to a recording of my voice because it's kinda like, is this really me? Also, when someone points out something about me/my personality randomly sometimes I'm just like whaaaat? You really think that? E.g. I've been told by my sister that I always appear bored when I'm out in public, which I really didn't realise at all.\n\nAnother example is when I was in school people used to call me pretty and stuff, but I never internalised these kinda compliments. I mean, it didn't have an effect on my actions / confidence level or anything like that, or make me walk around with the confidence that people find me attractive (I think if I did I would have been in the 'popular group'). I don't know if this makes sense?\n\nI don't know, I just feel like my internal self and my external self are really separated or something... I think I'm trying to say that the two don't align with eachother in some kinda way? \n\nAnyway, I want to start making YouTube videos so that I can try to improve myself and my awareness of my external self through opinions of others (i.e. comments) and stuff. I also want to do it just to share my interests with others and not keep everything to myself, because sometimes I'm just like, honestly, there's really no need to be so private. YOLO. Joking that was cringe lol. \n\nSoo anyway, does anyone have any tips on how I can be better at perceiving myself in the eyes of others? Because I don't think it's good that I only seem to be interested in who I think I am inside. And do you think that the YouTube thing will help (even though I'm most likely going to find watching myself really cringe at first)?\n\nThanks for reading this incoherent mess and for any answers :) 
27	This is EXACTLY me. I just graduated and now it‚Äôs time to look for a job. I‚Äôm really nervous about interviews because I feel like the way I‚Äôm perceived is nothing like who I feel I am on the inside. I hate that because in the workplace, especially in business, impression management is so important. I‚Äôve been wondering if I should just find a way to figure out how I‚Äôm perceived and then align my personality to that so I can survive and make a living... although as an INFJ I‚Äôm stubborn as hell and don‚Äôt wanna compromise on who I am lol.\n\nI also feel you on the videos thing. I‚Äôve been meaning to buy a camera so I can practice taking photos and making videos of myself to better understand how I look to others. I‚Äôd honestly loooove to talk more about this with you if you want to. Its something that‚Äôs been on my mind a lot lately and is also bothering me..
17	You are living too much in your head. Getting some exercise, even just doing some stretching will help pull you out into the world around you. It‚Äôs easy to get distracted by all the thoughts but we have to keep ourselves grounded. You‚Äôll know you‚Äôre really there when you slip into wordless thinking.\n\nWhat does this have to do with other people‚Äôs perceptions? Well when people give you feedback that you consider to be trustworthy, I strongly suggest you take it seriously; one thing about living in your head is you just aren‚Äôt that aware of the larger, aggregate picture of who you are. You can‚Äôt really see the whole picture with your nose pressed against it. In this way others can be a valuable resource in our growth. \n\nBut you probably have no idea what they‚Äôre talking about, right? Practicing external awareness in the moment is how you eventually begin to catch yourself doing whatever it is. Then you can backtrack to see how you got there, and potentially fix some serious miscommunication or other unhealthy stuff. Stuff you didn‚Äôt notice but others might, like visiting someone‚Äôs house that smells funny lol\n\nI have definitely struggled with this too and stumbled upon this answer years ago after taking up yoga. Good luck!
11	I'm very much in the same boat.  Any time someone tries complimenting me it rolls right off and I think they're full of crap. In an attempt to counter this, I asked a friend to do a photoshoot with me. I hate being in front of cameras and seeing pictures of myself. This friend's older sister has told me several times that he really looks up to me, so I'm hopeful that he can capture my essence from am outside perspective.\n\nWhile lurking this sub, I'm starting to realize some of us INFJs need to give ourselves some grace and not be so hard on ourselves all the time. At least I do. \n\nGood luck on your videos! 
6	Here's a 180 view on the worry of how others perceive us: Anything more than a (very) minor curiosity in *anyone's* opinion of us is going to be harmful to our plans and peace of mind. As soon as we give this wondering energy in our mind space, we begin to edit our behavior to appease our imagined knowledge of someone else's thinking. \n\nI can be so stark with this that I literally say, silently to myself: "It's none of my business what anyone thinks of me!" (works very well for me, to bring me back to centered stability)
11	INFJ's 6th function is Fi (also known as the 'critic'). This basically means that the (immature) INFJ can spend a good amount of time self-criticizing during the day. Hence the self depreciation (pretty obvious in this post :)) and not feeling worthy of compliments that other people give you.\n\nINFJ's 7th function is Te (also known as the 'trickster'), this function, or the lack thereof makes us oblivious to how we are perceived by other people.Te is all about how other people think (whereas Fe for example is all about how other people feel).That's why INFJ's generally struggle with how other people perceive them. It is said that it is possible to emulate Te by using the Ni-Ti axis, I'm not exactly sure how this works though.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy advice would be, just straight up ask to a person how you are being perceived. If that's too scary you could also reflect on your actions with someone you are comfortable with (for example: w/ a colleague after work or with a classmate after a project).Good luck!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: your post was perfectly fine, why have you deleted it? :)
3	I feel the same. Exactly how you described, in pictures, voice recordings or videos, I've always avoided that kind of stuff, because i thought "that can't be me" and started to film myself so that i could have a glimpse of what i looked like or acted like, in private obviously. Through out time, I've changed the way i acted, and spoke (the tone, vocabulary) my posture, facial expressions. But to this day, unless I'm playing a character that i use to be around certain people, i feel uncomfortable being filmed or recorded. My advice is either do what i did, or get a friend that will be honest, when you ask them to, for personal development reasons ;)\nMaybe what i did isnt seen as the most moral and real way to be myself, but thats how masks work :) Either way i seeked change and i did it. Find a way that works for you and explore it.\nBtw sorry for this text mess, sometimes the things are structured in my head and then come out wierd. 
3	Would this be related to inferior Se? I keep going back to this function when I think about how I interact or respond to people or the external world. Like you, the way I look/sound is never what I expect when I see myself in photos/videos. I think it goes back to difficulty living in the moment or a lack of self-awareness.\n\nI find that I have stronger Se when I stay busy and social. Mental and physical activities are important--things like exercising, conversations, video games, etc. Also I have to remind myself to actually look in the mirror and make sure I look the way I intend to look. And to be aware of my posture, body language, etc. It takes a conscious effort for me a lot of the time.
3	Try to not worry about what others think.. also don't worry about what you think about yourself. You'll just be trapped in a never ending circle of trying to fit in when you were designed to stand out.
3	I built a circle of close friends who accept and ecourage my weirdness and honestly enjoy my insights. First step was of course having fun with honest conversations about life and patterns with them and the second BIG step was creating conversation on facebook and sharing most of my thoughts and events that occured during the day and also sharing memes :). I encouraged (verbally and just through openness) everyone  to share and now I just don't give a fuck about what people think of me (it sometimes still doesn't work out but at least I TRY my best at not giving single fuck at how I'm perceived and it's going pretty well so far). I obsessively try to do every weird activity I'm scared of being judged for. I think this is how we can reach our full potential in life and in general live a happy life.My IDGAF (I don't give a fuck) state started just 2 weeks ago and I feel like I can achieve everything in life now because of that attitude. In my opinion that fear of being judged and not accepted by the society is the worst enemy for infj. Unfortunately, that IDGAF attitude won't work fully unless you make sure that you are trully accepted somewhere in the world.
2	I'm an ISFP and your post resonated with me a lot. 
2	Yes, I very much relate. There was one of those weird Facebook trends a couple of years ago where people were posting 3 fictional characters that combined would make up their personality. It was just a silly thing but it drove me fucking nuts that I could not come up with my own. I worry that I am boring or lack personality, or maybe I just take on the traits of people around me. However I could very easily name characters that describe people close to me. Great, now my head is swirling again!
2	I feel a lot of this, even though just today I was thinking about how since I know how I'm perceived by other emotionally I can say the right thing to help them. \n\nAlthough the whole not liking my video taken, recording thing is so me. Also trying to change the way I'm perceived to not... Put others off if you know I mean.\n\nAlso when others compliment my look or physicality I just idk. I get so weird. It's like I don't take it as a positive thing others do. \n\nAnd yeah. Sometimes I'll see myself in the mirror and be like "wtf? Is that me? What?" Like most of the time i feel I go around and I'm just this ball of invisible energy lol. 
1	This sounds a lot like [cognitive dissonance](https://www.everydayhealth.com/neurology/cognitive-dissonance/what-does-cognitive-dissonance-mean-theory-definition/) to me.  
1	Me! Me! Me! Lol I do at times feel like I'm one of a kind but most actions I display feel quite basic, like they're simply the norm. So compliments require to be pitched to me and then I  buy into it. If I can see the logic behind why you consider me to be sth I  believe it. I'd say find someone who would understand this and deliver without any judgements. I actually prefer to give ppl compliments with a detailed train of thought (heck I overthink so why not deliver some good). For example I  won't simply say "you're  smart", I'll show you that you are and the impact it has made "you remember how three months ago you were able to explain to me x and I'd been struggling with it for years, I didn't even require further study I just aced it, damn you're really smart" (not a good example haha but you get the idea)-basically premise+ premise=conclusion.\n \nI  know not everyone needs all these information but I treat everyone how I'd want to be treated and sure enough it comes back to me. I can't  be sure if this is part of an infj trait but we're impact oriented and seem to be more perceptive of those around us. If you see it making a change out there especially to people you believe are better than you or you look up to , then a small thought will cross your mind 'maybe you truly are smart', then you'll  begin questioning what other things you are not aware of.  Now you'll  be open to hearing from others how they view you and what impact you've made, only now you can make those deductions for yourself with their train of thought. Next time someone gives you a compliment just ask why they say that  out of sheer curiosity, depending on how you frame it people are often so generous with the details.\n\nThe second tip is to take things as an end in itself. As I  write this I'm complimenting myself for writing haha, the ideas I'm  putting out and the insight I'm getting. That to me is enough, the process is molding me and any other feedback is simply an additive. The same should be for you, especially in the case of YouTube videos, instead of ignoring  the process of actually making the video bask in it. Do extensive research on your area, watch videos on how to captivate your audience, put all that knowledge to the test by making a video, edit it accordingly. (You'd  be sharpening your editing skills too.) Then once your final draft is ready, watch it, doesn't have to be perfect but sth you  can sit through once, you might find yourself smiling in some parts. I found out watching it twice in a row will make you start picking it apart with ideas of what others might think. \nThe process  should leave you with a feeling of 'completeness' that no further actions are required but are appreciated. Your work should be a finished good, and the feedback you get are simply ideas for your next finished good.\n\nAll in all be intentional and you'll surprise yourself, so... surprise yourself.  \nSometimes I break out from what Fruit (me) would normally do just to add some entertainment into my lifestory. \nSend me your link once you upload your content. I can't wait to be entertained/educated or whatever else you'll bring to the table ;)
1	If you want to start a YouTube channel because there‚Äôs something you want to share with the world (art, information, etc.) I think that‚Äôs great!\n\nI would really caution you, though, about using a YouTube channel to gauge how you are perceived by others. People can be really cruel for no reason, especially when emboldened by the anonymity of the Internet. My friends who run YouTube channels for their art have to deal with a lot of negative or inappropriate comments. You need a thick skin and also to realize that people‚Äôs words are mostly a reflection of their own inner selves, NOT a reflection of you.\n\nKind people say kind things. Mean people say mean things. You can‚Äôt trust the mean ones, most of the time!
1	I think we think too much about it\n*but I‚Äôll never actually think too much about it*
4	AM I AN INFJ OR INFP?	Looking at the descriptions and personality ticks of both types I‚Äôve come to understand that I have no idea which type I am. I‚Äôm swayed on both and can resonate with each of their insecurities and introverted tendencies. What are some key differences to look for to differentiate the two and to determine which type I truly am?
8	INFJs and INFPs can seem very similar if you are only looking at behavior. If you break down their motives and why they come to certain conclusions, it then becomes obvious that they're incredibly different. Here's a bunch of links which might help you out on our wiki :) [https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/wiki/faqs#wiki\_infj\_vs\_infp](https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/wiki/faqs#wiki_infj_vs_infp)
1	Cognitive functions.. I act more like an infp but I'm definitely infj.
1	You are somebody who didn't use the search button.
10	Would this be an example of Fe or INFJ behavior? Trying to type myself	I feel very strong in Ni, but unsure if I'm Fe or some other type entirely. So today my mom came home and I heard her grunt from downstairs (was on the treadmill). It was pretty sharp and I got a little anxious and felt pretty confident she was in a bad mood. Sure enough, a couple minutes later she blew up on my dad\n I dont even know what it was about because I was listening to a podcast but I could still hear it. When I went upstairs I was pretty anxious and thought she would blow up on me, but fortunately she had calmed down and then I stopped worrying about it. \n\nSometimes when she blows up on me I get the same anxious feeling or I get mad or frustrated at her and start yelling back or make some smart remark that she doesnt like. Is this an INFJ sort of behavior or is this using more Fi?
8	It's kinda hard to tell off that. I'm an ENFP so I have Fi and I get super anxious when there is conflict. 
4	When people blow up at me I'll usually go quiet rather than yell back. I can have loud discussions but essentially refuse to argue.\n\nThat's a whole different story with text though. I'll argue over text all the damn time but find me in person and I probably won't argue because when I argue I hurt people's feelings and I don't like doing that.\n\nBeing anxious in this case feels like like a personality thing though and more of a home-life thing. My dad would blow up every 6 months for the first 17 or so years of my life and everyone in the house would get anxious over it (we were all xNFx types, so it's possible to be an NF thing?) However once we brought it up to him and he has instead worked to change that part of himself which is wonderful to have.\n\nI would attribute it more to home life than personality type. However, knowing that someone is in a bad mood is likely your intuition talking, whether it's Ni or Ne, but I don't think Fi or Fe has anything to do with it in this case. I could be wrong for that though.
1	There's not enough information I think. Your Ni seems accurate, you could be an INFJ or INTJ, maybe even an ENFJ or ENTJ.
1	This will help you type  relatively definitively:\n\nhttps://medium.com/personal-growth/read-this-if-you-think-youre-an-infj-d13bcdb7d21c\n
1	i honestly cannot tell the difference\n\nmy Fi and Ni are third strongest and fourth strongest, respectively\n\ni think they work together?\n\nNi i see best through eureka moments with my Ti\n\nFi i feel all of the time, and i see through Ne (basically personalizing the objective truth)\n\nTi is self explanatory; works with Ne to create a computer-like logical problem evaluating system
5	How does one deal with the overall deterministic point of view that different people have without sacrificing individuality?	Hello all! So, this is going to be long because I‚Äôm in a mood right now and people are starting to bother me with their determinism. All right, so as an INFJ, it‚Äôs customary to play devil‚Äôs advocate even if it‚Äôs not necessarily something we need. The issue with that is that my friend group tends to have a lot of Fi users who either: a) don‚Äôt really like generalizing people and b) empathize with every individual, lest they don‚Äôt share their core values. Now, before I get downvoted to hell, I‚Äôm not trying to generalize and I do get it, but this is based on my perspective and intuition, but it doesn‚Äôt define all people and I‚Äôm sure they also lack maturity in certain cases as well.\n\nYesterday, I had a talk with an ENFP and I talk about how we, as a society can be apathetic and indifferent to the needs of others, but she kept trying to talk about the views of individuals. I understood her perspective, but I do play devil‚Äôs advocate a lot and I mentioned the ramifications of different ideas and how they‚Äôre interconnected and brought up MBTI. She wasn‚Äôt happy with this and started saying that I only think these things because of my current environment (because of issues with my mom). My thing is that we had a talk about an author who was sexually abused and how he went through it in his own terms, then a few days later, he was accused of sexual harassment and she just wrote him off and said he‚Äôs a perv. I thought, wait, what if he genuinely has changed? We can‚Äôt just discredit people just because we disagree with them because that‚Äôs not even how we do it. I have friends that attend rallies that talk about how ‚Äúall white people deserve hatred‚Äù and scream ‚Äúwhite privilege‚Äù and I get what they mean, but I still think their views are nonsense and crazy. They actually said that people have to ‚Äúlearn‚Äù. People are people first, then they are what they are and years of oppression have perpetuated that, but when does oppression end and ownership begin (because there are valid claims). I can tell when someone is weaponizing language for hatred, but I don‚Äôt believe in using my emotions solely. I just use logic to help facilitate them for the greater good. I actually met someone who, when I said that the world shouldn‚Äôt conform to your standards, she said ‚Äúwhy not?‚Äù üôÑ. Jesus Christ. \n\nMorals are great and they make the individual, but morality isn‚Äôt subjective in society and some people believe that the individual is an individual until they violate their personal convictions.\n\nSo, how do I contend with this level of nonsense? Nice again, no generalities, but most people won‚Äôt meet me halfway and I want to know if it‚Äôs the language I employ. And instead of giving logical reasons, they just say that it hurts their feelings and feelings are a necessity, in my opinion, but they‚Äôre not always a useful metric for viewing things and compromise doesn‚Äôt mean that you sacrifice your convictions, but that you just modify your approach.\n\nSo, does anyone have any suggestions because I‚Äôm tired of meeting most people halfway when they get angry and don‚Äôt want understand numerous perspectives. Plus, I‚Äôve been insulted for having a different opinion many, many times.
3	Having Fi high up in your stack and at the same time being intuitive (basically being an xnfp) doesn't go well with infjs tertiary function - ti (logic). Infjs using their third function can be blunt, logical and direct. Ti values truth. \n\nxnfps just want to feel good about something and are not concerned with logic and truth as much as an infj is. This can be really frustrating :/
3	First of all, I think we often like to think of ourselves as very open minded, but the thing is we all have strong opinions on different topics. Sometimes those strong opinions are that other people are close minded and can't listen to other opinions. I like to think of myself as an open minded person, yet I can get pretty defensive or have strong opinions on some things, even if I'm willing to listen to others' and I understand them. I think it is necessary for both you and I to acknowledge that we aren't as open minded as we like to think we are.\n\nSecond, I think a big problem here, at least with these examples, is how controversial they are. Sexual abuse and racism are touchy subjects that have *really* really hurt people, and as outsiders who haven't been in those situations, it can be insensitive for us to undermine or contradict other people's opinions on these topics (especially if they are people who have experienced that hurt). Playing the devil's advocate isn't always a welcome thing when you are contradicting people who have been hurt by this. Someone who was raped usually doesn't want to hear about the rapist's perspective or troubles. Sometimes it is necessary for us to keep our thoughts to ourselves. Just because we think something, it doesn't mean we have to say it out loud. Sometimes it's good to let them keep their opinions.\n\n> I have friends that attend rallies that talk about how ‚Äúall white people deserve hatred‚Äù and scream ‚Äúwhite privilege‚Äù and I get what they mean, but I still think their views are nonsense and crazy. They actually said that people have to ‚Äúlearn‚Äù.\n\nAbout your friends attending rallies, I *do* believe that white people have privilege, so I don't think that's a weird thing to say. I think [this is a good video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZPK57Qv7j0) which explains privilege more in depth. I also think people have to learn. Tv shows, movies, books, the news, the people we talk to, experiences we've had, etc. all perpetuate certain ideas, stereotypes or stories that shape how we view people. This doesn't only mean how we view black people, but also how we view men and trans people and animals and China and flip flops, etc. We are all going to have ideas on how to interact with different people, and they aren't always going to be the best methods for every person. I believe that men have to "learn" not to catcall women, because this is seen as a normal behaviour in many places that many men often haven't questioned or seen as bad. We are always learning and we always have to keep learning, as a society, to improve. Society isn't 100% perfct in how we treat others, so *of course* we have to keep learning. Learning isn't a bad thing.\n\nI live in Catalonia, a region of Spain where there is a strong indepedence movement. Many people around me attend rallies from both sides and sometimes say silly things that I don't agree with. However, I think that when we start to label someone's views as "nonsense" or "crazy", then we aren't truly respecting their views and keeping an open mind about them. If we think someone's views are crazy, then we aren't really truly understanding them or empathising with them (note that empathy doesn't mean sympathy). You yourself say:\n\n> We can‚Äôt just discredit people just because we disagree with them because that‚Äôs not even how we do it. \n\nbut I feel like your thoughts and words are kind of contradictory in the post. I personally, and I may be wrong since I don't know you, so please don't take this the wrong way, that you may need to work on not discrediting people's opinions. A lot of the time we think we are right, but when we catch ourselves thinking that other people are thinking crazy, then it's always a learning experience to indulge them and ask *why* they feel that way, ask them to explain their opinions. Pretend you *don't* know, that you don't have opinions, and listen to what they have to say without judgement. I have learnt a lot this way. Things that I used to think were right or fine or normal were turned on their head when I listened to people's experiences and views that I hadn't considered.\n\nPersonally, I deal with similar situations by simply not stating my own opinions and contradicting them. I get nothing out of it, I rarely manage to convince people who don't want to be convinced and we all leave the conversation frustrated. Sometimes I say "well, I feel like it's good to keep an open mind, since we don't know all the information / we don't know this person and all the details of their situation". That usually helps people calm down and it isn't too confrontational. 
1	I don't really understand your post, maybe because u and your friend have almost same position, u both use only feeling side.. or i dont get it.\n\n>We can‚Äôt just discredit people just because we disagree with them because that‚Äôs not even how we do it. I have friends that attend rallies that talk about how ‚Äúall white people deserve hatred‚Äù and scream ‚Äúwhite privilege‚Äù and I get what they mean, but I still think their views are nonsense and crazy. They actually said that people have to ‚Äúlearn‚Äù. People are people first, then they are what they are and years of oppression have perpetuated that, but when does oppression end and ownership begin (because there are valid claims). I\n\nExtremism can be considered wrong but you should still realise why they are doing it? Try to understand them and listen, without being on someone side but still listening, you will become more open. You decide who is wrong, whose claims are wrong or right, isn't it ignorance, isn't it subjective? Now you should realise why I think position of both you and your friend is same. \n\n> Morals are great and they make the individual, but morality isn‚Äôt subjective in society and some people believe that the individual is an individual until they violate their personal convictions.\n\nMorals are completely abstract like ex. time and morality is subjective, it can't be objective, anything considered bad or good is abstract.. \nSubjective - based on or influenced by personal feelings, tastes, or opinions. So you are trying to use your morals (subjectively) to change someone else morals and say someone else isn't objective, basically it.. You can't be subjective, it's illogical.\n\n\n> We can‚Äôt just discredit people just because we disagree with them because that‚Äôs not even how we do it.\n\nWhy ?\n\n> I just use logic to help facilitate them for the greater good. I actually met someone who, when I said that the world shouldn‚Äôt conform to your standards, she said ‚Äúwhy not?‚Äù üôÑ. Jesus Christ.  \n\nShouldn't you as open type know that not everyone accept doing things for greater good. Sometimes years of opression have it's toll.\n\nSry for bad englando, hope it's good enough to read.\n\n\n
15	What do you think?	u/thechessgoddess and I are currently working on gathering answers for how thought processes work in different types. This is just out of curiosity, not an attempt to stalk you according to how you think of grave crimes. All replies are appreciated!\n\nIf we count moral obligations out of the equation, \n\nQuestion 1: How is murder logically fine?\n\nQuestion 2: How is murder logically wrong?\n\nNOTE: Feel free to write down whatever thought you have, whether it is emotional or just plain retarded. This is a place to express yourself, after all. 
3	As an INFJ, I live by my morals. Continuously becoming a better person morally, becoming aware of my cognitive dissonance and aligning all my actions with my morals is my ultimate goal in life... I think this is a difficult question to answer if you say "no morals"! :P\n\nI think I personally disagree with the wording of the question, anyway.\n\nWe can argue whether killing someone is *necessary* or not, but we can't confuse "necessity" with "morality". Just because something may have been necessary, doesn‚Äôt make it ultimately good (and vice versa). You said no morals, but I think you chose words ("fine", "wrong") which carry moral connotations, thus making the question near impossible to answer without some sort of overlap. I think this happened because morality and logic aren't two entirely opposite concepts. I think morality could be considered a tool towards making a logical choice. We often use morality to point us towards a logical solution.\n\nAs for my personal opinion, I do not believe killing another is usually a moral, ethical or good act, and as such, I wouldn't say killing is "fine" even if it were arguably necessary. I think that, when we label a death as "necessary", we often forget about the morality of it, leaving the death of a person or animal to our logic and ignoring the worth of the victim, their impact, the feelings of those who loved them, etc. Even when a death is arguably necessary, we mustn't celebrate it, we mustn't feel proud for it: we have to make sure situations like this never happen again and put all our efforts into finding peaceful solutions in the future. We must properly respect those who died, even if we can't forgive them, apologize for the harm we‚Äôve done, especially to the families and friends, and not forget about the true victims of our actions.\n\nKilling is (morally) wrong, in my opinion, only when it hurts somebody. Whether that be the person being killed, the family, friends, ripples through society, etc. If someone is completely alone, nobody will care if they died, and they also want to die, then I don't think it is morally wrong. If everyone involved will be happier after the death, then I don't think it is morally wrong either. And so it is also *logically* fine.
3	I‚Äôd say murder is logically fine if that person is a direct threat to you or someone you care about.\n\nI think it‚Äôs wrong in any context where you are the aggressor, there are other alternatives or if it is purely an act of revenge. \n\nI‚Äôm an ENFP
1	Really stumps me..if we count the moral obligations aside. I mean..I hope I'm understanding the exclusion of moral obligations correctly. I'm just going to blurt out all the thoughts, lol.\n\n1) So..murder can be..maybe.. considered logically fine..when if someone actually ends the life of another person who's driven by the urge to harm others? Mentally or physically..a person who's ruthlessly ruining other humans' experience of their lives, really doesn't deserve to enjoy a life of their own either.\n\nEven after saying that, I feel weird for the murdered person. Smh.\n\nSo..yeah..maybe murder can be considered fine if the person who's murdered is an absolute despicable human being with no one to mourn for them. Or if it's like a whole family of absolutely utterly bad people. Like, purely bad, people who care about nothing except themselves.\n\nLife..this.. chance to be alive.. everyone has the right to enjoy that. But nobody has the right to ruin others experiences. And I think the latter holds the upper hand, in case both of them clash.\n\nI don't know why I am thinking this way but.. whatever, lol.\n\nSo that's for the first one.\n\n2) Well, I already feel the contradiction between the answers.\n\nMurder can be considered logically wrong for one fundamental reason - no human has the right to take matters into their own hands and END someone else's life. All living beings, the "living" component in them, they can be considered equal. Under no circumstances are one person given a greater "right to live" than the other. So murder can be seen as a violation of those rights. And these are fundamental, unwritten, basic rights. It could be considered as true as the essence that governs the Universe, the laws and.. I hope I'm making some sense, lol. So..yeah..\n\nMurder is logically wrong just because of the "thing" that no living being has the "greater living essence" than the other to consider ending the "life" of another living being. May it be humans or what not. Rather not talk about animals.\n\n*Even though humans are animals too..*\n\nAnyways, I'd say those are my quick, raw thoughts.\n\nI hope it's somewhat helpful with whatever you're doing. Wish you all the best for your work\n\nPersonally I definitely agree with the second answer of mine, lol. Just..putting it out there.\n\nThank you for the opportunity to just..think. Haha.\n\nGood luck.
2	So, how do you think the different types would respond? 
2	Question 1: Murder is "logically fine" when used in self-defense.\n\nQuestion 2: Murder is "logically wrong" when the killer seeks revenge against their victim; when someone kills out of spite, not for defense but for offense. 
2	Nothing is inherently right or wrong, only what you want to believe. Otherwise the world is a raw input sandbox.
1	>If we count moral obligations out of the equation,  \n>  \n>Question 1: How is murder logically fine?\n\n\- If we consider that the murder is committed to avoid a larger amount of future suffering, perhaps it would be logically justified. For example, someone who decided to kill Pol Pot or another murderous dictator would be saving thousands of future innocent lives.\n\n\- Or, if we take a cold evolutionary perspective, anyone who can't prevent themselves from being murdered is simply being eliminated from the gene pool as too weak for survival. Their demise would then lead to a stronger next generation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Question 2: How is murder logically wrong?\n\n\- Committing an act of murder would be opening oneself up to retaliation or vengeance. As no one wants to be murdered themselves, this would be logically contrary to their own self interest. \n\n\- Risk of punishment and capture is high in a society with less and less room to hide oneself and hide the evidence due to technological advancements and reduced unpopulated space. Therefore it would be against one's self-interest.\n\n\- Murdering weaker members of the species might make the next generation stronger, but could also destroy other valuable characteristics and create less population diversity, which creates a higher risk of inbreeding/susceptibility to disease.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. But all this aside, it's just wrong because it is! Ahhhhhh!!! Why am I even writing this??? That would be the emotional side of the equation :) Thanks you guys, interesting topic. Looking forward to seeing what others think.\n\n&#x200B;
1	I don't think you can technically ask if murder is logically fine. Is there anything logical about murder unless it's about survival (someone trying to kill you, deserted island and not starving, etc)? So, I guess in one of those scenarios, it would make sense to logically murder, as it is the most obvious step in ensuring your survival.  \n\n\nNow, I don't think its logical, but I can see how people could justify murder from an emotional standpoint. Or, many people argue the "greater good" idea, does it make it allowable to murder someone that's going to harm others, that would go on to harm others? What I they're not actively doing it at the moment? Or would never behave that way then? Is it justifiable?  \n\n\nI think I could also see an emotional reasoning of people who murder for revenge over a child, loved one, etc. I wouldn't say its logical, and I can't say its permissible, but I understand the motive. Which, is hard to balance out with the idea that we should also offer mercy and forgiveness to people. 
1	I'd say murder is justified if the murderer was being terribly tortured and didn't have time on his hands and self defense by killing the other was the only option\nIn all other cases, it's wrong\n\n-INFJ
1	Extreme external aggression towards you or a cared one if unavoidable. You as hard as they do, balance. You end what they started, as humanely as possible.
1	Murder is justifiable the second one human violates the rights of bodily autonomy of another human. \n\nThe right to bodily autonomy is so engrained that even dead corpses have rights that their bodies cannot be used without their express consent, given before death. We Revere this right so much that we set aside thousands upon thousands of acres to bury our dead, their bodies intact as the currently accepted social mores of the burial process will allow. \n\nWhen one violates another humans right to bodily autonomy, they are showing their contempt for life itself, and must be exterminated. \n\nA humans right to bodily autonomy will always supercede any other right on this planet, and any concious violation of it is enough to warrant a death sentence. \n\n\nThe real question is not when is murder justifiable, and when is it not, but who should be designated to carry out such sentences, because becoming the cause of another human beings death warps the individuals responsible for it, creating callouses that shield them from how precious it is in order to save their own sanity, continuing the cycle of contempt for the right to bodily autonomy. \n\n\n\n\n\n
1	1) Self-defence. Also something something trolley problem\n2) Not the above
1	1 When capability becomes a necessity.\n\n2 When capability becomes an irregularity.\n\nYou see, a capability does not necessary mean you should whenever you want to but it will understand whenever you did.\n\nIsn't freedom just fun when we're all capable of certain things. Like just 1 simple day is capable of driving you to insanity and murdering a close relative out of impulse. Or a whole brutal year of anger, resentment and vengeance can make you forgive a person just at the last moment before you wanted to drive a knife into them. I love the randomness of it, the sheer chance  \n\n\nWe are all x until we become y. That's why randomness strives.

1	Logically speaking, there is no such thing as fine and wrong. Anyway, I'd love to see the results of your research on thought processes, will you publish it somewhere?\n\nQ1: Murder is ~~fine~~ justifiable (by law) when:\n\n\- you have to murder one person in order to save the lives of more than one person;  \n\- in a warzone fighting against an enemy;  \n\- it is out of self-defense and your live is in danger.\n\nQ2: Murder is wrong when:\n\n\- they don't apply to reasons given above.

7	My sister and I have many problems, but one of the hardest for me to handle is her constantly giving me advice, telling me what I ‚Äúshould‚Äù or ‚Äúshouldn‚Äôt‚Äù be doing, how to do things, etc. It‚Äôs nice that she is trying to help, I appreciate that, but it is a constant stream of unsolicited advice. Practically the only things she says to me nowadays are what I‚Äôm doing wrong and what I should be doing.\n\nFor example, a while ago I told her I was going into the city to meet some friends‚Ä¶ and she proceeded to tell me which train to catch (when she didn‚Äôt know where in the city I was going) and to look at the timetables. I go into the city practically every month, I used to study there for four years and took the train every day, I obviously know how to take the train‚Ä¶ yet, instead of asking me about my friends or what we‚Äôd be doing, or just making kind conversation, she started telling me how I should be doing the things she knew nothing about.\n\nI know this is her way of being nice, but I‚Äôm tired of her constantly telling me what to do and feeling like she‚Äôs treating me like I‚Äôm stupid. If I say ‚ÄúI know‚Äù or anything along those lines, she feels attacked and like I‚Äôm ‚Äútoo proud‚Äù to accept her advice because she‚Äôs younger than me.\n\nThe same happens outside of normal conversation. When she is angry at me, which is basically every day, she tells me everything I did wrong and need to change. I have many faults of my own, and I try my best to listen to what she says I need to change and do so if possible. For example, I have been working a lot on my temper these past couple years and I think I finally don‚Äôt yell or act out in anger like I used to. But now, when she‚Äôs angry and I don‚Äôt yell back, she is telling me that I simply don‚Äôt care about her. I feel like everything I do or say is misunderstood to an extreme degree, the other day a simple ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt need to apologise!‚Äù (I was trying to be nice) turned into an ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt accept your apology because I‚Äôm better than you‚Äù in her ears and she got *so* angry at me.\n \nBecause she feels like she is constantly helping others (and she *is* giving advice and help, it‚Äôs just not usually welcome), she also feels entitled to my help whenever she wants it. She is constantly asking for favours that are quite big, tiresome or difficult for me to do, or simply last minute so they are inconvenient, rarely saying thank you, and getting angry or disappointed if I say no. In that case, *I* feel guilty, because she blames me for being selfish for not helping her. I don‚Äôt think she realises how much she asks me to do, it‚Äôs a habit that she‚Äôs never focused on (and I don‚Äôt really want to point out, because she‚Äôll tell me I‚Äôm selfish and it‚Äôll make things worse).\n\nMy sister is a very negative person. I think she is going through a rebellious and difficult time, so I try to be patient and understanding, but she is really weighing me down and making me unhappy every time I see her. If she were anyone but my sister, I would‚Äôve door slammed her years ago. I love her so I don‚Äôt want to lose her, but I just can‚Äôt stand being around her and I don‚Äôt know how to fix things.\n\nI don‚Äôt think she is going to change these behaviours if we sit down and talk. Every talk we‚Äôve had has ended up with me feeling worthless, being blamed for various things, and I don‚Äôt feel like anything has changed with our talks. If I want things to improve between us, I need to change *my own* behaviours and thoughts, because I can't change her. Any help would be deeply appreciated...
5	To start us off:  \n\n\n**What is some of the best career advice someone told you as an INFJ?**
3	I‚Äôm totally in love with an ENTP (I‚Äôm female 26, he‚Äôs male, 29) and I don‚Äôt know how to move on. I‚Äôve been in love once before (not sure of his type but definitely an extrovert and a feeler) but even this is different. I haven‚Äôt felt this way before about someone, even in my serious relationships (There‚Äôs been 3 major ones, lived with 2 of them, again not sure of types but all introverts and all about 2 years in duration.) He‚Äôs incredibly messed up from his last two relationships and has made it clear he is in no space for another relationship. But we‚Äôve been sleeping together for the last five months, we attempt to go time without speaking but the longest we‚Äôve ever gone is a week- one of us always caves and texts the other when drunk. We‚Äôre strangely codependent with each other, obviously share great attraction to each other, but lately I‚Äôve been struggling immensely with my mental health and he struggles with PTSD. We used to be a good thing for each other and care for each other greatly but  now it‚Äôs so messy and I keep pouring out my feelings to him but he literally can‚Äôt respond and will say ‚Äòhow was your night?‚Äô He‚Äôll always avoid it, but still want to continue speaking to me. \n\nIt‚Äôs probably as basic as he can‚Äôt give me what I want and so I need to move on, without the hope of something more, it‚Äôs just so hard. As an INFJ I find it so difficult to make real, genuine connection with others through which I feel totally understood, and he really offered this. He always understands me, always reassures, always cares. \n\nWe poured all over each other for a couple months, and for a bit there his care for me and understanding was so consistent and intense and wonderful, it was like I found both the security and stability I‚Äôve desperately craved my whole life, while he also made me feel like I was on fire. We used to spend hours on the phone and he would tell me dumb stories from his childhood. When I was sick at his house one night, he kept my hair pulled back when I was throwing up in the bathroom and literally picked me up and carried me to bed where he had food and water waiting for me with my phone on charge, took my shoes off and tucked me in and when I woke up he was in his pjs sleeping soundly, laying propped up over me with his arm around me like he was protecting me. When he has nightmares I hold him in his sleep and stroke his back and he audibly would calm down. \nOn Christmas Eve he was super drunk and said to me ‚Äúwhat if you‚Äôre actually perfect for me and I‚Äôm just fucked?‚Äù\nHe was always there for me when I was upset. I deeply care for him and appreciate his intelligence and love him. \n\nHe‚Äôs just so unbelievably shut down emotionally and I also need to totally sort my life out. \nBut I still feel like I want to marry the boy. He‚Äôs so beautiful to me and I can‚Äôt help but think about how it could be.
3	I'm questioning my own INFJ-ness lately. Previously -- mental illness kept me homebound whenever I didn't have to go to work. But now with my newfound ability to be out and about with out panicking I find I can't stand to stay at home all day long on a weekend anymore. I just HAVE TO GET OUT AND SEE THE WORLD AND THE PEOPLE! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy introverted partner, could stay home all weekend long if he could. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot really looking for advice I guess -- but wondering if I'm more extraverted than I thought? 
2	I'm looking to change careers from tech and software focused to a more people-facing role.\n\nMy current job is very unfulfilling and mind-numbing. My potential job would be as an account manager, which is a person that is kind of an advocate/intermediary between the client and the company. Conceptually, I don't know if I'm attracted to this position because I genuinely like it and is compatible with my personality, or because I just want out of my current one. \n\nAny thoughts?

1	 Question: as INFJs, do any of you think my friendship with my INFJ best friend will ever be the same? I hurt her feelings and am an ENFP. \n\nSummary: I kept ditching her to hang out with my new boyfriend (classically douchey move, I know) apologized about it very late, and have received no reply. \n\nFull story:\n\nI will try to be brief, but I struggle with that as an ENFP haha. \n\nBasically I have attachment issues which cause me to latch onto people one at a time and then like, jump along to the next person once that one is no longer available for whatever reason. I decided this past fall semester would be the semester I changed that about myself (I am in college). Cue my friend. \n\nI had an INFJ friend who would casually reach out to me from time to time. We always said we were destined to be friends bc her mom was best friends with my aunt growing up and they still talk. I had just left a codependent relationship, and I was determined to not rely on her too heavily. So I started free therapy from my school and we moved into an apt together w 4 other girls. \n\nEverything was going well at first, bc I was acting like myself and we would spend time together and we were very honest all the time. I was reluctant to call her my best friend in my head bc like I said, I didn't wanna latch onto her and wear her out. But I knew that's what she was quickly becoming. My therapist finally convinced me I was allowed to rant to someone other than her sometimes abt my problems, so I went to my INFJ friend when a speech we heard triggered a traumatic memory for me. I'll never forget how amazing she was in that moment. I suppose I sort have idolized her as this mothering goddess this whole time without realizing it, and this whole story just proves why that wasn't good. \n\nEventually I did get asked out by this one guy who I had thought was cute but didn't know much about. I went out with him and he is also an ENFP, so depending how into MBTI you guys are, you can imagine how fast we fell for each other. I remember thinking before our first date, "ok, he can be in my life, but not my whole life." Trying to get myself together ya know? And it worked like that for the first little while (which I'd estimate is the third fourth of the semester). \n\nBut, the more I fell for him, the more I worried I would lose him if I didn't provide constant attention. I didn't realize how seriously worried abt that I was bc the more time I spent with him the less time I spent journaling, reflecting, or even sleeping. \n\nWhen this first started happening, my INFJ gal pal would kinda joke abt it with me, "when did you come home last night?" and stuff like that, bc she knew I was so sheepish abt it. I was always like, "I'm so sorry I came home late," but she said it was fine. And it probably was, I don't know. But this next part wasn't. Not at all. \n\nSince she and I were roommates and close friends, a lot of our plans during the week were casual things like watching movies or going on drives and they rarely had a specific time or anything like that. They were usually tentative plans. Because of this, I thought it would be ok to skip out on them sometimes to go hang out with my new boyfriend. Really not cool, especially since people used to do that to me all the time in high school. But at first, I only did it sometimes. And I always said sorry, and she always said it was ok. So then I assumed, "Wow, she can handle way more of this kind of thing than I can" and I just kept pushing it. I told him I was stressed that I didn't hang out with her or our other roommates enough, and that they were mad at me abt it. I dont know that I really believed that so much as it was easier to believe she was mad than it was to believe I was hurting her.\n\nBy the end of the semester we hadn't spent any alone time together, just me and her, for like 3 weeks. I was missing it, but I thought that if she was saying this was fine she probably didn't miss it as much as me. I justified my actions to myself. I told myself that if it really hurt her she would come to me about it. I told myself that if I had really hurt her feelings, she would've brought it up one of the times I sheepishly apologized as I slunk back into the apartment at 3am to see her half-asleep on the couch. I told myself that since I'm going on a mission trip soon for my church I was doing her a favor by getting her used to life without me. As though that's even my choice to make for someone.\n\nThis past semester I was home. I kept in touch with him and her, but mostly him. I'd send her little jokes every now and then and him dozens of texts everyday, plus do phone calls every night. I had it in the back of my head still, that something about my behavior was just wrong. I thought if I sent jokes more frequently it would sort of make up for my douchery. I wondered how she was doing, but I never asked. I was afraid she wouldn't answer or even have serious conversations with me anymore. Once, we made plans to facetime but she forgot and they fell through and I was too embarrassed about my past behavior to reach out again. \n\nThen I planned a weekend trip to visit them both back at school, deciding that I would just have to SHOW her I had changed. I told him leading up to the trip that I was there to see both of them as a heads up. I failed her one last time, basically. I let her know leading up to the trip when I'd be in town and then when I got there, I texted her to see if she was busy. \n\nShe said she was gonna have a bunch of friends over at her place and I should come. I had tentative plans with him that night as well, but I didn't tell her that. I just figured both of them would work out somehow. I really should have. \n\nI got to her place and she was excited to see me. We hugged. She showed me a new tattoo, told me, "we should talk," and I said I agreed bc I was dying to know how she was really doing. Then I left early to take him to dinner, promising I would come back to the get-together after. She asked me to take a picture with her just in case I didn't. For some reason, that request was what made me really recognize how used to being pushed aside I had made her. I felt terrible. But I came back to the party with him in tow. The next day, she drove me to the airport. He asked me if he could come along, and I asked her. She said it was fine. I know it wasn't. On the drive there she explained her new tattoo and talked about her depression, something I had talked with her a lot about before I started flaking on her all the time. I cried listening to her terrible experiences. She laughed and said she wouldv'e cried too if it were me talking abt those things to her. \n\nSuddenly I was through the airport security and very alone. I called him and burst into tears, lamenting what a terrible friend I had been to her. He said, "Baby, you can always apologize, that's what i do to let people know I'm sincere." I said, "I don't know that she would see it as sincere at this point," but I was so anxious and full of regret that I sent one anyway. Here is what it said:\n\n"Hey \[INFJ\], I wanted to apologize specifically for not warning you beforehand that I might leave your get-together early. I had tentative dinner plans for either that night or the next one (before I realized my flight was in the afternoon) and I wasnt sure how things were gonna go down. But I should‚Äôve just explained that.   \n I did that a lot in the fall too, and I am sorry. If I wasn‚Äôt sure what I was doing I just wouldn‚Äôt mention it until I was basically out the door. I felt like a flaky roommate but I had trouble figuring out what I should do differently.   \n I am so grateful for your friendship and your patience with me. I‚Äôm glad I could see you again before I went back home."\n\nThat was two days ago, and she has not read it or replied. She does send me and another old roommate jokes in an instagram groupchat, but that text is unopened. I get more regretful and anxious everyday. Today I checked pinterest to see that she shared a post which reads, \n\n"'My silence means I am tired of fighting, and now there is nothing left to fight for. My silence means I am tired of explaining my feelings to you, but now I don't have the energy to explain them anymore. My silence means I have adapted to the changes in my life and I don't want to complain. My silence means I am on a self-healing process and I am trying to forget everything I ever wanted from you. My silence means I am just trying to move on gracefully with all my dignity.'- Aarti Khurana"\n\nIn 28 days I leave for my mission. I will be gone for a year and half, and only able to contact people via email once a week. I wanna know from the perspective of INFJs, do any of you think our friendship will ever be the same? 
4	Pete Buttigieg	Does anyone else think he's an INFJ? I've been very intrigued by him recently, and I can't hold myself back anymore. I need to know his type.\n\nNi - He's articulate, and well thought out. He may have Ni because he seems to have very clear visions, especially about the future. He's VERY future-oriented actually, and he's all about "out with the old, in with the new."\n\nFe - He's kind and respectful. He doesn't place a divide between his party or anyone else's, and he'll stay calm even when things are getting heated up. This also makes me worried that he might get trampled in debates, but let's hope that's not much of a problem. Back on topic, his vision is centered around the people. He's trying to help everyone.\n\nTi - I don't really know what to say. His Ti works exceptionally well with his Fe.\n\nand then there's Se which I guess is less noticeable.\n\nI can't really get around thinking that he's an INFJ.\n\nIf you don't know who he is and you live in America, I suggest you do some research. He's a really promising presidential candidate and he's going places. I just hope enough people learn about him in time.\n\nedit: I'm sorry this is rushed. I'm really tired. if you don't research Pete I'm going to have to cut off your toes tonight.
2	I like Pete and you may be right about this one. He‚Äôs definitely intuitive. But Ni is not articulate per se and he gets a lot of laughs. Could be infj but he‚Äôs almost too relatable.
25	Found in INFP. What would the INFJ version be like?	
51	I think the INFJ version would be logic going between its choices. Feelings would then be like wait, but how does this effect people? How will this be perceived? Is there a way to modify it to make it work better? \n\nMeanwhile, your actual feelings would be sitting in a corner like ??? ??? 
20	Me internally: A is definitely the correct option... I‚Äôm certain of it, my logic and emotion have worked together to form the perfect conclusion\n\nOthers around me: (loud debating) B is overwhelming correct\n\nMe externally: I just side with B because I don‚Äôt want anybody to confront my opinion
14	After Emotion chooses B, Logic would lock Emotion in a cage and say, "A! Choose A! Hurry! I can't hold him much longer."
11	A bit like \n\nEmotion: I dunno, what does everyone else think?\n\nLogic: *sweating* Uh, give me like, 4 days to think about it.
5	"What do you think, everyone else?" "B!" \n\n"What about you, logic and emotion (self?)?" "*at gunpoint* B-B....." 
3	https://youtu.be/kup1P_9nQ0o\n\nThis is why I have such a hard time making decisions.
3	Logic and Emotion get into a wrestling match that never seems to end! 
1	ah yes this one.\n\nimagine tho:\n\nwhats morally right versus whats the most efficient/logical
57	Survey on Flirting behaviors and Personality	Hey I am a doctoral Student at a University in the South. I am studying flirtation behaviors, specifically trying to catalog specific flirting behaviors taken from several experimental studies. I was wondering if I could post to this community as it seems relevant to my topic. Thank you in advance for taking the time to take the survey there is an opportunity to win a gift card if the entire survey is completed. You can back out at any time.\n\nHere is the link to the survey\n\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JMQP5PJ
12	A number of questions are particular to the US. Do you want international participation or is this country specific?
6	finished. Question #184 says ‚ÄúI gave them a message.‚Äù Did you mean massage? Or like giving someone a note or letter?
6	jeez that was long. ENTP here. glad to help
5	I just did it. I‚Äôd love to see how your research turned out. üíó
3	Done, quite a lengthy survey, however I'd love to hear about the results sometime. Best of luck :)
2	Done!
2	I took it and finished- I'm enfp though. Good luck with your research! üëçüòÅ
1	Not 18 ‚òπÔ∏è
1	Finished the survey!
1	Done!
1	done :)
1	I did it but absolutely hated it. 
1	On the demographic question is Asian American considered both people whose ancestors are from India and people whose ancestors are from China?  'cause those are two different "races" bud, and relevant to the topic, they're likely to have different culturally influenced flirting behaviours.
105	Any other INFJs not fit the mold of being so sensitive/empathetic?	Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm sensitive in that I completely and intuitively understand what makes others tick and can immediately put myself in their shoes and understand what they‚Äôre going through. But when it all comes down to it, my advice is ‚Äúsuck it up, buttercup‚Äù.  I can‚Äôt stand people getting in the way of themselves and I find difficult to immerse myself in the draining counselor role so many people expect from INFJs in general. \n\nI am methodical, driven and future oriented and I don‚Äôt let emotions get in the way of my plans. At work I was even thought to be an ENTJ by my colleagues and direct reports! I‚Äôve taken the test for 15 years and have always tested as INFJ, so I know it‚Äôs not a mistake. \n\nWhen someone knocks me down, I get right back up and keep going. Sometimes if I feel like it, I retaliate and knock them down even harder. That alone seems like not very INFJ behavior, especially when I read this sub and see so many of you taking the high road. \n\nI know we all come in variations and people are not all going to behave the same way, even if they share the same MBTI, but I‚Äôm just wondering if any of you also feel less like a warm fuzzy kitten and more like a fearless lion? Anyone? Rawr? \n\n\n\n
49	Yeah as an INFJ I definitely relate to not being the warm fuzzy kitten type - well at least not always! I also am not an animal lover, I don‚Äôt wear flowy clothing. I was told by a coach that I likely have a higher developed Ti function. I stopped testing because it‚Äôs more instructive to understand the cognitive functions and INFJ stack. \n\nRegarding the warm kitten analogy: There are some INFJ stereotypes that straight up do not fit me! I can be (when I choose) very warm and charming (ok I suppose like a kitten). But here‚Äôs the thing. I have a dirty little INFJ secret: when someone is sharing their woes I‚Äôm empathizing and while I understand and feel exactly what someone else is... I‚Äôm also detached and objectively analyzing the hell out of it from a million different angles. This perspective-ing allows me to slice through bullshit and deliver a response to someone that is most helpful AND loving. Telling someone flowery shit just to be ‚Äúnice‚Äù annoys me. I‚Äôm most interested in understanding 1) what does this person need RIGHT now (just to be heard? An advocate? Tough love? Affirmation?) 2) what will help them in the long term? 3) how open are they? How much if any permission do I have to speak bluntly with them if tough love is needed? So to me this seems like I‚Äôm filtering my empathy with my Ti. As in the more you develop your tertiary function (Ti) the better you are at the ‚Äúdetached empathy‚Äù or boundaries. \n\nAlso, the entire time I‚Äôm projecting into the future to help them long term as an advocate. \n\nDo any other INFJ‚Äôs relate to this ‚Äúempathetic detachment‚Äù? I‚Äôm feeling deeply what they are but I also feel totally in control of how much Sympathy I illicit and I rarely default to just giving someone a hug and crying with them. I need to hear from other INFJ‚Äôs or INTJ‚Äôs about how they empathize. Chime in peeps! Is this how an INFJ normally empathizes? \n\nHere‚Äôs why this is bugging me: Ive had FP partners and my ISFP sister told me I‚Äôm not empathetic just because I don‚Äôt always respond with the warm kitten hug and tears :)\n\n
20	INFJ M 22 here, i've been tested as an INFJ for 4 years and i can totally relate to this. i don't necessarily feel like a fearless lion but not a warm fuzzy kitten that's for sure. i don't "retaliate" ( i try to keep my calm ) but i do have the "switch" button that makes me really cold/agressive sometimes when am attacked directly. same growing environment maybe ? people trying to "mold" us but never succeeded ? people always criticize/made us feel different ? getting hurt but never letting that get out, always keeping it inside ? from experience i became someone that NEVER shows his feelings or interest even thought i know am not like that.
13	I‚Äôve learned that compassion and empathy are incredibly powerful life-changing human traits, that‚Äôs where the biggest RAWRs come from. What keeps us from fully embracing that side of ourselves is the trauma we experience, and the fears that take up residence around our deepest emotional wounds. The ultimate show of fearlessness is to allow ourselves to be vulnerable for the sake of others.\n  \nBut, there‚Äôs no need to feel bad about taking time for yourself. I get numb, unresponsive and uncaring sometimes. If I don‚Äôt take time out for myself to get centered and prioritize my well-being, it always leads to depression, and I become useless.  \n  \nEdit // I made my comment after reading multiple INFJ posts in a row, so some of what I wrote might be superfluous. I should have just said that I can relate. Part of caring for others is allowing them to take care of themselves. I always take a big step back in relationships if I feel like someone is becoming dependent on me for any reason.
10	Without a doubt always tested as INFJ and reading the descriptions clicks with me quite deep....however I've become quite jaded over the years towards many things (due to upbringing and light mental imbalances). I suppose I've just started to understand the "darker" side of INFJs. \n\nNot condoning or sympathize at all to be clear, but Hitler was an INFJ as well. That's sort of what I'm talking about but far far far less straight evil. 
7	Who you are and who you choose to be are independant.
6	You sound like an INFJ to me. Maybe you‚Äôre an  enneagram 1 too, so you value truth more than others Fi. I typically just tell the truth which usually explodes in my face, but I feel as long as there‚Äôs a chance I make a positive difference for them I‚Äôm okay with it. It doesn‚Äôt stop it from replaying in my head over and over though.
5	Rawrrr!!! üòÇ I love, love this idea of INFJ‚Äôs being more ‚Äúlion like‚Äù than kitten like! I also think this is a developmental thing. Ie... we develop into lions. I would describe FP types as coming across as more warm and fuzzy than INFJ‚Äôs.... or less likely to analyze feelings from multiple angles and just respond with genuine hugs and tears. I have to say it‚Äôs their magic! 
5	I‚Äôm this way too!! Sometimes, I have to ask myself ‚Äúam I being a good person?‚Äù because I can be so nonchalant about things and wonder why the hell are people around me making mountains out of molehills. I do a lot of eyerolling. \n\nI‚Äôm not very sensitive. I don‚Äôt take things personally. Especially when it deals with people I don‚Äôt care about. In general I‚Äôm very attuned to people‚Äôs energy and their moods and act accordingly like any considerate human being but I‚Äôm not sensitive towards them in regards to  taking things overly personally or over analyzing. And maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôve gone through very traumatic experiences but things most people worry and fret about seems so small and inconsequential to me. I‚Äôm always on the verge of saying ‚Äúput your big boy/girl pants on, dust yourself off and get over it!‚Äù (Okay. I do say this often.)\n\n
6	Pautyp thanks for the link to the post. I will definitely check it out. I can‚Äôt tell you how refreshing it is to hear from other INFJ‚Äôs about this cold empathy thing and it not being a negative thing. I definitely relate to the empathy being like an out of body experience. Perhaps this is why people have told me that I‚Äôm ‚Äúnon responsive‚Äù at times. I sometimes forget to use my voice to display active listening (periodic uh hu‚Äôs) but what they don‚Äôt know is that my brain is taking in so much more than their words. 
5	No, you're an INFJ, you're a straight shooter and like to get to the point. You can see things people can't see, but the thing is you are looking at it at your point of view and not theirs.. what's going on in their minds is something much different.. I sorta face that same problem as well sometimes.. It's kinda like listening to small talk... it doesn't excite you nor interests you and you already know the ending to the story (or at least you think you know). Not INFJs are emotional and empathetic... and also some INFJs go through a series of personality changes and growth, depending on their age and experience. I find that I was shutting people down and ignoring emotions of others and my own, it was almost like a form of defensive mechanism.. not dealing with emotions because you don't want to get emotional... but all of that really is just bottling up emotions which will affect you later. I am emotional but I don't show it to people, I don't really express them. I used to be much more extroverted, but as I age, I steer closer to my true self which is an introvert. Remember, INFJs are very contradictory and mysterious.. you can't really fully describe an INFJ and they all come in strange sizes and forms.
4	I think it just has to do with growth, I feel like I‚Äôve grown into the lioness over the years. The old me ‚Äúkitten‚Äù is still there but I‚Äôve just gotten to a point where I‚Äôm kinda over chill about everything in general. It‚Äôs a nice place to bed. 
3	Agreed I took a lot more bs when I was younger too. I think this relates to boundary development. I found lerlerlance comment very important too. It‚Äôs a similar thread of thought as the author Brene Brown (who I adore). Vulnerability is very powerful. I see that as a growth opportunity in my Fe. I just want to be 100% honest and say that as an INFJ I don‚Äôt feel inclined to indulge every request for sympathy as I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessarily the most helpful response in every situation. As INFJ‚Äôs we have a strong drive for self improvement and helping others grow - that includes boundaries, powerful vulnerability, but also honesty. My best friend (a wise 60‚Äôs something INTJ) told me that the test for how she decides her responses is by asking herself ‚Äúwhat is the most loving thing for this person?‚Äù Sometimes the most loving thing is blunt honesty. Sometimes it‚Äôs vulnerability, sometimes it‚Äôs letting people know it‚Äôs not ok to be a bully. I‚Äôm very aware of my own woundedness & garbage so I just try to keep that in check to make sure I‚Äôm not in some negative loop. But many times I‚Äôve felt healthy and still have no issue pushing back when needed. Hope this helps! Sorry for rambles :D
3	Context is everything; if you're working a job with a heavy results-oriented environment, you're going to worry more about the job rather than other people's problems. Maybe us INFJs have a great capacity for empathy but like all things, it can be overridden. 
3	Haha wow I definitely relate to this it‚Äôs unreal.\n\nI think growing up I was definitely a consistent counselor role and sort of emotional punching bag for all my friends. I would listen and give advice and give so much of myself to the point where I got sick of it by the time I turned 20. \n\nI then decided to weed those people who consistently felt sorry for themselves and complained all the time.\n\nI kept a close circle and only reserved emotional energy for those I cared deeply about.\n\nMy feelings now are basically ‚ÄúI‚Äôll help you if I feel you are struggling, if we‚Äôre close and I cherish our relationship, and if I have advice that I think will maybe help. If I feel taken advantage of as a pseudo therapist or if I really don‚Äôt feel a close connection at all, I won‚Äôt even bother.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSuck it up‚Äù is definitely the new mantra for me most of the time hahaha, and I think that may be a sort of self preservation thing as an inwardly sensitive and introspective type that was taken advantage of growing up. Resulting in a more distanced, focused, INFJ that can sort of switch ‚Äúon‚Äù the empathy when needed or when they want to.
3	I've always been sensitive, but empathy I had to grow into. Personal development and self care has helped a lot with this. \n\nI previously wondered if I might have been a thinking type because honesty has always been very important to me, even if it makes life more difficult and at the cost of creating conflict. When I'm stressed I can definitely become quite cold and detached. This tends to impact the people I'm close to more than anyone else. \n\nFor reference, I'm an INFJ-A, enneagram 5. 
3	Over time I‚Äôve learnt to select which filter is best for the situation. If someone is playing the victim role looking for a rescuer, this seems to trigger my Ti and I become quite analytical about it. I can easily ‚Äúrelate‚Äù to how they are feeling, and I can still put up a wall so that I don‚Äôt absorb their emotions. I‚Äôm 45 and I feel this took several decades to master. 
2	McLynn you got me thinking this morning about unconventional ways (lesser discussed ways) INFJ‚Äôs can harness their gifts and growth states... I‚Äôll probably post something about this soon. I think there is a ton of uncharted territory to be discovered. 
2	McLynn I relate to your description of leading people to realizations 100%. It‚Äôs much harder to do than just fold and give a hug lol. 
2	\n\nThere are light and dark INFJs, I don't think the dark INFJs consider themselves fluffy, sensitive or pride themselves in empathy \n\nAlso, just because you test this way, doesn't mean you are, anyone can test into any group..but you are persistent in your answering. 
2	YESS I feel this completely 
2	I had a similar thought [in another thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/asekbv/infj_paradoxes/egtzfib/) the other day. It's why I thought I might be an INTJ for a while, but the INFJ descriptions and functions explain me much better. I think it's because of inferior Se that many of us don't experience feelings in the moment. I can be a sensitive person, but I'm very much in control of my emotions.
2	As an INFJ with aphantasia, I'm borderline psychopath. If I wasn't raised on super heroes, I'd probably be Dexter.
2	Simply put you don't understand empathy or the INFJ function stack. You can understand what someone is going through without having to do anything and Fe is not like Fi which is what INFP use. 
2	I do feel a certain pressure as an INFJ female to respond a certain way. Though I‚Äôve made it a priority to listen to my intuition above all. 
2	I am very sensitive. That‚Äôs just going to be my nature. \n  \nFor the most part I pick and choose the amount of  empathy I‚Äôm willing to deal with. I try to block out empathy for most of the world. I just don‚Äôt have the energy for it  (I had it as a teen/ didn‚Äôt know any better, and it was overwhelming). Occasionally someone or something will really get to me for which I‚Äôm powerless... and I‚Äôll go through whatever empathic rollercoaster that may be. \n  \nHowever I see lots of reasons to be empathetic... and I think I process the emotions and potentialities for nearly everyone I come across throughout my day... like a cyborg computing people and running data on the side of the screen... I see it all... but I just don‚Äôt let it in. \n  \n
1	Infj=/=snowflake
1	I can be kind of cold-hearted with some things but not others üò¨
1	Someone mentioned that gender might play a role in the feeling/logic balance. I‚Äôm female. If anyone wants to share their gender, it would be interesting to see any trends. 
1	Makes total sense. I have a similar issue. I‚Äôm a teacher who gives art critiques and I‚Äôm always trying to find that balance when I give constructive criticism. There‚Äôs always days I blow it haha. Still learning too. 
1	To your point perhaps we are a bit more outspoken with our partners or close friends than say a student. But oh my god it must be so refreshing to have an ENTP husband who can track with you when it comes to honesty. 
1	‚Äú So how would you face hatred in order to create peace?‚Äù  Just a look at being realistic about our type... and thinking about what all this really means. Analysis of whether or not Hitler was INFJ; what went wrong? [Hitler INFJ? What went wrong? Barracuda 57](https://youtu.be/NY7HWf7boMo) \n
1	i think empathy is more of an INFP thing, although i could be wrong
1	Doesn't sound like an INFJ, no.  
1	You may have been mistyped... I know INFJ is one of the most common mistyped MBTI
124	Healthy Reminder: Don't Gaslight Yourself	Hey guys. Just a very healthy reminder to not gaslight yourself. Our functions can leave us very prone to questioning our own sanity when usually we are just fine.\n\nI have an over communicative mother and as a part of my growth into finally getting the level of solitude and me time I need I've been shutting down conversation with her that is excess as well as letting her know where I'm wanting to be with my space. I moved out when I turned 18 (4 years ago now) and as I'm the youngest of her children it's understandable that I'll be the hardest for her to let go of.\n\nAfter around 1 month of less communication than she is used to she accused me of being selfish and not following my religion, both of which I refuted to her 1 on 1 with proof of why it just wasn't true. She has always treated my introvertedness as a defect & it has had a drastic effect on my developement often leading me to believe that I should instead over indulge my FE just for the sake of serving a purpose to other people. In my journey leading up to breaking those chains I frequently gaslighted & shit talked myself simply for choosing what to do what is best for me. It's taken me YEARS to continue walking that path & finally begin to truly live my own life. If those seeds of insanity hadn't been planted & I would have developed into who I'm slowly becoming a lot sooner. I wish I had this context of myself a lot earlier in my life so I could have avoided the painstaking months of questioning my own sanity.\n\nI wish bright futures and much shadow integration among you. Thanks for listening & please remember to do what's right for yourself! :)
44	I'm not so sure. I think i have a deep-seated fear of being delusional because I witness so many delusional people around me. I fear if i stop second guessing I might go crazy, so better safe than sorry?
15	Your mother sounds quite narcissistic!
12	I probably needed to hear this. I'm in an extremely unhealthy mental state right now and all I'm doing is punching myself further into it.
5	Thanks for the reminder. It's all too real. I felt like I gaslighted myself today after a phone interview. 
5	YESSS! Thank you!!! My ex boyfriend gaslighted the shit out of me because of my introversion which lead me down a sad sad road of gaslighting myself! It‚Äôs taken well over a year but I finally recently realized that- wait a second! I‚Äôm not just a lazy sack of depression, I use my time and energy how it benefits me and it‚Äôs sad that I was in love with someone who took one of my basic personality traits and convinced me to be depressed bc I thought I was lazy! At the end of the day, we worked in the same field and I was more successful (not to be narcissistic myself but he was frequently getting written up and I had just won a national award- so I feel it‚Äôs well deserved narcissism haha) so the entire situation was just a defense mechanism for him. But I really let it get into my head! So glad to be out of that mental shitstorm!
5	You know what‚Äôs the best catchphrase for an INFJ?\n\n\n‚ÄúFUCK THEM‚Äù \n\n\n(It‚Äôs supposed to be funny)
3	Gaslighted myself into thinking I loved someone and that ended up breaking their heart.\n\nThey loved me so much I thought I could do the same :(
1	Thank you for the post! I feel like I do this to myself a lot.
10	INFJs "most E of the Is" and "the most T of the Fs". Discuss.	INFJs are supposed to be the "most extroverted of the introverts" and "more thinking then most other feelers" because of the introverted thought + introverted combination. Let's unpack and discuss this. Do you think this is applicable/ somewhat true for you?
9	Yep! Ti comes out strong with Ni leading the way. They form a very heady bond together. Ni also reinforces Fe and compels us to pay attention to people more than some other introverted types.
3	This is so applicable that it almost got me mistyped, lol.   \n\n\nFrom what I've observed the Ni-Ti combination seems to manifest in us INFJs as someone being more analytical and logical, with that inner logic shifting around to accommodate new information (and the occasional painful perspective-changing challenge to that established worldview).   \nI have also had a series of discussions with my ENFP friend about cognitive functions, and she noticed that the Ni-Ti combination almost came across as a weird... detachment? She called it a "detached and curious" mannerism but I'm not sure if I completely agree with that being the description. But I see what she's saying and it resonated.   \n\n\nAs for the "most extroverted of the introverts" part, I'm not sure if it has something to do with Ni and Fe, or what other cognitive functions are involved, but I have noticed that the people close to me are particularly surprised when I finally claim that I need some time for myself and would rather be alone given the choice, since I spend so much time with them, and genuinely like people and being around people. 
2	Fe is generally very outgoingly extroverted, and the tertiary Ti (combined with Ni) pretty much serve as an internal computer
2	I do the tests every two years or so, and I've gotten INFJ almost always. \n\nThe only three mistypes I've had are INFP (as a teen), ENFJ (just recently), and INTJ (recently) over the decade and a half I've been doing them. I feel like the very odd nuances of these three mistypes makes me almost certain I'm INFJ. I'm definitely too emotionally extroverted to be INTJ, I'm too not-in-touch-with-my-own-emotions to be INFP and fuck.... everyone thinks I'm extroverted but I'm very, very certain I am not under any definition aside from "not shy" and "socially needs to lead the conversation". \n\nI definitely think I lean more towards introvert thought and extroverted feeling, which means that in social situations I \*seem\* very outgoing. I don't even have the peaceful voice most people ascribe to INFJ. I just seem outgoing. Hence why I ask other INFJs what they think of these T and E leanings. I think other people would lean me those two ways and I'm wondering if others fit this same idiosyncrasies.\n\n&#x200B;
1	Yes, I've thought about this recently. I've thought that I'm INTJ, before I understood the functions. Strong Ni-Ti causes me to delay expression of my feelings until I sort them out and determine what makes sense for me to feel.
56	Resourcefulness & independence (bit of a rant)	I was just thinking about this while dealing with a situation at work. Knowing that most INFJs work best independently and behind the scenes, does it annoy you when people ask questions that they could easily figure out themselves? Or they come to you for help/advice, but you just end up stating the obvious?\n\nIt's a huge pet peeve of mine. I remain friendly and helpful in these situations, but as someone who only asks for help when I really need it, it's exhausting to deal with people who aren't resourceful or can't find the best path on their own. Often I'll have the same information they have--for example, someone will ask me a question and I'll have to search my old emails to find the answer. The same emails we all received. I don't want to be an asshole, so I still help them out, but that's never the way I would approach a question.\n\nThis seems to be related to the Ni-Ti functions correct? (I'm still learning these.) I'm constantly in this mode of independent thinking and independent problem solving that resourcefulness just comes naturally to me. I'd rather take an extra few minutes to locate an answer or develop a solution than bother someone else for their help when I'm perfectly capable on my own.
35	One thing I have found is that the obvious answer to you is not always obvious to others. I tend to take real enjoyment out of helping others, even if I would be able to figure it out on my own. The intuition of the INFJ makes things that are unclear to many a straightforward answer, and sometimes that's hard to grasp when talking to someone without that intuition.
12	Teach to fish, instead of giving them fish
11	This asking-for-help-all-the-time some people love to do is making their lives much harder. I thought about that a lot and when I tried to hold that mindset for a while I noticed it's about giving up decision making. Giving up responsibility. I really like to understand why people do certain things and this opened my eyes a bit. The best way to deal with such people is to just give them a subtle hint toward the solution. Lead them to the solution but the important part is to let _them_ to make the last step. \n\nI often take the hands-off approach and many times people ask for help just out of a habit. They haven't tried to solve the problem. And when they do conquer the issue themselves, their eyes light up with excitement. Bare in mind that it's possible that somebody has never really felt that. Especially when somebody tends to assume the role of a victim. Just a passive observer. And there are many people like that.
6	I definitely notice my eyebrows sometimes get knitted when someone asks me something they could have just as easily googled, or worse, asks me for info I have explicitly posted in my profile.  I keep trying to remind myself that part of us all practicing relationship development, is being willing to be human with each other, and inviting myself to try to be responsive. Yeh I‚Äôm still working on it.
3	This is akin to the people who ask questions about a tv show we are both simultaneously viewing for the first time. Some people really are oblivious.
3	Yes, and working in mental health like I do makes this a real issue. I‚Äôve had parents flat out ask me what they should do when their kid says, word for word, ‚ÄúI need to go to the hospital or I‚Äôm going to hurt myself‚Äù. They call my office first and ask what to do. Take them to the hospital. Now. \n\nOR \n\nPeople call looking for services we can‚Äôt provide (a good example is ADIS classes). I let them know we don‚Äôt provide what they‚Äôre looking for and they ask for a call back with a list of places they can go to. We‚Äôre just a counseling office, with our own client‚Äôs needs at the top of the list. Some rando calling in asking for us to just figure it out for them isn‚Äôt a thing. It never ceases to amaze me how snarky people get when I ask ‚Äúhave you done a google search?‚Äù \n\n*Scoff* \n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not MY job, is it?‚Äù\n\n.........uuuuuh yeah. Yeah it is. 
3	I have not identified so hard with a post in a long time... maybe ever. This is every day at work for me. I'm an office manager.
2	Yes! In the situation of the emails that you mentioned, I usually tell them how to search their emails and then send them on their way.
2	Answering these questions via the Socratic method brings me entertainment and joy.
2	Yeah so, I think I'm.the total and complete opposite in this regard. When asked a question I will drop everything to make sure whoever's asking it gets a full and complete answer. It's because I remember days back when I was a newbie and could either sit there for hours trying to figure things out on my own or I could have a senior show me the ropes in detail, and I would much prefer the second.
2	I deal with this all the time at work. I have a FT job and a PT job teaching at a college, and I can't get away from it. \n\nSomething I've had to start doing at my FT job is ask people to look back at emails themselves/try to figure out the answer.  It seems bitchy (to me, at least), but sometimes they ask when I'm in the middle of something important or time sensitive. So if they ask me something, I typically ask them to do what I would have done anyway: "Can you check your emails, I think so-and-so sent it"; "I'm not sure, I'd email this person and check".\n\nThat way you can still do your responsibilities and then you can help other find the answers themselves.  It's hard and I'm not perfect at it. Often times they come back after searching/contacting someone else and it's like "Now what". But...idk that's what I find myself doing as I take on more and more projects. \nGood luck, though! 
2	> does it annoy you when people ask questions that they could easily figure out themselves?  \n\nthe worst situation. i tend to "help" (although in a slightly hostile tone) by pointing how they wasted my time\n\n> Or they come to you for help/advice, but you just end up stating the obvious? \n\na different worst situation. here i try to be as empathetic as possible, but still make clear that i cannot give a new perspective or further support/elaborate an existing one.\n\n> This seems to be related to the Ni-Ti functions correct? \n\nthats the way i see it\n\n> I'd rather take an extra few minutes to locate an answer or develop a solution than bother someone else for their help when I'm perfectly capable on my own. \n\nthat is very true of me (plus every now and then working the problem out yourself enlightens you on something you did not notice previously)\n\nas an introverted intuitive, i respect personal space, and so tend not to speak unless (and this is presented in order from most important to least important)  a) logic is clearly violated for no reason, b) emotion is clearly violated for no reason, c) morality is violated for no reason, or d) cultural practices are violated for no reason
1	Yes! I‚Äôm someone that always tries to figure things out myself, and I would hate when my peers would ask our professor an obvious question that we could have easily figured out. I also have been focusing on resourcefulness lately so it really stands out to me when people ask lazy questions 
1	Maybe just tell them you're busy 2/3 times they come and hopefully they'll get the message
1	This happens to me all of the time
1	I see your situation. As already stated in the comment section " the obvious answer to you is not always obvious to others ". Help them and perhaps show them how you got your answer, or how you would get the answer. But be careful not to act like they are stupid.

3	DAE not really have opinions? \n\nEg. sometimes I listen to songs and whether or not I like the song, would depend on whether or not a (respected) individual close to me approves of it. I'm not sure how to put it in words but I feel like I can never come up with something original without being afraid of people judging me for it. So my actions are limited to things I know society would accept me for. When in reality I'm super strange - 
1	Are you a unique infant? Because I am and I'm thinking maybe there's a link between being a weird infant and having a rare personality. For me I dislike pacifiers, cried like a kitten(according to my great gran) and rarely cried at all. 
1	DAE find themselves driven to embrace and accept other people's ways of working, yet frequently, unable to think anything other than, "but this is soooo non-sensical!"?\n\nThe less we make an obstacle of something, the less it serves to trip us up. And yet sometimes, the cognitive dissonance is far, far too great.
15	How to know if I'm INFJ or ISFP ?	Hello everyone ! I studied the mbti for a long time but I'm still not able to tell if I'm an INFJ or an ISFP. I relate to a lot of INFJ traits but I guess I never experienced what INFJS describe as overwhelming Se. I relate more to Isfps  Te problems but I don't know if it's that or INFJ Ni-ti loop.\nI relate a lot to the Ni function, but I don't know if it's as a dominant one or a tertiary. Fi on the other hand seems like a mystery to me. I like philosophy but I think it's an INFJ cliche and ISFP could be into that either. I kind of relate to Fi/Ni loop too. Have you got any ideas on how to distinguish the two types ?\nThank you for your answers
6	Here's how I differentiate them - \n\nINFJ's main function is Ni so listening to their own gut instinct is what they're practically always doing. Versus ISFP's dominant Fi which they listen to in order to know what they want to do in the moment. INFJ's Se actions are a result of dominant Ni - so their actions are more often based on what their "gut instinct" tells them.\n\nAuxiliary functions - INFJs have Fe so they often enjoy being around people and having (positive) social interaction. They're very in tune with the people around them and know how to come off as friendly to others. ISFPs don't have Fe but Fi, so they might not be, or want to be as social but with the right people, that their Fi vibes with, they may become more social. Moreover their Se observes the current situation and is in tune with the present and the body language. They often have smooth body movements. They usually don't like long discussions that don't appeal to their Fi/Ni in some way.\n\n(edit: another huge difference between Fe/Fi I forgot to mention is that high Fi's are good at dealing with their own emotions by themselves while Fe users do it best with someone else they can talk about their feelings with.)\n\nedit: As far as tertiary functions - INFJs have Ti so they like forming their own thought models that might contradict commonly known facts (Te). They might enjoy intellectual debates. INFJs with higher Ti might be more questioning of logic. \nISFPs have tertiary Ni, so they might usually have some sort of subjective idea of what people and reality might be like (that they usually can't really explain). Ni might also lead to ideal visions of outcomes.\n\n(Tell me if I'm wrong with any of this - I've had time and some INFJs to observe and spend time with, and think about the differences myself, so these are kind of based on my ideas of the functions that I've formed based on my observations.)

5	I am falling in line with Horami and TA-19 I think.  You have to focus on the cognitive functions and the attitudes for each.  INFJ and ISFP are indeed very different from this standpoint which is a much more scientific model than how you may think you relate to things at any given point in time.\n\nAnd I would focus on Interaction Styles and Temperaments in order to arrive at your correct type.  INFJs have an Interaction Style that is Direct and Movement-oriented, whereas ISFPs are Informative and Control-oriented.  Both are Responding but that is essentially the "Introversion" factor.  As for Temperaments, INFJs are abstract, future-focused and think in terms of what "should" be done.  ISFPs on the other hand are focussed on reality or the concrete.  They want to test the rules and think in terms of what works.\n\nAnyway, better than me trying to explain here.  You could refer to CS Joseph"s videos about the two type.  One should certainly resonate more than the other.  Here are the links:\n\nINFJ: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ir-ypPLUdxY&index=8&list=PLCPzIFw2QJDeAV5CjEIjmzqSiQIknVk1N&t=0s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ir-ypPLUdxY&index=8&list=PLCPzIFw2QJDeAV5CjEIjmzqSiQIknVk1N&t=0s)\n\nISFP: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntcBulfl\_IY&t=0s&list=PLCPzIFw2QJDc9YW50wcWv8EkaekF6d\_OO&index=8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntcBulfl_IY&t=0s&list=PLCPzIFw2QJDc9YW50wcWv8EkaekF6d_OO&index=8)
2	I don't really understand S or Se other than in extreme moments of clarity or more likely, partaking in unhealthy behavior.\n\nFor example, I've found myself trying to focus on enjoying the "moment" of a sunset, within seconds of recognizing its beauty I am thinking about atmospheric diffraction, global warming, gravity, etc. and all the connected topics related to whatever I end up focusing on but this is what I enjoy thinking about and provides my subjective sense of beauty. Typically, I have been driven to focus on the "now" via external guilt playing on the fact that I want those I care about to be content and has caused me quite a bit of undue stress trying to be something I am not. Unsurprisingly, letting this go and being yourself without apologies allows one to actually revel in as close to what I understand Se to be ... and then the typical constant intensity of an INFJ somewhat drops away, which is an amazingly alien feeling.\n\nCompare how you live in the moment to my subjective experience of trying to do so, hopefully this helps along with the other advice you have been given.
2	youd most likely easily see the differences between Fi and Fe, so i think you should look there for a better answer
1	INFJ dating ISFP. I'm great at knowing what I want long term but terrible at short term decision-making. My ISFP is bewildered by my indecisiveness because he can almost always tell what he wants in the moment. He struggles with long term thinking/planning, though.\n\nAnd he does things because he wants to. I do them because I feel I have to. My own feelings will rarely factor into my decisions. I just don't give them that much weight, whereas a heavy Fi user will. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nCan you relate to one side more than the other?
-4	Re-learn the functions, ISFP and INFJ are nowhere near. I relate to Goomba, does it make me one? No.
126	How many people are really INFJs?	(¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø)\nWith INFJ supposedly being one of the rarest personality types (1.5% of the population) it‚Äôs quite a surprise with how many people identify with it. It‚Äôs one of the most common types to be incorrectly identified as and with all the vague summaries online of what it means to be one, it‚Äôs not a surprise. I mean it‚Äôs constantly said to be a walking contradiction but aren‚Äôt all people? I mean most people aren‚Äôt a 2 dimensional character?\nThe main 16 personalities quiz online especially favours IN types and gives them out more generously than other types but do you guys simply think that they are actually much more common or that many simply label themselves incorrectly. \nSo what do you guys think??\n\n(btw this isn‚Äôt meant as an attack, simply just a curious (maybe?) INTP who previously thought themselves to be an INFJ as the 16p quiz told me and accepted it)
253	I think this has more to do with introverts being more likely to be on Reddit and more likely to take personality tests.
72	Well, I mean, there are over 7.5 billion people in the world. If 1.5% of them are INFJ, that's more than 112 million INFJs in the world. We're less common than other types, but we're not unicorns.
19	I get the feeling that the "INFJ's" whom can't take my direct nature are actually INFP's with a focus on harmony over self-growth.\n\nINFJ's can take doses of reality, INFP's seem terrified of reality quite often in my experience and they take much longer to eventually act upon the things that are causing them anxieties.
45	I think the rarity might be overstated, or it's possible that this type (or NFs in general) is naturally drawn to MBTI because of their interest in self-discovery. I've never used 16personalities, but I've always tested INFJ and the description hits the nail on the head for me. None of the other types even come close. However, I think there are a lot of people who fit somewhere in between two or more types. I've always rejected the idea that everyone must fit within one of 16 boxes and carry that label for life. It's just about finding the one you relate to most and using that for personal growth. Your type can change later in life as well.
13	Nobody knows ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
14	A few factors I see with why there are so many INFJs identifying themselves:\n\n1. I think INFJs struggle a lot internally, highly self-reflective but also very interested in how they affect other people, which leads INFJs to be very likely to take personality tests to heart, really try to understand themselves with the analyses they read, and it's so relateable in a world where that has been so rare for them.  I don't think other types, in general, get as invested into the results or feel as strong of a pull to really delve into them.\n2. Online communities are filled with introverts.  Because even introverts want to extend themselves socially, and the internet provides a wonderful way to do so without being so draining. There's less of an expectation, so it's safe to withdraw at any time.\n3. NF and NTs in general also seem to be extra active in terms of the personality analysis. Those types are much more introspective and interested in self-discovery in general.  In my real world experience, these are also the types to be more open to hearing about personality theories when I am sharing my thoughts.  SFs and STs tend to lose interest quicker.
25	Not sure, but I think there are quite a few mistypes. Some people really want to be INFJ for some reason. It‚Äôs easy to tell if they‚Äôre fake, just accuse them of being INFP and if they freak out they‚Äôre probably INFP.
26	I think infj‚Äôs bring ‚Äúwalking contradiction‚Äù to a whole new level. We are introverted, intuitive, feeling and judgmental. We are very self aware and we have deep caverns of emotion. We are also the most logical of the feeling types. That is where the ‚Äúwalking contradiction‚Äù comes in. There is a constant battle between logic and emotion in our minds. We can react negatively to an emotion and label ourselves as ridiculous and irrational, all at the same time. We have so many feelings, but at times we hate ourselves for having them. Many other types are not so self aware. They aren‚Äôt able to be personal therapists for themselves. They aren‚Äôt able to recognize destructive patterns of thought and devise and plan of action internally. They aren‚Äôt able to see when they are being irrational or when their emotions are validated with truth. We aren‚Äôt red or blue. We are purple. I think any true infj will test as one because we are quite honest with ourselves and therefore honest in our answers. We know and remember every nook and cranny in our minds. We know exactly what we need and what we want. We know how‚Äôll we‚Äôll react and how hypotheticals will make us feel. We know ourselves inside and out. Our work is never done though. We are constantly evolving and learning more about ourselves each day. We are so deeply engulfed in our thoughts that it can feel as though we are mentally in another plain of reality, while our bodies remain in the present world. We are weird beyond words. I‚Äôd honestly like to be another type if I could choose. It‚Äôs exhausting being an infj. 
10	INFJs are way more common on the internet then in the outside world. There's a large bias over presence on the internet. I saw surveys about stuff based on each personnality type. Whilst ESTJs are the most common type, the survey only had about 40 answers from them whereas there were 450 INFJ respondants. INFJs outside the internet is correctly proportionized.
10	I think, get to know yourself\n\n&#x200B;\n\nthen report back makes some people angry because they like to think they know themselves 
6	It makes sense considering what kind of people are typed as INFJ and what kind of people are more likely to be looking on the internet for answers 
6	I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a survey bias if anything. Like someone else said in the thread introverts and introspective types are more likely to be drawn to MTBI tests and reddit. \n\nAnecdotally I had a great heart to heart with a friend of mine when we compared our cognitive functions, having felt we better understood each other for doing it. \n\nWe tried to do this with an ESFJ friend of ours and she was disinterested in less than 5 minutes. Wanted to talk about other people‚Äôs drama instead.

5	1.5% of 7.53 billion equals 112950000 INFJ's. I've never met another INFJ in my life (that I know of) other than on Reddit. 
4	I (ENTP) know quite a few INFP, and a few INFJ. Difference between the two of them that is most obvious to me is simple. You can learn about an INFP in depth much-MUCH quicker than you will learn about an INFJ.... The one I know the longest (5-years) I still barely know much about her. INFP are more capable of showing you below the surface.\n\nBesides that I have found that INFP are considerably less emotionally grounded than INFJ. Look for emotional outbursts or bouts of total confusion in a 'INFJ' ... If they're less stable than other INFJ I suspect they are really an INFP. 
3	I have been questioning my own type lately. I subscribed to /r/ENFP just to see what all the fuss about them was about since we are supposed to be compatible and I found that I related to a lot (not all) of the posts there. Thats he case for posts here, too. Maybe it's clear to some people but not so much for me. Every time I test I do end up with INFJ or INTJ though. Who knows?
3	I took MBPT several times throughout my schooling because I constantly moved and somehow attended schools that were interested in this for career development. Took it in 6th grade, again in 7th grade, once in high school and once in college. I got INFJ back every time and was being as honest as possible, not thinking about a question too hard. I ended up studying psychology and counseling. The 16 personalities breakdown for INFJs was uncanny. I showed it to my husband and he was like ‚ÄúWow, maybe I should take the test sometime. It‚Äôs like they wrote it for you.‚Äù So I guess what I‚Äôm saying is that it just really resonated with me, my results were consistent, and knowing things relevant to INFJ traits has really helped me grow as a person. I‚Äôd also say I was pretty surprised when I found this sub in the first place and even more surprised by how many other there were! \n\nTo address your question, after my husband got interested in taking the test, we googled MBPT and about 1,000 random, free tests showed up that claimed to be MBPT. I guess it‚Äôs possible a lot of people take other tests and get results that may not entirely coincide with the legitimate one...? Or maybe for those who already know about MBPT, there is a strong desire to be ‚Äúrare‚Äù and test takers understand how to answer in ways that would elicit a particular result...? Maybe believing you‚Äôre an INFJ leads you to taking on more traits of one...? \n\nI don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll ever know.
3	Personally I think it's a combination of what the top comments are saying (INFJs are more likely to be introspective and seek out MBTI/be present on reddit) and also the fact that most people just take a test online and accept the results at face value without looking into cognitive function stacking. The tests are especially inaccurate because without significant introspection you are answering the questions based on your perception of yourself, which can have varying degrees of accuracy. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe only reason I know I am INFJ is extensively looking at cognitive function stacking, consulting others who are close to me about their thoughts on how I behave, and taking time to legitimately try to evaluate how and why I think/behave the way I do. Ni-Fe-Ti-Se is certainly my stack, making me an INFJ, and when I read about Ni-Ti loops I realized how much of my life was spent in one. I spent some time considering INTJ, but the cognitive function stack doesn't fit. I also found eneagram to be very helpful in confirming my MBTI results, but am still not positive whether I am 4w5 or 5w4.
3	We are so desperate to understand ourselves that we rely on mbti to explain it 
3	It's really getting on my nerves.\n\nAll this. "Really INFJ" shit.\n\n\nReally why does it matter???\n\nI_m INFJ and sometimes relate more to INFP. Even can test as INFP while stressed.\n\nAll this MBTI is about learning one's self and hopefully progressing in our unfortunate human state.\n\nI think we all sometimes get hung up here. It's beautiful yet down right bullshit at the same time!\n\nWhy the fuck is it such a big deal to be rare? It's bullshit! I don't want to be this way!!!\n\n
2	Impossible to know exactly.\n\nWhat about your trip? You went for counseling? Psychologist? More tests? Functions?
2	Thought I was an INFJ, re took the test after a little more self exploration and I found that I am an ENFP. I relate heavily with both, though and still am conflicted. 
2	 I always type as infj, but I relate a lot to infp as well. That because on the last major trait, I‚Äôm borderline.  I think often people forget typing does a usually poor job of conveying the different degrees at which we all experience these traits. People see letters and judge it as black and white when in reality it‚Äôs a giant spectrum.
2	I think infjs and infp‚Äôs are some of the types most likely to be aware of their mbti type
2	I don't trust the 16 Personalities test much anymore. Check out Erik Thor or Personality Hacker.
2	1.5% of the population is still a lot of people and of that percentage I‚Äôd say an infj or similar type is more likely to be on reddit jabbering about their brain than probably at least half the rest of the population 
2	I just found out that when INTJs go into their Ni-Fi loop, they start developing conspiracy theories. Now THAT I relate to! I used to spend most of my mental energy figuring out "what's reeeeaaallly going on." Then I started taking classes, got much less bored, used Te perhaps?, and apparently broke out of the loop.\n\nWho knew?\n\nThe main INFJ trait I resonate with is looking for patterns and using them to try to forecast future trends. It's one of my obsessions. INTJs do that too, I suppose. But, I'm not a strategist. (Then again, I'm also not a counselor.) I do pick up "vibes."\n\nI don't suppose it really matters if I can't use the information to get more healthy about expressing whichever functions I turn out to have, and there are many pathways to that goal.
1	>simply just a curious INTP who previously thought themselves to be an INFJ as the 16p quiz told me and accepted it\n\nIt told me that I was intp lol
1	Ah good point 
1	I thought I was an INFP for the longest time, retook the test and was more honest with my answers and get INFJ and honestly feel like it suits me to a T
1	These tests are either meaningless nonsense or we have to take them seriously and understand each other, or write them off for the psychobabble bollocks that they possibly are.
1	Well if your taking the test for the first time, maybe you still dont understand yourself very well, meaning you're not going to know how to answer the questions about yourself correctly. My ESTP friend got ENFP cuz I know he took it wrong lol but I also saw that coming.
1	Fellow INFJ here ! :)
1	All my tests came back INFJ. Seems to suit me to a tee. I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm all that unusual of a person so I dunno! 
1	I am. I‚Äôve taken the test at least 5 times since the mid nineties and each time I‚Äôm solid INFJ. No wavering. 
1	I think it's many factors. Could be that INFJs are more likely to search about this topic, could be that because it is a rare personality, people might seem to be drawn to identify themselves as INFJs, or maybe some people have only taken one test. I don't know and I can't judge. I think the MBTI should be taken more as a guide to discover your personality and not identify yourself with a type 100%. Circumstances could influence your results when taking the test, so I think the best is to take it months apart and using different sources.
1	Most people get their type incorrect when they first do the test. It took me a while to figure out I was INTJ\n\nFew people bother to research MBTI further and validate what their type is, which means most people are mistyped (not just those who identify as INFJ)
1	So many people want to believe there INFJs because they think it‚Äôs soo cool to understand everyone but I feel empathy for INFJs carrying such a burden feeling responsibility for everyone‚Äôs emotions - I used to think I was an INFJ because I understand people too but more from why they think they way they do! Turns out I‚Äôm an ENTP who was stuck in his INTJ shadow for a looong time - people just need to do more research and talk to people/friends about mbti I would say that‚Äôs the best ways to eventually find your type.
1	I kinda wanna ask this question too.. seems like most INFJs on Reddit have no problem with the social side of "introverts" makes me think if they are truly introverts? I'm an INFJ and I definitely have strong introvert qualities.
1	I took tests from 3 different sites and I got infj... I can understand how it‚Äôs so rare because I don‚Äôt relate to anyone my age and I do so much for people and get peanuts in return. Fml
1	\-> "\\"\n\nAlso you can tell if somebody is a real INFJ if you stuff them into a fMRI machine and let them count sheep while you look at the results.
1	As an INFJ i just posted this 3 days ago. cause its so true...\n\n&#x200B;
1	When i joined my company they were people, people, and as such they put me and my other colleagues through a Myers Briggs test with a lerson leading the course. We had paintings, drawings, 3 word tests, a mini speech about ourselves etc.. all with our answers and responses recorded by this personality expert i guess followed by a multiple choice personality test. At this point i'd never heard of the 16 types and my result was INFJ. I've since done research into it and for me everything matched with how i feel about things and deal with various situations. I don't know what the course cost but it must have been for then a few pennies so i feel sure that the result of INFJ for me was correct.
1	I like what you say. I think it‚Äôs interesting - as well as you accidentally ‚Äòachieving‚Äô the wrong personality. \n\nMyself - in the world feel the complete reality of the INFJ rarity but our sub and hearing other more active subs talk about our type seem to make me/the community feel very relevant - us being more common then what I find prevalent.
1	Welp, I can't speak for the other 110 million INFJs but I [didn't mistype.](https://i.imgur.com/l5mdBRo.jpg)
1	I know what you‚Äôre saying because, being the cynic I am, I questioned if I was/am truly an INFJ. But so many things I‚Äôve read about the INFJ type just hit home. Suddenly things made sense. I‚Äôve always felt like the odd one out. \n\nAside from that there are a couple of qualities that stick out in my memory. One is the idea of not being into casual relationships that a love match is a deep one. Material offerings fall flat. I‚Äôd rather be with a man who doesn‚Äôt have much but can love me as deeply as I do him than a wealthy guy who can‚Äôt give of himself. \n\nAnother thing is ethics & integrity. There is a line from the show Mr. Robot. (I‚Äôve never seen the show but came across this scene when I was looking up info on Rami Malek.)  In the scene, Elliot confronts a guy (Rohit aka Ron) who is running child porn online. At first Rohit thinks Elliot is there to blackmail him. He says he won‚Äôt pay him any money (even though Elliot hasn‚Äôt suggested blackmail) but quickly changes his mind when he understands Elliot will report him, not fully realizing Elliot has already reported him. As police descend onto the scene, Elliot says on his way out the door ‚Äúthat's the part you were wrong about, Rohit. I don't give a shit about money.‚Äù And that line, within the context of the scene just soooooo resonated with me! No one can get me to betray my ethics with money. I can say that because it happened a couple of years ago. I was in a financial cul-de-sac & definitely could have used the money. I was offered $500 to do something I believed unethical. (It was) I turned it down. Didn‚Äôt have to even think about it. Now someone might say a larger amount might sway me. No. I know me. Selling my ethics is something I couldn‚Äôt live with. Offer me a million $‚Äôs & it makes no difference.\n\nOne other thing attributed to INFJ‚Äôs is the door slam. Wow, do I get that one. Not that I‚Äôve done it often, but it‚Äôs definitely happened.\n\nThere likely are those defining themselves as INFJ‚Äôs. Maybe even me. At the end of the day it really doesn‚Äôt matter. Why I‚Äôm here is to interact with people I believe have a better chance of ‚Äúgetting‚Äù me than most others out there.
1	The question is how have the 16 types' frequency been verified across the population?
1	I am typed INFP by those questionnaires, sometimes ENFP. By searching about functions i started to think if those online stuff are for real. \n\nI do know that i am intuitive, feeler and introvert, and working in the art field my thing is not the over emotional stuff, but art from systems. Things like video-games, procedural animation and fiddling with arduinos. \n\nAnd even though my bad feels and anxieties get a mark on Fi, when i am around people i can't help but try to help them. And again, don't know if this is a lack of self esteem or Fe. \n\nNot that i want to cross the border just to be with the cool kids. What i need is a better path of self-betterment other than confusing and secon-guessing myself
1	I took a test in my psych class and I was the only person who got infj. Since then I have taken other  variations of the test and got roughly similar results. Anyway I feel that I am more introvert than extroverted, More intuitions based than sensed, more feelings than thought and I swing both ways on passive or judgmental.\nSo yeah I‚Äôm an infj 
0	The thing is we don't know that types are real....
-1	My sister was initially typed as an INFJ but later retook the test and saw her results change to an INTP... another person I met on Reddit began as an INFJ and eventually developed into an INFP. I wonder why some younger INFJs seem to transition into other types as they grow older?

3	Think I'm currently crawling out of despair at the mo towards enlightenment... Boy is it a crawl atm...

3	Does anyone have any insight on how best to healthily address a friendship in which the lifestyles and behaviours of each party have drifted apart on different paths?\n\nI feel as though my priorities in life have changed, and as a result I'm much more careful with how I spend my time.

It‚Äôs also really hard to find these people. I actually feel as though I haven‚Äôt found them (and never will).\n\nBeing selective makes me feel guilty because I feel like  I think I‚Äôm superior to other people.\n\n
5	How to tell between INFJ and INFP?	Hey everyone.\n\nI've taken the Myers-Briggs test on 16 Personalities last year in February, and I got INFP. I took it again a few months ago, and interestingly, got INFJ. Took it again just to make sure I didn't "mess up", and got INFJ. Though, "J" was 53% and "P" was 47%. Is there anyway to tell which one I am for sure?
7	[You look them in the eyes while twisting their internal values with your imaginary fist. If they cringe, they are INFP. If you cringe, they are INFJ.](https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/wiki/faqs#wiki_infj_vs_infp)
8	Firstly disclaimer, I am an ENFP borderline ENTP straight female.  I have two friends, INFP and INFJ. They are both straight men of similar age (20s). They both have HIGH I, MIDDLE N, HIGH F, but only their F and P are different. At first glance, the way they communicate their ideas, the way they make friends, the way they care for people are quite similar.  But the two of them are irrevocably different in how they live their life.\n\nThe similarities:\n\n1. Both my INFP and INFJ friend are very sensitive individuals who idolise the people they fall in love with and they also blame themselves after a relationship did not work out even if it is not completely their fault.\n2. Both my INFP and INFJ friend are quite shy when they first meet someone, and they don't like big crowds. BUT they both communicate well one-to-one and really like  to go into in depth topics on ideas and imaginary quirky stuff.\n3. Both my INFP and INFJ friends are quite kind-hearted and doesn't like to seem like a 'douche' in any way. (that being said, the entp in me is saying "douche" is a relative term.. So this is based on their own view of douchieness). They try to avoid it. They don't like to act confident.\n\nThe differences:\n\n1. My INFP friend is more likely to try something new. Try a new project, a new direction, a new kind of food. But is very unlikely to stick in finishing the project. My INFJ friend doesn't start things often. But once he does, he sticks to it and maintains it everyday. For that reason, my INFP friend cannot ever stick to going to the gym or keeping a job. While my INFJ friend works hard in his job and works out every day. But in the end, my INFP friend has opened up to more new experiences due to this.\n2. My INFP friend goes into hiding when he is depressed. Cannot maintain his life at all when he is.  Whereas my INFJ friend maintains his life as usual, while also goes into hiding from close friends... but finds surprisingly bad outlets of addiction/drinking/casual nonsensical sex with strangers as a way to cope.\n3. My INFP friend is quite open to talk about sexual topics with women he is close with. My INFJ friend in the other hand is verrrrrry uncomfortable with the talk of sexual topics even with close loved ones. Also from my experience, INFPs are kind of closet freaks for sure and love the idea of being a bit of a freak. While INFJs are also closet freaks but are ashamed of it. In a great way of course!\n\nAgain, this is all from my perspective of them. I really like analysing people and I really like my two friends. so yeah, fun stuff. Actual INFP and INFJs need to tell me if this is true. I know that most people know the basics like J is greater managers and Ps are freer but I thought it'd be nice to go into detail so you really could see which one you relate to more. That being said, I also go in and out of ENFP and ENTP depending on the season hahah. You could just possibly be both. And don't feel bad about that. I honestly believe the people who have some 'middles' are the healthiest kind of people.  
3	1. Read both type descriptions, one should fit better than the other.\n2. If money is an issue, take more tests online\n3. Read about the cognitive functions\n4. Go to r/MbtiTypeMe\n5. If money / availability is not an issue, seek out for professional advice
2	J and P have to do with how detail oriented you are, essentially. For example, when planning an event, those with ‚ÄúJ‚Äùs will be planning everything from the entertainment down to the silverware design, the detailed appetizer selection, the guest list to a T. P‚Äôs, on the other hand, are much less detail oriented- they‚Äôd give something blatant like ‚Äúit‚Äôll be an event for kids‚Äù ‚Äúwe‚Äôll have food‚Äù 
2	Do you show up on time to appointments, or are you often late?\n\nDo you tend to go with the flow, or are you a to-do list person?\n\nJs relate to time as a finite quantity, they are careful with how they use it, schedule, are usually timely and expect that from others. Better get it done now, life is short.\n\nP‚Äôs relate to time as an infinite quantity. It‚Äôs OK if it doesn‚Äôt get done today, there‚Äôs always tomorrow. They tend to break agreements (something came up), show up late to meetings, go with the flow.\n\nWhich one do you relate most to? \n\nPersonally, when I am in my deepest joy, I am P-ing randomly all over the place. üòâüòâ But college and corporate America taught me how to be very J.  \n\nHowever, right when I think I am P, it really rubs me the wrong way when people show up late, and at work I am happiest when things finish on schedule. \n\nSo I consider myself on the cusp, with natural structure at P but highly trained J.\n\nHope this helps.  \n
2	The same happened to me actually! Ive ended up concluding that its down to organisation. I sometimes can be incredibly organised and plan ahead for things. But I can also be terrible at time management amd get distracted easily. \n\nBare in mind, the test is mostly a guide and our brains more likely work in spectrums so its very possible you have a mixture of the two.
1	Learn the cognitive functions. INFJs have: Intraverted iNtuition, Extraverted Feeling, Introverted Thinking, and Extraverted Sensing\n\nINFPs: Intraverted Feeling, Extraverted Intuition, Intraverted Sensing, and Extraverted Thinking.\n\nSo they share no cognitive functions. They may look similar on the surface, but it should be easy to see which one you are. Learn the difference between Extraverted Feeling (Fe) and Intraverted Feeling (Fi), and maybe also Extraverted intuition (Ne) and Ni.\n\nAlso you should be open to the possibility that you are neither of these types. The MBTI test is notoriously shite and biased in favor of inuitives over sensors. Most people are sensors.
1	infps are generally more carefree than infjs (although infjs are so rare and reserved that ive never gotten to understand them, or maybe thats just me)\n\nthat aside, infps emotions are very volatile
23	Thought I was an INFJ for 4 years, am actually an ENFP.	I spent way too much time trying to figure this out. First, I had all of my friends take personality tests so I could learn about the Myers Briggs personalities. I gave lectures on it, and participated in group discussions with my peers about Jungian typology. I also studied the engram personality typing system. For 4 years I meditated thousands of hours I honestly can not remember the hours to count them. I believe the personality typing system is an illusion and everyone is an individual. however a useful tool for self reflection. The most sensitive tool we have to change our own consciousness is breath. I guess one of the benefits of studying the INFJ's function stack for so long is that I was accidentally studying my own sub-conscious, being the INFJ and the ENFP are each other's positive opposites.   \n\n\nSo here is what I have observed as an individual able to identify INFJ's. You all are basically like everyone else, but that's your magic.  You're not trying to blend in you're just you. You guys would probably continue reading this if it was not about you in some direct way. You are generally interested in other people, which makes me wonder why or how you are an introvert. They do tend to be quieter than other personalities I have noticed. You all are unique, no two INFJ's are the same but I do often find their interests in conversation are in human organizations and belief systems. So what does that mean for me as an ENFP for someone who also has those traits from time to time? It means my most commonly used function is extroverted intuition, my second most used function is Introverted Feeling, my third most used function is extroverted thinking (woo), and my fourth introverted sensing. So my question for the INFJs is this; how did you decide you were an INFJ?
14	Deciding to be infj? At least for me doesn't works like that.\n\nI feel this is more proper: Self discovery trip
8	INTJ here. Interesting read, makes me want to know more about shadow types. I noticed a fairly common mistype or people undecided whether they are INTJ or ENTP, so it makes sense this can happen with INFJ/ENFP as well. Coincidentally, I‚Äôm dating an ENTP and in certain social contexts, I think we perform as our shadow types. I wonder why that happens.
9	> So my question for the INFJs is this; how did you decide you were an INFJ?\n\nHonestly, I just took a couple free online tests, got INFJ on both and that's it. I read the descriptions and thought that INFJ did fit well with who I am. I haven't paid much more attention to it or read the other types in depth. I come here because I like the conversation and often feel like people here have shared similar experiences to me. For me, it's just anecdotal!
7	> I gave lectures on it\n\n....
3	Hey, I'm glad you figured out who you really are. I imagine it must be difficult spending all that time thinking you were one thing, but instead the other? But you've found out who you really are now, and that's what matters, I suppose!\n\nWhat you've written has resonated a lot with me! I suppose my interest in others is quite contradictory. I want to figure out how humans work, why we feel our feelings, and get to the roots of things. I want to help people, but from a distance, is probably the best I can say. Another allure is that everyone's lives are different, and there are so many ways people can either fall from grace or ascend! Simple descisions we do can change everything, so I always try to be helpful for others. I believe that by being nice to someone, such as smiling at them, you can change the world! Because then that person is happier, which makes another person happier, and so forth.\n\nI'm still unsure of my type honestly, and I'm not really in a rush to find out, haha. I'm on this sub because a few people have said that I might be an INFJ. I tend to take in other people's information and ideas, so I'm seeing how it goes over here.\n\nWho knows if we'll ever be 100% sure? Is it even possible to be 100% sure? :)
3	i thought i was infj for a good few months, turns out i‚Äôm an isfp.\n\ni just have more developed Ni than the average isfp (because i was abused when i was younger and the only safe place was my head, and only expressed myself through art)\n\nalso a tip:\n\nif you‚Äôre having trouble typing yourself, you‚Äôre gonna think that your middle functions are your dominant, and you think that you‚Äôre really good at them when you‚Äôre actually not. while i have more developed Ni, i still suck at using it.
2	Hmmm... I am an ENFP married to an INFJ and I have to say that sometimes we seem like the exact same person. Legitimately exactly the same person. It is weird because most people see us as VERY different. But to each other we are ridiculously similar. \n\nI don't know how to explain it so honestly my entire comment is BLUR but I just wanted to say I understand why you were confused. But isn't it interesting that people outside your relationship with INFJ - ENFP thinks you two are VERY different? 
2	I pretty sure I'm an INFJ however there have been times when I've wondered if I'm an INFP but then I Google a few articles and it convinces me that I'm definitely INFJ. One question I do have though as a lurker on this subreddit is why are there so many INFJs on here if we're the rarest personality type? It seems like we're all over social media and I wonder if it it's because a lot of people mistype as INFJ. 
20	I think I need life help from someone with experience [Repost from INTJ subreddit]	 Hi all,\n\n&#x200B;\n\n`[I posted this on the INTJ subreddit as well a couple minutes ago, but on the chance that I'm actually INFJ, or that you all can relate better or will care more, I'm posting it here as well]`\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBe  forewarned that this is going to be a bit rambley and what I consider very personal, but I'm hoping you guys of all people will be able to latch onto the underlying meaning of it all `(luckily this applies to both INTJ and INFJ)`. I have a few disconnected  thoughts that seem related, I'm just not sure how to fit all my thoughts together cogently yet, and if I'm being honest, I don't want to spend  the entire night thinking through and preparing an essay I don't even  know if people will even read :P\n\nIf  you have questions, I'm an open book. I'm pouring my heart out here, so  I'm hoping it resonates with someone. I'm even going to try to  structure this post in a somewhat unique and interesting way to hope it  can connect with more people. I'm aware that this is going to seem like  "way too much info", but it's deliberately written like that so that I  can just give as much information as possible about what's going through  my head. If I really felt like it, I could concisely ask a single  question and move on, but really I want to solve me, not just one  situational question. This is about as vulnerable as I can get at the  moment.\n\n**THE BEGINNING.**\n\nI'm  a 26 year old male, and was pretty distraught with life before I found MBTI and suddenly got caught up in a whirlwind of research, starting  with MBTI, moving to cognitive functions, then to general personality  comparisons, and finally with just general aspects of psychology. It helped me put together so much from my past and I feel much more  competent and stable in general, but there's still some last bits that I  can't seem to shake, there's so many conflicting accounts of what it  means to live life to the point where it seems like either nobody really  has any idea, or everyone has their own idea, regardless of whether  it's wrong or not, and apparently that's supposed to be fine, but it  really REALLY doesn't feel fine, it feels lazy, and arrogant, and like a  life of living in a massive blind spot.\n\nI  dunno, I'm rambling a bit, but it seems like the secret to life is  focus and working hard to achieve your dreams, unless it's not and it's  actually about being present and just going with the flow, unless it's  not and it's all about helping others, unless it's not and it's all  about helping yourself, unless it's not, etc... It's driving me a little  nuts. I have no end of passion for anything I do even if it's something  I don't necessarily like doing (as long as it doesn't feel deliberately  wrong), and I can always take lessons and happiness from just about  anything I do, but figuring out how I should be living my life seems  next to impossible at the moment aside from making small improvements  here and there like cleaning and exercising.\n\nWhen  I don't know if what I'm doing is the best thing, or is at least the  best possible thing, I very quickly default to going cold and detached,  because the alternative is thinking I'm doing something wrong, which  means I'm knowingly behaving in a "bad" way, and are therefore logically  an asshole. Knowingly doing something selfish, or acting arrogant, or  hurting people when you know the alternative has a better positive  outcome for ***"THE UNIVERSE"***  (or at least as much of it as you know) seems like the absolute worst  thing a person can do (in a general sense. I don't mean that stealing a  cracker is equivalent to committing genocide, but that knowing that  stealing a cracker is worse than not doing it, but still doing it, is  logically bad, just as genocide is almost certainly logically bad).\n\nI'm  aware that this way of thinking is probably not healthy and completely  impractical and impossible to uphold, but not only can I not shake it, I  can't even feel committed to the idea that it's something I should even  shake. Hence why I spend a good 2 hours or so of my night reaching out  to others for help, hoping that someone else has felt the same thing,  and why my life feels basically cold and detached outside, and intense  thoughts and emotions inside.\n\nFor  a bit of backstory, I had a rough childhood, and as far as I've  understood so far, that tends to spark the development of Fi very early,  unless it goes on for too long (like 20 years too long for example)  where it just comes back around and destroys itself. I distinctly  remember many moments and my general outlook on life being positive as a  kid, and then all the bad shit started happening and I started  hardening, standing up for my family, quickly becoming very mature, and  then just emotionally breaking and being completely depressed on the  inside, but stoic and focused on the outside.\n\nAs  this went on, I just lost touch with my childhood. It felt like stupid  pointless dwelling, and was pretty fuzzy anyways, I just assumed I had a  terrible memory and went on with my life, and let the past be the past,  all while beating myself up regularly for not being better, not being  normal, and not being happy. I felt like I had things I had heard would  make me a happier person, like working out and dating, and whatever  else, but never really had the motivation to do them, there never really  seemed to be any point because "it's just me, what do I really matter, I  should just focus on doing what I can to help and just make sure I  don't die of boredom in the meantime", all while hoping that one day it  would all be over and I'd get back to being "normal".\n\nAt  some point, due to life stress, I was pushed into having to get out of  relying solely on what I'm now pretty sure is intuition, and had to do  more than just be good at reacting to what life threw at me. It felt  very strange to seriously start using what I'm pretty sure is  extroverted thinking and felt like a bit of a leap to me. I think I  literally didn't trust my own thoughts as credible, so to suddenly think  I of all people could use LOGIC and make leaps without researching  absolutely everything online felt genuinely frightening. I think I was  seriously worried that I was pushed to my breaking point and could have  snapped (I was stressed out and pretty pissed off in general), but I  ended up going to opposite route, started meditating and introspecting,  working out, putting a bit of trust in myself and came up with some  hypotheses about what could be wrong, and \*then\* confirmed them online  through focused research to confirm that what I was thinking was  actually valid.\n\nSince then, I've gone  from feeling like a competent scatter brain, to actually starting to  care about myself and thinking I might actually have some surprising  value, and might actually be pretty damn capable and emotionally  sentivie. I think I might be healing, because I've started to notice  more "happy" impressions, and I've started noticing that I focus more on  the world. Smells, sounds, people, my own fashion choices, how I look  and act, how I feel and minor medical issues I've been ignoring, they're  all starting to be important. As a result, I think I've been noticing  more often that certain events, smells, feelings, whatever, elicit some  pretty strong memories of when I was happy as a kid, and I think that  same mechanism is how I'm good at my job. I get an impression of an  issue, and suddenly I pull everything together from past experience and  come up with an answer. This is what clued me in that I might actually  be INTJ (I've been pretty much in complete denial since I started  getting into all this about half a year ago), I'm pretty sure that's how  Ni works from all the descriptions I hear, and it makes sense with what  people say about how when you're doing work you love, you're happy and  it all just magically comes together on a consistent, sustainable basis.\n\nSo  here we go, after all that, here's some actual questions I have. If you  skipped all of that up there and just wanted to get to the heart of the  matter, it starts here.\n\n# YEAH I SEE YOU SKIPPING OVER ALL THAT AND CUTTING STRAIGHT TO THE "POINT"! >:(\n\n# THAT'S WHY I EMPHASIZED IT TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR YOU <3\n\nMy  problem is that I still can't get over feeling arrogant, and feel like  it's my duty to be humble always. The problem is that this conflicts  with all the impulses I have where I want to just shout someone down,  and spout out an entire idea for an hour and show that I really did  think all this through despite what I let on to try to be normal and  sociable. I really want to have a way to just have control over a  situation, not literally, but more control over myself to accurately and  to the best of my ability be able to get across an idea in a way that  other people can digest. The problem is that they feel so large and  complex and connected that I sort of just have to like...get ahead of  the conversation, and pre-empt all the questions I know are going to  come up by thinking, on the fly, how to phrase my idea to avoid or  confront those questions that I know will already be solved if I could  just get the whole idea out in one shot. I feel like I have to kind of  be a conversational architect so that I can get out my full idea, but  fuck is that ever difficult. I'm not great at it, and what ends up  happening is that I get frustrated, overwhelmed, and panic, start  rambling, ask questions that I know the answer to for some reason, and  eventually trail off uselessly.\n\nLike, I  recently opened up to two friends from work after one pointed out that  I'm actually very intimidating. I didn't know this (I assumed everyone  just thought I was quiet and kept to myself), and wanted to fix it, but  had no idea how to. I talked to them, tried to ask for advice on how I  could avoid that, and got the standard "you just have to frame things in  the way that other people will be receptive to". Like wow, what fucking  good advice, that sure helps. I'm almost certain that's just the  definition of being manipulative. It doesn't help that I know this guy  thinks very highly of himself, very often has a smug and demeaning look  on his face, and I wouldn't want to actually act like him, but it's  always good to get another person's perspective. What makes it worse, is  that now I \*know\* it's more cemented in his mind that I'm just some  hapless socially awkward fool who "just doesn't get it", and I can see  that fucking smug grin on his face saying "wow, you really are pathetic"  and I just want to punch it or very loudly and clearly explain why  that's wrong, but I don't because that's obviously wrong.\n\nI  really don't want to maintain the status quo, but fuck if I can't  figure out a good way to get out of it. These are the people I work  with, I can't suddenly cut them off. I can definitely limit my time with  them, and I've started doing that, but I just need to figure out a  method of living my life to get over my own insecurities all while  avoiding being a dangerous asshole, because I feel like it's very  possible. The feeling of me not being insecure seems highly related to  the feeling of me relentless tearing down everyone around me, and that  worries me, and I'm not sure how to separate them in my head (aside from  just being less insecure and realizing they're not the same thing, but  for obvious reasons, that's difficult to "just do").\n\nI  really really want to stop worrying about my possible actions so that I  can just live my life, but I just don't know how to yet, and just  "letting it go" seems extremely irresponsible.\n\n**Some other shit**\n\nThese  are little tidbits that are kind of related to this whole idea, I just  don't know if they need to go anywhere in that main body, so I'm just  going to list them here and maybe hope someone can figure out what to do  with them:\n\n* I'm  still not 100% convinced I'm an INTJ, having a broken childhood makes  it really tough to figure out what's what, but I also don't really care  too much exactly what my personality type is, it's just easier to find  relevant information if you tag your personality type to a search term  and when I try to post in other areas that aren't as focused as this,  it's harder to get a response.\n* I  could possibly also be an INFJ or INTP based on the descriptions. What I  think of as repressed feelings and depression could actually be very  strong Fe that I've never really gotten a handle on, and what I think of  as trusting my Te, could actually be a suddenly developing Ti (I think  this is around the time that your tertiary function is supposed to start  being more relevant). Sometimes I'm not sure what I feel, and most  times I just feel frustrated, empty, or neutral. When I get a second of  feeling happy in public, I feel like I quickly shove it down to avoid  being prideful or distracting others or drawing attention to myself.  Maybe I have really complicated feelings and a rough childhood that  makes things complicated, or maybe I have no or undeveloped feelings and  I'm actually an INTP who is just mature and focused. It's all a big  fucking confusing mess, and I feel like I need to just start going with  what seems the most fitting, just to get some kind of sense of  direction, so I take bits and pieces from different descriptions and see  if they relate to me and have use to me.\n* I  iteratively wrote this post. I'd write sections, and then go back and  rephrase them and notice that rephrasing in one area meant I'd have to  rewrite another to flow a bit better, and even after writing I know that  it's all a big mess of feelings and insecurities and that I should  probably just go see a therapist, but I don't want to take their time up  because I'm not like, suicidal or anything, I just need a bit of help,  and I'm worried that will make the therapist less likely to really  intently get to know me and will just make judgements on how I'm just a  liar or just tricking myself, or foolishly trying to rationalize  everything. I've heard some pretty terrible stories online from people  who I can't tell are either just afraid of their own thoughts and the  truth, or if the therapist really did say something like "Let's see how  you're going to lie to me today.". It just makes me hesitant, though I'm  fully aware that this is probably unrealistic and I can just put the  time into researching it.\n* I've  been getting a sneaking suspicion that all this personality stuff is  all a big joke and that really, everyone is the same and experiences the  same things and feelings in essentially the same way (disregarding past  experience), but that for whatever reason, the more "well adjusted"  normal people more readily "give in" and act on their impulses.\n* Something something free will and consciousness\n* I  literally can't seem to tell if I'm extremely smart and actually  genuinely do have those full good ideas, or just actually a completely  oblivious fool who really just doesn't get it, and that actually every  other person has the same feeling of "good ideas" and also equally can't  explain them fully, and that any attempt to delve into my head and  figure all this out is just a pointless task and "chasing the dragon"  and that really I should just give up and do whatever I feel makes me  happy.\n* I  just need some clear direction from some people who have experienced  something similar. I get that you're supposed to reach out to others and  learn from other people, and I feel like I have no problem doing that,  but maybe I've just tricked myself into thinking that I have no problem  doing that. Every effort I make to reach out seems to fall flat, and  it's starting to drive me nuts. You have to talk to people to learn more  perspectives, but every attempt to really connect with people seems  like it doesn't work, or it's constantly the wrong time, contextually,  to actually do that, and the only way I can really get out what I want  is to write a massive post online.\n* I JUST CAN'T LIFE. PLZ HALP.
8	I'm going to be honest and tell you I only read the first 13 paragraphs. But seriously. Are you me? I've never read anything so absolutely on point with my own life. 32/m INFJ here. If you ever want to talk about shit send me a message.
7	Awesome job for taking the first steps to self care! So there's a couple of things, but the core first. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou should reconsider seeing a therapist to hash out childhood trauma. The reasoning is two fold:\n\n1. Hash out verbally/physically what happened in your childhood with a person who is experienced in guiding others through emotional grievances in a safe way.\n2. By confronting it, it allows you to move on and to have more clarity in your life. Instead of being scatterbrained, your intuition will develop more thoughtful & creative connections that will naturally motivate you to plan and pursue action as the mothaf\*ckn INTJ you are.\n\nNow dealing with people. I think it's ok to share your opinions. You're trying to be pinpoint and illustrate objectivity in what can easily be considered by many a subjective universe. But remember, it is not your responsibility to change someone else's mind nor is it too win in every contest. You will never find the harmony you're looking for there. \n\nSo moving forward, There's really three choices here. You can either be a participant, an observer, or a combination of the two. by being a participant, you can create systems the will objectively bring more positive outcomes to your family/friends/community/world. If you choose to be an observer, be just that, observe. Hold no opinion, don't have any emotional attachment to ideals. The third option is a combination of the two. you participate in the world emotionally after observing it with detachment. Here, you strike a balance of the two.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell that's my two sense, you can take what I said, or ignore it. It's really only your decision at this point. I wish the best for you. Good Luck.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
6	Alright dude. I read every word. The thing is, whenever I read a long post like this, I get really mixed up when responding. I'm on my phone and can't really be scrolling around to write a perfectly-matching response to everything you said. But I will just make a few statements, and hopefully they will have some positive impact on you.\n\nFirst of all, I'm about a year younger than you and won't say I have more "experience" than you. None of this is condescension, just things that I've picked up in the past couple years.\n\nDon't ruminate too much. Seems like you have a tendency to think yourself into oblivion. I know it's not this simple, but try not to do it. I still ruminate these days, but I am usually able to recognize the pattern of thinking (playing events or conversations over and over) and nip them in the bud. I'm not a very social person. When I do have a conversation, I will mull it over in my head for hours or days after. It's not always negative, this happens with good events and conversations as well. Many times I will feel that uncomfortable twinge in my belly as I think these conversations over. I recognize it now, and willfully stop myself from continuing to think about whatever it is. I am a good deal happier these days because I dedicate less time to analyzing things to death.\n\nThis can extend to the thinking you do before even talking to people. The overthinking can stop you from saying anything in the first place. If you stop yourself from entering into these conversations, you are missing at least a few opportunities for positive connection. You are also missing out on the "practice" -- rarely putting yourself out there leads to more insecurity about your own social skills... If you are indeed an Ni-dom, Se is something that you don't trust in until you practice it.. a lot. It's a huge source of insecurity... Insecurity that leads to more sequestering, to more insecurity, to life as a total hermit. \n\nTry not to go down the hermit path. I did at one point... It was the darkest period in my life. I came out of it driven and much braver than before, but I could have more easily stayed in that dark cave for the rest of my life. You may be approaching the point where you can say "fuck it" and decide to live unapologetically. I'm still working on it, but these days I don't let myself get as concerned with what others think of me or what I say. I also don't try as hard to get out every last tangent of a thought. If the conversation allows it, great. But I no longer get incredibly (invisibly) upset when someone misses the point I'm trying to make. People are who they are, sometimes they just aren't on the level I need them to be, and that's okay. I decided I don't need anyone to be exactly where I think they should be. I'm a lot happier living this way. It also helps to go into a conversation openly. Be available to talk about what they want to talk about. Maybe at some point they will be able (and interested!) to hear every last morsel of that grand idea you have been working on.\n\nWhat else, what else... Try to stay a bit more positive in general! I know it's cheesy, I know life isn't all roses and sunshine, I know. But if you're thinking those negative things (I forget exactly what you were saying, but about the fear of seeing a therapist, about the guy that judges you and grins...) Just remember that in your view, you are the center of everything that happens. You say it like you're sure the therapist would judge you. You assume the guy with the grin is thinking terrible things about you. But you are perceiving these things with intuition. You don't actually KNOW what these people are thinking of you. Intuition is strong, but it's not magic. Check yourself. If you're constantly assuming people are thinking negatively about you, demand some proof from yourself. Did you overhear a conversation? Find someone's journal entry? We can be quick to disregard concrete evidence in favor of our "mystical" intuition and abstract connecting of all the dots. This goes back to inferior Se. Mistrust in the world around you. Think: "always assuming the worst"... \n\nIMO, Ni is powerful and so useful, but also at its most basic level, it is anxiety. I think INxJs experience a lot of anxiety (and feel broken because of it) simply because our preferred headspace is one that constantly reads between the lines and finds possible threats to our existence. Learn to check what the voice in your head is telling you against cold, hard, FACT. And don't let your intuition take you down a rabbit hole that will prevent you from living your life in a way that you enjoy. Not tolerate.. ENJOY. You have one life to live. Don't get bogged down in stuff that doesn't matter, even if your brain is making it seem otherwise. Read through your own bullshit like you read through the bullshit of others. \n\nAlso remind yourself that no one knows what the fuck they're doing. Everyone has their own struggles and life likes to fuck with everyone. You only know your perspective.\n\nBtw, you said you weren't sure if you're smart or dumb. I think the general rule is if you're self-aware enough to question your intelligence, you are automatically not an idiot. In any case, you strike me as an intelligent person, so don't worry about that too much. I know I rambled a bunch, but I hope there's something useful in here for you. Take care of yourself üíñ 
7	Hey lemme tell you I didn‚Äôt even come close to reading all of that or even half of it but mostly because I know if I paid closer attention it would‚Äôve sent me spiraling into another meltdown just like yours because I‚Äôm the same freaking way \n\n20 year old female INFJ and I stg I can‚Äôt go a single day without having some kind of breakdown for no reason over myself or my relationships with others or who knows what \n\nI could type for days without running out of words and still not be able to get it all out 
4	Okay so I directly relate to a bit of what you wrote. I also was really positive (& extroverted) as a kid and I had that same turn around and early maturity that leaded me to live 1/2 of my childhood depressed & with suicidal tendencies.\n\nI'd love to chat with you sometime about that, purpose, figuring out what "good" is and what it has to do with us,  and figuring out the steps forward.\n\n22m INFJ here who is still going through the struggle of trying to balance selfishness & selflessness too. It's bizarre how we can see self-care as selfish but just know that that's not true my brother. It's not. My lack of self care at a younger age fucked me over for life in certain ways I'd love to share 1 on 1 but I basically have living reminder of why self-care is never selfish. It's just not. Don't let that thought live in your head. Don't give it root. It's not healthy.\n\nLove you my man and if you want someone to break shit down or just listen sometime, reply here or message me and I'd happily make the time. Just let a boi know.
4	I read all of this and I‚Äôm amazed at the way it is written. This is exactly the way I think and lay things out.\n\nI‚Äôm 24M and I‚Äôm constantly aware of the way I affect the world, much to the detriment of myself. And I assume that to act more in my own interests is to be less aware of others. I don‚Äôt have any answers, just letting you know that someone else struggles with this.\n\nI‚Äôll be seeing a therapist soon hopefully. I don‚Äôt think you need to be suicidal or crazy to see one. They‚Äôre there to help undo harmful patterns that have emerged in peoples lives, and if left unsolved, can manifest into bigger problems. Childhood traumas are probably the biggest contributor to this.\n\nAs a side note if you find yourself considering therapy: finding a good therapist is like finding a new friend. You don‚Äôt gel with everyone. Don‚Äôt be discouraged if you need to see a few before you find one that you can relate to and respect. 
3	To be maladjusted to a low-level society is a positive feature. \n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_disintegration\n\nI believe everyone goes through this but due to lack of external stimuli people rarely go into self discovery or there's not enough drive to find out why things are the way they are. I went through shit 3 years go and I've become so fucking sensitive after that I had to look for answers or I would start drowning in addictive behaviours ruining everything around. That's when I stumbled on stoicism, Jung, Marcus Aurelius, Jordan Peterson, INFJ, psychology, Narcissism, other cluster B disorders, codependency. This led to hours of thinking on why there's so much shit in the world then getting overwhelmed and going back to those addictions, abusive relationships. I am still struggling but I've ended those relationships now trying to integrate all those fragmented parts of my personality.\n\nThe bit about people getting randomly intimidated is so true. I think they just need to know that parts of us which we don't reveal. Like we also are scared, confused. They think we've figured out everything. Maybe we have at their level. They might be at the level we once started. \n\nI'm probably rambling. I hope that this helps you because I've been in situation like you, still am. In short, as per that theory, choose the highest value as per your own value structure rather than the one impose by society every single time. 
3	I read every word, actually twice.  I just have a quick question or two, partially because I‚Äôm curious, secondly, because it is possible that you answering my questions might help you figure out whether you are INTJ or INFJ.  My first question is:  Have you taken the full MBTI test (online or from a book where your answers could be compared for results) or have a professional give one to you where they discussed the results with you and there was some give and take in trying to understand the results with this professional?   I know you said you don‚Äôt think you should go to a therapist as you are afraid you may be wasting their time because you are not suicidal, etc. , but perhaps you could spend a little time and money to get the full test done where there is someone who is trained specifically on MBTI who can help you work with the results of the test and also you could have them answer the questions about the results to you as the individual that you are within the larger, more general frame of MBTI typology.\n\nMy other question is this:  What I get from your post is that there is a lot of anxiety in you about whether or not you are doing the right thing to have your ideas (and by extension, yourself, since these ideas are important to you and you‚Äôve spent a long time pondering on them) accepted by others.  It doesn‚Äôt seem to me that you expect people to agree with your ideas, but you do want them accepted as valid and well-thought out ideas (and again by extension, having others see that you are the type of person that is thoughtful and puts a lot of time and effort on considering ideas,solutions, etc.).  Am I on the right path here?  If I am, then in that case, it doesn‚Äôt matter in the end what MBTI type you are, unless you truly feel that knowing what type you are will give you the tools you need to solve a situation (the story from work being an example, but since I too often tend to want to over explain my ideas to get the details and reasoning behind those ideas across, I suspect this may be something that happens to you as well in social situations quite often) that is giving you anxiety as you try to overanalyze your own behavior after the fact to try and make sure you don‚Äôt handle it the same way in the future (if said situation did not end the way you hoped it would).\n\nI am an INFJ, my husband an INTJ, and both of us overanalyze other people‚Äôs‚Äô reactions to what we say (or ideas we have, etc) all the time.  I think the difference between the two of us is that it seems to be only an issue for him when it has to do with whether he thinks someone respects him or not for his ideas, etc. (especially in the workplace) and in the larger world as a whole.  I tend more to want other people to understand my ideas and how I got to the conclusion I did (at work or otherwise) and why I think it will work, but I don‚Äôt really care how the wider world views me outside of a very few people or those people in a team I‚Äôm trying to get something accomplished with.  I don‚Äôt know if by mentioning the difference between the way an INFJ and INTJ handle one of the root issues you were talking about in your post will help you decide which you are (if you do think that figuring out which of these two MBTI types will help you resolve inner issues you are dealing with), but I just throw it out there in case it does.\n\nEdited for a very important question mark I had forgotten to include.\n\n\n\n

3	Damn, you sound like me. I think you just have to own up to the fact that your abilities with introverted intuition are just better than others. Other people can imitate it, but I think it‚Äôs clear that you‚Äôre better at it. An INTJ friend of mine said his strategy is to typically let everyone in meetings talk first, and then using introverted intuition he pulls all the ideas together along with his to make a decision towards the end. He said something along the lines of people tending to respect his decisions because it becomes quite clear he‚Äôs almost always right. I think it‚Äôs tough to not feel guilty, but you have your place. I also think it‚Äôs better to feel guilt than narcissistic.
3	I'm going to be super short about it bc I'm on tablet and also blunt sometimes. I've read the entire thing.\n\nI feel you are at a point in your life where you are getting clarity and healing but things get worse before they get better. The way you write sounds like you are in the middle of a paradigm shift.\n\nTwo recommendations: \n1. Look into Jungian shadow work.\n2. Buy a journal and write. A lot. You need to get it out.\n\n
2	I won't lie to you, I didn't read EVERY word lol, but enough to feel like we have very similar thinking patterns, and honestly I have been kind of struggling between the same types as you, and I had an abnormal childhood to say the least.  Sometimes I cannot decide if I naturally make decisions with my heart or with logic, I usually factor in both.  I identify with INFJ because it's the one that feels the most like me.  I was like you and I researched MBTI for a solid 6 months straight, which honestly made deciding on my type wayyy harder lol.  I felt like I was cheating every time I would take the test because I knew what each answer meant lol.\n\nAs for your question, I feel you.  I try so very hard not to brag about myself, and I cannot express to you the guilt I feel when I catch myself bragging.  Sometimes I am just proud of myself and want to share it lol. I have learned that sometimes it's ok to brag a little, you can still be humble about it.  We cant always be so hard on ourselves, you know?  My philosophy on it all is to just love.  Act out of love, leave behind hate, anger, fear, pride, lust, etc that may only temporarily please you, but destroy you later.  Nothing done out of real love can be bad, at least not in the end, and I am looking at this as an end game thing lol.   There is probably more I could comment about on your biography lol, but you gave me information overload and that's all i got for you at this moment lol.
2	I didn‚Äôt read most of it but from skimming over the bit  about being intimidating to others when your not even aware of it, I can relate to that. I read how to win friends and influence people by Dale Carnegie and by slowly applying those to my life. I‚Äôve gotten better at that aspect of life. 
2	About this parragraf:\n\n> Like, I recently opened up to two friends from work after one pointed out that I'm actually very intimidating. I didn't know this (I assumed everyone just thought I was quiet and kept to myself), and wanted to fix it, but had no idea how to. I talked to them, tried to ask for advice on how I could avoid that, and got the standard "you just have to frame things in the way that other people will be receptive to". Like wow, what fucking good advice, that sure helps. I'm almost certain that's just the definition of being manipulative. It doesn't help that I know this guy thinks very highly of himself, very often has a smug and demeaning look on his face, and I wouldn't want to actually act like him, but it's always good to get another person's perspective. What makes it worse, is that now I *know* it's more cemented in his mind that I'm just some hapless socially awkward fool who "just doesn't get it", and I can see that fucking smug grin on his face saying "wow, you really are pathetic" and I just want to punch it or very loudly and clearly explain why that's wrong, but I don't because that's obviously wrong.\n\nI have an aunt who is constantly pushing others down, criticising others, telling us how we should be doing things, etc. She has strong opinions on everything, even if she only just found out about its existence, and a closed-mind so it's very difficult to talk to her. Practically every comment she says is something along those lines. I used to have a very short temper. I've gotten better at it, it's something I've being trying to fix for a long time, but the point is that I used to explode multiple times when around her. Her constant criticism of me really got me down, upset me, made me defensive. Was I really doing everything *wrong*? Was I such a useless person that I have to fix and change so many things? \n\nFor example, every Christmas we go to my cousin's house and play Just Dance. I'm a terrible dancer, but it's not like you actually have to dance to win the game, you really just have to move your hand with the remote. So that's what I do, mostly: some really bad dance moves and moving my hand. My sister, however, is better at dancing but not so good at moving her remote. My aunt, every year, yells at me from across the room how I'm such a bad dancer, how I shouldn't even be playing, how this game is so stupid, etc. When I win, because half the time I do, she says I don't deserve it, that I didn't do anything, that I'm terrible at the game... It always gets to me. It's a secret to absolutely nobody that I'm bad at dancing, yet her words always make me feel bad and worthless and like I'm not good enough.\n\nWhat helped me a lot in dealing with her was a sentence I read once: The person who is criticising you, do you aspire to be like them? Are they someone who you look up to and take as an example? If the answer is no, then their advice and their opinions of you aren't really that important or even relevant, don't take what they say personally. We have to listen to the advice of people we want to learn from, people we want to be like, people who are a good example.\n
2	The fact that you spent this time to write such a detailed description of what goes on in your head lets me know that are you indeed an INFJ and that there's something truly beautiful about the mind when it has the capacity to process so many different ideas given the intensity at which these ideas arise in our brain. 
2	To quote Granny Weatherwax, "as you grow older you'll find most people don't set foot outside their own heads much." This post--this beautiful, lengthy, tumultuous, incredibly self-conscious cry for "HALP"--absolutely screams of someone desperately needing to do just that.And while  I obviously can't actually coax you out of your own mind, I can try to illustrate why it's important that you try anyway.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLook, I get it. You're trying to perform the delicate high-wire act of shifting into adulthood without crashing and burning along the way, and maybe you've taken a few falls but you're sure as hell not down yet. Then you discover a theoretical framework in the MBTI that promises to help you solve the one puzzle that eludes you--your own mind. This is great! Your own mind is all you've ever known--it's a "locked room" that keeps you imperially and fundamentally alone from everyone else--but with this framework, you begin to suspect that you can break out of it and finally do this thing called "living."  \n\n\nUnfortunately, the deeper in you look the more convinced you become that the model is all bullshit. There are epicycles within epicycles everywhere as internet folks rush around determined to "type" everyone else within their own myopic understanding of the framework, focusing on isolated events in order to justify their own foregone conclusions. You throw yourself in deeper, reading more articles, taking more tests, watching YouTube videos--but nothing ever really answers all your questions, and it feels like you're just swimming further and further away from the shore.  \n\n\n  \nHere's the first MBTI secret I eventually learned: quoth Monty Python, "It's only a model." MBTI is a lens to understanding yourself, but it's not the only one--and probably not anywhere close to the best one, either. It has its uses, and refining your understanding of this bizarro thought pattern we call introverted intuition is one of them, but it is incredibly limited in terms of describing the whole picture. When you write out a physics equation, that's merely the simplest approximation of reality; arriving at more accurate answer would take up much more time with increasingly diminishing returns in terms of derivation time. Likewise, you may be an INTJ--or you may be an INFJ caught in an Ni-Ti loop, like I believe myself to have been--or you may be something else altogether.   \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's the second MBTI secret: it doesn't really *matter* what you are. You see a model with sixteen "clearly defined" types and, hey, you're a smart guy, so it must be easy to place yourself within that model, and then you get frustrated when an easy description defies you. What matters is that you're asking the questions. It literally is the journey, not the destination, that will lead to self-improvement here.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother caveat: the MBTI model *doesn't account* for things like trauma. It just doesn't. That's why it's only one particular lens to understanding. The others in this thread mentioning possible therapy to deal with unresolved childhood trauma are probably speaking wisdom.  \n\n\n  \nThe reason I spend so much time on this, rather than addressing your interpersonal concerns, is that as long as you remain self-conscious you will never truly be happy around other people. I'm not saying you have to totally let go and relax to find fulfillment with other people, but I do think that once you're able to trust yourself you will find it infinitely easier to trust others.   \n\n\n  \nSome suggestions:  \n\n\n* Read more! If you are an INTJ/INFJ, you really need to be feeding that Ni processor as much information as you can; the certainty of its conclusions belies its own inner ignorance if you haven't properly fed it. If you're not an INTJ/INFJ read more anyway--as Stephen King observed, it's the only way I can think of to engage in actual telepathy with another H. Sapien.  \n\n* Pick up a hobby! This post doesn't make it clear what you actually do for fun. Ideally, this hobby will bring you into contact with other people so you can batter down those feelings of isolation and self-consciousness. (My life was legitimately changed when I found D&D in high school, for example.)  \n\n* Listen more! It sounds like you have a very direct communication style that others may find unpalatable at times. Focus more on trying to "walk in the shoes" of the person who's speaking--that may give you a better insight on how to present your strong vision to them in a way they'll actually understand. Is this manipulation? Only if you're doing it maliciously; everyone else would call it diplomacy. :)  \n\n* Find people you trust and allow yourself to be free *and* vulnerable around them. Understand that they chose to be around you and aren't there to cut your down or tear you apart--they like you for you. Knowing and accepting that you're loved can help you go a long way toward loving yourself.   \n\n* Do yourself a favor and take a break from the MBTI. Just like Asimov's Multivac, it's perfectly fine to say "INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR MEANINGFUL ANSWER." Your need to crack the code and get a final answer will only cause you pain. Just relax, get out of your own head, and enjoy being 26. You'll be surprised how quickly it passes you by if you're not busy living it.
1	Like a few others who have commented here I feel like we have had a very similar beginning as well as struggles with figuring out who we are. I understand what it‚Äôs like to feel like an ass over a seemingly small action and to not want to take too much pride in myself for fear of being perceived like a narcissist. I also don‚Äôt understand this whole ‚Äúlet it go‚Äù concept. I understand what people mean when that say it but putting it in action is another thing. \nA few things that have helped me feel more confident and less like an ass is simply believing people and just communicating with them. If someone says you‚Äôre good at something, say thank you. They probably mean it. If you hear it a lot it‚Äôs ok to think that maybe just maybe it‚Äôs true. If you feel you have done something wrong analyze it and see what can be done. Said something slightly off to a person. Bring it up to them. I‚Äôve told people more times than I can count ‚Äúhey I‚Äôm sorry that came off this way I didn‚Äôt mean that. I meant this‚Äù\nMore often than not they never thought that what I feared that I meant was what I meant. It‚Äôs eases me and shows that I care. Seems like a win win to me. I also feel I can‚Äôt help solve this whole dilemma with you. The search of self discovery is what we allow. But I hope maybe this helps in a small way. If you ever is want to chat about all this deep stuff message me. Some times the comment thread can be long. Good luck on your journey! \nAlso I‚Äôm a 28 F INFJ.\nüíö
1	After reading your entire post, I couldn't put myself to read through all the responses you've received so I'll try to keep my own unique and short.\n\nI'm only 21, I had messed up childhood and also not very good at social. Seeing that we also think alike and also having issue with having a hobby that you can claim as "yours". Like, we can get into many things but unable to settle on any and be motivated enough to make the best out of it. But yeah, aim at something you can determine meaningful is what I did and you have to learn to ignore every other path you "could" have taken. But without a focused aim, we go nowhere, without securing a destination first, you won't be able to begin.\n\nI'd recommend on looking for Jordan Peterson works if you haven't yet or the 5 personality trait but what it seems like to be is that we're very high on "conscientiousness" and that can be quite dreadful as we overly think about things (every little things). In brighter side of things, we are more likely to be successful in life and achieving higher goals.\n\nAs of what is the meaning of life, is what we always ask. Well, there isn't any if you look at how big the universe is and everything you do will not matter in a billion year. But what about this? When you have reached your end, how about dying with the recognition of the world was better (magnitude doesn't matter, but you can make it bigger if you wish to) because the fact that you have existed. And the meaning of life would be you helping the world becoming a better place for everyone :) Heavy but meaningful, heavier the better and it'll be more meaningful to you. Cheers buddy, hang in there.
1	In summary I think you are having difficulties right now with mental health and insecurities and that is what is holding you back from improving on your skills as an INFJ. \n\nBeing conflicted between arrogance and humbleness is a total INFJ thing ‚Äî being conflicted in general really ‚Äî I constantly ride that line. You have the T to know what you‚Äôre talking about but the F to know when and if it‚Äôs a good idea to say it. I think you have all the tools to be a great conversationalist but it‚Äôs a skill that needs to be worked on. If I didn‚Äôt have 5+ years of customer service I‚Äôd probably in a similar place. It‚Äôs also about confidence in you‚Äôre own abilities as well, as soon as you get flustered... it‚Äôs game over. Totally impossible to get your train of thought back. \n\nIn some circles that‚Äôs all anyone does is manipulate. We are chameleons, we can integrate into any social situation ‚Äî when in the mood ‚Äî but we see surface level bullshit for what it is even when we participate in it ourselves to keep the circle amiable. That guy sounds like an ass, however you‚Äôre letting him press your buttons. There‚Äôs an insecurity there that you think he knows about. Just remember that most people don‚Äôt know shit about us, if you work on yourself you know you could run circles around those people any day. It‚Äôs all about keeping calm and trusting yourself. The most likely reason cocky people are cocky is because they are hiding an insecurity themselves, if they‚Äôre good looking they have a shit personality or something, everyone‚Äôs got something they‚Äôre insecure about. The cockiness is just a defence mechanism. \n\nAnother thing that really helps is not focusing on them reading you but try to focus on you reading them. This is our natural skills at work. They‚Äôre bringing the subject back to you, and that‚Äôs not our strong suit, we don‚Äôt deal well with the centre of attention, especially if it‚Äôs not our favourite crowd to be in. Whatever you do try to get the attention off you until you have read the room closely. Then if someone tries you, you have more ammo to use if you need to. \n\nIt is unfortunate to have to resort to their behaviour but if you absolutely need to socialize with them you need their respect, and disgustingly resorting to their level is a way of doing that. I just think of it as social survival. \n\n
14	Become a healthy male INFJ?	I‚Äôm a 22M INFJ, what are some good steps to becoming an emotionally ‚Äòhealthy‚Äô INFJ? 
1	Usually we prefer more detailed questions, but we think this is a great topic for community discussion! We've marked it with "Community Post" flair accordingly.
25	As a 22m INFJ myself I'll share 3 things I've recently learned.\n\n1. Let friendships drift apart if they're heading that way naturally. Make sure you're both on good terms, but if you don't talk for 5 months and then decide to catch up, take both the opportunity to take a break & the opportunity to reconnect. It's worth it.\n\n2. Take care of yourself. It's not selfish.\n\n3. You're not perfect & it's okay to act like it. At this stage in our life we're so obsessed with growing and developing, but if you're already taking good steps in that direction don't stress it anymore. Everyone fucks up from time to time. It's okay :)\n\n(Bonus!) Develop your hobbies and find a few things you can get absolutely lost in.
10	develop healthy friendships with men and women platonically and securely attached.
8	I would say that being emotionally healthy is all about understanding your emotions and feelings, knowing why you feel that way, and being able to manage how your react to those emotions appropriately. So here are the few tips that I try to live by for that each day, they work for me, but might not be for everyone.\n\n1. Understand your emotions and how they make you behave. Do you get anxious before meeting someone new? Does that make you not talk with them as much as you‚Äôd like? Just understanding that is important!\n\n2. Identify appropriate techniques to manage your emotions. Everyone will get stressed or anxious - that‚Äôs healthy - but how we react to those feelings is what‚Äôs important. When I‚Äôm stressed, I tend to procrastinate- so instead I‚Äôve started taking a short walk and deep breathes for 5 minutes and then making myself get back to work.\n\n3. Find your balance. Don‚Äôt work too much, don‚Äôt play too much, or sleep too much. Find the right balance of things you know you need in your life to be happy. I know I need more alone time than most - so I intentionally make time for that otherwise it won‚Äôt happen. But after an hour of chilling by myself I know I need to get back to other responsibilities.\n\n5. Exercise! This is the best way to turn a sour mood sweet. Get your body moving, get outside, and get your heart rate up! It might suck for a bit, but you‚Äôll feel much better after moving.\n\n7. and last one - be in the moment. There‚Äôs always lots to dwell on from the past or worry about in the future. I‚Äôm guilty of both of those a lot. But putting those thoughts aside and being present in this moment is important to living a full life!
7	Read some of the INFJ articles on Introvert, Dear (its a blog)
5	Slow down. Like yourself.
5	Set boundaries. They are super important in order to create healthy relationships with yourself and others.
4	The biggest turning point in my life was learning how to recognize and manage my emotions. For example, hey I'm starting to feel lonely, and sad because I'm thinking about myself being lonely. That means I should reach out to someone and talk to them or spend time with them and get out of my head. Basically, self awareness of my emotions, and knowing what works for me to handle that specific emotion. When I was younger, I used to feel so deeply and intensely that my emotions would consume me and my life was like a roller coaster ride. Now events/feelings that would have previously incapacitated me don't affect me for very long, and I learn from them.\n\nAnother one is setting and enforcing boundaries. I know that when I'm upset, it means that someone is crossing the line and I need to communicate with them and ask for what I want (sometimes you need to ask multiple times). I realized that I was only ever bitter/resentful when I was trying to be nice by taking crap from other people. And maybe they didn't even know they were giving me crap. \n\nGetting better at knowing what's actually important and learning to let go of idealism/perfectionism for certain things (probably my biggest work in progress right now). Makes life so much easier and things actually get done. But I still hate it when I compromise on my vision of how things should be. I also recently developed the growth mindset which has helped a lot with perfectionism.
5	Hi,\n\nDont be afraid to make mistakes.\n\nDate / Enter Relationships (very important to becoming emotionally healthy)\n\nIf you get a stuck point in your life (several years with no growth), develop your Fe... dont worry about Ti or Se yet\n\nTake care of your body\n\nHave Fun
2	Countless of things one could say. I prefer keeping it simple. One thing only: listen to your instinct, understand it and being willing to jump in the unknown is something that at first sight seems so unlogical. It‚Äôs there for a reason, use it or lose it.
2	I am an INTJ. My tip is don't underestimate the effect that diet has on emotional stability. 
2	Don't fix yourself as "INFJ", fix you, don't try to connect you with personality type, find your own flaws not some dumb shit repeated by some clickbait site. Oh and I don't mean being any personality type is bad but focusing on "unhealthly side" of any personality is wrong. Focus on increasing your positives with accepting that you can't be ideal.  Maybe im slightly harsh but my english isn't enough to write it in kind way.  So with more pragmatic approach find what is making you go into any self-destructible behaviours/habits and slowly one by one replace them with something productive.
1	Thanks man that was just what i was looking for. Really helpful. Any ideas for new hobbies? as my hobbies currently are quite isolating....
1	Find ways to counterbalance your native tendencies, just stretch your abilities by practicing things you are uncomfortable with.
1	Be kind to your mind, body and soul. Read and get lost in things you find intellectually stimulating. Be curious. Eat well and exercise. And embrace your inner artist. Do all these things and you're well on your way.

1	1. Hard thing fir us to do, but you have to learn to put yourself first, to take care of yourself.  If you‚Äôre not in a good place physically/mentally/emotionally, you can‚Äôt help others like you‚Äôre driven to do.\n\n2. It‚Äôs ok to say no.
1	Learn to recognize when you're over-complicating something. This is your perfectionism at work. Let it live too long and, before you know it, life will have passed you by.

We have an extensive [FAQ section on relationships between types](https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/wiki/faqs#wiki_type_interactions), with a [table of summaries[(https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/wiki/faqs#wiki_compatibility_per_type). We also have a [FAQ section on how to care fo INFJS](https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/wiki/faqs#wiki_infjs_and_relationships).
1	Since my post was removed few days ago I'll try here:\n\nHey INFJs! Fellow ISFP here. Hope all is well in your world. \n\nI (28M) recently started seeing an INFJ (24F) and looking for advice.\n\nThis weekend I booked a rustic cabin in the mountains that we are going to snowshoe into and stay the night in. \n\nI really want to use this time together to get to know her better and understand who she is and what she values. From what I researched, INFJs have a difficult time being understood by others. In your opinion, what are some questions I could ask that would open her up so I can understand her better? Or maybe, an activity or game we could play? \n\nAny advice is much appreciated. Thank you guys :)
7	Why do INFJs and ISTPs subliminally denigrate people's goals and ambitions?	I'm just curious if you've noticed this about yourself and why you may do it on a sub-conscious/unconscious level. Is it de-valuing Si/Ne, which as an axis is sort of about comfort and fantasizing?  
16	That sounds like a toxic people issue rather than correlated to MBTIs.\n\nI often feel like I am the only person out there these days who is genuinely happy for other people's successes, goals and ambitions. And I try to encourage and help them along the way if I can.\n\nFrom personal experience, I can recall many ISTJs, ESTJs, ESFJs, ISFJs who tried to denigrate people's goals and ambitions (including mine). \n\nNow that you mention it, they do all have Si in common. I'm not sure why that is. Perhaps Si people are more prone to feelings of inadequacy and jealousy? I have quite often found that those types of people do it out of a place of insecurity and wanting to see others fail so they don't feel so bad about themselves. \n\nThat, and the fact I feel like they are on a different wavelength to me (ie: they don't "just get it" when I talk to them) is why I don't bother interacting with unhealthy sensors anymore. I only like healthy sensors or intuitive people.
7	I can't speak about ISTP's, but as an INFJ, I can get to motives real quick. \n\nAuthenticity and motives. We have very finely tuned BS detectors. If we feel someone is BSing us or themselves we call it out. \n\nThe way our minds work, is we are pretty good odds people. We can see the end result of a chain reaction. So if someone says or motions "I want to push this domino" We are going to respond "well this domino 10 places down at a fork is going to fall, are you sure that's what you want?" \n\nWhile the other person is tunnel visioned on that first domino they think we're wacky because we are seeing a larger picture or chain than the other person can currently fathom. That comes off as rude sometimes, or too up front. However it's meant in earnest and as we put ourselves in other situtations we  can see things happening when they either can'r or refuse to themselves. \n\nWe are able to connect data points of external things very quickly and reduce those to the best fit possible outcomes out of the chances of thousands of scenarios being played out in our heads. \n\nSorry if we  burst a bubble every now and then.
2	The idea of axis is outdated, there is no axis.\n\nYour Perceiving and Judging attitude towards External and Internal objects can't be both ways, meaning you can't have Ti AND Fi in your stack, or value both Ne AND Se. That's all. There is no contradiction in valuing both Se and Si, or both Te and Ti. \n\nExample for INFJs: Nothing stopping you guys from having a feely attitude both inwardly and outwardly. You harmonize with people (Fe) and with your own convictions (Fi).\n\nModel G socionics proposes a more accurate stack compared to MBTI:\n\nINFJ: Ni Fe Fi Se\n\nINFJs treat people and objects as unique (Fi), they prefer not to refer to individuals using categories (Ti) that they belong to. They listen deeply and with empathy (Fi) and not critically (Ti). INFJs value Ti, but they know how weak they are at it. They certainly value Fi over Ti is what I'm trying to say.\n\n
1	Me (infj)and my mother (istp). Both of us know how to play games with one another. She knows how to grab at my feelings but I know how to bend the truth with her. It‚Äôs not the best relationship but we have learned to understand one another. I still have problems with her till this day. She raised me. I still play ignorant with her affairs so that we won‚Äôt have conflict. I think that they do it for security or their gut feelings. I‚Äôm not  sure, I‚Äôm drunk.
20	INFJs dating Exxx's : How do you balance your partner's extroversion??	I'm INFJ/F/24 dating a ENFP/M/23 for \~ 6 months. Recently there's been a rift between us because of our social habits and preferences. He runs with about 15 good friends (no joke) and I have a close-knit group of 4-5 friends. Our friend groups don't overlap since I'm drawn to mature individuals who are usually 5+ years older than me & his friends are all younger with loads of energy. It's gotten to the point where he's stopped inviting me to his stuff because he assumes I'll be uncomfortable around his 15+ friends - which I *am* because my social battery drains after about an hour & I become a wallflower while he's busy entertaining. When I try to hang out alone with him, he'll oblige but not without a side comment about how he doesn't feel lucky to be dating me when he can't share me with the people he's close to. We get along so wonderfully on a personal and conversational level, but recently I feel that I won't ever be able to fit in to his incessantly fast-paced social life. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny other INFJs in this gridlock with an extroverted partner? Is this a trivial thing that can be worked out? Any tips to find a balance? Our relationship is quietly winding down without any petty drama or big fights, and for some reason it hurts more this way. Would love some advice on this particularly dreary Wednesday :) \n\n&#x200B;
13	> I become a wallflower while he's busy entertaining\n\njust be a wallflower, what's wrong with that?
13	To find balance, you need to look into developing your own self worth.\n\nWhat this really means is you need to find something outside your relationship to focus on and use in your down time of being with your partner.  Let and understand that an EXXX is going to be all over the place and doing their bouncing around.  This gives you the opportunity to recharge, focus on your own desires/goals etc.\n\nIts a blessing in disguise\n\n&#x200B;
5	I was in a relationship like this in the past...me being an INFJ and him being an extrovert. What helped me to deal with his incessant social life was to have a lot of his friends come over and hang out at our place. I could be as social as I wanted, spending quality time with his friends for a bit, then retreat to another area of the house when I wanted to be alone.¬†\n\nIf you're out at one of his friend's houses or out on the town, it's harder for you to get away or take a break when you need to because I assume you arrive together. One possibility is to drive separately or just take an Uber home so that you can leave on your own time when you're starting to feel drained.¬†\n\nIn my opinion, it important to at least be social with your man a little bit to show that you care about his friends. Do you like some of his friends, and do you have fun with them even if it's just for an hour or so? I think that's pretty important because if none of his friends are fun to be around, then it's understandably hard to even spend one hour with them.¬†\n\nIf you really love him, I'd say it's definitely a possibility that you can figure it out. The two of you can bring out the introvert and extrovert in each other from time to time, which can be a positive thing!
6	I am an INFJ (and not surpringly, very intorverted) and my husband is the definition of an extrovert. To make matters worse, I have a job where i am around a lot of people and interacting all day long and his is an office job with minimal interaction.\n\nSo you can imagine the troubles we've had in our relationship. What helped us was to have an open and honest discussion about the issue. I was constantly worried that since I didn't want to go out as much as him, that he thought I was lame, boring etc.\n\nAfter many weeks and hours of trying to come to a solution, we came up with a few things.\n\nFirst was that I had to stop worrying he was judging me. It took a lot of reassuring but he promised he didnt think I was boring or lame.\n\nSecondly, we decided it was more than ok to do things seperately. If he needed to go out with friends or have a game night, it was perfectly acceptable for him to do that alone and there would be no bad feelings whatsoever from either sides\n\nfinally, we decided that if need be, we can leave events seperately (not my favorite idea but, it helps). If I was at my socializing limit and he wasn't, it was ok for me to go home before him. This one solved a lot of fights for us, and we try to discuss beforehand if we will leave together or seperately so we are both mentally prepared.\n\n\nI know it seems a bit straightforward but that has really helped us avoid arguments, fights and wearing the other one out.\n\nGood luck, friend!
3	I don't understand why he needs to share you and gets funny with you if you don't hang out with his friends.\nFurthermore it annoys me that he expressed that you are less to him for this instead of working something out that's a middle ground.\nThe 15 friends thing seems like an ego thing, trying to feel love *by* being "popular", I wouldn't be able to keep up with so many people without getting exhausted and feeling like the friendships are bland and empty because there isn't enough time to build a proper connection.\n\nI'm ENFP, 6w7 btw\n\nI recommend standing up for yourself and talking to him to organise a proper compromise.
3	INFJ with an ESTP here...\n\nI am perfectly content with hanging out inside on a rainy Sunday morning/afternoon, but he absolutely hates it and goes stir crazy after an hour or so. We compromise by him having a friend over, or he gets his way and we get out of the house to eat or thrifting. We love having our alone time though, so the part where he is almost bored with just you and constantly wants to include other people is frustrating and unrealistic. He needs to work on nurturing your relationship and slow down with the constant activity.
3	Hi! Infj married to and enfp. I love the fact that he does most of the talking and it seems like I do most of the thinking...lol!!\n\nI dont really have friends but its nice when my husband wants to go hang out with his friends (Netflix time for me yay!!). \n\nYou guys are just going to have separate lives and just let each other be. Try to focus on the positive of each other and try to understand...even though I get the Enfp is weird because they dont behave like we do lol\n\nAs the PP said find balance. But I want to share something about the ENFP. They can be ambiverts but I feel like as they get older they become introverted.  I'm noticing with my enfp hes becoming an intp. He would rather just stay home and hang out with our family.  I would look that up.
1	My partner and I try to communicate our needs nicely and respect each others. (Note: My partner is ENTP, but I think he's just barely an extrovert, perhaps an ambivert. He loves talking to people but he doesn't like going to parties or being around loud people). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf I need to be alone for a while, I'll just ask him, "Can I lie down in my room while you use the computer out here for a bit?" And he knows what that means and gives me time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's a fine line...we encourage each other to do things out of our comfort zones (i.e. like hanging out in a group) but we also know when the other person has hit their limit. It may come with getting to know your partner even more. It took me three years to realize that my BF has officially reached his breaking point emotionally when he starts rubbing his face. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wouldn't worry too much about it. Do what you can to meet your partner's needs but communicate clearly what your boundaries and needs are - that's all you can do.

14	Thoughts on INFPs?	It'll be nice if you guys could give feedback on us INFPs,maybe focusing on the good/ bad qualities of them in depth(if possible) ,also maybe first impressions when meeting them,your experiences with them as well. On a side note,you guys are lovely ‚ù§
10	The one I've met and have been close friends with for almost ten years is extremely sweet and imaginative. She's highly artistic and idealistic, constantly dreaming up new ideas. She sees beauty in just about everything, and loves to compliment the intricate details. She often insists that she isn't as good at art as everyone constantly tells her, struggling with self doubt and imposter syndrome, even though she really is amazing. She also struggles with completing creative projects on time, mostly cause of her perfectionism, but she's getting better. Overall, a wonderful friend and I love talking about dreams, ideas, and creativity with her.
7	I wish I was either INFP or INTJ. You INFP are incredibly delightful reminders of our more creative idealistic side, INTJ's are incredibly delightful reminders that we are also unfortunately hamstrung by a logical side. \n\nPoor old INFJ stuck here like a balloon on a very confused string. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can share with you my favourite INFP quote (which is probably not the best quote, but it's something I identify with):\n\n"Feeling is caught in the approach- avoidance bind between concern both for people and for All Creatures Great and Small *and a psycho-magnetic repulsion from the same.* The "object," be it homo sapiens or a mere representation of an organism, is valued only to the degree that the object contains some measure of the inner Essence or greater Good*.* "\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKnowing that there are other people out there like that is endearingly comforting. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
4	My closest friend is an INFP. She's the only person I've ever met that can go as deep conversationally as I can, which is something I'm really grateful for. Must be something with the intuition we have in common. She's also really good at feeling *with* you in the moment, as in sharing in the happiness and sadness of the moment, does that make sense? haha. As for less good qualities, that would clearly be the inferior Te: she's super disordered, is usually late and forgets things from 5 seconds ago, but that's a small price to pay for all the good sides and even then, that kind of dishevelled confusion is pretty cute sometimes!
5	I get along well with INFPs. I love your Ne. It makes me think about how I process things and your questions lead me to learn a lot. I love the way you're always trying to understand things, and you do it out in the open where we can see the process. But it can be really easy for an INFP to get stuck in that enormous, overwhelming Fi, so that part can be hard for me, because then I absorb those big feelings and I have to feel them with you. And I feel like there's nothing I can do to help when someone in stuck in their Fi, so that's frustrating.
4	I like INFPs a lot, I definitely know way more of them than any other type. They're incredibly nice and friendly, and usually very warm and empathizing. They're often very creative and fun to talk to, and have a lot of interests that make it really easy to have a wide range of conversations with them.\n\nHowever... I find it really *really* frustrating how often they start things and never finish, or just talk about starting things and never try despite getting all the things set up to be able to start.\n\nFor example: one of my closest INFP friends has a really nice camera because she wanted to take up photography (it hasn't been touched but the once), she bought a ton of yarn and cute needle sets to pick up knitting (she never even started), she was gonna start writing a blog and set up a whole website for it and has like three posts (all posted over three days, then abandoned)... there's so much more, and each time I get so caught up in her energy and stoked to create with her or see where she goes with it, flowing with support... and then she drops it, which just leaves me feeling so drained afterward as she moves on to new things she won't do. I admire the interest, but I get so exhausted with the wasted energy.\n\nConversations *about* creating are at least really fun in the meantime! I just wish that energy had some release at the end, if that makes sense.\n\nOn the plus side, sometimes I get to have fun with the abandoned materials which is pretty nice for when I just want to tinker with something and create for a little bit without the investment.\n\nI also wish, though, that for all the INFPs that I know, they spent a little less time talking about themselves or steering conversations to only be about them/their ideas... it wears me down when they take over conversations from other people very often. I think that's a very immature INFP thing though, because my more mature INFP friends are wonderful about keeping conversations open to a group.
3	Tend to either be one of the greatest people or the shitiest
3	The good: kind, approachable, open-minded, creative, imaginative, unashamed, they don't care for superficialities. Fashion, design, trends leave them cold (mostly), which always impresses me (inferior Se). They enjoy nature (at least the ones I know). I can talk to them about books and movies forever. Quirky and interesting, especially when they indulge their Ne. Sincere. Can be surprisingly determined. Brave. You can't really hate them. Innocent.  \n\n\nThe bad: They read Fe too much as inauthenticity. They don't go deep enough, especially on academic topics. Whatever establishes rapport with their feelings is the truth, whatever doesn't is not. I find the way they get attached to the downtrodden can get annoying/self-righteous. They mistake sympathy for empathy: No, it is not MY feelings you're feeling, it's your own feelings imagining what I am feeling (and getting carried away). They can be quite judgmental of people they judge to be abusive of power.   \n\n\nHaving said this, I so enjoy seeing INFPs look at the world in awe and wonder and trying to see beauty everywhere. I wish I had their faith (for lack of a better word).
3	**good**\n- understand me intuitively like no other (a close INTJ can understand my brain; a close INFP can understand my heart)\n- appreciative\n- pretty easy-going\n- very smart, book- and street-wise\n\n**bad**\n- can be overly competitive or snowflake, aggressive and self-centered when unhealthy/immature\n- their sense of humor is sometimes too random/illogical thus unfunny to me\n- their obsession with being out of the box is yet another box
2	There's an INFP girl I work with and there is such a *softness* to her - her stature, face, hair, clothing, voice, manner. But I got to know her a little more in depth as we talked our experience with friends and family who have differing politics, and I honestly got a little scared at her powerful emotional reaction. She said that she basically vets people and won't get close to anyone who doesn't share her views. (Is that the fierce inner Fi coming out?) But anyways, I was surprised because the outer softness was completely hiding this inner fire and intensity that was honestly kind of intimidating.
2	[deleted]
1	Of the 2 that I know who are INFPs, it's been so long idk what my first impression was but I'm pretty sure they were both the aggressors in pursuing the friendship with me. One seems so much more grounded and practical than me. She's way better at problem-solving because she doesn't get lost in the big picture. She has good people skills-- very warm, empathetic, very diplomatic. I'm always impressed by her verbal communication skills because I tend to go off on tangents and I wish I could just get to the point like she does. She likes to talk about feelings and relationships. She knows what she needs and takes it-- like she's better at asking for help than I am and when it comes to her job she takes a lot of mental health days whereas I'll run myself into the ground before I do something like that. But when it comes to her relationships with her family and romantic partners she's a total doormat and I wish she would assert herself more. I think that has more to do with her upbringing than her personality though. Sometimes she seems pretty social but then she'll drop off the face of the planet for a while. \n\nThe other one does the same dropping-off-the-planet thing. She is really sensitive to criticism and often gets paranoid/takes minor things personally and ends up influencing the mood of the group. I feel like a lot of times she has these big expectations for something but she doesn't do anything to make these things happen, and then gets really upset when they don't materialize. She's always looking for something more out of life but she can't articulate what she wants. She's a pretty whimsical person with unique tastes in clothes, music, home decor, hobbies, etc. whereas my other friend has very basic tastes in everything. \n\nThey both like to throw parties and are good hosts, they both have crafty hobbies, and both bad housekeepers lol. And they have no problem starting projects, but sometimes don't finish them, whereas I have a problem even starting something but once I get started I'm committed to finish. 
1	I very much struggle with Fi doms. I'm sure I know more than one INFP, but the INFP I was around the most left terrible taste in my mouth. Any type can do that when they're selfish and immature though. INFJs have our own set of things the drive people batty.
1	infps are arguably the most volatile of all personality types, and as such are unpredictable, but are sometimes so reserved (even to those that are close to them) that a major truth is left omitted and those that theyre close to suffer.\n\nbesides that, they are what you might expect of them. very carefree and creative, and take some kind of hell yeah attitude toward life (unless something really bad happened to them)
1	I hate (yes, hate) working with them, seriously you can't argue against their ideas since everything will be taken personally. Other than that they're pretty fun to be around.
182	INFJ Paradoxes	Not sure if this is a thing, but I think INFJs are a pretty paradoxical type. What are some of your paradoxes? One that I keep thinking about for myself is how I'm really good at understanding people's emotions and getting them to open up, but at the same time I struggle opening up to other people and really explaining how I feel to others. \n\nJust curious if this is an INFJ thing, and if we all have similar contradictions.
261	There's also the one that goes something like loving and wanting to help others, while simultaneously loathing and being disappointed by humanity....
131	I don't think this is an INFJ thing, but I need structure and order, too much of it though, and I feel restricted. I simultaneously need chaos and spontaneity, too much of it though, and I feel like there's nothing stable I can latch on to.
87	Loving myself because I have genuine strengths and abilities that help others and make me a good person in other peoples eyes, vs hating myself because how could I even say such an egotistical thing, I am not better than anyone else on this earth and I shouldn‚Äôt act like I am. The world doesn‚Äôt revolve around you, you piece of #%*‚Ç¨!$?
59	I need TONS of alone time but I feel like I can‚Äôt have all of the alone time I need because I don‚Äôt want the people I love to feel neglected. And one minute, I want nothing more than to be alone but the next minute, I get an intense need to be around people. \n\nI love order and organization. But if an outsider looked at my ‚Äúorganization‚Äù, they‚Äôd probably just call it a mess. Organized chaos is the perfect description for my life. \n\n
46	I consider myself an empathetic person, but I have trouble feeling empathy for people when I'm viewing them up close. (Unless they're someone I love.) For example, seeing a homeless person doesn't affect me much. Or if a stranger starts telling me a sad story about something they've been through, I'm not able to have an immediate reaction. It just doesn't affect me like it probably affects other NFs, and it makes me feel cold and detached.\n\nI feel the most empathy when I'm viewing from a distance (either looking at something in retrospect or if I were to observe the daily life of someone who is suffering) and take time to understand others' perspectives, which is something I do when I'm alone. I'm so stuck in my own head most of the time though. I find that I have a lot of empathy for groups of people (I'm very socially liberal) but it doesn't immediately translate to empathy for individuals. I always have my guard up against others.
25	Brave but timid
20	I'm a social loner.\nI'm a lazy perfectionist.\nI'm a practical dreamer.\nI'm an asexual romantic.\nI'm a cheerful pessimist.\nI'm a supportive critic.
42	I need to be around people, but I can't be around them for too long. The struggle is real.
19	I need things to be organized and structured yet my house is messy. I think this is due to 1) my boyfriend who has a preference for perceiving, and 2) Se being my inferior function - too much mess overwhelms me and I get stressed and don‚Äôt know where to start. 
15	This is probably the most relevant to me thread since I joined.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. I need rules and order, but abhor monotony and structure. I need spontaneity for spice, but too much or I get bogged down and overwhelmed. \n2. I love having a close knit group of friends, but I also need tons of me time and have lost people in the past because I inadvertently neglected the friendship. I constantly forget that I have to reach out sometimes too. Too much networking (almost a necessity for my professional) and I have to take a weekend or longer to recharge.\n3. I do a lot with marginalized demographics in my city and most of my friends are like, "You're no poster child for such and such," because I'm pretty jaded and cynical about it all, but I still am passionate about the work like conceptually or something SMH
9	Paradox, i'll give you a good one in 3 words.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nINFJ in sales.
9	One I can think of is wanting to be noticed but not wanting the attention, if that makes sense...!
23	Needing intense love and affection but becoming repulsed by it if it feels too overwhelming. 
7	Yes, we are very contradictory.. we do have a slight extroverted side.. but at the end of the day, we are true introverts. Opening up is difficult, not because of doing it.. but because people don't REALLY CARE what you have to say. People are UNCOMFORTABLE when you get too deep into emotions or personal problems, they try to change the subject or they see that you are deeply troubled. In today's society, emotions and feelings are a sign of weakness... not sure why that is. So ever since then, I usually don't open up and talk about emotional things, because people are not comfortable talking about that, they just want to talk about regular things like gossip and things that don't involve feelings. I guess talking about feelings is a downer and they don't want to feel triggered hear a sad story.
6	I retain most information better by listening rather than reading ‚Äî except names. If I meet you at a party I‚Äôll forget your name instantly, but if I read your name before I hear it, there‚Äôs a very good chance I‚Äôll remember it. 
6	I crave and dread the company of exactly the same people for exactly the same reasons.  The people who will ask me questions about myself and actually care about the answers, who will tell me all about themselves and bother me until I open up.  They drive me nuts, but I need them desperately.
7	My main paradox is that I can easily judge the mistakes and lives of others, but when my own flaws are brought to light I can just as easily justify every one of them.  I try to keep it in check since we're all fighting a unique battle; some days are better than others.\n\n
5	I always want to be alone but when I am I dream about being with people who care about me. \n\nI want to explore the world but when it actually comes down to the going through with it I always chicken out or put it off\n\nI really want to be in a relationship but I'm always too worried about how people will judge me to put myself out there\n\nThe list goes on
4	Craving and yearning for deep connection with people....but not actually want to see or meet people. 
5	Well, one I've noticed about myself is that I can usually tell if someone is lying to me - but I'm still as gullible as heck. It's so weird watching someone trying to lie to you and you can just tell that the person is hopeless at deceiving you. And then someone else tells me a real whopper of a story and I'll just go along with it in total innocence, until the joke is revealed and everyone laughs at me. So brutally confusing.
3	There's so many... a big one for me is wanting to do things with people and go out but also being a huge homebody. I need people to ask me to do things or have scheduled times or I just sit in my dorm all day
3	Lots and lots of deep, inner ones. Mostly having to do with me mirroring my own undesirable egotistic thinking and behavior tendencies. In other words, i project a lot. I'll see something really repulsive in someone else's behavior and then come to realize it's because i see a part of me that i don't like in that person at that given moment.\n\nBut then again, we all do that, not just infj's. \n
3	I suspect that a paradox only seems like a paradox until we can understand it entirely. And it seems as though all of life is built upon seeming paradoxes.  \n  \nYour paradox - as long as you view yourself as an outsider / separate from others, you will find it difficult to open up. I‚Äôve felt this way my whole life. Partly because of my fear of being vulnerable and/or misunderstood, and partly because I don‚Äôt want to burden anyone with my baggage. But, being an outsider gives you perspective that is valuable to others, which is why they may be prone to open up to you. \n  \nMy current paradox - Most of my pain and the core of my personality comes from my dad leaving my mom when I was a year old, and the resulting abandonment and shame I felt, even though I have no memory of it and it wasn‚Äôt my fault. I don‚Äôt have any kids, but I‚Äôm a creator, and I abandon personal projects constantly. I‚Äôm continuing the cycle, despite the pain it caused and is still causing me. Knowing the cause helps but doesn‚Äôt undo the shame. What I‚Äôm working on now is unconditional self-love. It seems to be the only way out of this paradox of being my deadbeat dad to myself.
3	Desperately wanting to befriend others while simultaneously noticing all their negative traits, thus making me get stuck in an awkward middle area
3	I want to love/destroy everyone/thing.\n\n‚ÄúPlease be close and love me/OMG FUCK OFF!‚Äù\n\nI value freedom and liberty/order and hierarchy\n\nScience is the ultimate arbiter of truth/the spiritual plane is the ultimate truth
3	My body is here; my mind likely is not here.\n\n&#x200B;
2	* I hate working from home, and have the unusual preference of wanting to come in to the office every single day.   I work in a cubicle with low dividers and don‚Äôt like the idea of having my own private office. Often, I will willingly end up as the person leading meetings, and will directly tell people to stop extraneous discussions. At the same time, I don‚Äôt like long meetings and usually will not socialize with my coworkers. \n\n* I play a lot of board games, especially ones with a decent amount of player interaction such as Catan or Werewolf. Surprisingly enough, most of the people I play with are introverts and I‚Äôm almost positive the leader of our Werewolf group is an INFJ. \n\n
2	Maybe it's because it's painful for you to feel other people's pain.  And so it would make sense you wouldn't want to subject another person to that. 
2	I'm paradoxical as fuck.\n\nI want to be unique but I also want to be understood.\n\nI spend time alone thinking I should be out, and time out thinking I should be alone.\n\nI insist on being in complete control of my art but I struggle to rely on myself with confidence.\n\nI'm very sensitive but seem aloof.\n\nI hate convention but I'm afraid to break it.\n\nThe list could go on...
2	I am a walking paradox and it's also why it makes me feel profoundly lonely as I have never met anyone who understands this.\n\nI have a negative view of humanity overall and dislike being around people or socialising but at the same time desire a deep connection and meaning in my relationships. I am extremely introverted even for most INFJs, I barely have a social life or friends and repeatedly keep choosing to be this way even though I hate it. I'd like to be more extroverted and have more of a social life even though my actions keep choosing otherwise. \n\nThe other is empathy. I actually have extreme empathy for the most part but there are some areas and elements where it either completely ceases to happen because of some situation (it's almost like a light switch ...maybe this is the infamous door slam) or I just stop giving a fuck and couldn't care less if that person lived or died. My empathy also seems to be getting more and more selective as my thinking side is heavily dominant so I can simultaneously think something doesn't deserve my empathy even when I do feel it or vise versa. There are also some bizarre issues like in the case where people die in the news...I used to feel very strongly for those but now I literally do not give a fuck. Most of my empathy only gets triggered by people I've either bonded with or to animals. I'm also heavily pro death penalty which I haven't come across there INFJs who agreed, and I literally do not have any empathy for those types of deranged killers and would be in support of them being put to death immediately. \n\nI'm sure there are others but this is all I can think of for now 
2	I can't think of anything rn, and I know I'm really late to this, but I really relate to this in the op:\n\n>I'm really good at understanding people's emotions and getting them to open up, but at the same time I struggle opening up to other people and really explaining how I feel to others.
1	Wanting to be isolated from society, yet, wanting to be around my friends 24/7
1	The conscientiousness & the contentiousness. :)
1	I crave control so much that I use drugs. That‚Äôs probably the most paradoxical thing I‚Äôve ever said. 
1	Beeing "sociable" yet a loner? \n\nLike the friend who's *there*. \n\n&#x200B;
1	INFJ‚Äôs are known to be walking contradictions.\n\nhttps://introvertdear.com/news/infj-contradictions-experience/#comments
1	Wanting to be needed/useful, but then resenting that and wishing people didn't rely on me and being relieved when they no longer need me. e.g. helping someone one day and feeling good about it, but the next time they need me I'm like grrrrr leave me alone. 
0	studying logic and having strong logic would make you see that what you presented is not a paradox
21	Emotional Sponges	Hi everyone!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo any of you also experience what I refer to as being an emotional sponge? Recently, I tried to calm a friend down before a date and went into it very chipper and positive. While it worked, I spent the next few hours all jumpy and feeling sick with worry. It's a blessing and a curse. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf any of you have similar experiences, I'd love to hear about it!
5	Yeah definitely. If I see someone I can sort of just feel whatever they're feeling. Which I imagine is what tends to prompt INFJs to ask "what's wrong?" when someone seems down. But obviously, we can't just help everybody left and right, I had to learn to be aware of it and just say "Wait a minute that's just my Fe(?) being active again whoops". And then not let others emotions become mine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor example, every time I'm in the office my mind tends to immediately shift to the person who sits next to me. And every time, I'll ALWAYS feel whatever mood they're feeling, even if I was happy a second ago.
2	I am very similar! I work as a speech-language pathologist with children with Autism/developmental disabilities, and sometimes struggle with maintaining a "reasonable" emotional balance when working with this population; if some of my students are having an extremely rough day behaviorally/emotionally, and nothing I'm doing seems to be helping  a lot, it definitely makes me feel more anxious and upset, sometimes for days afterwards :(. Working with this population is also tough for me sometimes, emotionally, due to the minimal/progress at a slower rate seen, as well as working with very overwhelmed and stressed parents. I know some people think I'm "too emotional", but I try to use the extra emotion I feel as motivation to continue working hard at work for my students and families, and also as motivation to do more self-care, to help balance out my feelings. 
2	I have a co-worker that confides in me/vents to me quite a bit.  I listen to her, i soak up what she is feeling and quite often feel as if they are my problems also.  Sometimes i just listen, sometimes i offer support/encouragement, sometimes advice, but it seems to really lift the burden off her shoulders, which makes me happy that i could have such a positive effect.\n\nBut after doing this for while, it seems like (in my mind) i have turned myself into her goto for her negative energy.  Her positive energy.... well seems like she seeks out others now to share that with, guess she doesnt want to pick back up any negative that she deposited.  Wish it wasnt so, it would be nice to deposit some good energy to keep me balanced.
2	I get this! In Buddhism, when someone else is suffering and they want to vent to us, the perspective we adopt is to help them dissolve compassionately. A sponge soaks in, so that's like they had a crappy day and their cup is filled with water, and they come home and vent to you and empty their once full cup into your empty cup because you had a great day but now it's reversed, they feel great and you feel like crap.  All that happened was a transfer of water. I find it unfortunate some relationship advice out there is saying you have to do this for your partner if you love them, you have to sacrifice your current happy emotional state so they can have that instead of you.\n\nI disagree. What if instead of a win lose or lose win zero-sum game, it could be a win win? That would be the analogy of dissolving the water, so in a gas state, water vapor does not use any space in either of your cups. It's a win-win, now you're both happy! With excellent boundaries and a ton of practice, one can learn how to hear someone else's pain, listen with compassion, and yet stay grounded in who you are and how you are feeling right now and not become the sponge, but instead help them dissolve their mind clutter, so that everyone can be happy.\n\nBeing INFJ I had a natural ability to be a sponge, and I did that for many people growing up, that was how I gained many friends (the free counselor that made you feel better) and I did it for my narcissistic mom as well so she would love me (that's all subconscious of course), all without knowing that's what I was doing. Upon discovering this other way I speak of, I adopted it and felt much better, however some people didn't like it because I shifted patterns on them and no longer let them just dump on me so they had to take more responsibility for dissolving their own stuff (although I helped them) and lost some friends over it, but oh well being a sponge was unhealthy for me anyway.\n\nFor me the analogy of dissolving the water is much better for my health than being a sponge! I'm still the counselor type for my friends, but at much less a cost to my own health!
2	You bet! I've learned a few coping mechanisms over the years. \n1. If feeling down or unusual and can't figure out why always begin by asking myself "does this feeling belong to me?" Often it's an emotion that someone else was experiencing that somehow got glued  to me. Recognizing this is the first step to being rid of it.\n2. When I'm with people giving off strong emotions, rather than putting up a wall (which takes my own energy to maintain) I think "I send you peace" or "I send you love." It sends out good energy but also seems effective at keeping me from absorbing their emotions.\n\nThese solutions may sound to new-age to some people, but they work for me.
1	For me it's how close you are to the person in question and how much you care about the situation. Then it can range between an emotional sponge and a brick wall. But usually it sides more between emotional sponge and the mid-point of brick wall. 
1	Absolutely! This was strongest in middle & high school, but then I learned to separate their feelings from my own. I leaned to empathize with them, but then return to my own head afterwards so to speak. It's important to keep that mental & emotional solidarity. While it may be nice to be emotionally amorphous to help others, it only devoids you of form. You can be empathetic and still return to yourself after. Practice it sometime! It makes the whole ordeal of the specialized comfort we can give much less taxing!
1	Yeah, I'm totally this way. I've had to quit people and groups because either they bring energy that I cannot be around in the long term, or there's this assumption that I can just deal with it and because I also appear fairly passive or difficult to read, that I'm fine with whatever's going on. I've been working on setting boundaries and giving feedback about what I am experiencing, but it's hard.
6	Job and Career - February 20, 2019	Career questions and advice go here! Check out our [School and Career FAQ section](https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/wiki/faqs#wiki_school_and_career) for additional perspectives and conversations on this topic.
5	I am a female INFJ in desperate need of career advice - which career do you think would best satisfy an INFJ's need for helping people, independence, creativity, problem-solving, and so on: law or psychology?  \n\n\nI have been studying law for two years and I do not like the subject itself (I find it boring and it feels like it's draining my soul), yet I think I would like being a lawyer and helping people. Also, being a lawyer opens many doors to higher positions were I could help people by changing the system.  \n\n\nOn the other hand, I love psychology and I'm genuinely interested in the subject, although I do not know if I want to work as a psychologist (I want to help change the world...), but I might be interested in research, being a professor or something. I don't know.  \n\n\nMy dream job is being a writer, but that's a long shot. Any thoughts or advice? Someone please help me be rational, my heart (nor my brain) knows what I want. \*confused emoji\*
2	Human Rights Law has been a great way to combine Ni-Fe with Ti for me. 
2	I struggle with the desire to create something and be someone, and the desire for complete anonymity. Sometimes I want to write publicly on a blog, but then I get a visceral reaction that makes me want to stay absolutely private and hidden from view. Anybody else struggle with this? 
2	Any other infjs in the tech field? I'm currently going to school for cs and I feel a little intimidated by the personalities of my classmates. Everyone I go to school with is a lot more of a thinker than feeler, and much more of an aggressive type. As a hsp, this does cause me to be a little nervous about any job I'm going to be apart of in the future. I think I'm great at the problem solving aspect, which is why I love the field, but it's everything else that gets me. So are their any other infjs that are in tech and can share some of your experiences with it? 
1	I am in quite a similar situation to you, i was doing chemical engineering purely for the prestige and money (hated every minute) and not for enjoyment and decided to change to psychology starting this September. My advice is do something you think you‚Äôll enjoy and money and happiness will come. Plus theres always other options once you have your degree finished! 
1	INFJ female here too that considered both of those options as well. INFJs make good counselors in general but as an emotional sponge, I don't think a therapist is fitting for our type. It's not exciting, but I've been told if you really want to make a difference, get an MPP - writing up policies. Law is risky and also difficult to find the practice that fulfills you. It can be extremely soul destroying taking job at a law firm whose practice goes against your values, but you don't have a choice because you need experience. Obviously this not always the case, but pretty common. However, I think human rights law and environmental law could be fulfilling.  
3	"Offense to Truth"	
2	huh. definitely an intp thing, although we (intps) look for a collective truth rather than a personal truth
67	What is it like to feel? Curious ENTJ here.	I'm just curious what it's like to feel especially with your intuition.  Is it like being able to feel someone's vibes?  What information are you able to gather or deduce?  Also is there something you do to hone these feeling skills?  Thank you.  BTW you guys have awesome flairs, really fun.
80	I can feel the pain everyone is in, a lot of them don‚Äôt know it themselves. I know how to help them, but they don‚Äôt listen. I can feel the weight of everyone else‚Äôs hardships and spend my life trying to run from it- because deep down, I‚Äôm a joyful, carefree person. I‚Äôve dealt with myself and have a strong emotional intelligence that will guide me through my life- but nobody else even seems to want to try to reach that point. It‚Äôs pretty lonely, if I‚Äôm being honest. 
103	Exhausting. Like getting bombarded with hashtags all day long and you can't turn it off. 
30	This is actually a really fantastic question. I‚Äôve got no flair, but I‚Äôm an INFJ. To me, intuition is a really strange thing. It‚Äôs sort of always ‚Äúthere‚Äù. Similar to having another sense. \n\nSometimes my intuition just gives me a ‚Äúfeeling‚Äù (more easily described as a gut feeling) about a person, and sometimes it‚Äôs more on their behaviours (body language), the way they speak, etc. it all sort of adds to the ‚Äúvibe‚Äù that person gives off, and that vibe can either feel negative or positive. It seems strange, but you can tell if a person is being genuine or hiding under a facade. Sometimes you can just feel what someone is feeling without them even telling you. It‚Äôs a very strange but wonderful thing. \n\nI don‚Äôt really do anything to hone my intuition, it‚Äôs just sort of.. there. I do however like people watching and perhaps that does help hone in on it? Who knows. \n\nReally interesting question nonetheless, it‚Äôll be intriguing to see other people‚Äôs responses to how their intuition affects them. 
24	[deleted]
19	It almost rules my life sometimes. Any time I'm around someone who is unhappy, I feel it too. \n\nI have a friend who is prone to moodiness, and it bothers me beyond belief. I could be in a large group of happy people, but if she's a bit grumpy and just quietly sitting in the corner, her mood dominates everything for me and will ruin my ability to enjoy myself. \n\nBut it's strongest with my husband, as I care for him the most. I feel sorry for him that he's not able to have a bad day in peace, as I have to fix it ASAP almost for my own sake. Any negative emotion he has I feel it so intensely as well that I can't do anything until he feels better, then the relief of seeing him laugh or smile is enormous. \n\nI often wish I could be a bit more oblivious, because it can be a real burden feeling what everyone else feels. 
25	You just completely absorb a different mood. Hard to describe 
7	"what it's like to feel..." - i really don't know how to describe that xD\n\n"... feel especially with your intuition" - Keep in mind that we see everything and by that we can deduce changes in the "habit" of a person. in my case, it has a lot of "if/else" but the "sensation" ( to not call it a feeling ) i get is that i just "know" when something is "off" and by asking questions or just watching/talking to the person i can pinpoint ( the accuracy differs ) what is wrong in a person. most of the time i get a feeling of what they feel because the eyes are telling me something and weirdly enough subconsciously i can understand what they are "hiding" (?). Again i can't tell about the other INFJs but that's how my intuition works. 
9	For me (24yr M INFJ), it feels like I‚Äôm drawn into someone else‚Äôs emotional state without my permission. Then you start feeling their insecurity, anxiousness, happiness, etc. then i have to access why I feel the way I do based on how they feel. 
11	>What information are you able to gather or deduce?\n\nTo put it simply, how trustworthy someone is. That's very simplified, but I find integrity and authenticity is what everything eventually boils down to. As for non simplified and from where those trustworthy gauges come from... I'd say being able to see things on a very micro/core level.\n\nEvery comment has an intention; a core or essence. And that informs one's desires. I can just tell what someone wants/needs and is trying "to get to" in any given situation, and so then can predict the certain paths that person will take in order to get there.\n\n>is there something you do to hone these feeling skills?\n\n Getting my own emotional needs met in order to stay curious about other people is what keeps my empathy at it's healthiest. And trying to stay as honest as I can with myself. If a person is dishonest with themselves they'll be be less receptive to feel someone else's emotions. And less accurate. I think a reason why infj's are so skilled at intuiting/feeling others is because they've started with themselves, watching their mind form patterns and recognize those same patterns in others.
8	you start fetishizing lobotomies
7	You want to withdraw yourself from people, from time, because that's the only way your feelings and all that crap will not swallow you alive. \n\nBut I always strive to stay within the light, following what The One said in Doctor Strange... "We don't really lose our demons, we just learn how to live above them."
5	Stressful and exhausting! I‚Äôm not sure what my brother‚Äôs Meyers Briggs score is, but it‚Äôs definitely *not* INFJ and being around him is always very draining for me. \n\nNot because he‚Äôs a bad person, but because I am always trying to mediate the mood in the room and he has a strong, selfish, and dismissive personality. Oftentimes he‚Äôll be moody and/or strong minded, and I don‚Äôt even notice in the moment that it‚Äôs ruining my experience and stressing me out. In the moment I‚Äôm just playing it off and making sure everyone else is happy. Then, after he leaves, I realize what happened and spend the next few hours mad at him and stewing.\n\nI‚Äôm working on being more mindful in the moment, but it‚Äôs *hard*, especially with family! \n\nBut yeah, that‚Äôs basically it. An innate *need* to maintain peacefulness. And feeling very unsettled when that‚Äôs not the case.
6	I think people explained it well so fat, but like... I'd define it as an emotional sponge. If someone's off or in a mood then I immediately shift. It sucks because I could be having an amazing day or be alright and then one interaction sticks with me. And like a sponge, it takes a while to dry so hours after the interaction I still feeling it unless someone comes along to change it\n\nIt's kind of like carrying the weight of the world but the earth is actually everyones unspoken and hidden emotions... its exhausting. I'm also empathetic and what to help, but youd be surprised how many people dont want to be helped. \n\nThe N also leaves me over thinking everything, usually how it emotionally impacts me or my future relationships with people. Like a I rate my interactions with people and obsess over the smallest mistake or word said that could have impacted the interaction. For example, if I say something that seems to offend someone (unspoken or spoken offense both) I stress about making that person feel bad even if they were able to bounce back. I HATE conflict and confrontation, I just want people to like me and get along with each other...
5	For me it goes along with having a good memory and remembering little details as well as just feeling others emotions easily. I once figured out that my friends dad had gotten a DUI just from overhearing a side conversation between her and someone else where she didn‚Äôt explicitly say anything about a DUI. Using past experiences and random facts put together I guess. 
5	It's the ability to read people, automatically, involuntarily and instinctively. I think we lay on the thing about feeling other people's emotions too thick, makes it sound mystical when in fact, that's what happens when we're not fully aware of what's going on, because it's all happening on a subconscious level. We have a tendency take those feelings on due to our natural sensitivity but with practice, it can be controlled.\n\nThe problem is, it's really hard work not to become cynical when you're really good at seeing beneath the mask most people display to the world. It's worth it though. 
2	It can be exhausting. It is always there, whether in small things or big things. I'm constantly feeling a "vibe" coming from people or situations. You have your five senses - your ears are constantly listening, your eyes are constantly seeing, and my intuition is constantly feeling. It can be overwhelming but I've learnt how to deal with it. I'm comfortable now. I struggle a lot more with my Ti than with my Ni. 
4	Hey, ENFP here.\n\nIn the most logical way, I would say that it is like taking any problem in life that you have and approaching the problem logically with emotional constraints.\n\nFor example, it's a no brainer to break up with someone from a logical standpoint when you don't share anything in common. Throw in the other party's feelings into the decision making, it becomes slightly more difficult. You don't know how this person will respond to the bad news, or if you missed something special in that relationship and you just didn't give it enough time. \n\nI think developing feelings begin with tuning into how you actually feel about the facts. Yes, facts are facts and they exist, but your feelings are your opinions on those facts (they exist too). I act on my feelings because they define who I am, and I use them to try and make the best decisions for everyone including myself.\n\nThis is why most people here say that it is "exhausting". You are basically juggling more balls than the facts themselves provide. 
2	I describe feeling the emotions in the air as odors. I can pick up on people's emotional "scents". I can't not pick them up anymore than I can't not pick up smells in the air. At most I can do is ignore or address them, but they always affect me somehow. I can walk into a room and immediately get a sense of the general emotional vibe. Sometimes it's pleasant, like clothes fresh out of the dryer. Sometimes it's musky like a public locker room. Or repulsive like someone drenched in alcohol and marijuana smoke.\n\nWhen I was younger, I was at the mercy of these scents. Now I learned to cope better with them. I can't turn it off, though.\n\nEdit: Answering your other questions.\n\nBased on those "smells", I build context for my interactions. If someone seems happy, I join them in their rejoicing. If someone seems upset, I inquire and try to help if I can. If someone seems dangerous, I passively investigate to determine the danger level and act accordingly. I can pick up on moods quickly and map appropriate action to those moods. However this came from years of practice and study, since I needed to know what actions correctly map to what moods. You're also dealing with people, who are mostly irrational, so some improvisation and wiggle room is needed to let people be people.\n\nTo get better at managing and responding to emotions in a productive way (accurately and rationally), I read a lot of different sources about the nature of humanity. I am a Christian, so the Bible is my primary text for theology and anthropology. I supplement that with reading books on psychology, sociology, and other human behavior. Then I interact with people. My goal is to communicate with them--express my thoughts and feelings as appropriate--and be understood at least in part while maintaining an amiable relationship. It doesn't always happen that way, but it tends to be at least positive in most cases. I want people to know that I'm simulateously interested in relating with them as well as getting things done. There is a error on both extremes: relation at the cost of action (people-pleaser) and action at the cost of relation (steamrolling).\n\nI hope these thoughts are helpful.
4	It's like wearing someone else's dirty underwear.\n\nIt can take weeks to sort out which feelings are mine and not theirs.\n\nIntuition feels the same as doing math. Someone says 2+2. You know it's 4 without thinking. 
5	It's rough. You can feel awkward, like you've walked in on someone dressing, because you know they're not meaning to share their emotions with you, but it just happened. At the same time you're exasperated, because you feel like you need to react somehow, but can't be sure if any action or word from you will be accepted; or if you stay silent, will that offend?\n\nCrowds are even worse, because you're wading into a storm of conflicting emotions and are fully aware of them all. 
4	I had a situation the other day where I was angry with my mother but  I realized exactly why she was doing what irritated me and I realized that she doesn't even know why I'm irritated even though I have explained it to her. And it kind of sucked? Because it was like I understand that I should just let it go but also it isn't fair I should be allowed to be mad even though I know the reasoning behind her actions. I don't know how to articulate it honestly. If that makes any sense. 
3	Love the question. I'm curious as well. Lol
3	Sometimes it's just too much hahaha 
3	Exhausting.  Thank god for medication.  I have to plan for downtime, limit social interactions to no more than an hour, wear noise cancelling headphones, sunglasses, basically do whatever I can to drone out the stimuli.  
3	It really makes me think twice before I act because I don't wanna trample on peoples' feelings. I also feel like I don't contribute much to group conversations because I'm observing people and digesting info. Literally had no more computing power to comment. \n\nGenerally I can guess how people are feeling and their personalities IF I FOCUS A LOT. But usually I'm daydreaming like I'm on drugs so don't worry getting figured out unless you really had my attention. I can also guess how misunderstandings happen because I see from both sides of a coin. I can also see how words can influence people's emotions. Like from "Your work is horribly done!" vs "There is a lot of room for improvement."\n\nPeople have different personalities so I adjust the way I speak to accomodate them. Some of them can take jokes like a champ so its pretty fun to roast them once in a while. Some are blunt and others are sensitive so gotta react accordingly.\n\nOne last point. Its actually not that difficult to read a person. Observe patiently with your senses and feel with your heart. See the body language, hear the tone of their voice and observe the words they use. Ultimately, you're observing how a person reacts to the environment around them and with enough evidence, you can guess their personality. Don't forget to double and triple confirm your hypothesis though. 
3	Its like tuning in to peoples frequencies or energies. Some people have overwhelming energies. So its quite tiresome 
3	Keep asking: What does this mean? This piece. This whole. This interaction. This tone. This place. This sign. This. What does this represent? What truth does this tell me? How does this fit the puzzle that I know? Is it a new puzzle entirely? And deeper still. And deeper still.\n\nDo that about everything. Everyone you meet. Especially for the things that matter because they have seeped into your mind or your heart. Motivated by harmony, peace, beauty, truth and understanding--even if dark. And deeper still. And deeper still. For each movie frame of your life, at the speed of real life, and you might know yourself.
3	My intuition is basically recognizing a series of patterns in an unconscious way. In relation to feelings, there's a certain vibe associated with each one that other people put out. If someone is sad, their tone of voice might be more somber, their word choice is different, their body language, etc. But again, most of this isn't a conscious thought. It's kind of like empathy with secret powers. \n\nSo then I either feel what they feel or I can challenge it.
2	What the hell
2	INFP, not INFJ, but man do I also know about feelings - I guess if you don't feel anything often, its hard to describe. Imagine having an intense, immediate reaction to most things said and done in your surrounding. Like, someone says something and it alters your mood significantly. You could be having a great day, and someone saying something good or bad can either enhance or de-hance it. Its almost like your internal gauge for the importance of things is hyper sensitive.\n\nLately, I've been working on becoming more tough a bit because it does effect my life. That being said, it also has some major advantages. Even when I'm in a bad mood, I can appear sweet to people because I've spent years honing how to respond to them in a way that makes them happy. It makes me happy to see them happy. It makes me sad to see them sad. The best feeling is when something I say registers with them and they feel good and connected. When I say something and it upsets people, I sense it immediately and feel bad. I've become quite good at finding someone who's having a shitty day and saying things to them to make them feel better, at least for the moment. I have a knack for caring if people are upset and wanting to make it better for them, which I guess can also be a weakness.\n\nIn your journey to trying to feel more, maybe start with what I do. Go outdoors and enjoy the beautiful sunshine, listen to some music with meaning, look at some good art, watch a good TV show, spend some quality time with people you like.  I dunno, those may be only things that work for me though. The way toward feeling, at least for me, is doing things that aren't logic based. Maybe try to think about someone you knew today who was upset, and think less about the logic behind them being upset and more about what its doing to them. The place they're in. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs a sidenote: INFJs, does this resonate with you too?\n\n&#x200B;
2	ENTJs actually use Ni too, since it is your second function, it means you should still be using it pretty often. In your case, Ni makes you constantly think about how to achieve things. So, the "feeling" of using Ni is the same.  It is simply directed at something different: people. Although I do use it in a similar way because I want to acheive certain little goals that concern people. For example, because my Ni is constantly active, I always notice whta is going on in people's heads and what their "issues" are. And if they are close to me, I will think of ways to make them face those issues without being too direct. I'm sort of a secret psychiatrist lol. \n\nThe rest of the time, I just try to make sure everyone's self-esteem is at healthy levels.   \n\n\nFe as a second function is very strong. which means I constantly mirror people's emotions. I litterally feel what others feel. It can be exhausting. But people and their emotions is where my focus naturally goes. Just yours is naturlly directed towards goals.   \n\n\nWhen you ask how you can hone the "feeling skills", do you means feeling in general? Do you want to be capable of feeling more? Or do you specifically want to know how we use Fe and how you can get better with people?
2	For me intuition isn‚Äôt an emotion. It‚Äôs not something I feel, it‚Äôs more like a sense. I‚Äôm able to see through and predict people very well, and I can tell when they‚Äôre putting up a charade sometimes. Now that I‚Äôm trying to put it into words it‚Äôs kind of hard, not sure I‚Äôll be able to get the meaning across well. I‚Äôm basically able to read and understand people very well without really knowing why.\n\nA lot of this does come with age and experience. You learn this better and better the more you observe. So I‚Äôm sure it can be taught, but I wouldn‚Äôt know how to explain where to start.
2	I've always felt that the intuition side of things is like a casting net or a web. \n\nThe net expand and all these little pieces catch in it, and my feelings and mind find constellations and see patterns.\n\nSometimes the web is always there, sometimes I can cast the net intentionally like a focus, to try to understand one person, event, concept.
2	Hey! I‚Äôm on mobile, so forgive me if this isn‚Äôt detailed enough. I actually roomed with an INTJ for almost two years and found the similarities and differences between us fascinating. Since you‚Äôre ENTJ, you might find this useful. \n\nBasically, because of dominant Ni our entire thought process for just about everything in life centers around ‚Äúpoints of view.‚Äù We aren‚Äôt just good at considering and holding multiple points of view, it‚Äôs literally how we think. We can‚Äôt not do it - in some ways it‚Äôs a real weakness. \n\nSo for him, Ni + Te means he is fucking phenomenal at strategy and problem solving in real-time. Take debate - he was actually in a debate club in high school and knows the finer points of formal debating. He can seemingly instantly assess a logical construct and all the possible angles one can take - he can take the point that I‚Äôm arguing, articulate it better than I can, and then just as quickly explain what‚Äôs wrong about it. I bet you have a similar disposition. \n\nI found that he had trouble understanding my Fe because he was trying to understand it using Fi. It was actually easier for him to understand it when compared to Te - it‚Äôs action-oriented and there‚Äôs a strategy to it. I can very quickly and holistically interpret a set of social data - body language, tone of voice, group dynamics, etc - to derive things such as motive, intent, underlying emotions etc. and it‚Äôs all used to the end of creating group harmony. I can almost instantly determine the best way to assuage someone‚Äôs ego.\n\nGotta go! Hope that helps!
2	It‚Äôs like a 6th sense where I read tone, body language, personality, etc. subconsciously. From that I just kinda get vibes or a gut feeling that i confirm subtly before acting on.
2	the way i can best describe it is, imagine you walking into the ocean, and you feel the water cover all your body yet you are still able to tell what part of your body is being touched even tho you are convered in water, does that make sense?
2	It's an ability/skill/curse that I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy. 
2	Growing up it felt like a curse.  With practicing meditation and emotional regulation, it's one of the greatest gifts any human can have.  Life feels much more in a way that I can appreciate and experience gratitude for.  It's like the difference between feeling flooded versus being able to swim in a great vast ocean.
2	In my particular flavor of infj I don't believe I am feel people accurately. I figure my success rate is about 50%. Typically when I sense people's moods I automatically refer to the "I'm not good enough this person doesn't like me" infj black cloud. I have learned that this can be very false and I'm not sensing them, I'm sensing something generated from within me. I find this happens more often with people that are "closed".  but when a person opens up to me it's almost like I'm enveloped by their emotions and I can walk in their shoes very easily. It's not like being psychic or anything. Lol. In my estimation it's purely informational. If a person is open to an infj the infj will process information, and convert it into emotional understanding. So it's kind of like you're not empathizing with the person directly you're using visual and auditory cues and converting it into empathy. \n\nIt's always fun when you connect with somebody and they think it's totally spiritual when in reality it's the pure information exchange and a conversion process in the infj brain. 
2	It's a blessing and a curse. It's a blessing in the sense that I'm a human lie detector because I can actually feel when someone is hiding something. Even if they are trying to hide their true personality I can feel that they are off. The ones that are fake humans are typically entirely unmemorable to me upon meeting them, even if I've met them a few times. Which is good because then I don't remember to invite them anywhere. I can feel when people are uncomfortable too and generally deduce with body language where it is coming from. My incessant need to make these people comfortable is probably the due to me hating to feel their discomfort. When people are happy or excited, I get really swept away in it and genuinely want to keep that train running (here's looking at you ENFP,  ESFP!). When people are in the mood for debate or snarky jokes I'm all about that too (ENTP, ENTJ!). When people are relaxed and comfortable it definitely rubs off on me (INFP, INTP üòç). \n\nWhen people are agitated or angry I get super agitated and angry too. Unhappy people make me miserable, even from afar. So that is generally my biggest issue with absorption of emotions. I also tend to absorb a lot of nonsense when people are gossiping so I usually just exit when this happens.\n\nI guess I also have an issue with identifying what I'm feeling, and discerning if it's mine or someone else's. Love took a long time for me to learn because if someone loves me I feel love too when they are around, this doesn't always mean that I love them. It was a rough road figuring that one out. I still have an issue determining if I enjoy someone's company or they are enjoying my company and I feel that instead. I try to decipher it by what I feel about them when they aren't around, and I'm alone, it helps a lot.
2	 A. "The vibes" every bit of information captured by your senses gets absorbed by the pattern recognition system. \n\nExample: A happy/angry way to open a door (touch and hearing. Did it was too fast, too slow, did I felt the door slam vibrations on the floor?)\n\n B. "Deductions" Why would Jane feel sad?\n\n- I approach to Jane and say "Do you want a cookie?"\n- She says "Yes / No"\n- I've got X free minutes, wouldn't mind hearing you (I know she's sad) Did something happened @ work? (Wild guessing, Jane spends 8 hours @ work)\nJane blows off steam, feels better, gets on track to identify the issue and solving it. Let's call it a day.\n\n\nC. Hone feeling skills, two ways:\n\n- Understand your own emotions. You'll know when someone is going on the same trip.\n- Understand how people feel and why\n\nThe more cases you see/live, the more expert you become. Also leaves room to fathom new situations in case your main inner framework is functional. If not, your predictions get random.  There's work to be done to have a better understanding of the world.\n\nSometimes you can guess out a feel you haven't had. "It should feel like this and that, haven't happened yet to me. Do you feel like this?" a lot more often than not, the answer is "Yes"
2	**Converse question: how does it "feel" to be ENTJ?** You guys have some the strongest "status anxiety" out there, and that fascinates me.\n\nPonder upon a "Domesday" scenario for a second: _you've lost any and all executive function, and you find it almost impossible either to act out any of your plans, get things right, or achieve any of your goals. You have no respect from your peers, and you're seen as being mediocre at the work you do._\n\nHow would you cope?
2	A lot of people in here are talking about literally feeling other peoples' emotions and I don't experience it that way, at least not in adulthood. I consider myself a skilled user of cognitive empathy, but I don't literally feel peoples' feelings the same way that they do. As someone else pointed out, that makes it sound like magic, which it isn't. \n\nI think for me unfortunately what helped me hone my intuition was dating and befriending a *lot* of extremely shitty people when I was younger. I can spot insincerity and bad faith a mile away now. You cannot sell me things. If someone did that thing where they insert a pause into their sentence to make it look like they haven't already decided what they're going to say next, I noticed it, and it irritated me. If they ever pair that move up with telling me something that's meant to be in any way persuasive, or telling me something about someone else we both know, oh, cool, now I know literally everything about that person and what they're trying to do. It would be fun if it weren't such a drag. \n\nThe most annoying thing about it is waiting for everyone else to catch up...for instance, let's say I meet someone and they turn out to be a garden-variety manipulator, and inside of a week I've figured out their motivations and can practically read their thoughts. That's cool for me, but since I hate conflict and constantly have my Ti telling me that I'm actually crazy for doubting this new person's sincerity, I would never do anything overt to try to limit their influence, so I still have to deal with them for two or three years (or four, or five) years before they out themselves to everyone else. \n\nThe other annoying thing is that some people really hate to be figured out, and I can't help the fact that I'm a champion-level figure-outer. 
2	Feeling someone's vibe is like, in a nutshell:\n\n¬∞Every data you have gathered through humain behavior, mixed with your own path and possible path of developpement are giving you a frame for reading people.\n\nSo basically as you get older and experience more people, the whole machine gets even more faster. You can't even pinpoint exactly where did you even got those informations, because it's probably a bunch of analogy that comes from all over the place.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThose skills are improved through knowledge, connections and repetition of occurence, i think which could be completely unrelated to people sometimes.\n\nIf i had to break it down:\n\nimaginary exemple: Let's say i have noticed some Pornstar have a certain possible physionomy, Speech pattern, political view, and moral system,intelligence, emotional strategies, and rationalisation, this form the unconscious Pornostar persona,the closer someone seem to match those characteristic, the closer they are to the Pornostar "archetype".\n\nIf someone seem to be very close to this, but isn't, the information is transmitted to another archetype, so even when you are wrong, it just fill up the whole database for another reference point. If this is a one time thing, this isn't conclusive evidence, but if it happen multiple time, it's a pattern.\n\nHere is just one archetype on the fly, but you have a lots of them, and the degree of adherance to those multiples points gives a multifacet picture gathering that gives me a clear possible idea of who i am talking to.\n\nThis database is constantly increasigly evolving, i can be reading an article, looking at  the comment of a certain demographic of people, observing a certain style of clothes, watching people gets angry in the street, anything just fill me up, and through repeated experience, i try to decifer if it's a  pattern or a informations to put somewhere else.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen i say "try" it's not exactly like am consciously thinking that or acting that way, it's more like there is a judge in my brain dedicaced for this job that doing this automatically.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI will say this cover a good portion of the "vibe" but not everything, my own personal maturity, and psychological developpement also play a role in this, the more i have "traveled" myself those archetypes, the faster it is for me to read through them. I would say good people reader are people that have done a lot of thing, and been a lots of "persona". You may not understand them, but they can get you retroactively.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is also no relationship with being sympathetic and empathic, i can fully understand where you come from but decide to not give a fuck for whatever reason.(Usually based on my current belief system and ethical philosophy)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLast thing about this "I am feeling what other people are feeling in ME". This seems to be more the mark of a lack of self awareness and psychological developpement, rather than an INFJ thing. You will also see a lot of "younger" NF make this claim in general, along with saying they are hyper sensible, ADHD, High potential ect... Notice the trend here?\n\nOver diagnostic, over labeling, make people unable to actually think what they are diagnosing, and those "easy" word, make you less likely to deconstruct and think by yourself the pattern of what's happening here(lack of self awareness), so you psychologically prefer the validation of being understood and classified rather than the solving or changing the pattern that made you like this in the first place.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis process is obviously not conscious, but immediate, it's like when you meet someone, you see all the gathering of all those point forming a picture\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
2	Following because as an ENTJ the only time I actually feel is, well, never, and I'm not sure if I should laugh or cry about that. I'm not a sociopath, I just don't feel feelings.\n\nThe most intense feelings I ever had were the one time I got broken up with by someone I was in love with, and after that initial flood of feelings I think my emotional acuity actually dropped 50 points. That relationship was interesting, because the other person was an empath and helped me tune into other people's feelings.
2	Idk, ENTJ here as well
2	I'm an INFP so feeling with intuition is just a natural feeling like a gut feeling you have you just read the social situation with ease. It's like having a magnetic force around you and you just feel the push and pull of different emotions. Theres nothing I do to hone these feelings but just flow with them. The more I experience an emotion the more I get better at reading an emotion if that makes sense. 
1	This post seems to have a lot of Fe and "feeling how others feel" rather than Fi.
1	Late to the party, but:\n\nI experience Ni as more of an intellectual rather than emotional function.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
2	Help with negative friend	Hey guys, as INFJ‚Äôs we are able to soak up the external emotional state of the individuals around us, especially our friends, and as a young INFJ I‚Äôm not sure what to do in this peculiar situation I find myself in. Basically, I‚Äôm a first year at my university and one of my buddies from high school went to the same university as me and we became a lot closer. However, as our friendship deepened, I started to discover the serious nihilism inside his heart, his negative and pessimistic outlook on life, and substance abuse. However, I know he is a good person at heart but is lost and confused as a young man in society - but hanging out with him is becoming exhausting because my innate desire for purity and goodness feels constantly under distress. How should I handle this situation, I don‚Äôt have anything against my long time friend, just being around him brings down my vibe and I don‚Äôt know what to do.
3	You have to hang with him less, unfortunately. Take care of yourself 
2	Negativity is like the back side of a magnet for me.  I'm not sure if it's possible for me to choose to continue to spend time with someone in a relationship like that.  Not out of hatred, but it's so destructive that my sense of emotional survival won't let me stick around.  I'm an encourager, and I'll try, but I have to spend more of my time around positive influences.
2	Hello,\n\nI was in a very similar situation to you.\n\nNegative friend who always vented her problems on me, her life was a mess but she didn't try to fix it, and she was always drunk and partying as a cope mechanism. I tried to help her emotionally for a long time, because we've been friends for a lot of years, but eventually it became too much for me, I was always exhausted and little by little I started to be disgusted by her, to the point when I started making excuses for hanging out or talking with her through my phone. I ended up door-slamming her and rarely talk now, and even though I feel a little bit guilty, it was just my emotional reaction to that problem what became the "solution".\n\nAnd I'm mostly happy about it, it feels a little bit more "fresh" without her now.
2	Distance yourself. I know you love him as a friend but it will be worse for you if you don't. As much as we desire to help anyone and everyone; unfortunately there are just some people who refuse to be helped. You've made an effort to help him and he isn't listening. You've done your bit and If you continue to be around him you will feel dejected and depressed yourself. You may feel a tang of guilt but you do come first. End of the day it is your life and you need to focus on your own positivity. I have given the door slam to somebody in the past for 2 whole years for the same reason as you. It was the best thing for me.. \n\n
10	Do other types feel the same companionship INFJs do?	This is a question for everyone, all types, do other MBTI types have the same sense of companionship? I've found lots of INFJs are proud of being so (me included) despite the burdens it comes with, and we get along so well. All my closest friends are INFJs or ENTJs because we all rely on each other for understanding, comfort and companionship... is it just an NFJ thing? \n\nBasically, I feel like I can always count on my fellow Advocates and Protagonists to give me reassurance or at the very least not exhaust me. Is that common?
8	I remember reading the N types typically prefer N type and the sensors tend to prefer the sensors, but most of my friends are sensors (used to be real close with an INFP childhood friend, but I hang with ISTP, ESTJ, ISFJ, ISFP, and ESFP friends), but I feel like I have that click of mutual understanding with ENTPs the most that makes me enthusiastic and encouraged to explore the world with them, or to find someone like them that likes me too hahaha
6	INFJs DO have a very strong need to have a sort of "pack" (like wolves). I think it is a FJ thing. 
3	Idk man I have 1 ENTP friend and we play advocate for each other constantly but besides that I have no "companion" friends. Last time I saw her was 5 months ago anyways, but we're reuniting this week and I can tell you I definitely look forward to it!\n\nSo I love the 1 companion level friend I do have, but I don't crave that feeling from every relationship. I like having friends where we can keep things low-key & fun. Sadly we share no hobbies or interests lol.
2	I don‚Äôt know what you mean to be perfectly honest, but I‚Äôm very close with my friends and the people in my life. I have a best friend named Elizabeth, we‚Äôve been best friends since senior year of high school (known each other since 7th grade) and you will never hear a bad word about her come out of my mouth. We have very different views on the world and life, but we get along fantastically and respect each other‚Äôs views. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd tell her anything/everything, but I do know I‚Äôm extremely loyal to her as a friend. Same goes for the majority of my friends. I have to have my friends and my dad to stay sane. They give me stability. Don‚Äôt know if this is related to the question, but just a side note, I like being close to people. I like having someone they I can talk to every day and share my thoughts with. I‚Äôm really big on relationships and like being in them. Being single is fun too but I prefer being committed to someone and having that. 
4	Faking to be an INFJ	I have an acquaintance who claims that they are INFJ. However, having known this individual for a while now, I know that they for a fact, aren't an INFJ. They're quite more ~~analytical~~ manipulative in terms of thinking and in fact, is the complete opposite of myself (an INFJ).\n\nRecently, my friends and I took a personality test for fun. The person in question was matched with INTP, which personally, was unsurprising. However, when they got the results back, they were visibly very upset and started saying things like, "I'm an INFJ for sure-- this test is wrong! Let me retake the test!" It was honestly shocking how upset they were over this result.\n\nJust a bit of background on the individual: They're quick to please others, and I'm a bit convinced they're a bit narcissistic too. When they initially told me that they were an INFJ and they follow a lot of INFJ-related pages, I almost did a double-take because I was so certain, this person was far away from one.\n\nDo you think it's possible that the person's actual personality type is INTP... but they're just posing as an INFJ?\n\nEdit: I was particularly curious because this individual has a history of being manipulative, cold, and calculating... but also has a savior complex. They're known to be people-pleasers who really want to fit in and would say things to please others without boundaries. I would say that generally, INFJs are concerned with the wellbeing of others, so that's why I posed the question. It is not to say that all INFJs are great individuals, but it was just an observation.
15	INFJs are typically highly analytical. They're also people-pleasers (much more so than, say, INTPs), and I've also known unhealthy INFJs with narcissistic tendencies. So I'm not sure you've provided any "evidence" to indicate this person is \*not\* an INFJ.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat being said, mistypes are common, so it's entirely possible that a different type would be a better fit. It's really hard to know. But like others have said, that doesn't mean they're posing. 
11	They may not be "posing" per say, but mistyped themselves. I think it's fair to say most people struggle to assess themselves in an accurate and unbiased way. This could further be supported by the fact that they follow INFJ pages, many of those seem to make gross generalizations about the type. 
6	May just be that they identify/relate strongly with the INFJ type, without having considered that maybe they're more analytical than they think, so the INTP typing may come as a surprise to them. I don't think they're purposefully masquerading as an INFJ though. 
3	Yes, it's possible to mistype yourself. These tests are self-expressive anyway and depend on our knowledge of ourselves.\n\nBut INFJs are also very different. We all have different personalities and beliefs. INFJ is just our cognitive functions, what information we focus on and the ways that we process this  information externally and internally.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut we can't tell you whether that person is INFJ just based on a short description on your perception of their personality.\n\nAt any rate, our personality types shouldn't really matter all that much to others. If a person is mistyping themselves they are really online hindering themselves and disenabling themselves from working on their real issues.  It doesn't affect you unless you were intending to be a part of that process... and even if you were, I still am not sure it would affect you. You can still observe or assist them where needed.\n\nI've got a tinge of the ginge and I dye my hair. I never know whether I'm a "real" redhead or not because it's enhanced from its original tinge.  Maybe they are just higher on some cognitive functions, lower on others and on the cusp. \n\n&#x200B;
4	I don't understand why you care so much. What difference does it make if he thinks he's the wrong type?
4	Why does it matter? Who cares of he‚Äôs posing as an INFJ
1	A person may be an infj at their core. The issue arises when a person works to strengthen the weak parts of their personality. Then they take a test and they don't really see how they are they test as how they want to be. Historically the mbti tests are wholly inaccurate (according to what I've read) There are more reliable ways to type people (again according to what I've read. Lol)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Ir-ypPLUdxY\n\nYou can learn how to type people and then type the person based on their interactions. I have no idea how to do it yet. I'm just starting literally a few days ago studying this process. So well I know nothing at the same time I can imagine how you can miss type and get a different answer on one of those tests. It depends on your mood and your experiences I think. \n\nAdditional study is needed for sure
1	I have taken Myers Briggs at different points in my life and I‚Äôm sometimes I am an INF-P or J. I think some people may be both. I believe that I may be both which is why I joined both subs, INFP and INFJ. I don‚Äôt see why someone would fake to be INFJ, as if it‚Äôs some elite club in which one would have know someone that someone‚Äôs to get in. It‚Äôs a spectrum. I am just on that J/P line. 
1	It's possible they are INTP or maybe even an ENFP or ENTP.\n\nIt's not uncommon to type as your opposite partners.\n\nThe 'manipulative' comment makes me think ENFP or ENTP, as unhealthy ones are prone to it.  An INTP is more like to be aggressive thinking and dominate by trying to create a predictable future.\n\nEither way I'd just respect the person as it never really matters what type another is when you interact with them.  Give them some freedom to be themselves.  I think our types are used most healthily used when developing ourselves.
1	The test isn‚Äôt reliable, it only ballparks. research the cognitive functions, and people pleasing is a result of inferior Se (INFJ trait)
112	An interesting podcast on INFJ personality type advice, and on understanding INFJ personalities, that I think many of us will find useful in our day to day lives.	
8	Damn. Blown away by this. Really weird to feel decrypted while I'm usually the one decrypting. The podcasters give a lot of relevant exemples and it feels like real life situations already encoutered. Thanks for the share!
4	I love personality hacker! I met Joel and Antonia one time and they were so cool.
3	This is a really good podcast. It's also worth checking out some of their other episodes. They explore the way the mind works in quite explicit detail, while still presenting it in a way that's easy to follow. 
2	This is really cool... everything was well put. This is all very relatable :)
2	I LOVE Personality Hackers. I started listening to them about 3 years ago and they're still my favorite üòÅüëå
2	I can literally cry at this :') Thank you for sharing <3
2	This was an incredibly validating listen with lots of great reminders for cultivating a positive mindset / positive growth. I‚Äôm sharing this with others who might want to understand me on a deeper level.

1	I've really liked trying to change my environment a bit more as a form of self-expression with the whole KonMari trend. I got one area of my living area settled and it feels so peaceful. Since I keep plants in a separate growing area, when I work from home, I always put a few different air plants on my desk, and the change and having something living around me gives me a certain peace. Thought I would share as more of a way I do self expression, I suppose.

5	Is Kumiko an INFJ?	Kumiko being one of the protagonists from the anime Hibike! Euphonium. What I find unique about this show is it really delves into the personality of the main characters, from minor quirks to events and ideas that define them. For an animated medium, I think it‚Äôs brilliant in it‚Äôs character writing.\n\nI find Kumiko showing a lot of INFJ tendencies. For example, it‚Äôs known early on that she puts on a facade to seem like a ‚Äògood girl‚Äô type, trying her best not to step on anyone‚Äôs toes and really doesn‚Äôt have a defining personality trait of her own. \n\nGoing further would be spoilers, but we do see Kumiko give off further INFJ vibes as the story goes deeper. \n\nAlso, I‚Äôm pretty sure Reina (the other protagonist) is an INTJ because I‚Äôve become so enamored with her and a personality like hers piques my curiosity to no bounds. \n\nWhat do you guys think? If you haven‚Äôt watched it, I‚Äôd recommend it for sure! 
2	I never heard of this anime but looks interesting to watch; thanks for mentioning\n\nAnd yes, after looking up on wiki and reading that personality description of hers, INFJ seems to fit her because she is usually polite and friendly but awkward and blunt. She also plays a role as a bystander and she listens to people without judging them harshly, which is how she make friends. She also accepts flaws and strengths from everyone and doesn‚Äôt like her personality because she doesn‚Äôt communicate well. Kumiko my favorite character now. 
2	I love that show, she‚Äôs a really well written character and relatable. Her VA is great too, I watched it a while ago so I can‚Äôt really specify anything but yeah I‚Äôd say she is from the impression I got! She seemed both emotional and also strong willed at the same time which is a good characteristic

1	how do you create with purpose? [creative wellness]	I'm posting this in a few mbti subs.\n\nWhat techniques have you discovered for enhancing, refining and inspiring creativity in your life?\n\nPerhaps the Ne users can speak more on discovery and inspiration and Ni users can speak more on converging and focus.\n\nIn my experience finding a place where I can express myself seamlessly (without overthinking) is critical to my mental health. It is a couple stages away from Maslow's self-actualization and self-transcendence but is a necessary level of human development.\n\nHow do you define creative wellness? \n\nOn a scale of 1-10 how would you rate your level of creative wellness?\n\nPlease answer any of these questions, or all. \n\nThanks for reading, I look forward to reading your thoughts/feelings.\n\nTLDR\nentp curious about your perspective on creativity
2	Aside from my day job, I like to write. I'm INFJ so dom Ni user. \n\nI tend to become aware of the thing I want to write about, then I take some time to let it build in my mind. It's normally something that starts to bother me (I did a piece on introversion in the workplace, and another on overconfidence most recently.) \n\nWhile it's stewing, online research is good for me. This feeds my Ni process with more knowledge and ideas (even if it's not immediately obvious how much I'm retaining).\n\nThen, eventually, I get the urge and start writing and if I'm ready, it comes quite easily. If I'm not, I'm learning to walk away. The difference is obvious but sometimes I'm in a place where I want to write and I have to accept it's not going to happen that day. It's weird but seems to be the pattern.\n\nI'm trying to do articles regularly now, once or twice a month. The purpose being to explore issues that don't normally get the attention they deserve, covered in the sort of depth that would naturally appeal to us intuitive types. So far, it's going pretty well. 
2	I've always been an artist. It's not something I've thought much about. I"m also a musician.\n\nThere are certain things that that do seem to rob creativity. Work does this more so than anything. So, I tend to gravitate to jobs that allow freedoms. Like little to no management. \n\nI think in general, I have to have silence and solitude to be able to create anything. I definitely can't be feeling any kind of strong emotions or stress. 
1	This is in terms of your creative wellness question. \n\nI enjoy music and art, but for a while, I struggled with wondering if I was a creative person. I realized that I always play music that other people have composed, and started to wonder if I could ever have "enough creativity" to compose my own music.  \n\nI think one important thing to note is that creativity can depend on time and leisure. These two factors are huge variables in creativity, so to speak. I think that if I had enough time, perhaps I would be able to compose something on my own. But I do realize that time isn't everything, and sometimes, spontaneity is the most important factor in creativity. \n\nThis is to say that, honestly, I think it's hard to define my creative wellness on its own. But I would like to think that I have the potential to become a more creative person. 
1	my previous gf wasn‚Äôt a drain - my mind would go blank and I would just live in the moment...loved it (for a few hours)\n\nbut personally it‚Äôs all a paradox for me, when I‚Äôm with someone I want to be alone and when I‚Äôm alone I want to be with someone. sucks lol
100	What does a healthy infj look like?	I‚Äôm definitely an unhealthy INFJ right now and have been for some time. Don‚Äôt worry I‚Äôm not blaming my problems on MBTI, I‚Äôm in therapy working on my issues. But I‚Äôd like to know what you guys think our personality is like at a healthy, balanced mental state.
119	i don't think there's a specific guidebook for how you should act as an INFJ, or any other type of person. but, as an INFJ, i can tell you that one of the things i changed about myself after with unhealthy mental habits for way too long is to talk to friends and loved ones about the things that wear on my mind. \n\nit's really easy for our types to get sucked up into our own heads and get caught in mental loops, running ideas through our heads, analyzing them, then running through our heads again. we can do this all day, every day and never come up with any satisfactory answers. what we usually need is outside input, which can be very hard for our personality types to seek out.
44	Accepting yourself for who you are, and also valuing yourself. As INFJs we subconsciously are attracted to helping people. We‚Äôre people pleasers. However, there comes a point where it can be damaging to yourself and you need to remember to keep your distance and keep yourself sane sometimes. It‚Äôs better and more valuable to develop and make yourself a healthy INFJ for later on in life. \n\nMost importantly, know your needs. You can‚Äôt force yourself to be what others view as ‚Äúnormal‚Äù or ‚Äúhealthy.‚Äù Treat yourself sometimes, make sure you‚Äôre taking care of yourself in whatever ways your mind and body respond well to. 
27	In my opinion,   \n\n\nAn unhealthy INFJ is the result of not only getting trapped in one cognitive function over the others but also in not utilizing all your functions (and knowing their places).  \n\n\nFor example, in middle school, I decided to get into skateboarding because my mom made me. Not only is it a heavy Se activity but its culture is not Fe friendly (e.g., cussing out others for not being able to kickflip). In short, I wasn't happy. Thankfully, I left it.  \nLikewise, in high school, I became obsessed with theology and philosophy. While Ti is better used by an INFJ than Se, Ti is at most meant to be a tool/assistant for us. Nothing more. INFJs will never quite fit into the current philosophical world (which has become too Ti for us). While there have been INFJ philosophers throughout history, only one of them (I believe) was able to adapt to current analytic philosophy: Wittgenstein. The rest are too poetically and spiritually minded for philosophy these days. I learned this, unfortunately, only after graduating from college with a BA in Philosophy.   \n\n\nHonestly, I should have studied psychology and/or social anthropology. Now, I really have no career options that fit my strengths :( but I have hope :)  \n\n\nWe are Ni-Fe doms. We are healthiest while using our insights to understand and/or help others. That's it. A beautifully simple purpose for us to practice. As for who those "others" are, it's up to you. Ti helps us help them by refining our insights to make any kind of logical sense.   \nSe keeps us present in moment when conversing with others, caring for beauty, being able to jump into our ESTP shadow in emergencies, etc.  \n

20	Vitamins (B12 really helped me) sleep, lots of water. Taking care of your needs, good music. Therapy saved my lifeee. Hope you feel better soon, your not alone! 
32	When you figure it out, clue me in.  \n\nI constantly feel like there is something out of balance.  I work on one area that I feel like I‚Äôm lacking in, and other areas fall short.  So I move on to something else that needs work.  And so on, and so on.  I feel like I‚Äôm a continuous work in progress and that I‚Äôll never be content with where I am in life and with who I am as a human being.  
20	From one of my previous comments: Not an INFJ and I only know one well, but he is what I‚Äôd consider healthy, not just as an INFJ but just as a person. With my personal experience with this subreddit, there is quite a bit of glorification of unhealthy habits, none of which I see in him. He focuses on self improvement, but he isn‚Äôt insecure or overly critical of himself. He‚Äôs probably one of the most secure people I know if I‚Äôm being completely honest. He doesn‚Äôt pity himself or believe that he‚Äôs an outsider due to being an INFJ, but he‚Äôs aware that he‚Äôs different. He likes to be alone, but makes time for those he cares about and can handle people very well. He‚Äôs okay with being out of his comfort zone and is completely willing to try new things. He understands other perspectives while remaining true to his core beliefs. He‚Äôs well spoken and takes the time to completely explain his thoughts if they are confusing. Overall an extremely well rounded person that I consider myself lucky to know. I could be completely off base, but he seems to have a lot of self love, and I find myself almost envious of that, even though I‚Äôm happy he has it. Dunno maybe I‚Äôm completely wrong about INFJ qualities but those seem to be some traits that he has that I find lacking in lots of posts from this sub. 
8	With me it's feeling that all parts of my life are balanced and accounted for. I try to keep an honest running assessment of what I'm doing and the lives of those nearest to me. When I feel a deficit in attention, I create a mental work list and do that work until everything feels in order again. \n\nBecause this work is never completed, I remind myself that any feelings of anxiety or fear are transitory, and because I'm consistently watching and working, I believe negatives will eventually resolve themselves. The world is in a constant state of change and I have to remind myself not to hold too tightly to any part of it, but to enjoy things while they exist, and mourn / celebrate when they have gone. My visions of what could be are held in check, subordinated to what actually is. The former is for planning and the latter for life.\n\nI can't feel healthy unless I can forgive myself, so I practice forgiving others. If I can do that, then I am better able to cut myself some slack. Over the years I've come to understand just how hard it is to accomplish anything in this world, and have come to admire human effort. As long as we're trying, we can do better. Our biggest enemy is not failure, but but the absence of doing. It's easier to direct objects in motion than to move them when sitting still. So now I find more comfort in doing than actually achieving, even though one always seems to lead to the other.
4	To answer your question about a healthy balanced INFJ, life is beautiful and peaceful.  You just have to get through the dark night of the soul.\n\nTake care of yourself physically and develop your Fe.\n\n
6	Intuition is like a vast net within our subconscious, collecting patterns, ideas, concepts and various other information.\n\nI believe all people, but perhaps intuitive types more predominantly have an inner knowing of what we are capable of being, even if this is typically expressed in daydreams and epiphanies. This is why we have such an unquenchable thrist for personal growth, which may make us feel inadequate with who we are right now. \n\nI feel things like meditation for example can help clear the muddy waters of our inner world and perhaps manifest this inner knowing into reality.\nThe path of spiritual practice is what fuels my fire. \n\nSome like being creative with art, or helping others. But we have a true blessing and that is our strong intuition. Feed it, read, travel, take in new experiences and watch you're inner world change and then your outer world will follow. Life is a reflection after all! üôèüèª
4	Having the constant INFJ flow
5	A healthy INFJ is not withdrawn. They are much more open emotionally and show more grace. A healthy INFJ do not place expectations on others to conform to their ideal image they have for the person. They're comfortable in their own skin. They are attune to their morals and ethics while balancing their care for others. A healthy INFJ SETS boundaries with people because they care about others and themselves. And a healthy INFJ has good intention in their investment, not falsely invest in others because they're too "empathetic" or friendly.
3	I think it's all up to the individual.. we are all in different stages in life so it's not going to be all the same experiences. For example, you were probably in a very different stage 10 years ago versus today.. your challenges and problems are different. Give it another 10 years and you'll look back and laugh at your problems now.\n\nI think INFJs go through so much.. my whole life has been a struggle, trying so hard to fit in but I couldn't ever fit in. I have pretended to be an extrovert so that I could feel normal, but it backfires because it just doesn't feel natural to me... I had a feeling I knew that I was different when I was younger.. but back then, introverts wasn't even "a thing" and I had no resources to learn about what it really is. Relationships are greatly affected, especially when the other person has no clue why you are the way you are.\n\nI think it's more healthy to fully accept yourself the way you are.. not trying to say be lazy and not improve, I'm trying to say maybe all the struggles in life is so that you can learn to love and appreciate yourself.. learn more about yourself, about being an introvert, and use that to your advantage.. We can be alone and happy.. extroverted people cannot do that. We have the ability to read and analyze people, while others are clueless. We engage in deeper conversations, which attracts many people due to our depth.\n\nDon't worry, wherever you are in life, you are on the right path.. this is your journey and you learn as you go. It's part of your growth in the human experience.

2	a healthy infj needs an unhealthy world.  \nmeaning a world full of unknown.  \nyou cannot be a healthy infj in a world thats discovered for the most part. its like asking a lion to behave like an infj and keep rethinking his environment and habits , insisting to eat some grass cause he had that 1 fantastic experience.   \ninfjs work is dont in the starting phase of conceptual exploration while working with humans, then it stops.  \n
2	A healthy INFJ looks hot...
1	I find it really hard to get into the whole un-/healthy type thing.    \nThing is, sure, some people are truly unhealthy, but what I always say is: you do you man. Really, if I wake up today not regretting laying in my bed all day long yesterday, then I'm healthy. Why? Because I did something yesterday that I don't regret today and/or tomorrow. As long as what you do does not disturb others (let's say if you lay in bed for the whole day without helping your spouse, mum or w/e clean up, then you're hurting by not lifting a finger) it's okay, really.    \nSure, it's not always healthy, but definition is blurred so it's extremely hard to define oneself as a healthy person, on the interweb there will always be that person who'll say you're not and that's the thing. To one you're ok to another person you're not.    \nSorry for a block of text.   \nP. S. you'll know when/once you're healthy or close to it, trust me. 
1	See: Gandalf the Grey.
1	Right now I'm a very unhealthy infj. Been through a major trauma the past year. I'm just now getting to where I have adequate time and space alone with silence and solitude. \n\nWhat I noticed over the past 3 years I've been very stressful and very traumatic. Is that I was overloaded mentally emotionally and psychic.\n\nI think there's certain ways I behaved and started behaving in certain ways I started thinking or actually acting and lashing out. All those things are abnormal for me and out of character.\n\nDoes seem sometimes people get stuck in certain ways with no way out and overtime don't realize it and it starts affecting them negatively. It's just like that cliche with the boiling frog. you can put a frog in water and slowly turn up the heat and end up boiling it and it won't realize that it's being boiled. I think INFJs seem to have that problem more so than most. Especially with demands people around us and life itself. and we can explain to the others exactly how we're feeling or exactly what we need. They don't understand the need for solitude. They can process and deal in the moment and we can't at all. \n\nI mean really if anybody's healthy mentally emotionally or even physically. Seems like we all share the same characteristics. We will remain calm. Will be balanced and centered just as a regular nature. we want lash out or act out or say things or do things out of character for us. And regular things in general just won't bother you so much. I'll be less crying less anger less hurt less pain. \n\nnot sure if other INFJs do this but I definitely overindulgent things whether it's cigarettes or copy and there's been a couple times alcohol. Alcohol being the worst of all of it because I'm already acting out character. 
1	I've had my share of lows in life... but currently, I'm really content with where I am in my life. \n\nOf course, life waxes and wanes, and stress does tend to ebb in and out. But overall, I am at peace with my inner self. Every day feels as if you've had a nice, homecooked meal and you have just eaten the right amount to feel satisfied. I'm at peace with the way things are, no matter how upsetting they may be. 
1	I haven‚Äôt read every comment so maybe this is redundant but after many years of trial and error the thing that gets me out of a Ti loop is to meditate and practice mindfullness. I think especially for INFJ‚Äôs protecting your states is necessary for energy management. States of stress, states of recovery. I‚Äôm a professional artist so I practice art for 8-14 hours a day. Much of it is technical so I‚Äôm dialed into my Ti for long periods. If I don‚Äôt fit in time to recharge in my Ni state I feel like I‚Äôm going to go freaking nutso! I had a mental breakdown about 9 months ago because I amputated my Ni and Se too long. Journaling, looking at art, or taking a bath are the fastest ways I change my state to an Intuitive creative one. I also will listen to esoteric podcasts. Meditation for me is more of a transition into the intuitive state. I identify with feelings of guilt if you‚Äôre not being productive but you ARE being productive by recharging. The key is to do recharging activities and not just screw off otherwise its wasting time. There are no rules about what a recharging activity is - so long as it‚Äôs intentional and purposeful! 
1	Jet's MBTI - Cast Podcast	Hey Reddit, my name is jetplane48 (ESTP 7w8 sx/sp) and I am starting up a podcast in relation to MBTI. Fundamentally, the goal of the podcast is to educate the viewers of several Typology systems through a series of one-on-one's with others who are interested in the same topics. I have been conducting interviews for many years (MBTI related) and this is just an extension of that, however, I want to discuss topics that the audience wants me to cover. Naturally, I'll come up with my own material but I would love to explore topics that others have in mind. I am busy with school for the next few months but when I finish, the goal is to eventually be more consistent with these podcast uploads if this turns out to be popular enough. I'm very excited to get this started, and let's see some questions!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAR20eDTSOg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAR20eDTSOg)\n\n&#x200B;

3	How do i solve broken sleep?
2	I have a friend who's going untreated for depression and anxiety. In the past she was medicated and getting therapy, but she recently lost her job and is going without either. She still has meds, but they aren't working for her. She spends most of her time crying and beating herself up emotionally.  I also heard she's self-medicating with alcohol. I've sent resources to her about where to get free online therapy, and she has a chance to get free therapy from a women's clinic but she hasn't followed up on it.\n\nThe problem is she's starting to lose all of her friends. They love her and want to help her, but she isn't getting any help. The other issue is when one of her friends expresses a feeling, like sadness, frustration, or panic over her behavior or choices, she then uses their feeling as another way to beat herself up emotionally. She is making other people's feelings about her, basically denying them the opportunity to be able to express themselves in an honest or open way without using them to make herself feel bad. She recently made a risky choice which frustrated her roommate, and instead of trying to fix that, it turned into a multiple day emotional self-abuse fest of dwelling on how everyone hates her and she has no friends. Her roommate's valid concern was left completely unaddressed.\n\nRecently she did something that caused an intense panic and fear response in me, and although I told her that, I had to spend the next 20 minutes comforting her and talking her down from intense sobbing and wailing. She understands panic attacks and didn't once ask how I was doing or recovering or handling it but instead I had to focus on her and how she felt so bad she made me panic. Unless I'm validating her choices or saying how she's not at fault and propping her up, I am getting to the point where I feel anything else I say is going to send her over the edge. It means I can't have a roll in this friendship other than unquestioning support, which isn't always valid and very one-sided.\n\nPeople with depression and anxiety, or people who have dealt with being in a codependent relationship with someone with depression and anxiety, what advice can you give me? This is no longer a friendship, I'm being used as therapy and she isn't getting better, I'm just validating her choices and it has to stop. I feel like I'm the last cushion between her and rock bottom. She has stated multiple time how I'm her only friend and it's a lot of pressure. It also stops me from being able to assert myself because she's made it clear that I'm all she has left (which factually isn't true, she has other people who care about her, but not in the way she wants).
2	I typed this up and was like... resisting deleting it so much!!! But I  figure it's good to talk about my INFJ relevant failings. Just get that horrible personal shit out into the open, and then feel guilty about discussing myself so much later!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm type 1 diabetic and INFJ. Sufficient to say my health is a potato. For all I know my insides are mashed potato. I didn't have healthcare through my work for two years since I wasn't PR in the country I lived in.  Now I'm back to my OG country my ESTP grandma is taking me to get all the tests done that I would never actually do for myself because I prefer to just hypothetically ponder my issues and I need feedback and support from others to actually look after my health. People need to tell me it actually matters otherwise I question my own feelings and get stuck on that "oh but I'm probably being dramatic it's manageable" loop. Telling the doctor "oh I'm fine my nanna just thinks I have allergies"  and then explaining that I've been constipated my whole life, regularly get less than 3 hours of sleep (and I lied and said I usually fall asleep by 3am- even though usually the sun is up and I'm still up) realllllllyyyy honed in that I'm an idiot with no concept of the realities of my own present health.\n\nAt any rate, I told the doctor that I think I have hormone imbalance issues and I'll be interested to see if that's right or wrong. But also- if I'm right, doesn't that mean I'm even more of an idiot? Because I self-diagnosed a potential hormone imbalance like 4 years ago, but because my parents didn't seem to really care when I brought it up to them I just pushed it to the back of the closet and thought "oh my health doesn't matter". Like, as a baby in the crib my mum would come back for me two hours later and I'd be lying there with eyes wide open, and as a child I came out with a different excuse to not go to bed every night. My parents joke about it... but I have some seriously heavy sleep issues. I actually lied to the doctor about how often I don't sleep. I literally had not slept the night before my appointment with him at all.  I'd stayed up all night.\n\nTalking to the doctor reminded me that I'm a walking fucking mess. I'm the health equivalent of a high-functioning alcoholic. I wonder how I'd be if I didn't feel constantly tired.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut it feels really good to have someone else rationally make proactive changes for the good of my health.   I just want to be able to be proactive about my own health/ feelings and if I can't, then at least I want people who can in my life in some capacity and it feels amazingggggg to actually have someone else say "you need to do this. You are really sick."\n\n&#x200B;
1	Made this post in the middle of the night üòÇ (restless thoughts about my past kind of consumed me):\n\n*So I had a dream right now (3.am. right now), and I wanted to quickly share it with you guys.*\n\n**I felt my body heat drop immensely, to the point where I was somehow "melting".** *- the dream*\n\n*When I suddenly woke up... I found that I was drenched in sweat. I wasn't sure what was going on?! But, apparently I was so hot my body "woke me up" through a dream, and so I drank some water and instantly felt better....*\n\n*This is super weird (even for me) that I somehow "knew" this, while I was asleep.

1	I can often be quite skeptical when it comes to alternative medicine. I can say I do, and try to believe but i think my inner skeptic makes even the potential placebo effect not work for me.\n\nBUT... in the last month I've started taking medicinal mushrooms such as Reishi, Cordyceps, Lions Mane and Turkey Tail and its genuinely transformed my life. Mentally and physically I've been noticably better from struggles that I've been battleing with all sorts of treatments for years. Im not "fixed" persay.. but damn am I ever amazed. \n\nI have quite the compilation of studies to back it up as well on my computer but since Im on my phone Ill just link, the first link from a quick google search.

12	Am I an INFJ?	First off, I apologize if this is yet another post of many from people who are seeking to find the answer to their MBTI. What started off as a fun test has now grown into a slight obsession, and I feel that taking the tests over and over is no longer leading me to deeper insights. I also have begun to grow weary of websites that specialize in making lists, such as "10 signs you're an INFJ, the rarest personality type," since I've noticed a lot of vagueness in the answers as well as seeing similar answers appearing on lists for other types.\n\nI've consistently tested as three different types: INFJ, INTJ, and INFP. \n\nI do not want to bore you by pouring my life story onto this post, but I will say that from a young age I have always been described as very stoic and mature. Friends of my parents would often describe me as "an adult living in a child's body." Throughout school I was always regarded as the strongest writer of my grade, by a wide margin, while struggling more significantly with mathematics. Socially I was and still am a classic introvert, while at the same time I've managed to develop a large circle of friends and have had success in earning social status.  I am a very reserved person by nature, keep opinions to myself, avoid conflict, etc. but very much enjoy social settings to a degree (music festivals, bars on occasion, etc.) and was even the president of my fraternity in college for a year. From a completely objective standpoint, people seem to really like me and it boggles my mind because I do not feel like I'm going out of my way to put effort into winning people over. It just sort of happens.\n\nSometimes I feel as though I have an entire universe inside my mind, and things like music allow me to be carried away into a world of fantasy in which I'm living out my dreams, accomplishing my goals, bonding with loved ones, etc. all while sitting in my room with headphones on. In fact, it can become addicting and rather distracting from real life because it is just so damn enticing. \n\nI put an exhaustingly large amount of effort into pondering who I am and what I should be doing with my life. I am constantly reflecting on my past experiences, evaluating my strengths and weaknesses, and trying new things in order to get closer to realizing what my 'thing' is. I seem to want to live a life in which I master something, whether it be an art form, a skill, or a profession. I would definitely describe myself as ambitious and am very competitive when it comes to something I want to be good at. I thrive off of comparing my work to those above me and learning from them in order to make myself better.\n\nWhen it comes to things like politics, I tend to see issues as instances of massive misunderstanding between different groups. I do not understand why humans are so often unable to listen to each other in order to gain deeper insight into the roots of their grievances. I have never gravitated strongly toward one position over the other (for the most part) because my allegiance always seems to be with hearing the 'other side' out.\n\nI 100 percent value rationality and logic, two things that are staples of INTJ. I have also been described as having a statuesque appearance of the face. In fact, many people have told me that they thought I was unapproachable and intimidating until they got to know me. In addition to this, I was very successful in things like debate in high school because I was very easily able to see the logical chains of arguments and recognize their weak points. It definitely clicked for me.\n\nOn the other hand, I loathe analyzing hard statistics, solving math problems, and feel as though I have the greatest access to my intelligence through writing, which leads me to think I may be more aligned with an INFJ/INFP personality type. I've never considered myself to be a great big problem solver--I feel like I spend too much time in my head to be analyzing the world around me for inefficiencies. \n\nI never considered myself to be an artist simply because I did not find myself partaking in things like painting or drawing, but I certainly do have a fiery passion for music and have been also drawn to creative writing for years, having written a number of short stories and plays.\n\nI hope that these details will be of use to someone who can provide further opinion on what my type may be. It would be sincerely appreciated.
5	A lot of things you mentionned were related to INFJs, but slightly more to the other types. From what personnalities you tested, atleast it seems obvious you have introversion and intuition somewhere in the functions. The differences are mainly preferences for feeling over thinking and  judging over percieving. The way you write and some things you say you do make me think you're more towards *INTJ*, but to check, answer these questions:  \n- Do you consider yourself introverted but become magically extroverted at times?  \n- Do you pick-up on people's emotions/feelings? ie: you feel someone is mad/sad about something despite them not actively giving signs of it.  \n- Do you pick-up when people are bored, ie, of what you're talking about?  \n- What are you're planning habits? A lot, few, long term, short term, ...  \nAnswer these and I could help you.  \n  \nThe main things that make me think you are an INFJ is the fact you were considered more mature and that you're a good writer, howerver, you mentionned things I would not associate with INFJs. Despite those things are common to most people, the fact you mentionned these over other stuff is why I'm considering them. These are: dwelling on the past, going (rarely) to social gatherings and other stuff related to external interactions. Not that they are absent in INFJs, but rather because you mentionned them over other things.\n\nHope this helps. Btw, these "10 signs you're an ..." have, first off, weird clickbaity names because they are, not at the expense of quality, but because the writers actually need more clicks. Second, it is normal some "facts" repeat themselves as though personnalities are all different, thay do have resembling points. This is most common for introversion. Lastly, you don't need to "listen" to the test closely, it more or less gives you possibilities over which personnality you may have. Read about them and *THE* one you relate most to is likely the correct one.
2	Though those dichotomies are very close in letters they denote different cognitive stacks.\n\nWhat puts you in flow? What activities give you energy rather than using it? What will you do feeling like time has no consequence and will only stop doing as outside or bodily function concerns arise? Introspecting and teasing out how your and other minds work (Ni), analyzing possible future outcomes (Ni) or reflecting on what something means to you (Fi)? Does this or that feel right for you, resonate with you (Fi)? \n\nIn times of stress and to defend yourself do you you nit pick details and factual facets of an issue, objective truth with a capital T (Ti), or what it means to you and its resonance with you (Fi)?\n\nAre you more hesitant to discover and learn about how the world works (Ne) or how other people, their social and emotional ties to each other and you work (Fe)? Which of these two aspects do you more greatly deride your personal skill in?\n\nWhich is more an aspiration for you; to be present in your body moment to moment like in exercise, meditation or driving a car (Se) or finding the most efficient way to execute a given task (Te)?\n\nAre you more hesitant to continuously look people in the eyes placing your full attention on them (Fe) or find the most efficient way to execute a given task (Te)?\n\nWe enter flow with our primary function (1st), avoid our auxiliary function (2nd), defend ourselves with our tertiary function (3rd) and aspire to our inferior function (4th).\n\nI didn't look anyone but intimates in the eyes for years, I now know when I look into someone's eyes fully I experience their emotional state bodily.
1	To me, you sound quite like an INFP. Very in touch with your own feelings, conscientious towards others but not necessarily concerned by them, easy going and well-liked. \n\nYour point about seeing all sides of a debate, this is why INFPs are often called 'mediators'. INFJs tend to be more single minded. We can understand other perspectives, but we're not generally known to sit on the fence. \n\nI'm marrying an INFP and your description definitely sounds more like him than it does me. Hopefully this helps. 
1	I do think you more of an INFP from your post. Unfortunately I can't give you a proper list, but my closest friends are INFP and INFJ. And INTJ, which I definitely don't think you are. Logic, honestly in my opinion, I don't think it's related to T/F of your personality. And T is definitely not related to mathematics or debating. It's more of a matter of priorities. What do you prioritise and how much of it is related to your affections and longings for someone or something? The main reason I see you as an INFP is your focus on your relationship with ideas/music/external forces. "What is my relationship with the lyrics in this song?" "What makes me, me?" Whereas INFJs like to focus more on other people. How to help others, or how to understand others, with other people's ideas. In some sort of "How did their actions and thoughts affect me?" sort of way.\n\nINFPs and INFJs are equally amazing. I have dated many people of different mbti, but my serious relationships were ONLY with INFPs coincidentally and one INFJ. But in the end I am getting married with that INFJ :) you are definitely very different to my INFJ, but he would love to be as expressive as you haha..It's great to be INFP! I always felt that INFPs are a little more interesting and a little funnier and wilder, a little more open sexually. INFJs have a little more mystery in them and they don't analyse or express their feelings as well as INFPs do. I am an ENFP/ENTP so yeah, both of these work great. 
2	How I think we can be better at recognising Te-trickster	**DISCLAIMER: the point of this post is an Ni exercise for me and you** üòÖ feel free to share what's on your mind!! Let's debate! (Scepticism is key!)\n\nSpeaking from personal experience, a quick and easy tip for you to learn how to speak English better! (I am not a native speaker myself) listen to podcasts ALL THE TIME. I repeat, At any chance you get, play some background noise of someone talking in coherent English (It does wonders!)\n\nI've heard and maybe you did too, that a stereotype about INFJs is that, *they pick up new languages pretty quickly.*\n\nAs for why, I suppose it has something to do with Te-trickster (on axis with Fi-critic).... still need to think the explanation for it... If anyone has a theory, I would love to discuss this with you! \n\n\n*I believe it has something to do with being "blissfully ignorant of your own feelings(Fi)/other people's thoughts(Te)"*\n\nEDIT: A better term for being "blissfully ignorant" (and in line with Ni) is "wilful blindness"\n\nAnd I suppose, "Extraverted Thinking Blindness" or Te-trickster is a good counterpart 
1	I personally attributed this phenomena as an "Anxiety" or feelings of negative nature (The Fi-critic in all of us).\n\nMy "medicine" for this thinking is Satire comedy, close relationships and lots of physical/mental exercises!\n\nHit me with your best examples/arguments!
4	Need help for clarifying my personality type.	Whaddup all, I'd like to apologize for my lengthy "essay"\n\nLately, I've been really drawn to personality types and have taken many tests, them being prominently INFJ and sometimes (kinda rare) INFP.\n\nBut here's the thing: I don't know HOW to believe that I am an INFJ.\n\nFor some dumb reason, I stubbornly won't believe that I am one of the rarest and gifted personality types there is, as I don't believe I am worthy lol, I struggle with self-acceptance as depression and anxiety have plagued my life.\n\nWhile it's great having been classified as an INFJ, I would like to have some clarification and answers to my many questions regarding the differences between INFJs and INFPs, because on the surface they seem so damn similar. Here are some of the reasons why I kinda believe and not believe that I am an INFJ:\n\nStarting off with empathy, I can totally empathize with other people, apparently, those are the 2 traits INFJs and INFPs exhibit powerfully, but here's the thing, after reading many INFJ posts, they can supposedly "feel" emotions of other people, whereas INFPs "mirror" them, does that mean they also feel the emotions but to a lesser extent? When I deal with other peoples traumas, I feel their emotions as if they are my own, which is INFJ, but I feel like I am also kinda mirroring it, which is INFP, so that's one of the confusions. Additionally, when entering a room full of people, I immediately get a vibe of the mood of the room - something that's apparently INFJ, but I am pretty sure other personality types feel that way too.\n\nSecondly, as an introvert, I suddenly get energy spikes and become magically extroverted especially when it comes to meeting new people. Don't know why, I mean it's great while the extroversion lasted, but after a few days and weeks, I get drained and drained until I retreat back to my dorm room and just slump off for a few days, and then become extroverted again, it's like a cycle, a pattern, of having social energy, to have no energy and then back again. Is that INFJ?\n\nI am also organized, from my room down to the music playlists that I listen to when in different moods, is that INFJ?\n\nAnd oh yes, I also like to put other people's needs in front of my own, I always want to make sure they're comfortable and I really care what people think about me, that's why I am sometimes not the biggest fan of debates regarding sensitive topics, now I don't know if that's and INFJ quality or just my social anxiety acting up.\n\nAnd last but not least, my brain, more exactly, how it works, it's weird and paradoxical, although not great, I love science and cool, groundbreaking concepts like black holes, time, the human condition etc. but I am also somewhat creative, I played the violin for 10 years and is very drawn to many types of music as they each convey a different vibe which I can jam to, I also like philosophy due to the many perspectives of people, but I am trash at writing, so it's like a 50/50 usage of the brain.
3	As an INFJ myself, I was also shocked to learn that it was one of the rarest types and felt kinda special, but it isn‚Äôt all its chocked up to be. I knew that I was kinda different but originally thought that I just hadn‚Äôt found a lot of people like me because I‚Äôm introverted and not trying really hard but I couldn‚Äôt be *that* different from other people. Now I know that its going to be extremely hard to find people in my life that can truly connect with me. I feel a lot lonelier knowing that what I am (and what I need) isn‚Äôt common. So try not to think of INFJ as being put on a pedestal, being rare doesn‚Äôt mean much at the end of the day. \n\nReasons why I think you‚Äôre INFJ:\n\n1. You‚Äôre organizing your thoughts. You‚Äôre asking insightful questions. Both huge qualities of INFJ. You just need to work on being more self reflective without bias. \n\n2. This is another area that you might need to work on before you know for sure. If you think you can tell the emotions of others really well then you‚Äôre likely an INFJ. INFPs tend to do better at sensing their own emotions. INFJs tend to not really know what emotion is ours or the other persons. It takes a lot of self reflection before you‚Äôre able to even notice it at all and then try to separate yourself from someone else‚Äôs feelings. \n\n3. That is very classic of most introverted types. You mentioned being being magically extroverted which is also very INFJ. \n\n4. Being paradoxical is very much INFJ. I find that even my thought process is paradoxical, both organized and chaotic at the same time. \n\nTry not to think about it too hard. Ironically getting to far into our own heads is a common thing for us, but it is possible to see more clearly if you work on it. What I‚Äôd suggest if you are still having difficulties relating to a personality type is just read through the stories and other examples of behaviour and see what you relate to. Try to study yourself if you can‚Äôt quite tell atm. But remember that everyone is there own person and the MBTI isn‚Äôt the end all be all. If you think you identify as INFJ but have INFP or even ENFJ tendencies that‚Äôs completely fine we‚Äôre people after all its not always possible to put us in a perfect category.
1	Thank you for asking these questions. I relate to all your points. I consider myself INFJ, but I was also a bit unsure. Mostly because why would I of all people be this unique personality type? (just like you)\n\nYour points and the other comment here helped me get some perspective because I still wasn't completely sure. So thank you. 
1	>they can supposedly "feel" emotions of other people, whereas INFPs "mirror" them, does that mean they also feel the emotions but to a lesser extent? \n\nThis one is wrong, infp feel someone emotions way deeper than infj but they know its someone else emotions affecting them while infj dont have idea why he/she feel that it blends with his/her own feelings that's why it's called mirroring vs absorbing. Still from your post it's 50/50 if u exclude bullshit repeated by people reading 16personality.com. Look at functions/facets/socionics and see if it's compatible for you, if 3 show same result you just have proof for yourself.  \nFor me easiest to distinguish between those is asking yourself question can u be bad guy in some kind of scenario.
