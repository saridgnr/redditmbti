371	Your ISTP Care And Handling User Guide And Manual	##**Your ISTP Care And Handling User Guide And Manual**\n*****\n\n**Congratulations! You have found yourself in possession of your own unique ISTP unit. Or rather, it has found its current situation agreeable for the time being. Since ISTPs are notoriously difficult to understand, we have issued this guide to help you along the way.**\n\n###**Getting Started**\n*****\nYour ISTP unit should arrive pre-activated and ready to solve problems. In case your ISTP has not been activated please complete the following:\n\n1. Place ISTP in a quiet setting.\n\n2. Point out 1-3 problems or things you do not understand. \n\n3. Wait 30 seconds.\n\n4. If after 30 seconds your ISTP unit has not activated, asking your ISTP to “Open up more emotionally” will immediately activate Flight Mode (though this is not recommended).\n \n\n###**Care and Maintenance:**\n*****\n1. Your ISTP unit does not require any direct care, supervision or maintenance, and will be happiest left to its own devices. \n2. Efforts to assist your ISTP will be met with annoyance and could possibly void your warranty.\n3. If you give your ISTP rules to follow, you should take care to explain why they are in place. You should also expect that if they are inane rules, they will not be followed.\n\n###**Interpreting Your ISTP**\n*****\nAt some point you may say to yourself, “I wonder what my ISTP is thinking?” Here is a short guide on how to interpret your unit’s words and actions.\n\n>**[Silence]**\n\nYour unit is likely thinking through a problem, contemplating its surroundings, or is thinking about nothing at all. Do not worry, this is normal.\n\n>**“I’m fine.”**\n\nYour unit is fine. Do not worry, this is normal.\n\n>**“I need some time alone.”**\n\nGive your unit time to recharge. If you recently subjected your ISTP to an intense or prolonged period of social interaction, this should be expected. However, frequent abuse of your ISTP’s limited social engagement function is not recommended and can void the warranty.\n\n>**[Shared experience]**\n\nThis is as close to your ISTP as you will likely get. Willingly participating in an activity together is one of your ISTP’s primary methods of communicating fondness.\n\n###**Software**\n*****\nYour ISTP comes pre-programmed with the following abilities/traits:\n\n+ Remains calm in urgent and stressful situations.\n\n+ Reliably grounded, realistic, and pragmatic.\n\n+ Ability to be a “Fly on the wall”\n\n+ +10 Tinkering Skills\n\n+ +10 Logic\n\n+ +10 Feelings Resistance\n\n \n\n###**Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n>*Does my ISTP actually like me? It’s getting hard to tell and it won’t respond when I try talking to it.*\n\nProbably, especially if your unit willingly chooses to spend time around you. Try not to talk so much.\n\n>*Help! I think my ISTP is broken!*\n\nYour ISTP is not broken. Due to its natural ability to overanalyze and rationalize (sometimes to an unhealthy degree), your unit may be stuck in its “WTF Years”. Give it time to grow, and offer encouragement when needed.\n\n>*Can I keep it?*\n\nUnfortunately that depends on the model. If your ISTP goes missing for an extended period of time it is possible that you have accidentally activated your ISTP’s aversion to commitment. However, with some models this feature has been omitted, in which case you might be able to keep your unit for the entirety of its expected lifespan.\n\n**Congratulations on your new ISTP unit and we wish you many years of interesting experiences!**\n\n*****\n*****\n(This post was heavily inspired by [this](http://thoughtcatalog.com/sarah-brady-wagner/2016/05/your-enfp-care-and-handling-user-guide-and-manual/) guide to ENFPs. I thought it was amusing, but a little too long. Mine is shorter and obviously specific to ISTPs. Hope you enjoyed it!)
99	Beautiful. Can we sticky this and just refer relationship threads here?
33	This here is a high quality post! Humorously written with a lot of actual good advice. Mark this ISTP approved!
20	Okay. Time to shut down any and all MBTI related threads. This one is the hands down winner!
13	this should be given to out to our SOs -_-
13	Well played! Commended.
11	Thank you for this! From an INFJ who thinks her ISTP is not really fine when he says "I'm fine". 
11	I want to send this to my co-workers.
11	Oh, ok. That would have been nice to know before I broke mine. 
11	this is fantastic
9	I found this excellent enough to say that it is excellent. 
10	Give the ISTP tools, but be wary as a juvenile ISTP unit may disassemble devices (like a tv remote) and not know how to reassemble.
7	hehe.  I really liked this.  good job.
6	(tear forming). you get me.
6	Late to the party ofc but jesus this is the most helpful shit i've ever read to understanding this girl lol. INFP here but so glad to see that it's not that she doesnt like me (or maybe it is) it's just how she shows fondness. *mind blown* now i know to stfu and enjoy this shit
6	Phenomenal
5	lmao love this
5	Fucking A man, thanks for the laugh.
2	Spot on
4	I laughed at every characteristic you laid out.  It's like you know me better than I do.
4	I laffed\n\nwhy can't our sticky be this funny? :(
4	INFJ here who has spent most of the last decade in a whirlwind relationship with an ISTP. You NAILED it. Sometimes it's easy to forget some of these things about him. Awareness of these behaviors/tendencies & a solid understanding of their innateness is key to keeping your ISTP long-term. 
3	Thanks for the read, quite enjoyed it. 
3	Bravo!
3	Yes! this is too accurate. Great work.
3	So true!
3	This made my day as an ISTP. Best thing I've read all week :)
3	this is hilariously on point! love it!!
3	How long is an extended period of time?
3	Wish I had seen this sooner. If my ex had it maybe we'd still be in a relationship. \n\nI may just print some of these out to give to new people I meet. 
3	This would have saved me SO much grief over the past 2 years.
2	By far the greatest post I have ever seen on this sub 
2	I really enjoyed this, thank you.
2	Really wish I had access to this guide several years ago! I took my ISTP apart trying to 'figure the unit out'. I don't think it ever got put back together quite right. Whoops...
1	Damn... I wish there was one of these for /r/ISTJ
-3	Still too long
-4	Yo, can we get stuff like this for some of the other, superior MBTI types?
11	Best/ Quickest way to Shattered your heart	Whether it be a friendship or romantic what it the best/quickest way to shatter your heart\n.\n(For romantic exclude "I've been cheating on you") 
20	Reveal to me somehow that they've judged me incorrectly and have made negatively impactful decisions about our relationship based on these incorrect assumptions about my character. \n\n  As a close friend or SO, them not giving me the benefit of the doubt in the situation is just not something I can easily move on from. If situations were reversed, I would feel like assuming the worst in them would be like a betrayal of trust in them as a person and in the way I think of them.
9	Being ignored, or acting excited around other people but not me, I hate that shit
8	Tell me there's absolutely no purpose to something I've been busting my ass on for an extended period of time, or that I personally haven't accomplished anything. Wanna see me in a full-on depressive slump? That's how ya do it 
7	"Shatter my heart" would be too dramatic. The closest thing to heart shattering was at my wedding when my bridesmaids, my closest friends since high school, showed up late and spent forever getting ready in the dressing room while I was greeting incoming guests. I went upstairs once and texted them twice to come down as soon as they were ready. Any one of them would do. They all came to the wedding hall together when the ceremony was about to start and there was literally nothing left to do. Fortunately, my colleagues jumped in when I was running around like crazy ushering the guests to their seats. I've never been so grateful.\n\nI spent 1-2 days after my wedding asking a few friends around about what happened in that dressing room. I tried to convince myself that they were trying their best to be quick despite arriving so late but every single thing I found pointed the other way. When I accepted it, something inside of me died then. I spent hours crying and then felt nothing towards them at all. No anger, no hatred, no sadness. Nothing. Like you don't give a second thought about strangers you pass on the street and you simply don't care what they do with their lives because it has nothing to do with you. That kind of feeling. \n\nSorry for a long post. I guess my answer is betrayal of trust. As an ISTP, I like doing things myself and I rarely ask people to do stuff for me. When I do ask, it means a lot to me and if you say yes, please keep your word. Or do it the other way round if that's what you aim for. 
7	I never understand when people use 'heart' like that(follow your heard, heart break etc) . I dont have that feeling. 
2	I'm pretty stable, and I doubt there's some magic key to "shatter \[my\] heart." However, if you want to piss me off, calling me an idiot is a great formula. 
2	Oh, I just *hate* it when my friends cheat on me. Lol. \n\nProbably by dying?  That usually does the trick...
1	Betrayal of trust, or, if you're someone whose opinion I value highly, lead me on and let me think I'm really good at something, encourage the thought that I'm good at it, and then later on tell me that you think I suck at it and you only let me believe that I didnt. Super stupid backstory, I was sick a fair amount as a kid (think under 12 years old) so I was in the ER off and on. To help pass the time my mom and I would ALWAYS play I Spy. I would go out of my way to find the tiniest, most annoying speck of dirt or paint on the wall, or the tiniest feature in the room, and make that what she had to find, and she usually lost, and would give up in frustration. A little over 10 years later she tells me, after I suggested we play during one of her appointments, that she was only letting me win and that I really wasn't that good at it. That one stung quite a bit. Please don't do that to people, lol.
4	What are cute things your SO does for you? Cute things you would like them to do for you but don't?	If you're single, imagine being in a relationship with someone, then think about these (lol).
4	I like the little thoughtful things, things that would go unnoticed by anyone else but make it seem like the Universe is trying to hint that it cares about you.\n\nLike you open the fridge, thinking “Shit, I wish I’d gotten some-” and there that something is, as if by magic. And you know the magic came from someone thinking about you.\n\nOr when you are the one spinning magic and your SO notices the Universe trying to hint it cares about them. I love that.
7	Do you guys have a difficult time analyzing a person sometimes especially if your talking or dating them and there’s problems ?	
12	Do you guys think using Fe ever gets in the way of you focusing on a task or using Ti Se ?	
11	In what sense? A day to day Fe or an Fe build up due to something you’re avoiding?\n\nA day to day example:\nI am a metallurgist (process, product, and quality engineer) for nickel superalloys. When something goes wrong, that’s 10s of thousands of dollars lost on a good day... 100s on a bad.  When I do my investigations, I find information that could get someone fired. Someone I know, someone I may talk to every day...\n\nDoes not stop me from doing my analysis. Now it may influence on how I handle the corrective action. I don’t fire people if I don’t absolutely have to. I try to find a corrective action that will fix the situation. But, there is still some influence, as I’ve given people second chances that no one else would have in my hierarchy. \n\nAn event example:\nDoing same job. In the middle of data analysis. Recently found out my mom has a debilitating disease that will leave her more disabled the longer she lives with it. Tried to just focus on work. Found myself talking to myself and having to take deep breaths, and eventually just staring at a screen. \n\nSo only severe events will distract me. Typically because I am trying to think my way through the feelings and how to handle that situation, which detracts from my normal processing power. 
3	No I didn’t mean like that but thanks for your examples, I meant more like worrying about how i come off to people when communicating with them while working, and trying not to be to cold and it gets in the way of me being able to focus. Like that like in your field someone asking you saying something causal to you and you try to use Fe to respond like eye contact smile would it throw you off at all ?
3	I think I try to "use Fe" sometimes to sugarcoat what I'm saying so it doesn't upset people. But it fucks up what I was trying to say, so I stopped doing it as much.
4	I doubt you are ISTP if Fe gets in the way of Ti. If you were ISTP, you should theoretically have the opposite problem 
2	favorite movie or tv show?	i like that 70s show
1	Once upon a time in the west.
1	I really love burn notice, and GoT of course
1	Some of my favorite movies are Big Lebowski, Pulp Fiction, Star Wars, Office Space.
1	movie: star wars\n\ntv show: brooklyn nine nine
1	Blade runner
1	Currently watching the magicians and penny dreadful on netflix
1	Movie: perfume:story of a murderer, arrival, lotr, Alita:battle angel\n\nTV: GoT, Rome, Westworld\n\nAnime:FMA:Brotherhood, hunter x hunter, silent voice, paprika
17	Do you lie?	Is honesty a istp thing or just me? I find that I never really lie as I don't see a reason to. For example if something goes wrong and someone tries to blame me or put something on me. I know I followed exactly what I'm supposed to be doing correctly so I know I won't get in trouble for telling the truth. Another example when it comes to talking to people I won't lie about myself or about something that happened because it wouldn't satisfy me if I persuaded someone on a lie. Even in situations where I did do something wrong I won't lie because what's the point if I already did it? I would say yeah I did it and if there's consequences then oh well I'll get past them.
17	Outright lie? No reason to really. I will embellish a bit sometimes though.
18	I don't think I've ever been in a situation where I've felt lying is necessary. I've withheld the truth before (not telling someone about something that was meant to be a surprise) but for the most part I've never really seen the point in lying.
13	To dick around and be playful around people yeah. But otherwise, i’ve been known to be brutally honest.
5	Honestly, I lie SOMETIMES but it's usually only to serve some short term, non permanent goal. I can't think of a time I've lied about something relatively important. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMeaning, I don't lie at work. I've lied at home though like,\n\n&#x200B;\n\n "Hay Jayb151, did you do the laundry yet?" \n\n&#x200B;\n\n"Ah yea babe, It's been done for hours." \**frantically folding laundry before wife comes home from work*\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut yea, in reality, I find it too much work to lie. You find yourself living in some web of deception that will fold in on itself eventually.
4	Only to get out of things I don't really want to do without saying "I don't want to go". Instead it's "I have to help my dad" or I'll say I'm on-call for work.
3	I lied a lot to my parents growing up because they're close-minded and were very controlling... but now that they're out of my life, I no longer lie. I'm not ashamed of the things I do anymore 
3	For me at least, lying just seems like a waste of time. Why would I spend extra time and energy to make up a whole new story when I can just tell you the truth? 
2	Nope, i can avoid the truth if it is something that i shouldn't say, but if i get asked directly I will give a short and precise answer.\n\nAnd then die.
2	Not really lie so much as, not elaborate all the details. 
2	I think that anyone who says they don't lie is lying to you.  
2	I know stuff...you just have to ask the right questions to get it out.\n\nIf i don't feel like you should know about something, i'll just say that "i don't know...(if you should know about this)"
2	Deception is an ugly tool, only good to use on someone who is hostile. 
1	I was going to say "yes, all the time" but actually I agree with what you wrote. I only really lie for joking around (which is a lot), or if I have to (white lies etc) 
1	Of course, I doubt few if any in the world don't lie on occasion.\n\n Mostly I don't bother, but I'm not morally above it by any means. There are things I could lie about without hesitation, and things I'd never even consider lying about and look down on others for. Basically I don't feel guilty about lying, but I won't lie about something that would fuck anyone else over, or in a way designed to manipulate/deceive anyone into something. 
1	I do lie, but not unnecessarily. Only when I feel the consequence for not doing so will  be too severe, then I do. 
1	I lie alot if it's not hurting others
1	I lie as part of experiments, never to just cover my own ass. 
1	Ok.  Today I lied about not having time to see someone- where in fact I just didn't want to find that time to see him. He's a friend who's been wanting more of my time lately( due to his own reasons and having too much time on his hands- and have been having a hard time hearing no)- where I have no spoons left- and I've told him that- that I need to pull back and take care of my business. \nWhile technically it's not a lie- I don't have time im willing to allocate there-or emotional resources to provide companionship/ recreation- if there would be a serious, dire need- I'd find that time. \nAs it stands now- he'll have to find ways to amuse himself without me. And I didn't want to tell him that I don't want his company- not this often-he'd definitely feel hurt( where all im saying- that I don't have the mental energy to provide that for him now)\n\nSo.  I lie to spare people's feelings sometimes.  Maybe it's misguided. 
1	Not always I do on occasion to test my skill or for small things that won't impact anything. I'm also generally transparent but I without a strong relationship with anyone

7	do people think you look Mean?	Just had that experience today. A cashier just flat out asked me, 'Why do you always look mean?' and I was a little surprised. I try to be friendly and polite to people and being mean is my last intention. But my resting face just looks threatening apparently. Anyone else get that reaction?
10	I look like I don't give a shit.
7	Yup...I got the "do not fuck with me" face and attitude. I am also a woman with huge boobs and it confuses people... 
2	Yes. People sometimes ask me why I'm not smiling. I honestly feel great without being smiling all the time, but let's face it, this is not about ourselves but about making others feel more comfortable around you. It's a simple gesture that demands little effort and can radically improve our daily social interactions. At least I do notice that people tend to talk more to me and be more friendly if I'm packing a smile.\nFurthermore, it's scientifically proven that forcing a smile does actually influence your mood for the better.
2	My grandfather always tells me-- only me-- to smile, so I'd guess so. 
1	Yes! Someone help me fix my face!
1	yeah, i like it though. i don't really look mad but have a very neutral expression most of the time, nobody ever knows what i'm thinking/feeling unless i tell them or have a real emotional reaction. i can't force myself to smile so idk what else i would do anyway
1	Yeah, but it's good most times. Ppl don't necessarily bother me 
1	"Bored" "aloof" "devil may care" but not "mean"... except sometimes ppl have said "I thought you didn't like me before I knew you"
8	Is it hard for you guys to do hands on work while having a conversation with someone, without making mistakes ?	
17	Personally, no. Still, please don't come near me when I'm working.
5	Depends. New task or routine work? When I’m at work doing routine shit like oil changes and tire rotations, I have no problem talking to my girl on the phone while she’s on break at her work. That shit is muscle memory by now. But if I’m doing something that requires new effort to figure out, like doing electrical work or engine work, I need to concentrate without distractions. 
7	I can’t even hear you if I am focused, even just reading.  Cannot even reddit and TV at the same time.
4	Yes. I can't work and talk with you at the same time, unless it's some kind of mindless task. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you try talking to me while I'm working, the work will get done, but the conversation is going to suck.
3	Counting, Measuring , Reading, Watching. Just don't come near with all ypur distractions.
3	Hands on for me is usually coding, so yes, very much so. But if I'm working on anything else, no. I end up focusing more on the task than the person, and I miss half the convo anyway. My brain does not respond to human speech very well.
2	I need to be left alone during calculations, like measuring for cabinets or figuring material costs. I can figure anything out, as long as I'm not being pestered or second-guessed.
2	Yep, I was working something at work when my manager started pestering me. For the life of me I couldent fix  what I was working on until he walked away, it was like my mind was just blank.
2	No, Im either completely zoned in or not at all.. Unless it's something stupid easy. I am excellent at blocking out everything around me when working. I once had this child banging a spoon up against a bowl right next to my ear and I didn't notice until someone yelled at the child. 
2	Yes, I often mix up words or trail off when I'm doing something that requires my hands/focus. For example, say I'm trying to tie a flourocarbon leader on to monofilament (a very hard knot to tie btw) I'm not going to able to say anything besides "yep" and "nah" until I'm done.
2	Lmao not sure if this is similar, but in Product design and Manufacturing class. Talking is fine while I'm drilling, sawing or chiseling. But I instantly screw up stuff if I'm measuring 
2	Yes, I'll catch myself at some point zoning out of either the work or the conversation. And I often have to tell people to shut up for a second so I can a thing I can't do while people are talking. \n\nIt's like I can either listen, talk or think. But only one at a time. It was pretty awesome during my depression/wtf years. I used it to get a break from my mind.
1	not really but i still prefer to focus on one or the other
8	How would a ISTP and an INTJs differ with their functions in how they analyze a situation or thing?	
22	My dad is INTJ. He goes from 1, 2, 3,....me as an ISTP goes 5, 32, 7,.... in terms of what order we do certain steps of a project in. He uses some kind of flowchart logic, and I don’t. We’re both medical responders and I’ve seen him delay for a few minutes at a car wreck while he thought out if he should order a helicopter. The decision takes two seconds to make! It drives me nuts. \n\nINTJs think like chess, several moves into the future, making all the decisions at once. I think more like a card game or something where I can’t see all the info- I make a decision based off what I know, and move forward and make the next one when necessary. That way I can take things as they come instead of making a grand plan and having it collapse when something unexpected happens like he does. 
2	I used to be an INTJ while in the military. \n\nRecently I had a discussion with one of my uncles about work, leadership styles etc. We got on the subject of types of leadership and personalities our time in the military and how civilians are way different than service members. One of my cousins decided to take the MB just cause which then peaked my interest so I took the MB because I was curious if I changed in my thought processes since I last took it (3 years previous). \n\nSurprisingly I changed to ISTP.   I tell you what I still fit many functions of the INTJ but it was pretty uncanny reading the characteristics of the ISTP. Obviously I'm not all facets of it but wow much closer to how I am now.\n\nThere is pretty strict protocol in the military and other service jobs that I think while in and used to answering questions and figuring out solutions definitely changes how you answer the questions.\n\n
27	What Were you like as a child?	I remember being very weird and annoying, and it took some time to grow out of it.\n\n\n\n I cant help feeling like i should have been more aware of my surroundings and situations growing up because kids today seem so much more advanced than i.\n\n\n\nMy dad was also an istp i think and he lrt me take things apart like old vcrs and stuff. I was also kind of a loner, but not by choice. My family moved states a couple times and i had two sisters who naturally wanted nothing to do with me growing up lol. \n\n\n\n\nI almost feel like i grew into istp because my fe was starved or something and my ti and se were stimulated.\n
12	I once got into a serious 2 hour long argument with my friend's dad who tried to claim that insects weren't animals, at age 10. Honestly. That should tell you everything it needs to about me.
8	Damn, same. Except, I wasn't a loner by choice, but as a child I used to get bullied by my classmates. 
6	Slightly weird and occasionally very annoying. May be due to the resting bitch face that I had, or the brain-to-mouth filter that I did not have. These days I talk less and smile more… I like having friends and not getting into trouble, lol.  
4	I was extremely curious about everything, well the same is true about now too. And didn't want anyone to command me. My father was trying to make me take karate and boxing classes and I turned it to WW2 and had conflict with him about 10 years. \n\nAbout Fe, yeah the thing is that I never asked myself a quastion "What I really want?". Because the question means that you are not really aware who you are. And that is true, you will never  be completely aware who you are. 
5	I am an ISTP woman and maybe that is why I was never a loner. I liked being alone and did not mind it but I was super social but hated school. Lot of fighting, detentions, in school suspension, etc etc...  
4	I was an annoying child who was bullied in school and by my mother, divorced parents. Grew up more and more quiet and weird and antisocial until i could get out of there and live with my father, i think i grew up with years of Ti-Ni loop lol, fast forward 5 years and now everything is better but damn I was so weird as a kid.
3	I'd often escape the house and steal money from my Mum's wallet to buy lollies like hubba bubba at the shops.  \nPlayed handball with friends and got angry at them a lot when they beat me.  \nLoved playing with toy cars, juggling balls, yo-yo's and collecting yugioh cards.  \nI had no social skills so I compensated by being weird. Was very shy otherwise.  \nI spent time practicing my handwriting before high school because my teachers in primary school told me that it sucked. Ended up being super neat and fancy ready for grade 8.  \nLoved playing soccer even though I had asthma. I ended up being the goalie because I had quick reflexes and long limbs. Took up playing the flute and eventually cured my asthma.  \nI often used to hijack the family computer just so I could play games like Age of Empires, Jazz Jackrabbit, Pharoah, Anno 1503, Neopets, Empire Earth, Worms 2, Blinx: The Timesweeper, Simpsons Hit and Run, Return from Castle Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory,  Crash Bandicoot, Ratchet and Clank, Kingdom Hearts. My parents weren't really engaged in my childhood so I had a lot of freedom to do whatever I wanted. I lived a very hedonistic life which has honestly fucked me up. Pleasure Island is not a good place to live in.  \nAs long as I did chores and ate my vegetables all was good. But I never did. I even hated meat back then. Thought it tasted gross. Used to spit the cud into the toilet or stick food under my seat cushion to make it seem like I'd finished my plate. My Mum always used to tell me "there are starving kids in Africa, so don't waste your food." I think it rubbed off on me because I now never waste food. I pretty much live off others' leftovers. Now, as a chef, I realize how it would be very possible to live off the sheer amount of food we waste. No one should have to starve.  \nEventually my step-Dad got cancer, and his personality changed. He also developed dementia which led to him being narcissistic and violent. I was often hit and chased around the backyard with axes and such. But my Mum was a Christian and always forgave him. My Mum has like no Fi, just like me. So we were just a family of doormats who cared too much about what other people thought about us and so we never stood up for our values.  \nAnyways...
3	Keep in mind I grew up experiencing a lot of trauma. At least 6 years of my very early life (up until I was about ten) was nothing but violence and fear and anger, lots of abuse, ect. That likely influenced things a bit. \n\nI was always super outdoorsy, and also always thinking, always trying to break everytjing down in a way I could understand, always incredibly curious. We lived on a small farm near some woods and I was constantly running around outside, climbing trees, exploring, ect. I would run around barefoot most of the time, even in the woods, because I loved to feel the ground. I read (a LOT), and for the most part was pretty antsy as a kid, diagnosed with adhd at some point, and after being put on meds that helped me settle down and focus. I was incredibly, ridiculously sensitive though. Very empathic. I initially thought I may be an INFJ, it would explain the excessive Fe from my younger days, but after learning about the istp thought process and how their specific functions work together, theres no doubt. Anyways, I also started having panic attacks really young, and became extremely nihilistic at a young age (about 9). My theory is I started developing the lower functions (Ni and Fe) much earlier because of all the crap I grew up around, and things have been steadily balancing out ever since. Overall I was a major tomboy, we didn't have a ton of money so I couldn't do the sports I wanted to, but I was almost always outdoors. when we finally left the bad situations and moved into a small town with less interesting outside space, I stayed indoors a lot more, and after some bad medical advice, stopped almost all physical activity except what was necessary to get around.
2	I would put together every appliance my mom bought from as early as I can remember.  I was outgoing super early on but pretty quiet once I started school. Didn't have many friends until I showed I could excel at sports and then I was pretty much accepted. That was around 3rd/4th grade. Also I was bigger than most kids so I was never bullied. I would always look up statistics about demographics in the U.S. and crime rates once I got a computer. I made most of my friends through sports but only had a few close ones. My first girlfriend was an ISFJ and also a bit of a cunt but she gave great blowjobs. 
2	I grew up in a house where its extension was a large car/truck shop and it's situated in the middle of  a large ricefield. There was no other child the neighborhood, so I didn't have playmates except those guys (and my uncle) working at the shop. \n\nMy father is a farmer. An ISTJ. So I got my realist sense of the world from him, only he's very meticulous and routine-oriented. Meanwhile, my mom loved to make furniture and house decor. \n\nI'd say I had a pretty hands-on childhood. Only when I got to college, I developed the love for reading and an intuitive way of gathering knowledge.
2	\n\nDamn, well. My parents never had time for me because of work. But they did teach the basics, things like be respectful, don't start shit with people and if someone hits you hit them back every time. My dad also put me in swimming class and told me, hey, get straigh A's and be consistent in swimming and at the end of the school year I'll buy you whatever you want. I always hated school and the kids there, I would get yelled at all the time for day dreaming during class and I would get into a bunch of fights but my parents were well known and respected in town so the school put up with me. And I always got straight A's because of the promise that my dad made. He kept his promise and at the end of year one I got a PlayStation. So from that point forward my free time consisted of playing video games, reading and playing around the property. In secondary school I finally made some friends and I started going to the gym and doing Jiu-Jitsu instead of swimming. And now I go to University and things are pretty much the same, so I guess that I was the same way that I am now, but I just got better at things.
2	Fly on the wall
2	I was pretty mature and responsible child then became shit growing up
2	Stubborn and creative
2	I only talked when I was correcting people and I was only talking to people much older than me. I usually read novels, play games, watch TV, move a lot, or go outside. My schoolmates always said that they were intimidated by me and that I physically fought annoying people that's why I only had few friends. I slacked off in school but I managed to always have above average grades.
2	well you are correct. Your personality is moulded from your childhood.
1	I was smart, weird and probably annoying. I didn't seem to know how to act in social situations- I'd either be super weird and out there, or sit there in silence. I got along with almost everyone, but was not really close to anyone. I had no "friends" but lots of acquaintances. I didn't do sports, which is a classically ISTP thing, but I rode horses, snowboarded, did martial arts and was obsessed with airplanes. School was easy academically, but not so much socially (I was the only immigrant kid in a small rural area). I loved playing outside and exploring, building things. 
1	I got in trouble a lot. Only by women. Never understood why; nothing I did felt wrong or mean. Maybe I acted too much like a boy.\n\nI also never did sports besides archery, though I wanted to play baseball and rock-climb. I didn't have the parents for it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
1	legendary
7	What video game genres are you guys drawn to?	And are you drawn to flight or flight games ?
17	1st person shooter.   
14	open world rpg, stealth/assasin, fantasy\n\nmostly games you can take your time, kill some monters or humans, and explore. darker stories gets plus points\n\nfew example tittels: soulsborne, witcher, dishonored, divinity original sin 2, minecraft, terraria\n\ni loathe playing online if i don't have group of friends to play with
18	I like games with lots of customization features and story driven narratives and I hate multi-player focused games. 
8	things with sandbox modes like ARMA where i can build whatever i want, 1st person shooters, and strategy games like company of hero's and men of war, and games like Rimworld.  \n\n\nI STRONGLY DISLIKE TURN AND CARD BASED GAMES
7	RPGs, fps, strategy, fighting games, etc.
6	ksp, factorio, rainbow6siege, pubg, apex, skyrim, rocket league, flight sim, ace combat, civ, total war, Battlefield 4.\n\n'\n\nI would like to get into more of the new platforms but haven't bothered to look into it.  No MMO's for me.  I just hate that style of game.\n\n'\n\nNon video game games I like would be things like chess.  I also have been fooling around with a rubiks cube.\n\n'\n\nI enjoy pool, bowling, and darts as well.
4	Sandbox games (Rimworld, KSP), and games with an interesting open world (e.g. HZD).
4	I used to play a lot of first person shooters. I spend most of my "gaming" time on flight sims now though. 
3	I like FPS, RPG, and track oriented racing games. \n\n\nCall of duty and Super Hot are the two FPS games I play. For RPG, I like things like dark souls, darksiders, Dante’s inferno. And for the racing, assetto corsa and Forza Motorsport. \n\n\nForza Motorsport is by far my most played game though. 
3	Singleplayer story-driven games/RPGs, and base building/city building games primarily 
3	Old school platformers on SNES and Portal 2. \n\nAlso games with good storylines like Uncharted series, Last of Us, God of War.\n\nI dislike sandbox games and FPS.
3	racing
3	Mostly shooters, but lately I've gotten into racing. Im also not much of a single-player guy. Pretty much every game I play has online multiplayer. I like the competition.
2	Overwatch, Madden, Uncharted to name a few 
2	JRPG, Platformer (including Metroidvania), Horror, Visual Novel, Hack & Slash, some Danmaku, Action and Adventure.
2	Literally don't care about games at all. I get bored so fast, no games last longer than a few days with me. In my free time I want to relax (= watch tv shows / movies and not move a muscle) and not have to be all focused and concentrated on the game. 
2	I tend towards sports games or casual games like Super Meat Boy.  I'm super excited about the CTR remake coming out. I also play a lot of Fortnite as it's been a good way for my friends and me to hang out.\n\nI've recently started working through all of the AC games and it's my first time actually playing something that has a story to it.
2	Missile Command 
2	Lots of different games, mainly games with high replay ability, so competitive twitch shooters, milsim games, minecraft, Mobas are fun too some times. 
2	I play MOBA
2	None.  I'd rather be out experiencing the world, riding motorcycles, jumping from planes, skiing big mountains.
2	Futuristic fps like Halo, arcade racers, RTS, and rpgs
2	Only competitive games 
2	FPS, RPG, 3rd person adventure games, rogue likes, some turn based strategy.
2	Sandboxes (GMod, Manyland, etc.), twitch-based games (osu!, used to play Geometry Dash for quite a while), simulators sometimes (Hacknet is my favorite among them), rarely RPGs, mildly dislike first-person shooters.
2	1st person shootings games and rythm games
2	Open world RPGs. Sims, BoTW, Skyrim, STARDEW Valley. FPSs give me panic attacks, and some RPGs make great movies but I don't see the point of "playing" them (I'm looking at you final fantasy). 
2	Dark Souls and Bloodborne, nothing else can tickle my pickles
2	Ya'll need to check out a game called "They are billions"
2	RPGs, turn based strategy, sandbox
2	Racing/Sandbox. Beamng.Drive is a favourite.
1	I love flying in AER. And AION.
43	Is lack of motivation an ISTP thing?	I only get motivated by knowing that I'll enjoy doing something. Promises of getting something out of it in the future almost never work. 
32	Can’t speak for others, but this is definitely true of myself as well. 
31	Yes, totally an ISTP thing.  ISTPs are driven by passion and interest, not so much by a sense of duty.\n\nMy wife is an INTJ and she has the ability to do boring work because it is important.  I quite envy that.
10	I’m pretty sure this is an everybody thing 
8	Same with me... i preffer something that gives me inmediate pleasure (like playing videogames, watching a movie, eating pizza) over things that may bring me some benefit on the future (Studiying, do exercise....), but in my case i'm not sure if it's because i'm ISTP or 'cause i'm depressed.
8	One thing for sure, we don't have to feel motivated about everything. Life is trade-off most of the time, and we have to choose our battles.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease just try doing the thing you consider important at least once, and then you can reevaluate your feeling about it later. Humans are not that good at affective forecasting (predicting how you would really feel in some distant situation). You can feel totally differently -- e.g. enjoying it -- when embarking the thing you "know" you won't enjoy doing. \n\nFor example, i wasn't all enthusiastic about office outing and feeling that watching a film might serve my mood better. But, i forced myself to go because i don't want to have a bad rep of not even trying to have some more connection with my colleagues. You know what, i had a BLAST :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome plausible explanation of why we are bad at affective forecasting is because we don't consider all possible things that can work in favor of the opposite of the feeling we forecasted. This could also explain why you should force depressed people to get outside. They'd probably say that going out won't improve their mood. But, you might have read about sunlight improving serotonin level and hence mood. Staying in gives them longer time to ruminate that will make them even more depressed. They might fail to consider this factor even if you try to convince them. So you need to force them and just let them reevaluate their feeling and view about the activity later.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you don't mind another example, i was convinced of the benefit of running (of exercise in general) -- great health, feel energized, plus the natural BDNF. Oh man, i was feeling real struggle when building a habit of running. Started with just get up in the morning and walk little distance. Then walk longer distance. Then started running short distance. By the time i got to that level i gave my self moral license of not going further with my goal. I'm doing better than average people was my excuse. Every second is a torture. But, i just gave the longer run a try. Over time i find it not as difficult or tiring as what i was imagining. When you've gone that far usually your body adjusts and bad thing you imagined doesn't happen. Seeing many people also walk/run helps fulfill my teeny social need. Running even improves other aspect of my life (e.g. help with sleep better, concentration, mood). Some things cannot convince us unless we experience it firsthand (add to that the stubbornness of being an istp). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMotivation is also overrated. It's not sustainable if you want to achieve something of value which usually requires putting in effort/time. Creating a system (or a cue or trigger) that will help you at least get started with doing the thing without some mental agony/effort is worth to try. And you can slowly increase the intensity of the effort over time. Good habit system beats once-in-a-while achieved goals in the long run. If you already started with the habit, maybe you can celebrate or review why you do that in the first place (some sort of value affirmation) regularly to help you keep going strong.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOmg, i don't think i can write this long. Hopefully, it's helpful. Good luck with your life :)
2	Meet too thanks
2	I can confirm this everyday
1	If this is it -because its- Do I have chance of changing any of it?
1	FWIW, there are "Starter" types and there are "Finisher" types.\n\nISTJ, ISTP, INTJ, INFJ are Finishers.\n\nAs an INTJ, I can be a terrible procrastinator..\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnce I start something though...get on board, or gtfo of the way.
1	Guess I'm in the minority here, but I'm an ISTP and having unfinished business *is* a motivation to me. Even if it's not something I want to do or enjoy doing, if it needs to be done and I'm the one that needs to do it, it'll drive me crazy until I get it done and then I can relax.
1	If I don't know what I want, have no goal- I lack motivation.  Otherwise- im pretty determined. 
9	Just finished a cognitive function test with my results showing a high Si usage. Why would an Istp use Si?	
12	Those dumb websites track behavior rather than functions. You Se makes you high on Si as well because many behaviors seemingly Si is just Se or Ni manifested
3	ISTJs have dominant Si. Maybe you're mistyped? 
3	There's a good reason why MBTI uses letters. Generally, if you are dominant in one function, you will be strong in its opposite attitude. It is something Carl Jung talked about in Psychological Types. This is because they are the same function type, just concerned with different worlds. In this case the sensing aspect remains between Se and Si, so they are not in much conflict, whereas Ne and Ni are both repressed by Se.
3	Maybe you're ESTP? \n\nYour function strengths seem to go S - T - Fe - Ni\n\nSi is strong probably because you're confused what counts as Se or Si on the test, but also maybe because of **shadow functions**. I can't say about ESTPs, but ISTPs and ISFPs I know are actually really good at using Si. They have great memories, can be super organised and good with routines. They might not be good at listening to what their body is telling them (ie slow down), but they can use it well to achieve their goals. 
2	Inaccurate. Focused on action, but doesnt take into account more complex notions/thoughts/behaviors.. A lot of these questions are confusjng/needs specificity.\n\nEx. "Compassionately take on others needs as your own." Well it depends who it is, what it is for, why. Or maybe they are just so inept I need to fix the problem so I can stop thinking about it. Doesnt have so much to do with my dying need to help. \n\nMy interpretation of Fe/Fi questions always trips me up. I often get intj if the quiz is poorly worded. Sensory questions too. They are written as if a Se dom is head in the clouds taking in stimuli at a max level all the time. Ergo my responses seem less se. Note I too got dom si. \n\nistp ti se ni fe.   \n\nintj ni te fi se\n\nse 24.5.   \nsi 33.3\n\nne 26.5.   \nni 42.5\n\nte 25.4.   \nti 39.5\n\nfe 13.4.   \nfi 35.5\n\n
2	Read up on the "demonstrative function" in socionics. This is Si for the ISTP. This function is about as strong as the dominant, and constantly expressed, albeit subconsciously.
1	Take the Drlabs test on cognitive functions. I find it more comprehensive. 
12	What do ISTPs think of the other ST types?	I do notice that you guys hate ESTJs a lot, lol.
38	I don't think of them...
5	Everyone in my family is ESTJ I don’t apply MBTI over people I love them but we don’t really have common interests so we rarely talk to each other. About other ISTPs idk nothing I’ve never met one hehe 
6	I like my ISTJ SO! 
6	I click well with other STPs.. both kinds. I'm married to an ISTJ, and he was my best friend 10 years before that. As for ESTJs.. to be honest, I'm not completely sure. I know someone else who I suspect is an ESTJ, and she irks me greatly. But I obviously can't base my entire opinion of ESTJs off of one unconfirmed ESTJ. I have a feeling though that this is going to be less about MBTI type though, and more about maturity of the type. 
5	ISTJs are alright. They appreciate our introverted nature and I get along with most, but they're a bit basic and place too much stock in norms.\n\nWith ESTJs it's like there's always a power struggle. They like to boss people around. We usually exchange valuable information between each other, but I will rebel the second you start barking orders.\n\nI like ESTPs, they're fun to be around but whenever we hang out it feels like we're going to end up in jail.
3	My Dad is an ISTJ and we just never see eye to eye. His Si means he always brings up the past and he has very little Fe to know that this is socially inappropriate so he never learns.
2	My ISTJ dad i get along with but ESTJs are insane to me
2	ESTPs are crazy but fun
1	ESTP - dumb\nESTJ - cool but assholes\nISTJ - fucking awesome
1	What's wrong with ESTJs? My bro is ESTJ and while there's no having deep conversation he's definitely fun to be around. And inspiring as he gets shit done. 
1	we hate everyone
1	My ESTP father would be an ESTJ except he's not controlling. But he's responsible and calm.\n\nHe's not bad, though while I believe I'm the most like him among my siblings, we're not very close.\n\nI don't really think about the other types.
8	How do we find other peoples personality type?	Do we like ask them to take the test or there is like any other way
17	Observe.
6	Learn the characteristics of the cognitive functions, and how they change in different positions within the cognitive stack. Once you've got that down, watch their behavior and listen to what they say. 
3	The test is extremely inaccurate. If you want to know someone's type (or your own), you need to learn typing or know someone who knows how to type. There are different systems but C.S Joseph's system is the one I use and I think it's great. 
1	I've found if you wait long enough they will either do it themselves and announce it or their employer will make them do it, which they will subsequently announce.
5	Which MBTI types would you say are the most serious and non playful?	
6	* INTJ (in general, though they do have their goofy side. They only tend to show that to close ones, though)\n\n* ISTJ\n\n* ISTP\n\n* INTP\n\n* ENTJ\n\n* ESTJ\n\n* INFJ
7	xSTJ and xNTJ
5	INTJ \n\nSource: have INTJ significant other. 
2	Lmao at these responses. I can be really silly and playful too. It's just that I need to be comfortable.
5	How do you guys handle office politics?	Just wondering?
14	Scorched Earth
9	 Not well.
6	I find a new one. Literally not kidding. I've been out of college 3 years and have had 3 separate jobs. Everyone leave me alone. 
5	I handle workplace politics the same way I handle all other politics: stay the fuck out and don't pick sides.
6	I try not to talk to people. This works fairly well.
4	I don’t.\n\n/thread
1	Conflict is hard, I deal with it every day.  I have tapped into my desire to understand things and ask lots of questions.  I often play the “help me understand “ card.
1	As in discussing politics in the office? If so, I’ve been lucky to end up in a job where all my coworkers/bosses are pretty much on the same page. We don’t have identical views, but we all agree on major ideologies. Most of us here are level headed people that can back up our opinions. So even on things we disagree with, there’s never strife over it. 
1	I mostly just STFU and do my work during work hours without worrying about everybody else and their business.  I participate in the occasional happy hour or potluck so I don't seem like a weirdo and if its the bosses birthday I throw in $5.    
1	It can be entertaining, but I'm unable to participate in OP or drama
1	I'll listen but not interact
42	Anybody else quiet unless with significant other?	Is anybody else relatively quiet and keeps to themselves, letting others do the talking in conversation, but when with your significant other it's like a 180 and you don't let them talk?
49	I mean, it’s like this with anybody I’m super comfortable around, not just an SO. Watch me talk to my best friend and you’d think I was a 12 year old school girl. Then see me in public and I’m like a stoic 40 year old man who only speaks when he has something important to say. 
5	Yep
5	No. I never shut up at work, I’m always making funny comments or joking around with my coworkers over the cubicle walls. Same when I’m with friends. With people I don’t know very well, I’m either really quiet or quite talkative depending on if I want to form a friendship with them. Lots of people mistakenly assume I’m an extrovert.
9	I talk to an ENFP like crazy, we legit act like two 6 year olds. With anybody else though i'm pretty tight. 
3	It's not a complete 180 like you mention but if I'm around people I don't know or only kind of know I feel no obligation to talk whatsoever. However if I'm with close friends I do a lot of talking.
2	what's a significant other
1	Definitely. 
1	Yes
1	Yupp
1	Yes, but only because I overthink exactly what to talk about or I don't even know what to talk about. Over the years, however, I have learnt that you only talk to someone when something interests you. When you just meet someone are you really interested in knowing where they were born, their siblings, their age, or favourite colour... there are a lot more interesting things to talk about with someone you are close to.
1	I'm the same with anyone, and everyone. I listen, and listen some more. If something needs to be said I'll say it, and listen again. It's amazing the things you learn from all types of people.
0	No, I'm not quiet with others. Maybe you're just an ambivert. 
3	Anxiety	If you get anxiety, what usually triggers it? 
7	I'm fucked and have trust issues so I'd say when an SO doesn't text back. Also had a lot of people die last year so any time I get some vague text message freaks me out, especially if they take any length of time to respond to my response. Aside from that pretty much everything but those are the usual panic attack inducing ones.
4	Usually during any kind of emotional drama with a close friend or SO where I have to open up and try to resolve things if I was in the wrong... Where I send a message and there's that limbo of waiting to see how they respond. \n\n  Or basically when someone I care about or had thought I was friends with is ghosting me or if I think they're ghosting me... \n\n  I guess after typing that out I realize I can summarize my anxiety trigger as simply fear of rejection.
3	Talking to a group of \~10 or more. In high school and younger I was worried about humiliating myself. These days I'm no longer worried, but the physical reaction still happen. As I get closer to the moment I'll have to speak, my heart starts pounding. It's subtle at first and gradually ramps up to beating out of my chest. I take deep breaths to try and slow my heart rate, but it's too late. As soon as I start talking my mind blanks. I have everyone's attention and nothing to say. It's like I wrote a whole essay and walked it to the teacher, but dropped it into the shredder next to their desk. Still working on fixing this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe humiliation anxiety does come back if I get too high; especially around new people. I prefer very low dose edibles if I'm going to partake. 20mg and a movie is enough. Anything smoked puts me over the top and pretty much guarantees at least mild anxiety.
2	When I think I've got some sort of permanent illness
2	For me it's usually when I don't know what's going on. If I'm in a situation where people aren't communicating with me or everyone seems to know more than me it triggers my anxiety.
25	Does anyone else experience cycles of extreme tunnel vision about one subject for weeks at a time?	I’ve experienced this my whole life and I’ve been alternating between guitar, rock climbing, fishing, and cars for the last 5 years. 
25	yep. Super driven on something for a few weeks, then almost completely lose interest in it, then a few months later fucking love it again. Rinse and repeat. 
6	Yep. I obsess over something for long periods of time and then just suddenly move on to something else when I've found what I needed...
7	Very much so. It drives my two friends nuts because once I feel I’ve learned enough about a subject, I usually never bother with it again. That is of course someone doesn’t bring it up. 
2	Yup.
1	/u/DIYCharles .... basically your life 😂
1	Yup. Sometimes I get interested in a topic for a few hours or several months with extreme tunnel vision.\n\nAnd I love it.
1	[deleted]
1	Oh yes. Definitely
1	yep. ill be completely obsessed w one thing for a couple days-a couple weeks, cant think about anything else. then im bored and ill forget about it completely  and ill pick it up again later
1	Hey! ENTP here.\n\nThis *could* be a symptom of ASD!\nMight wanna look into that.
3	ENFP Interviewing ISTP Binyamin Tsadik Bair Ti-Se CP/B(S) MF	
1	Dudes got some serious stamina, he was barely interviewed more like talked at.   
1	I couldn't finish the video. I skipped over the ENFP's random stuff and then decided it's better to quit...
0	my brother is an istp. how do i tell him hes not logical without blowing up the house	seriously
12	Uh. Are you sure he's an istp? 
13	You bring better logic.
7	Thanks for giving a thorough explanation of the issue \n\n&#x200B;\n\n/s
5	Why?
3	Facts
2	What's he not being logical about? Let us logical people decide what's logical. 
2	This thread gave me cancer. 
1	What?
-2	borderline estp\n\nbut yeah better logic rarely works
6	I’m looking for a short nice way, or a few words to explain to an extrovert I’m not an emotional, or social person. With out explaining the MBTI and stuff, or offending them.	
30	'**I’m not an emotional, or social person.**'
21	“I would rather gouge out my eyes than go to a party. I’d much rather sit at home and masturbate.”
15	> r offending them\n\n\nThere’s your mistake. Wether or not they are offended is their own decision. You could say it in the nicest easiest way and they could still get offended. \n\n\nInstead of trying to tiptoe around their emotions or how they may handle it, just be honest with your words. Tell them how you feel. If you don’t intend to offend them, and they end up offended, *its not your fault*. Be secure in your words and understand that once you say them, it’s out of your hands how they will react. \n\n\nYou got this! 
6	I agree with earlier comment that you can't control others emotions. But I'd add to it that you should focus on "I" statements. Over emphasis that this is about you, not about them. "I need a lot of time to myself to feel relaxed." "I get anxious in crowded situations." No one can disagree with your feelings (I see the irony with the topic :)). If they are a secure enough individual, they won't reflect those comments onto themself.
3	Why would they be offended if you're not emotional or social? 
4	What's your opinion on funerals?	For close relatives, distant relatives, friends, friends-of-friends, and work/community acquaintances that you aren't close to? Or any other category of person one would be expected by some to attend the funeral of?
9	[deleted]
8	Don’t care for funerals, myself, but it is MOST IMPORTANT to consider that funerals aren’t for the dead, funerals are for the living.\n\nSomeone dies, we will move along with little trouble. Other types don’t. Other types are more affected by death. When considering whether or not to attend a funeral, you need to consider your relation to the living not to the deceased.\n\nAnd the notion that we would prefer to die without much fanfare is very self centered. You will be dead. You won’t care. Let the people around you deal with your death in the manner most helpful to themselves.
6	I've yet to attend one as an adult, but I do remember thinking as a kid that they were awkward. I remember trying to figure out how I was supposed to act. It just feels so forced... I mean, the only reason I can see that people even conduct funerals is that it's just tradition, which is a stupid reason to do anything. I'll do my best to make sure no one participates in such a bogus event in my "honor". 
5	It’ll be the death of me 
6	Had my nans a few years back. First one I actually had to sit in front of the coffin and shake hands to people. Sad time but thats life. Thinking back I just felt that funerals were a bit pointless, very dreary and boring. Kind of a money making thing too.   \nI don't even plan on showing up to mine!
3	Obsolete and useless.\n\nI can see everyone getting together for a celebration of the person, but the actual funeral? No. I will not go.
3	Had my first one last year for my grandpa, not exactly a great experience. Highly depressing, but it does have to be done.
3	If I'm not close to them then I probably don't care, might feel bad that someone died but no personal grief. But "closeness" is a scale. I would probably kill myself as well if my partner died or children died, second would be my immediate family and closest friends, third would be good friends/work colleagues and relatives, but everyone else is meh.
2	I hate them deeply and passionately. The only reason I haven't killed myself yet is hecause I don't want to make other people go to my funeral. -INTP
1	They're fine. I'd prefer to just go to the reception.\n\nI've been to three funerals since the beginning of this year, not including the several we didn't go to because we didn't live close.\n\nOn the subject, I went to a funeral this morning, then heard from a friend of ours that she was returning with another friend of ours. "In the cargo hold."-- the way she wrote it made me think it was a joke about his ridiculous antics.\n\nI jokingly told my sister that he must be dead. Then a minute later our friend added, "In a coffin."\n\nSo, I guess #4's coming up.\n\n&#x200B;
30	I have a question about ISTPs and conversations, and especially explaining, and responding to things.	When you guys answer someone’s questions do you sometimes say more then you need to, or if your explaining something give more details then needed? I’m thinking about not saying to much, and doing short responses from now on I think people would like that, because there’s less to think about.\nAnd what function would be responsible for to long of responses?
28	I'm the complete opposite - I tend to under-explain and assume that they understand more than they do. This is a recurring issue in my relationship because I hate explaining things (also because I'm bad at it, and my patience wears thin quickly) 
27	I try to answer the question completely and accurately, and sometimes that takes more words than they were expecting. But I love imparting knowledge, and want to see the person now have complete understanding.  Why is the Sun yellow? Well, let's discuss black-body radiation and Rayleigh scattering!\n\nI also sometimes assume the person knows nothing of what I explain, and will get too basic. I've spent too much time in IT.
9	Yes, i tend to get excited when I explain something and tend to give maybe unnecessary details. But I think that in most cases, people enjoy the way I give explanations to them. 
10	Is it something I'm really into like one of my hobbies? If so, I may accidentally just keep talking and rambling on and forgetting to check the other side that they aren't getting bored or disinterested.\n\nIs it something that isn't? Usually short responses. Great at work when things needs to get done, and they will ask more details if they really need it.\n\nNot great in social situations. This is probably where people think I don't want to talk to them. It isn't that at all. I'm sure many of us find small talk not engaging. They will literally have to drive it to keep things going-- ask more details, different subject, etc.. I'm not very good amount remembering that sometimes I should ask the same thing back. I'm trying to work on being better at this, and a good tip I read was to just ask them exactly the short response back as a question. They will automatically expand on it which hopefully will lead to something deeper.
6	I suck at explaining, so I don’t.
5	Whenever people ask me a question I ask if they want the "short answer" or the "long answer".
6	If a question has many permutations, or layers of detail that I suspect may be unknown to the questioner, I may either ask additional questions to clarify the specific point of interest, or, if I feel like I can tie it all up coherently, I may answer those permutations as I go to give the most complete answer.\n\nAs I turn this around in my head, a lot of how I choose to answer routine questions is predicated upon my initial appraisal of the questioner and the question. I tend to respond not so well to things I've already tagged #obvious or #easilysearchable and tend to be a bit of a curt asshole even to people I probably should be more humble toward.\n\nHope that gets at something you were interested in.
3	Yes, because I feel if I dont I won't give all the info needed. It's a balancing act for sure.
4	I usually give short responses and then have to explain myself a ton cause no one can understand what I'm saying.. Unfortunately, it's not always their fault either. I just suck at explaining things. >.>
4	If it's a yes or no question, then I'll respond with either yes or no.\n\nIf it's an open question, then I'll ask with series of "what do you mean?" to make sure I got the question right.\n\nI don't like over-explaining (or adding more details) unless the other person asks for it.
3	I am generally extremely brief, even when I know people expect more. \n\nI am only more verbose if it is a subject about feelings, and I literally dont know what i think/feel about the subject, so I try to work it out as i go, using myself or people as a soundingboard.\n\n\n
2	Depends who I am talking to. To people I don't care about, I talk too little. To people I care about, I talk too much. 
2	yeah, it's probably Ti and Ni. the more we think about an idea, the more we can write about it. Ne sounds like it would be better for writing because it comes up with more information, but NTPs are more likely to entertain several ideas without coming to any conclusion. also why intjs write reddit essays that nobody reads
2	Yes! I always feel like I over explain things and I really hate that about myself because it annoys the hell out of me when other people over explain shit. 
2	I always feel that I come off as scatterbrained when I answer long detailed questions. Almost like my mind is recalling everything faster than I can verbalize (I'm normally a quiet listener). If it's something I'm passionate about, I could talk until you're bored, but usually keep it straight forward.
2	While at work, people always stop by my lab bench to strike up a conversation (or just rattle off about their day). I gauge the person's interest of the subject through observation of their personality and the things they normally talk about. And based on said observations I choose the appropriate depth of my response.\n\nSometimes, giving a short answer might appear to be insincere, so I show them the opening to the rabbit hole by saying something like, "I could give you some examples if you'd like", or "I can explain this in greater detail if you're interested", or even "I could go into depth about this, but I'm worried it may bore you".\n\nIf you're having a hard time gauging the person, you can just say, "Hmm. I haven't thought about this before. What are your thoughts on this?" Then after listening to them you can give a response that matches the depth of their answer. They generally seem pretty satisfied.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd I think "T" would dictate the length of our potential responses, while our "I" would determine whether or not we choose to express them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: corrections.
2	I only know one ISTP and I'm married to them. This is his idea of an explanation:\n\nMe: How would you go about doing (the thing)?  \nHim: Correctly.\n\nThe end.
2	Oh. My. God.\n\n*Than, *you're, *"something,", *than, *too, "on.", And *too.\n\nAnd yes. I think it's because ti-ni tends to think in terms of systems. Everything connects to everything else, so a bunch of information that others may deem unnecessary is important to us.
2	I feel like more often I don't answer enough. I'll explain something in a way that makes perfect sense to me, but whoever I'm talking to would still be confused, then I realise I explained it, skipping base level information. So people without all my experiance and knowledge are only getting the second half of the puzzle.
2	I barely speak but when i do I always like to discuss and explaining things that I'm interested in but I ended saying too much details, which makes people always shows disinterest and boredom and because of that I don't speak anymore haha.
2	In texting format I always over explain things- make 100% sure they know exactly what I'm getting at with no confusion, at the expense of a double length message every time.
1	Yea it’s always something you’d never expect 
1	Were you always brief ?
3	What about the functions of the STP types gives us such a bad rep, and makes us get blamed for ever crazy thing that happens?	
10	I just don't know if you can tie that evil mischievous look that we get in our eyes to any particular function :P
9	In my case it's usually because I'm the only one capable of doing so on purpose
9	Because it usually is our fault. At least in my case.
5	Personally I think it’s because everything I do that would cause trouble and me to be blamed for it, is usually something I did out of self interest, laziness, and or convenience. Not that this is exclusive to ISTPs by any means, but the combination of sensing and thinking means we’re better at examining the situation directly and moving forward with logical decisions without consideration for how it may negatively affect other people, and perceiving imo is a fancy way to say procrastinate or wing it and makes us more likely to just act now and deal with the consequences later. \n\nTrash can never made it to the curb and now it’s festering in the summer heat? It wasn’t full and I didn’t want to drag out a half full trash can. Kitchen is a mess? Didn’t want my food to get cold, I can always clean it up later. Why did you reorganize this cabinet without telling me first and where you moved things? It’s more efficient and makes more sense like this, and you got eyes don’t you. You bought HOW MANY pounds of frozen tater tots? I was hungry and we have the freezer space. 
67	Feelings... my nemesis.	
3	Ha. Though, it's okay to feel.
2	Technically its your inferior lel
7	How to Get my ISTP back	Okay. so Im an ENFP 23F, and he’s an ISTP 25M. We worked together for 2 years and apparently he really liked me but I had no idea and was dating someone else at the time. Well last spring I broke up with the guy I was dating and ISTP coworker dude finally asks for my number after asking a mutual friend if she thought he had a chance. It was cute. Unfortunately I had already made plans to work a seasonal job for 6 months and we only had less than a month together before I left. \n\nI really liked him and he seemed to really like me too and we hung out almost every day and the sex was amazing and he was always so sweet and kind. He definitely seemed a little guarded however and I learned he had just gotten out of a 3 year relationship (and had a death in his close family a year ago). He talked about the future a lot, wanted to meet my family, and we made plans to travel together when I got back. He was really sad about me leaving. Well I left, we barely talked the entire time, but when I said I was headed back he started texting saying he was excited to see me again and hoped we could pick up where we left off. I got back, everything was really great, and then I told him I was traveling out of the country for a few weeks but then I would be back for good. He seemed miffed by that and made a joke that this wouldn’t work out bcs I travelled too much. He also didn’t want to hook up the week I was back saying he wanted to take slow things down and get to know me better. \n\nI left on my trip, and he ghosted me when I got back. A few months later I texted to wish him a happy new years, and he texted back apologizing and saying I deserved better than that (thanks, I did). Since then he’s been breadcrumbing, texting hey and such but never replies when I reply (he’s always been a shit texter though).  Recently I asked when I could pick up my stuff just to officially end things so I could move on with my life (bcs his last text said that he was keeping my stuff safe for whenever I wanted to get it) but he didn’t answer.  Anyways is there any chance he still likes me and is there any possibility we could still date in the future? I really liked him and I’m sad bcs I feel like we barely got to know each other but I feel like he’s dealing with a lot of stress at work and just life in general. Any insight would be appreciated. I’m so confused as to what’s going on in his brain. \n\nTLTR: Dated an ISTP for a month, traveled for 7 months, came back and he ghosted, but he keeps breadcrumbing and I’m so confused. does he want to end things or not? Is there still a possibility I can get him back? 
17	If this was me and I was acting the way he was, here's what I think my reasoning would be: he really, really likes you. Always has. But your travelling is incompatible with what he wants for the two of you. Knowing it probably wouldn't work, he writes you off into the "this isn't gonna work" bucket.\n\nEvery now and then, he gets a bug up his butt, remembers how much he likes you, and reaches out. Only to remember his previous categorization of you (as not going to work), and backs off. \n\nI think he loves with the idea of being with you, but doesn't actually want to be with you because of the problems it causes. I think he also wants you to be close to him (like, as in, not travelling), but he doesn't want to hold you back from it if it's important to you, hence, "you're better off with someone else [meaning -- someone who can handle your travelling better]".\n\nI think this is an ISTP thing, we're very easy to decide things about people and ourselves and we're very stubborn to stick with them. Right or wrong.\n\nIf you truly want to "win him back", I think the thing that is going to make the most difference is how much effort you put into it. Put all you got into him, be sure to ask what he wants and don't settle for him shrugging you off. Keep asking. He might just be "interest checking" to see if you're actually serious about this.\n\nJust keep in mind that you may not actually be able to win him back. If he's decided that you two are never going to work out, that may be where it ends. But try the effort angle first.
2	ask him if he wants to try and have a relationship
2	If any type wants to be available, they will. He doesn't. Move on. This is not an ISTP thing. Unfortunately ppl get confused and look to types for an explanation when every type will show interest if it is there.
11	I started a new job and am having trouble interacting with coworkers.	About a month ago I (f/20/istp) got my first job as a QC Technician. Meaning I basically go around telling people when they're doing their job wrong. That's not a problem for me. But what is a problem, is getting to know and interacting with people. Apparently people have been talking 'behind my back' about how I rarely talk or interact with them. How they don't know anything about me. And the little they do know, was 'info they worked hard to get.' \nMy SIL works in the same place but at HR. They've asked her if she has gotten to know me (they don't know we're family). She told my mom about how I behave at work, ie I don't talk to my coworkers. And my mom told me that I should talk to them but obviously not get too personal. \n\nWhat exactly am I supposed to talk about then?\n\n I have at least 2min and at most 5 min of interaction with them while doing my rounds. I don't understand what they expect me to say to them during that time. I also don't feel like I'm being rude to them or at least not intentionally. \nAlso most of my coworkers are at least 7 years my seniors. I can't seem to relate to anyone at work. \n\nLmao I hope this post isn't too clustered. 
11	Try reading "how to make friends and influence people."\n\nPeople like you using their names, asking about things they enjoy, etc. \n\nI really find small talk boring as fuck but will use it here and there to grease the wheels.
8	I have found that the majority of the population is obsessed with small talk. It really is the best way to get most people to like you, even though it's a pointless waste of time. 
3	Sorry that people are talking shit about you behind your back. Sounds like unnecessary drama to me. Do you smile when you say hi and see them? Maybe it's body language. Maybe make a joke or two if something comes up while you're interacting with them. If you see something in their workspace or on their t-shirt or whatever that you can relate to or comment on, use that. If not, I wouldn't sweat it too much. You don't have to be besties with people at work.\n\nEdited to add: If it's monday, ask them how their weekend was. If it's Friday, ask them if they have any plans for the weekend. Lol, these are the two questions I hate, but I've learned to just ask/answer them. 
2	Ask people questions, find common interests, things they like to talk about/are proud of, something they're good at that you can learn from. When people get into a frame of mind of offering advice to you or helping you, they subconsciously start to like you more. This works really well I think if they're older than you and you seem humble and interested in learning and doing your best at your job, and that you've got their back and won't throw them under the bus to management. Try to avoid directly talking shit about co-workers, but let people rant to you about other co-workers if they're so inclined, it'll be an easy way to let them do the work of small talk and avoid making a potential enemy  for no reason by making a thing of it. It's an easy way to fake an amicable relationship with a co-worker you actually dislike if necessary. I think of it like being Sweden, you want to remain pretty neutral and still maintain relations with all parties to get business done smoothly without dealing with drama and bullshit. So let everyone talk shit to you about each other, be sort of non-committal in a way that vaguely makes them assume you think the same thing and have the mountain passes wired to blow. Focus on the few things you can find to like or have in common with someone, and you can manage to tolerate even some of the most annoying co-workers I've found. It's worth getting along with coworkers and being friendly so they have your back. It's nice when people are disinclined to throw you under the bus and if you ever fuck up they won't jump on you over it. You have to interact at least a little with these people one way or the other, so it's worth a small amount of effort to at least try and make it more enjoyable or tolerable.  Best case you can enjoy the small talk with them, or get past the point of small talk .
2	If it's your job to tell them when they are doing their job wrong, fuck it. You don't have to be friendly to work with them. Let them talk behind your back all they want. I don't see anywhere that you are needing friends so... I work in a call center with about 400 other people. I can count on 2 fingers the number of people I speak to on a daily basis and that is only because they sit with me at lunch. I have found that the less people know about you, the less they can say about you. And even those 2 people don't know dick about me. My philosophy is  "you don't have to like me but you will respect me"\n\nEdit- i am the elusive ISTP female. Sorry for formatting. Mobile. 
2	It sounds like there are some immature people at this work place. Not everyone needs to be a chatter box...
2	That sucks....and something I've struggled with. I've never really felt like a part of the team, even though I can get along with anyone. I'm just not buddy buddy with most, I keep to myself. Practicing small talk helps, but I'd say to find 1 or 2 people that you seem to have something in common with and try to get to know them better. And then you can branch out from there. 
3	If it's your job to get them to do their job correctly I don't see why it matters if they like you, what they know about you, or what they say behind your back. Screw 'em. Do your job well and go home.
38	Annoying an ISTP	Is it just me, but when a person purposely tries to piss me off (e.g. Like ppl looking at me with this fucked up look and then cutting the cake in the shitiest way possible) it doesn't work. It just meh, like okay idc, you except a reaction out of me and you aren't going to get it. \n\nBut when they do it unconsciously I suddenly become a pissed off 40 yr old Italian man.\nE.g. pointing at the thing with palm up "eh wtf, why u gotta do it like that, just do it like this (shows them how)" \n
36	being genuinely annoyed when witnessing inefficiency vs not being phased when someone is intentionally trying to piss you off
13	I'm perhaps one of the most patient people on Earth when it comes to dealing with people.  Inanimate objects on the other hand, will feel my wrath very quickly should they not comply with my wishes.
6	I don't get pissed off by people usually, I get pissed off over things that I can't fix but have to deal with.
5	Well I did read that in an Italian voice, so you must be right.
1	are you me?\n\nThis is exactly how I am. Like, I'm so contrarian that if someone is trying to get a rise out of me, I won't let them. But if someone is obtuse, it drives me nuts.
1	Ha ha, yes
1	Yeah I can easily spot the asshole and that just rolls right off but I am totally the Jimmy Fallon IT guy character from SNL... MOVE.
0	Yeah most people walk around with no idea of their surroundings. It pisses me off a lot. These people are so lucky that society exists because I think they would die in a dangerous situation where they had to pay attention. There's a lot of pickpockets around my school and I honestly am fine with them picking these unobservant people's pockets. If they don't want their pockets picked they need to get a clue
6	ISTP professional coders: which aspect do you prefer to work in?	The frontend UI/UX, tweaking layouts and colour schemes to produce functional and aesthetic interfaces?\n\nThe backend cogs, gears, and databases?\n\nTesting and fixing, hunting down bugs to work the cause of failure?\n\nReverse engineering legacy code?
3	\#5, taking a problem and creating a novel algorithm to solve it. But I usually have to deal with #2-#4.
2	2 and 4 are more to my strengths. \n\nI'm not good at creating aesthetics. I can tweak and improve aesthetics, but if I were to do it from scratch, it would look like something that begrudgingly goes on a fridge. I am good with user experience/application flow though.
2	I'm most interested in troubleshooting the cause of a failure. I'm not a "coder" by trade, but I do something similar all day most days and it keeps me interested.\n\nI also have an interest in properly normalizing a database and efficient code and whatnot, but also those things are often at odds with: "I could spend 3 days trying to make the most perfect thing, or I could spend 20 minutes, get it working "good enough" and spend those other days on something that matters more". The latter usually wins because interest in efficiency also encompasses "how much can I get done with my limited amount of time".
1	I'm a senior in highschool but visual stuff interests me the most
7	Any speed readers?	Right now I’m learning to speed read. Many think speed reading is “skimming” but actually it involves 100% comprehension. There are some readers who can read 400 pg books in an hour or less. I feel that this skill would be the most beneficial for anyone. Do you speed read?
9	no. i can speed read and i do for things i don't care about, but if i'm reading a book it takes me like two minutes to read a page
2	I can do less than 30 seconds per page, and I’ve read over a thousand books 
1	I am not diagnosed, but i think im dyslexic. I do skim a lot. I really wish I could speed read.
1	Maybe. How large are those pages, and the text? I can read approx. 85 pages of A4 in double-spaced size 12 font in an hour. I do agree though, speed reading is very beneficial. 
1	I don't think that would be the most beneficial skill for anyone. It may be beneficial for your ego. "Oh, look at me i finished one 300-page book in one hour." And so what? \n\nSense of accomplishment that will soon be filled with void because what's the point of knowing everything but you can't possibly applied them in your life? It will fill you with guilty feeling. Sometimes, ignorance is a bliss. \n\nThe most important thing is to choose the most relevant book for your life and one you can immediately apply. Take the time and enjoy the read.
1	Yes, I speed read.  But just got to this point recently after reading a shit ton of books, and when I say alot I mean ALOT.  I've read heaps of text books, novels, autobiographies, art history, you name it.\n\nThe trick came to me when I started trusting myself to go through the page and hone in on key words and letting the unimportant words fall.\n\nA 200 page informative book can be demolished in an hour.\n\nThe cool part is this:  I retain concepts way better with speed reading because I have the liberty to slow down at the most important concepts and speed up with fluff.
1	I used to read an entire page in a few seconds if I didn't follow the lines. \n\nAs an adult, I can skim quickly and that's basically it.\n\n&#x200B;
9	hello, how is your sex drive?	also... are you kinky? or do you like vanilla?\n\nor maybe strawberry.. 
13	High.\n\nI'm pretty kinky. I'm into intensity, would be a good way to describe it. \n\nI don't have any fetishes though, just a long list of things that turn me on. \n\nI'm mostly into pretty vanilla things like bdsm, cnc, and rough sex. \n\nThe most depraved thing I'm into is cuddling
10	Single is how I would describe it
3	Insatiable, and [varied](https://imgur.com/HLghB8y).
3	pretty low, but that's partially due to stimulant abuse. i don't really have any interesting fetishes
3	Awful.  But I am on medication that lowers libido. 
2	Medium to pretty high I guess? Depending on mood and if I'm single or not 
2	Sky high.\n\nAlso dungeons.\n\nEnough said.
1	High
1	Pretty high. Depends what you mean by kiny I like rough sex but not out of pocket kinks..
1	Yes
0	What , why
9	how do you guys appear or act in a setting where you are comfortable? how about when you are uncomfortable?	I'm getting real interested in the ISTP's.
25	Comfortable: quiet with occassional funny/witty observation humor/topic. Might get deep without warning.\n\nUncomfortable: quiet with weird fidgetty moves that signals "i want to get the fuck outta here"\n\n
3	Comfortable- relaxed and pretty in the moment, focused on what I'm doing or who I'm with and not much else.\n\nUncomfortable- silently freaking out and over-analysing things, which people definitely pick up on. 
2	Well depending on whether I'm uncomfortable because of fear or disgust I leave the situation or maybe figure out why I'm uncomfortable and fix it instead if possible. Sometimes you need to get out of your comfort zone though and push through with courage.
2	Uncomfortable - quiet, serious, and invisible (as much as possible), looking for exit, barely any speaking.. Possibly none at all and just nods and awkward/polite smiles. \n\nComfortable - can be loud, "extroverted", laugh alot, crack jokes, sarcastic, etc. 
2	Sit there like a badass
1	More comfortable = more talking/more engaged. The opposite would be in the corner watching and not interacting, or if I can't wallflower, simple yes/no responses.
1	When I’m comfortable, razor wit, salty jokes, extroverted-like\nUncomfortable- silent, invisible for the most part
1	Uncomfortable- resting bitch face on point. Closed off body language. Speak when spoken to.\n\nComfortable- resting bitch face on point with periods of slight smiles. Open posture. Cracking jokes. I am funny AF when I wanna be. 
1	Comfortable - Head in hand on desk, or using a chair's backrest, relaxed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUncomfortable - Furrowed brow, good posture, limbs drawn close to body.
16	ENFJ (Male) trying to figure out my ISTP crush (Female)	Met this girl in my class back in July and had a crush on her ever since. We hung out a few times during the summer (just the two of us) and I noticed she was quiet, didn't say much and was not super open and most people would describe her as hard to get to know. I asked her friend at the time if she was looking for a relationship and she said no. After that, I started hanging out with her in groups. I noticed though that whenever I would ask her to do something, she would always say yes or have a legit excuse\n\nFast forward a couple months, I ask her out. She initially said yes but then texted me saying that she recently got out of a long term relationship but she still wanted to go as friends. We went ice skating/dinner/bar and had a great time. She was more open, wanted to get to know me more and overall I felt closer to her.\n\nWe continued to hang for a while and doing more couple like activities (Breakfast then library/nature trail, watching the lunar eclipse together on a blanket). Her texting habits got better, she even texted me first a couple of times which almost never happened. Eventually, she invited me to do stuff with her friends too and I thought things were good.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, my friends and I saw her on dating apps and which lead me to assume she was ready for something. Her profiles on there and very little pictures and no descriptions what so ever so I'm not sure how serious it was.\n\nSo i decided to ask her out via phone and she said that she's inclined to say yes but she does not want a relationship. When asked if it was me or her situation she stated that she enjoys spending time with me but does not want anything right now. Currently, I'm trying to calm my feelings before I can be friends with her again. When I mentioned to her the dating apps, she said that she was on there for a week when she was most over school but deleted the app.\n\nAs an ENFJ who is completely opposite to you guys, I just wanted to know if this is normal ISTP behavior and I'm still trying to gage a sense of what she is thinking. I'm not sure if she was being honest with me or just trying to spare my feelings by not flat out rejecting me. Is an ISTP super adamant about that kind of stuff?\n\nTL;DR\nENFJ guy likes ISTP girl. Hung out with her multiple times. Asked her out and she said inclined to say yes and does enjoy spending time with me but does not want a relationship.\n\nEDIT: Essentially, I misread her subtle increase in openness and availability as a clue she was interested in a relationship.
19	honestly with istp’s, take what we say at face value. we are known for being noncommittal so if she tells you she doesn’t really want to be in a relationship right now, it’s as simple as that. \n\npersonally i’ve been interested in many guys before and haven even gotten really close romantically to them, but i’ve never really looked for anything serious (making sure to make that clear from the get go as to not lead anyone on). \n\nif you’re genuinely interested in this girl, i suggest continuing to spend time with her and see if she warms up to the idea of a relationship, but don’t force anything as it would only be met with hostility. 
10	Hmm. So I've never exactly been in this situation but I'll say this. I was friends with an istj and I knew he liked me.. But I wasn't interested in a relationship with him at the time so I kept our friendship... Off and on. He was probably my closest friend but I just wouldnt always keep up the friendship because I knew he liked me and it didn't seem right or fair to essentially lead him on.  I didn't have absolutely no interest though. If I had absolutely no interest, I probably woulda cut him off permanently. Fast forward several years, and I'm now happily married to the guy. 
6	Shes probably not beating around the bush. \n\nAs a sidenote, I've known a few ENFJs and I've gotten along well with all of them but couldn't ever imagine dating them or spending extended periods of time with them. 
1	You should probably take what she says at face value, however, my best friend is an ISTP and she has a huge crush on one of her classmates, but she actually told him she would never date him (by accident; long story. In reality, she literally cries over not being with him when she’s alone. I don’t know if that behavior applies to all ISTPs, but that’s just an example I thought of.
1	This has been the thing with me and this ENFJ male I've known for almost 5 years. I'm very open with him to the point of actually entertaining a relationship with him. Heck we even recently talked about sex and what we preferred. He snapped out the last time and hated me for leading him on. He's frustrated for a long time, and I could understand. We didn't talk for almost 6 months. He went on a few dates, and I did as well. Those dates didn't work, and we're now talking again. WTF. He's very appealing, but my life is a mess and needs some personal hardwork.. I don't mind talking to him on this level. When my life gets better, I'd definitely take a move. He's been very patient all these years.
1	yeah this sounds about right. She probably is considering it because you approached her but because it's not something she was interested in to begin with she probably considers a relationship low priority and is focused on other things right now. ISTPs can be kind of hot or cold while they are juggling what their motivations are at the moment. I did the exact same thing with the dating apps before. I made the profile just to see what was there and to see if there was anyone on there I thought was worth considering a relationship. Not really digging it i deleted it after a week and decided i wasn't interested again. 
1	We're not hiding anything yet you have so much to uncover
1	Istp female here. She is being pretty point blank with you. Labels don't mean much to me. We are probably the only females in the world that don't give AF about that.  Can you continue to see her without needing to know about the next step? Just roll with it and have fun. One thing you can be certain of...if she doesn't want to see you, when will tell you. I doubt she would be dating multiple guys because who has the mental energy for that? Or the want to? \nGood luck. 
2	What are some real life examples contrasting INTP problem solving method vs ISTP problem solving?	Title
13	There are none. INTPs create problems.
5	Friendships with ISFJs?	My best friend since childhood is an ISTP and I’m an ISFJ. I’m just wondering if these types are known to get along and what your experience with ISFJs have been?
5	I generally really like them, I'm dating an isfj at the moment. Sweet people (most of the time)
3	My sister who raised me and is my best friend is and isfj. 
10	I hate these questions. Look, you've been friends since childhood? I'm gonna assume you get along. Doesn't matter what type they are.
2	One of my most favourite colleagues is an ISFJ. It's always easy to talk to her. She doesn't make silly jokes and she understands what I want to say even when I can't explain it that well. She is so well-organised and puts her 100% into her work. If you need to get something sorted, she's the best person for the job. She easily gets annoyed when her project is stuck because someone in our team isn't doing their job (which I like because no one else seems to care).\n\nShe's by far the only ISFJ I have ever met but she does give me a very positive impression of her type. I know that everyone is different but we're talking about ISFJ in general here.\n\nAlso I've read somewhere that ISTP is the type that supports ISFJ very well. I don't remember the details but theoretically we compliment each other. This colleague of mine is one of the very few people I intend to keep in touch after I leave this job (which is a huge thing for an ISTP. We tend to forget about people as soon as they go out the door). So, yeah, I think we get along nicely :) 
2	My cousin who's one of my best friends is an ISFJ. 
3	If introverted functions have a "final state" then how does its position really affect it at all?	If we talk about Ti as an equation function, then it should have some "final state." For example Te says : gravity on earth is 9.8 m/s. Ti says force of gravity=(mass of planet)/(volume of planet) or some other bullshit.\n\nEssentially, Ti can eventually reach THE true model for gravity that will be representative of every future Te measurement. Just like any theory eventually is correct though unverified. Once Ti hits that "one true theory" it has nowhere to go.\n\nIf that's true, then why would inferior Ti be any different than dominant Ti? Yes the dominant Ti might reach it first because they are primarily focused on understanding Ti models, but if the inferior Ti user learns the models from the Ti dominant, what makes them any different?\n\nSimilarly, how does your Ni in yourself compare to an inferior Ni if both have achieved the "end state"\n\nIs the inferior function in direct opposition to the dominant? I.e. tertiary can still serve the dominant supportively, but the inferior directly causes the user to not only be stressed but also to be slowed down in the use of their dominant?
7	What are you looking for exactly with your recent posts to ENTP, INTP, and here? What's an end result that will satisfy these posts?
2	I think you are over-complicating things too much. Go have a good read through [Psychological Types](http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Jung/types.htm) and you'll realize that all Jung talks about is definitions of functions and how they are expressed through the two attitudes.  \nThe difference between introverted thinking and extraverted thinking is that introversion is an attitude focused on making judgments based on an internal standard (aka following your "rules"; an evolutionary adaptation of preserving the self) and extraversion is an attitude focused on making judgments based on an external standard (aka following "the rules"; an evolutionary adaptation of propagating yourself in the world). The Te user obeys the laws of society and the Ti user makes his own laws. And here we see the first problem with the ego - that of relying to heavily on one function. If you rely too much on Te you become someone that never thinks for themself and becomes a sheep to the rules even if they don't make any sense. If you rely too much on Ti then you become someone that often gets into trouble with the law and can't integrate into society because you don't understand that you have to follow rules. It is only through a process of individuation do we learn how to use the repressed functions and our psyche becomes balanced.\nSince they are in the same realm of thinking, you often find that Ti types use Te a lot and vice versa. This is something Carl Jung talked about and is why I believe the 5th and 6th functions are actually stronger than the 3rd and 4th.  \nIf you're talking about the tertiary function, keep in mind that it is repressed by the auxiliary function so it's not actually that strong. Ti represses Fe just as much as Fi. However, the Ti user never uses Fi because their internal judging is done with logic not feeling, so their feeling standard is rarely internal and only ever comes from the external world.  \nAnd then things are more complicated when you start talking about "loopers" and how your interpret Jung's explanation of the auxiliary function.
2	Life time is not infinite.
1	A mind with perfect knowledge would likely continue testing new information against the perfect knowledge to ensure it holds up, so the knowledge wouldn't change once it's perfect but the mind would still process information surrounding it\n\nHighly unlikely a single human mind could develop perfect knowledge in a lifetime\n\nBut as a hypothetical the perfect knowledge in one mind would obviously be the same as the perfect knowledge in another mind... because it is perfect...
51	Really don't know how to talk to most people	Like it seriously baffles me, how do people have conversations, long in-depth conversations about their bus route, or their trip to the doctor's office, or some other mundane thing? It's like, I have nothing to say, Idk how people do it.
45	I was like that once, but then i just don't anymore. Don't know how though, the skill just...clicked...\n\nI think its because I watch how people interact for so long that i subconsciously knows how to act now...observe, copy, and adjust kind of thing.\n\nDamn i sound like a sociopath trying to pass as a normal human...
14	Maybe it's not that you don't know how to talk to people. Those topics you listed down just isn't very interesting and some people like talking for the sake of talking. That's not us.  It's fine, you be you, let them be them. There's no need to force yourself to engage in conversations you think are boring.  \n\nTypical solution (if you consider your situation a problem or bothersome), you just have to find people you have common interests with and connect with and the conversation could possibly go on for hours. 
5	Practice. \n\nNot everyone gets proficient in all the socio-emotional skills growing up. \nNBD, you recognize a skill you lack proficiency in, congratulations on your self-awareness, seriously.\n\nNow you have the agency to either maintain your current skill level or take steps, no rush, to improve.\n\nThat said I dont know how people get up at 4am to run & I'm not interested in improving that skill at all. 
4	I doubt these are *in depth* conversations. \nI'd rather opt out of hearing mundane details of someone's life, and don't find interesting recounting mine. \nIt's ok. You'll tak with fewer people about something that is of interest to you. 
3	Do you feel bad because of that? Would you actually like to talk with random stranger about your bus route? Would that actually make you happier?  \nStay yourself, find meaningful connections with people that share your interests. Conversation will just start itself. If you wan't to learn a chit-chat, it's possible, but is this your goal at the end?   \n

3	Small talk is the worst thing in the world. Or being alone in a room with a crying person...
2	ask people questions about themselves. have hobbies, know interesting stuff to talk about, make jokes. conversations just kinda flow naturally. \n\ni used to feel similar to you, but the more i just got out and met tons of people, the easier it became and now it doesn't bother me.\n\n
2	Same way, fuck it. Talk about what you need to talk about, and dip
2	Yeah, I really feel like an asshole sometimes because I just don’t give a fuck about anything people say. It’s like yeah we’ve talked about this before what more is there to say? But I don’t actually say that, I just nod my head and say Mmhm.
2	99% of the time, people are complaining about something. They need to turn their annoying day or their annoying acquaintance into an epic poem about the trials and tribulations of their life, and it doesn't take much effort from there to keep babbling about it. Nobody has long in-depth conversations about how great their bus ride was or how they didn't have to wait long at all to see the doc.
2	You don't-an INTP\n\nUnless I have a joke to say I don't speak. The point of conversation is to enjoy it, and I am not particularly seeking out any knowledge. Humor is enjoyable though so I use it when I observe something and think of something funny
2	My (ISTP) husband and I have times like this when we go out to dinner and just sit and eat and stare at each other. I can talk about theoretical things with people who are interested in such topics but he's typically not, and neither of us care about our trip to the doctor's office or something comparable.  It's not really necessary to do this unless you have a job that requires schmoozing. 
4	Men and women range themselves into three classes or orders of intelligence; you can tell the lowest class by their habit of always talking about persons; the next by the fact that their habit is always to converse about things; the highest by their preference for the discussion of ideas.\n\nCharles Stewart
1	Just ask a personal question like on a date. People either get uncomfortable or answer and you'll figure out who's company you enjoy more. There is no rule you have to get along 100% with everyone you meet.

20	Do you ISTPs find that if your irritated or mad about something, that it people can tell by your face and eyes even if you try to hide it ?	
52	Honestly the moment I stop fake being social they think I'm mad.
26	I find most think I'm mad even when I'm not. So they're bound to be right at some point. 
9	Lol, much like what others said, I frequently look mad. I do make a conscious effort to look friendly, and am pretty good at it by now.. but if I, for instance, start thinking or feel extra tired, everyone thinks I'm mad. It's just my default face I guess. Usually if people actually successfully peg me as mad, I wanted them to... or they caught me off completely off guard and it accidentally leaked through. If I want to hide it, I usually can. 
4	Where I'm from everyone walks around with a mad/irritated look on their faces, so I fit in just fine haha. But actually, I'm hardly ever actually mad or irritated about anything and I'm very good at covering it up, so no one really notices / cares to notice (because when almost everybody looks pissed, this look later gets understood as the "normal" look, and it's not worth talking about it). 
4	Not really, more like the opposite - people think I'm mad when I'm really not.
3	People can usually tell because I don't bother hiding it.
7	YOU'RE, NOT YOUR.
3	My face is basically a slab of stone except for positive emotions. And even then I generally have to choose to express facially. What’s funny is it’s even true when I get drunk/high. So while all my friends get giggly, I can sit there stone faced and nobody is able to get a muscle to twitch on my face. I love doing it to my best friend when he’s high because it drives him insane. I stare through his soul and it makes him so uncomfortable LOL. 
2	Nope, most people have no idea what I'm feeling, poker face

13	WTF years	So I havent seen a wtf years post in a while and seeing them for the first time on here actually helped me out a bit, so I thought I should add to the pile.\n\nI'm a 22 year old guy in his last year of college studying software development, and honestly hate the course at this point. I feel like getting the degree and never working in software because of the 9-5 in an office or looking at code on a screen all day. All motivattion has left me and even the famous istp "do assignment at last second balls to the wall" approach is just an unreachable state right now. \n\nI plan on traveling to Australia after I finish, and just doing physical work like picking fruit or construction for a year, while doing the one thing I reliably like, travel.\n\nMy problem is trying to figure out what else I want to do for a job in the future. I have a lot of other interests like engineering, art, sketching, reading, endlessly researching pointless topics on the internet, and more.\n\nThe problem is finding a decent job that I enjoy, I used to like programming more but now that I know what it will be like working in an office (a highly structured, regimented environment) , I get a little sick each time I imagine going in every day.\n\nIs there a chance to use your brain and body as a career in this world or do I have to pick one? 😅\n\nAny advice/guidance is welcome, \nAnd to all you istp software workers out there, is it as bad as I imagine? How do you deal?\n\n
10	With programming i think it depends on the size of team you are working in. Where i work, i am in a team of three where each of us has pretty much complete autonomy when making changes or adding new functionality. The only requirements for any piece of work are \n\n1:it does what it is supposed to\n\n2: it doesn't break anything existing\n\nThis will of course not always be the case with the rise of project 'managers', change advisory boards and other well meaning administrative processes that mainly seem to slow everything down.
8	Be advised, if you get married and have kids, a stable paycheck becomes much more motivating.
4	Not all programming jobs are like that. Just need to find one you like. 
5	Some programming jobs are highly technical, others are just about writing simple code and bringing in a bit of creativity to build websites for example.\nOn top of that, not all offices are emotionless hell holes. Some are quite fun places with cool people all working together.\n\nOn top of that, not all programming jobs are in offices! If you get lucky you can work remotely and be sitting in the beaches of Indonesia or the mountains of Switzerland while you code!\n\nBut also.. coding is not for everyone. Good luck!
4	>Is there a chance to use your brain and body as a career in this world or do I have to pick one?\n\nThe trades might be a decent option - Electrician, plumber, welder etc. You'll likely still end up with a rigid schedule though, and no hope of working remotely. \n\nAt the end of the day, I think it's more realistic to aim for a job that you can tolerate vs. one that is deeply fulfilling. Software seems like a very wise choice if you take care of your physical health in your free time. It might turn out great if you can trudge through a couple rough years to get to a remote position. 30-year-old you might be very happy you made the sacrifice. \n\nThe WTF Years article seems to suggest that you'll find some ideal path in your 20's and live happily ever after. That's not what happens for the vast majority of people, and everyone questions their life decisions from time to time. \n\nPart of me wishes I was in software engineering when I was 22, and part of me is very happy that I spent my 20's working part-time jobs and spending my days surfing and learning random things while my friends were stuck in offices. \n\nThe grass is always greener... I'd say lower expectations and just try shit out. Trust yourself to alter your course once you have more life experiences under your belt. 
3	I'm a 23-year-old data scientist, not a software engineer but similar type of work. Honestly, I nothing my job. I don't love it, I don't hate it. I work in a 9-5 office staring at a computer screen, and I deal with an unbelievable amount of corporate bullshit. But I get left alone a lot, sometimes my work is really interesting, and I get paid way more than I deserve.  \nI feel like I recently turned a corner and climbed out of my WTF years. I spent a lot of college thinking that I'd made a mistake and I was gonna hate my career. It turns out there's more to life than just your job, especially if you have money. I work so that when I'm not at work I can do all sorts of fun shit. I also have enough saved up so that if one day I can't take it anymore, I can up and quit my job and not worry for a while.  \nI would say graduate and take whatever programming job you can find that looks not-awful. If you hate it, quit and get a different job, the job market for software devs is great. If it turns out you hate all programming jobs, then by all means quit and move to Australia.
1	Could you go into business for yourself? I'm currently at a disadvantage in my business, not having any programming knowledge, but am constantly using brain and body to solve problems and implement new strategies. \n\nI'd recommend entrepreneurship to any istp. The challenges are stressful but it scratches that istp itch of always tinkering and problem solving. 
1	I do helpdesk, i don't answer the phone calls i call users back and i figure out WTF broke this time. 
1	I'm actually in the same position situation wise. Last year of college about to get my degree in environmental science. While I do generally like the course, I really am not sure if its what I want to do with my life. I'm actually not much of an outdoors person at all, and coding of any level make me want to put my head through the wall. While I personally feel like I'd like a job in consulting, I've taken no steps and haven't even researched jobs to apply to because of this hesitation.\n\nMy family has a small business which is mostly selling at craft shows and corporate events and I'm planning to spend a few months there. while its a really small operation and still pretty early, sales are over 120k annually with I'd say 60% profit margin with a lot that can be done to make those numbers better. It's definitely not construction levels of manual labor, but theres a lot of labor involved. My parents won't be happy cause they want me to get a real job with stability and benefits but.. :/\n\nSorry if this is just a personal rant but it feels really good to get this off my chest, because it feels awkward talking about most of everyone I know. But I guess if I had to sum it up and put a kind of message, I'd say that I'm going to apply my life philosophy to it, that being, "everything will work itself out", or simply put, I'm gonna wing it. No one asked to be born into this world, you should do what makes you happy. Life is short so make the most of it, but also know that we're still young and can still make a new start. At least thats what people tell me.\n\nIf I can make a final suggestion, if you have any interest in environmental science and doing field work, then I feel like it might be something worth looking into. I know a few people actually who transferred in from programming backgrounds. Despite the stereotype and what you may be thinking, theres actually a decent amount of computer work. I had to take 2 levels of stat, 3 courses in GIS, and a quite a few labs that are statistical data based. Depending on how your courses double count, it could take as little as 2 years but don't quote me on that.
1	Do what I do and work remotely. Program a bit every day, explore foreign countries the rest of the time. Plenty of programming jobs are remote; it's probably the most remote-friendly job you can have.
1	Hey mate, I work in Australia in a big tech company. Most of my buddies at the office are software engineers (wouldn’t be surprised if many are ISTP). A couple are in management and they generally seem quite content. Feel free to hit me up if you want to come visit for lunch, talk about the tech industry, etc
1	As someone who has my own web design company, I strongly urge you not to give up on software dev. It's in huge demand, pays a lot, and you can be an independent contractor/freelancer... meaning you can still travel, set your own hours, and never step foot in an office. It does take work to run your own business, but your chosen field is perfect for the lifestyle you want.\n\nAnd you can supplement your own business, until it really takes off, with service-industry jobs (bartending, waiting tables, etc.). Also, you can start by taking small jobs on [upwork.com](https://upwork.com) to build your portfolio. Or, you can just work through upwork forever.
1	Finish school and go do something somewhere that you think you will like. The degree and/or certs will help get your foot in the door years later if that comes around. Life will be a mix of jobs, people, places, and things you sometimes like and sometimes don't. I work to live while others live to work.  Balance
11	Last time I cried update / relationship advice	Two days ago, the last time I (24) cried was August 4th, 2018. One day ago, the little streams returned to flow down my cheeks once again. I'm considering breaking up with my gf (25) of a little over a year, and I need to vent and ask you all for any advice. Since this is my first real relationship, it would follow that this is my first breakup. We've worked through religious differences and political differences, but I can't seem to shake our communication differences. I wanted to avoid going in depth, but I think this recent incident really highlights everything. If you want to skip everything below and just lay down some break up advice in the comments, that works too. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Incident: When my gf gets angry she takes it out on everyone around her. We worked on the same team until this morning when her promotion to assistant manager of that team was announced alongside my promotion (non-managerial) to a different team. She was going to miss the meeting because she woke up late and got stuck in traffic. She had never called into a meeting before, so I sent her the number and code 30 minutes ahead of the announcement and she didn't call in, arrived half way through the meeting, refused to show up late out of embarrassment, and continued to text me about how angry she is at everyone. We've been through this song and dance so many times that I decided to tell her that I'm disappointed that she didn't call in and that her anger is misplaced on the people around her. It felt like she disregarded my help. I said this in person, and then she let her anger build for half an hour before sending me texts saying how angry she is at me for making this all about myself (waiting to text me is a common occurrence in our fights). I told her not to talk to me if she was going to direct her anger at me. Communication ceased for the day on my call. This is a more favorable outcome than the common alternative: ignoring me without warning.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Issue: By the end of the work day she's texting me again and wants me to come up to her desk. As usual, she's pretending like nothing is wrong. I think this behavior messes with me more than I previously realized. I ask if we're going to talk about the issue and she says "what is there to talk about?" I slowly leave the room until she tells me to come back. I wait for 30 minutes in silence while she does some daily organization in her notebook. While waiting, I get a text from my younger sister apologizing for putting her emotional issues with our parents on me last year (parents are terrible communicators, got into lots of fights in front of her when I left for college, and she had blamed me for not being there for her). Finally my gf turns to talk, can't find anything to say, sits down next to me, starts to touch me, and then tells me that she's over it and wants to move on. I say I can't keep doing this. It's an exhausting emotional rollercoaster for me to have a fight, mull on it all day, and then suddenly it didn't happened; rinse and repeat. I show her my sister's text and reiterate to her that my parents are terrible communicators, so communication is the one thing I need to be super solid in the relationship. At this point I just start tearing up because we've been through this many times before and it never changes. My gf then says, which is essentially her mantra now, that I'm going to reach a breaking point and break up with her. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNail in the Coffin: She texts me later to remind me that people aren't perfect, that she's pretty damn good compared to most girls, and that I'll realize how good I had it with her if I break up with her and date other people (it's actually been a huge struggle involving religious sexual shame, an overbearing obsession with marriage, and actions made from jealousy causing a coworker to hit on her for months including a flat-out refusal to let me talk to the coworker after some other coworkers found out). I clarify that the reason wouldn't be me wanting someone better, but rather that our communication styles don't match. She says it's exhausting to talk about her feelings and that I (an ISTP lol) always want to talk about every minute feeling, to which I clarify that I only talk about my feelings to her and only when we need to resolve something. I go off on a tangent about mindfulness meditation as a good practice for understanding emotions better and she says it sounds like I'm recruiting her to a cult. Here is where I (non-religious) took it too far by sending her (a southern baptist) bible verses about anger since she doesn't want to listen to me talk about mindfulness. She gets angry again and tells me that most of the time I act like I'm better than her and that I need to get off my high horse (in my mind I'm doing my best to qualify everything I say specifically to avoid appearing arrogant/superior. I do seem to have a problem giving her excessive advice when, in reality, she doesn't want any advice from anyone).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just feel so many different feelings. I feel hopeless because she's unresponsive to my concerns. I feel ignored because we have the same issues on repeat. I feel hypocritical for thinking she's exaggerating claims of arrogance and self-centeredness for her own defense. I feel weak for loving her so much. I feel weak for wishing I didn't love her so much. I feel frustrated that I'm not strong enough to break it off.  I'm just mostly confused because I don't know what to do. It seems so simple because I've typed out this whole post to try and convince myself to end it, but I'll see her in a few hours and I can almost guarantee everything will somehow be back to normal with us until some other incident starts this all over again. I do think she's right that I'll reach a breaking point. I just don't know if the breaking point is now and, if it's not now, do I have the strength to make necessary changes before the breaking point is reached. I probably just need to rip off the bandaid, but there are only bad times to do it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry for the essay. I sacrificed a night's sleep to vent at this corner of the internet because I value your opinions, so thank you to anyone who manages to get through this whole thing.
11	Man, whatever you're getting out of the relationship doesn't sound worth it on the whole compared to the amount of mental/emotional drain it comes with. One way or the other whether you regret the decision or wish you'd done it sooner, and least all the drama and bullshit will be over with and you can go back to just getting on with shit. 
6	It’s time to end it, if you don’t do it now you’ll do it sooner or later.
4	This sounds like an absolutely miserable way to live... Sorry you're having a hard time breaking it off.
4	First of all I want to say I love ISTPs. I noticed some striking similarities between what you describe and my relationship with one, about three years ago. My first real love was with an ISTP and I witnessed the first time he cried over a girl (me)....when I had driven three hours out to visit him in a different state and he broke up with me (over religious and political differences—him being a strict Lutheran and conservative, me being agnostic and quite progressive). We had been together for about a year as well, most of the relationship long distance Bc he was in the military and doing some highly specialized training. It was an extremely hard breakup, but ultimately it was necessary as those religious differences couldn’t be reconciled. \n\nAs you mentioned, there was a lot of shame around sex, and also he was so scared of going to hell and me going there with him if I didn’t conform to Christianity. His family and their approval was massively important to him, and they couldn’t get over the fact that I ‘wasn’t raised in the church’. A feminist, strong willed female was basically the spawn of satan. \n\nBut just between him and I, we were so happy together day to day and we easily saw a future together. He felt like part of me, in a way no one has ever felt before. We would talk about marriage, kids, traveling and even retirement.  But when we would fight over religion, it was like he became a different person who spoke this bizarre religious language which I didn’t understand (“I want you to find salvation in Jesus” etc). And I would be like “what does that even mean???” \n\nI know you mentioned you have worked through religious differences, and if that’s really the case good for you. I just know it’s an ongoing issue, especially if people are really engulfed in it. \n\nIn terms of your gfs behavior, definitely sounds unhealthy. Do you know her mbti? It is incredibly frustrating to be in a cycle of arguments/outburst and then having it be brushed off like it’s nothing. My mom has BPD and I spent like ten years with her in that vicious, exhausting cycle. \n\nI agree—communication is so important. And it doesn’t seem like it going to get better with her if you’ve been discussing this for a while. Have you considered couples therapy? That is one option if you really feel like she’s someone you could marry and spend a lifetime with. At least in that case you could say you tried everything. \n\nAlso lol about her saying you want to discuss all emotions. ISTPs don’t do emotions, and it takes a shit load of introspection and love for and ISTP to even pay attention and make sense of the emotions that a certain person elicits. It’s unfortunate that she doesn’t realize this. \n\n\nBut in terms of breaking it off, I’m sure my ex ISTP had a lot of those internal debates you discuss over breaking up with me. I was so in love with him and convinced we could make it work (and convinced religion didn’t truly mean as much to him and it did his family....and that he just hadn’t figured that out yet). But like you describe, the good times are so good that he couldn’t do it. It really took me asking him a million questions one time (are you happy with me? Do you think this is going to work? What do you truly need regarding religion?) that he actually came to the conclusion it wasn’t going to work. I was really heartbroken that I had to pull it out from him when it wasn’t even what I wanted to begin with. He just cried basically the whole time I packed my things to leave....which confused me so much Bc he never cried. I was like “what do you want here?”. Was brutal. \n\nWhen I got all my stuff out to my car he wanted a hug but I wouldn’t give him one (I was so incredibly hurt and mad he would do this before I had to make a three hour drive home) and I drove off watching him cry through the rear view mirror :( \n\nWas a very sad and long ride home indeed and I just sobbed like the next couple days. \n\nSorry that was such a downer story! But just saying I relate dude. I understand what it’s like when ISTPs love, how hard it can be for them to get there, and how difficult it can be to be logical and rational (something ISTPs pride themselves in being) in the face of love. \n\nIm happy to talk about this in more detail. Hope this was helpful in some way. Message me if you’d like :) 
3	Imagine waking up tomorrow and there's no one texting you about how the world is out to get them and everything is going wrong and you need to fix it but also doesn't actually want you to fix anything. Imagine being with someone who is listens to you, who understands logical advice, who will talk through things, and who won't lie about how they're feeling. Sound good? Yeah, dump her. It will suck for a bit, and then you'll feel so much better.
3	Whenever a girl or person says they are better than most people...That's a red flag. It's basically saying, yeah I suck but I suck less than others therefore I don't need to improve on myself.
2	Holy shit. \n\nTry being single for a while, I think it’ll do you some good. 
2	Oh man, I am so so sorry you’re going through this. The post was so hard for me to read because I felt really bad for you. I know you love her a lot, but it doesn’t seem like this is something that’s going to work long term, simply because she doesn’t seem to want to change to make you happier. Even when she sees you crying she makes it all about her. I can relate to her because I used to act like her when I was depressed, anxious and insecure and I’m really not proud of that, but I can empathize. ( I guess that’s partly why this post was so hard for me to read...it reminded me of all the who I used to behave and hurt people) At the same time, you sound like a really nice guy and you sound miserable so you will have to end it at some point. Feel free to pm if you need someone to vent to during this process or have more questions about how to break up with her. Best of luck.
1	Come and lay on my bosom, babe...you need a hug❤️ \n\nSending good vibes your way. 
10	Do ISTPs sometimes disappear for weeks at a time to process/figure out important matters?	Without giving too much info away, I recently had some drama with an ISTP - this is drama that ensued from mistakes on both my part and the ISTP's part. I texted the ISTP and ultimately asked them to make a major decision that would resolve all of our drama. They have now disappeared, and it's been a week since they last responded. Are they just taking the time to process information/make a final decision?\n\nHopefully this post wasn't too vague, just didn't want to make it too obvious because this ISTP is also a redditor. Thanks!
13	personally i do have a habit of disappearing for weeks, but not when making important decisions. istp’s are usually very confrontational so the fact that they haven’t answered you in weeks leads me to believe they read the message, ignored it, and moved on with your life–something i suggest you do too. 
8	Yeah if I become uncomfortable around someone I avoid them. Plus I'm very busy and don't have time to socialize. Sometimes I take it too far and become a hermit but meh.
6	> I texted the ISTP and ultimately asked them to make a major decision that would resolve all of our drama. \n\nThat reads like an ultimatum to me. "All of our drama goes away if YOU do something." Depending on the circumstances, there's a good chance I'd walk away like it seems like they did. 
9	Your istp sees you as being unreasonable, rude, or for some reason no longer worth his time. Whatever the issue, he probably explained himself many times and figures it is a waste of time to talk again. Not knowing the details myself, my basic answer is no, he is not processing information. That happened in a split second days ago. I speculate that you are insisting on an answer and won’t take no as an answer.\n\nGood luck, though.
3	No, I just forget to talk to people tbh
3	Ultimatums are stupid. You made a very foolish mistake.
2	Hard to say without more info, but I can speculate based on your words and description of the situation.\n\n  I usually don't want to continue talking to people who treat me badly or refuse to validate my concerns or conclusions in a situation. Maybe your text completely dismissed what they were trying to convey to you.
2	Some heavy things happened in my life last year, I just texted my closest friends that I'd be gone for a bit and disappeared for as long as I needed. \n\nThey'll come back to you when they're ready.
2	Yeaa but if it seems like I disappeared for that long it’s probably because I’m not coming back or texting back, I don’t take a week to process a something unless it a big life change someone’s asking of me, like a job or a big purchase.\n\nI’m currently getting ready to do this with a girl and I’ve done it with other people, after I explained something or a problem many times in a lot of different ways I’ll just ghost them, or stop coming around with out saying anything. I don’t know your situation but if it’s a disagreement you guys have been having for awhile that could be why their doing it.
2	It's hard to give a definitive answer without knowing more about the situation but I once had a falling-out with an emotionally abusive friend who was upset that I was finally standing up for myself and not letting her walk all over me the way I had for years. I blocked her on all social media and then ghosted her because I wanted out of the relationship and wasn't interested in discussing it with her any further (which could potentially be what is happening here). I seriously doubt that your ISTP is having trouble processing information, rather they probably already made a decision and this is their way of communicating it to you because long emotional conversations are exhausting.
2	"I texted the ISTP and ultimately asked them to make a major decision that would resolve all of our drama."\n\nI'd also walk away in a heartbeat, to be honest. 
1	It sounds to me like you asked for too much and now they are processing the request. The more you asked, the longer it will take them to process it. Even after processing it the chances are that they will refuse to make a final decision, because we don't like commitment and anything final is too much of a commitment. \n
1	i'm going to make an assumption (based off of what i would do) that because the situation was dramatic to begin with, your istp now no longer cares about it and because talking to you would be bringing it back up again, you have not heard from them. \n\nso that's it. you just have to move on. when they talk to you again don't bring it up. if you do, be sure that you're ready to move on from it as quickly as they will want to. 
1	If i have drama with someone i tend to wanna solve it as fast as poasible if i Care for that person and our relationship. However i can easely cut our someone who i feeling isnt worth the time and energy etc.
1	ultimatums are a sure way to lose an istp. or anyone tbh. 
1	kinda late here but i don't ever do this. it usually takes me very little time to make a decision, i will disappear for long periods of time but not to think about anything in particular
3	I have a question about ISTPs and smiling	Do you guys notice you, and other ISTPs never smile in your pictures and selfies, or just in general, and why is that is it inferior Fe?
13	I smile for pictures and I smile when I am doing something that makes me actively happy, and I smile in a social situation where it is expected, such as church
6	I personally don't smile in pictures let alone take pictures, I hate being fake so you won't catch me posing. If you don't catch me smiling naturally then you're basically not going to get a photo of me smiling.
2	I only smile sarcastically but I don't think it's inferior Fe though
2	smiling on cue vs smiling because you actually want to
2	Personally any time I see a photo of me smiling it gives me the creeps. 
2	It is a natural reaction to when something is funny smiling for a picture is forced. I have no issue smiling when I think of something that makes me happy but I will not force it.
2	I don't take selfies.\n\nBut I'll smile for photos-- at least I thought I did until I realized my lips barely moved.
2	Even Nick Offerman smiles.
12	Practically speaking, what do you think ISTP do better than ESTP?	Estp probably are better at social talents because of higher Fe, and reacting faster(se), but what do you think your higher Ni and higher Ti help you do better?
48	ISTPs shut up better
13	Introversion
10	Strategizing. My ESTP friends do better at sales, I do better at poker. Both types are good at reading people, Higher Fe and Se translates to better relationship building, higher Ni and Ti translates to better analysis of what people are thinking, knowing when someone is bluffing, and generally having a better danger sense. That said, my ESTP friends are still good at poker, and I am good at sales - these are relative strengths.
10	Stay out of trouble
8	Give us 5 minutes and it'l be everything
3	We are a rational type, so we make better judgments than our irrational twin.
1	Istp with high te?	Okay so im having a really hard time lately cause i feel like i have high amounts of te and maybe even si, but im also pretty sure im an istp. \n\n\nI like to organize things and have things clean. It frustrates me when things are undone when i do them. I also normally follow the rules.  However i also feel that theyre silly sometimes. So now im confused between ti and te and dont think i understand them enough in real world examples. \n\nAs for si, i often think about the past and relate or remember things because of something i did before. Could it be our se ni? I also love to make things, woodworkings, props, gifts for close fsmily and friends. Help meeeehhh o brethren
4	About the "high" amount of Te, I think it's just the combination of Ti and Se at work. Your Ti says that you should probably keep your stuff organized or follow rules because YOU think it's right. Se makes it happen. I don't know about the Si part, though. Isn't that normal to people? IXXPs are hard to type because we just do anything that we deem right. I even mistyped as entj.
2	More literally, Te is about a preference for external facts and structure, whereas Ti is a preference for organizing one's internal thoughts.... I'm most definitely an ISTP and I don't like my place being really messy.. cause then I can't move freely in it. >.> That would be Se. I also don't tend to like organize, but I like things to be organized so I don't waste a bunch of time trying to find something that shouldn't be lost. I would much rather be doing something more fun or productive. >.>\n\nAs for rules... the ISTP that is constantly breaking rules is gonna have issues in long run. It's just not practical. But obviously, they exist. At times, I'll ignore certain rules that I deem stupid, but I'm certainly not looking to break all the rules. I do try to follow them when it's something that not a huge deal... Although I have this internal rebellious desire to break a rule that I have to fight off at times. But frankly, on a practical level, breaking rules can cause a lot of unnecessary drama or issues so.. sometimes it's just not worth it... or I'd rather be more careful in choosing my battles. \n\nAs to the past.. We all technically refer to the past. The difference is that Si users tend to be very detail oriented because they naturally internalize sensory data, whereas Ni users internalize impressions. We all reference whatever we have stored away from the past. The reason Si users are known for being past oriented is that they'll rely on detailed past memories and when they don't have those detailed memories, they'll tend to stress out because they don't readily trust their intuition. They'll mimic what they know has worked in past and usually have detailed memories of those things. Ni users are more accustomed to "abstract memories" and hunches and the like so they're usually a little bit more comfortable guessing. \n
6	20 y/o ISTP and 21 y/o ENTJ	I've been seeing an ENTJ for the last 6 months now, previously was (and still is) my best friend.  He's honestly great, our interactions are easy and efficient. They're  straightforward and philosophical, hilarious and fun. Its an ideal relationship and I'd go as far as to say that I have fallen in love with him. Even if I hate connotations associated with that word.\n\nBut lately I've been having issues with my living situation at the moment. (Unexpected changes, abuse. He lives far away from me so its hard to communicate)  It's difficult to focus, my usual habits of wanting to be alone have resurfaced. I forget that I'm in a relationship and actively avoid communicating. Just feels forced and confining even if he's independent and gets that. \n\nI realise that the issue lies with me. Honestly I like the freedom that being single gives, you don't have to worry about anyone else and they don't have to worry about me. There comes a point where relationships require a certain amount of expectation and I hate that. \n\nSo I'm thinking of ending this soon? It's all just confusing . Even if he's someone I care about I feel like he deserves better. A reliable partner. I've always been a cool best friend anyway and I miss that. Just hope he understands where I'm coming from. (I do have a heart)\n\nI'm  curious to see if this is normal ISTP behaviour? Anyone experience something similar. \n\n
4	[deleted]
3	Yes. 28 year old female istp over here and just went through something very similar towards the end of my last relationship. I resonated HARD with the feelings you described. 
2	Personally don't think you should, if you believe he deserves someone better then you are the best for him.
1	Yeh, not a female but usually when I’m in a relationship I end up getting the feeling you described. Needing the alone time, still enjoying the friendship part but not wanting to commit etc. \n\nNot sure if it is ever going to be different for me.\n\n\n
5	Career/life ISTP advice!	Hello everyone my name is Logan. I’m 19 years old and 100% sure I am an ISTP. I’m taking Pre Trades Apprenticeship classes right now thinking I might want to go into that field. Specifically an Electrician. Both of my parents went the college route so I didn’t get to experience building things/fixing things. I love to fix and problem solve. At the same time I absolutely love driving. Which has led me to consider becoming an airline pilot. I love flying. Just going to an airport I get exited to take off and land. I guess with more experience I will find out what career I want to go into. But as of now all of my high school career was geared towards the college route. Pushed down my throat like all these other high schools are doing across the US. But I love experiencing things and manipulating tools/ machines. Either route sounds good. I just wish I had more action items and a agenda to follow to better understand my place in the world and find what I’m destined to do. Any input helps. FIRST TIME POSTING ON HERE! Let’s see how this goes 😂
4	Tradesmen are a dying breed yet still extremely necessary and valued. \n\nI encourage anyone with interest in the trades to go for it. I absolutely know college isn't for everyone. It certainly wasn't for me. 
2	Follow that optimism and drive. When you hit rock bottom, these two things will help you surface back to life.
1	Trades are great! I've been in HVAC for about 17 years and am a senior tech at a school district. 
1	I'm an electrician and recommend it 100%.
1	I wish I'd gone into Engineering or Electricianing (that's a word, right?). I think they're both ideal career choices for ISTPs. Not to say being a pilot isn't, I just don't think it's such a stereotypical ISTP choice
1	I went to college straight after school and dropped out after a couple years. Wish I'd went straight into a trade. Theory isn't my strong suit much prefer practical careers. I am a chef.
1	I am 100% an ISTP and I'm about to start my second job in the circus. I couldn't be more fulfilled and happy :)
1	I wish I'd knew what you know at the age of 19. Unfortunately I'm at the near age of 28 having spent 6 years at University studying something I no longer want to do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe working world is different to learning in a class setting. I much preferred working and found I learnt more on the job than I did sitting in lectures and having a non-engaging professor talk for hours on end. I'm sure your leaning is more hands on focus.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf being an Electrician is something you want to do, do it! Either way, becoming a pilot will require some form of financing and working as an electrician could possibly make that happen.
1	I could never do something like be a pilot because there are too many rules and procedures to follow.
19	When was the last time you cried?	I think the last time I cried was at least 4 years ago. Sometimes I wish I could just ball my eyes out and just release all these emotions but it feels like an impossible task. I don’t cry during movies or anything and I’m not trying to sound like a tough guy. The closest I could get to crying was this little whimper noise I made while tripping on ayahuasca and not even a tear, I was trying to force myself to make it happen. 
24	Last time I cried was last year on the morning of August 4th after taking 10 grams of mushrooms the night before. Was washing the dishes when I remembered some traumatic bullying from my childhood that I had repressed. Kept doing the dishes. Very therapeutic. 
15	if we're not counting crying from laughter then it'd be 5 years for me \n:/
14	I cry when i feel like crying nowadays.\n\nI'll keep the stoic robot mode for really fucked up/urgent situations. \n\nIts not good for our mental health in the long run if we keep it turned on.
12	It was about 4 years ago.  Major depression, but I didn't cry until I had to tell my mom I was probably going to fail out of college.  I'm a lot better now.  I was able to graduate and I now have a promising career.  The time before that would have probably been when I was in fifth grade or so.  
7	If I get super shit faced I'll have a pity party and miss a specific ex and have a good cry.\n\nI tear up for movies and touching posts all the time. \n\nLast time I really cried was when my first relationship ended.  Burst out in tears in a train carriage with a Chinese family. I'm sure they were like WTF but it didn't matter. \n\nCrying is cathartic! People should do it more.
7	Wow, I'm I'm such a baby compared to you guys. I've cried twice in the past 6 months; once in an arguement and once while incredibly sick with strep.
5	Remember that not processing emotions (in this case crying) is like holding onto a glass of water at first it's easy but as time goes on it weighs heavier and heavier on you. As istps we are not prone to processes our emotions but once we understand the formula we will always process our emotions. When something upsets you just let your self think about it and then expell it with a burp, shit, piss, most common one is crying or yelling. Once you process the emotion and "expell" it you will feel a lot better! It's a simple formula deal with emotion by dwelling on the troubling thought, cry, yell, punch, forgive, or communicate and boom you now feel a lot better.
4	Yesterday actually. I was slicing habaneros for a chili cookoff and i stupidly wiped by brow and got capsaicin on my right eyelid.\n\nBefore this it was maybe a year ago to a game soundtrack.\n\nBefore THAT, I don't remember.
4	Last time I cried due to stress: Last December, when a water pipe in my closet burst, soaking most of my clothes.  It was a combination of knowing that I live in a POS building, having something I worked hard to obtain (my clothes, and many of them are quite nice) get damaged due to something beyond my control, and realizing that I might not be able to salvage my things.  \n\nCried because something emotionally moved me:  Three weeks ago, when I watched 'The Theory of Everything' on Netflix while I was drunk.  That final scene where the movie rewound back to when Stephen and Jane first met, set to "The Arrival of the Birds" by the Cinematic Orchestra, had me fucking bawling.  Goddamn you Eddie Redmayne for making this stonehearted ISTP feel that way.
4	The last time I had a casual thought about *The Iron Giant*...\n\nI get tearful at a number of movies, especially since becoming a parent. \n\nActually ugly crying? I've done it exactly twice as an adult. Once in frustration with my marriage 12 years ago, and once in a powerful cathartic healing moment a couple of years ago.
3	at least once a year over the same event usually 3 or 4 times a year been about 17 years now 
3	Pluck your nose hairs, you'll cry lol. \n/Joke aside, hope you get better soon dude, maybe you didn't reach a breaking point or something, it may be a matter of time.
3	Wait! What kind of an istp am I, a movie made me shed a tear-🤔?
3	My cat died around December so I’ve been crying a lot.
2	Um like two days ago watching Captain America Winter Soldier lol. Not even just tearing up, it was a pretty steady stream for a hot minute. I love getting immersed into movies! Super fun, especially horror movies, I get to connect with characters and feel like I'm living another life that isn't mine, even if it is just for an hour or two.\n\nThe last time I could remember crying from intrinsic emotion though was maybe six years ago? When I was an angsty teenager suffering from overbearing stereotypical Asian parents. I guess I just don't use crying as a way to express my sadness anymore. It's not a bad thing to never cry, unless you're purposely holding back or view it as a sign of weakness. Just important to let out your emotions some place else, like through talking or through a creative outlet.
2	I don't even remember 
2	This past Saturday.
1	I cried when she left me and I also cry a lot during anime.
1	Back in October when I watched Coco for the first time. I didn't expect it to be that sad but it was.
1	I tend to cry when I get over tired...which is like every other day
1	Last year when my dog died
1	It obviously depends on what’s going on in my life, but if I’m super stressed I’ll just cry all the time, it kind of helps get things out of my head. However it seems to be tiny, unimportant things that make me cry, whenever it’s something important I don’t seem to be able to cry. 
1	i cry pretty regularly, usually out of frustration with my relationship. feelings are hard and don’t make a lot of sense sometimes. haha
1	I cry a lot. Usually it's over music, but not even necessarily sad music. I think it is what people call frisson but instead of getting goosebumps, I cry.
1	Yesterday after an argument with my mother. Before that, a few months.
1	I've watched a few romance animes that made me tear up a bit over the last few months, but the list is maybe 3 or 4 and it barely counts as crying. Even though if you read through the comment threads of some of these shows it feels like walking your way through a wake. One made me cry a lot and I can't explain it, tears just started pouring out. The last time that happened was at my grandmother's funeral over a year ago. Before that I can't really remember.
1	this morning lol
1	Full on bawling was when a family member died 8 months ago. I get the occasional eye-leakage but it's literally 4 tears and I'm good again.\n\nWish I could cry it all out sometimes but alas.
1	A few times Dec 14 between Dec 22. Turned off my mothers life support on the 14th.
1	A little after my grandfather's funeral oof.
1	Little under 12 years and childhood friends funeral 
1	I nearly cried yesterday because I keep not moving forward with the situation with my crush,,,,,, I'm just leaving it stagnant because I'm a coward but I guess it made me sad because I missed an opportunity
1	Yesterday 
1	I’m an ESFJ and I cry every day so it’s interesting to see the comparison
13	Dealing With Te Dom's Logic (help please)	I realize this may get many downvotes, however it feels needed that I make this post. I can't stand a lot (not all) of Te doms when it comes to discussions or debates. Here are some things that happens when I talk to them: they tend to assume that you are disagreeing when you are not, making arguments that doesn't actually dispute nor prove your point but is rather unrelated and then assuming everything you say is invalid because they fail to understand, then calling you a know-it-all or arrogant sometimes even after putting in conscious effort to narrow down your statement to a few words etc. This is incredibly annoying however, I realize that I need to become more effective at communicating with them as well, though I continuously seem to fail at it. What are some advices on how to talk and discuss with Te doms from fellow ISTPs?
7	One of, if not THE, biggest weakness of a Te dom is their sense of pride (aka a fragile ego). Most of them consider themselves to be amongst a special breed and usually attain accolades throughout their lives as a result. They're also extraverted so they usually feel no shame letter the world know it as well.
4	I’m still struggling with this daily with the Te-doms in my life. I don’t think it can be solved by just one side, but that might also be a cop-out. \n\nThere’s a reason I’m constantly making shitty jokes about Te types. Understanding what’s going on and being able to work with it in the moment are two different things.\n\nThe only success I’ve had is in asking prompting questions and letting them do most of the talking. Even my attempts at active listening are usually received with confusion or scorn because it sounds like I’m just parroting or something, to them. 
3	I’ve simply given up on high Te users. Many of them are assholes who don’t even want to understand you, just writes everyone who is not them of as an idiot.
3	This might not be very helpful, but I live in a family of Te doms and I've found the best policy is to just conserve my energy and not get into arguments with Te's. I keep my opinions, knowledge, etc. to myself instead of subjecting myself to an exhausting browbeating session where carefully reasoned thoughts are not welcome or appreciated.\n
3	Just chiming in to say that this complaint is common between any two types with significantly differing cognitive functions. As an ENFP I feel this way about Se, Fe, and Ti.
3	Hi there, I’m neither Te dom nor ISTP, but I *am* a pretty strong Te user who often has frustrating arguments with my ISTP spouse. Here are some things I’ve noticed about our conflicts:\n\n(1) I don’t give a shit about WHY something works. If it is a solution and it’s effective, then boom. I’m done. Moving on. It works. He wants to continue to entertain various possibilities or unlikely scenarios that might play out and prove to be an exception to the rule, which I find highly annoying. I used to even wonder if he was just looking for an excuse to argue or trying to be difficult. \n\n(2) He has a fuzzy, spatial logic that mostly serves to justify his inferior Fe. And he doesn’t seem to realize it. I’ve pointed it out and he thinks it doesn’t matter. So the rules of a logical debate do not apply. He will resort to straw man arguments, ad hominems, deflections, gas lighting.\n\n(3) he shuts out any incoming information that conflicts with his preconceived notions or, going back to my previous statement, goes against what he “feels” is right. He also entertains bat shit insane phenomena and superstition like chi and karma that cannot be scientifically proven.\n\n(4) he questions medical professionals, legal advisors, teachers, pretty much anyone in any field of expertise, almost as though it’s his duty. I got major problems questioning a doctor who went to school for twelve years and practiced for another fifteen, when it comes to chemical reactions and medications and anatomy and shit I know nothing about. Yet my husband is a contractor and feels *A-okay* antagonizing someone in any field of expertise, as though they have to convince him first, before they can be taken seriously.\n\nEtc.
2	You shouldn't have issues projecting your logic on mature Te users. It's only the immature who have too much pride to admit when they're lacking.\n\nMy two best friends are Te doms: ENTJ and ESTJ, and sure, they can have their moments where their pride gets in the way. But they'll usually accept input if the logic is better than theirs.
2	Just remember that Ti doms share a good deal of function with Te doms. The difference is that Te doms follow "the rules" and Ti doms make their own rules.
1	> however it feels needed that I make this post\n\nnah
1	You don't really need to convince them of your logic. You can listen to them and go do your thing.
1	If you have to improve your Te (ISTPs' nemesis function) to relate to them. This is the only solution. If you can't, then don't bother with them. They live in a different world. 
1	My best advice if you are arguing on how to do something; is to just do it your way and if went succcesfully, show the results in their face.
23	Monotone	Are you monotone? If so, what if anything did you try to change? \n\nI mean yea I don’t get excited about much so I guess it comes through in my voice. 
16	Pretty monotone here. Didn't do much about it. Coworkers despise it though.
8	I'd say my  bf (ISTP) has a decently monotone voice MOST of the time. However his facial expressions are extremely monotone and hard to read (Not as much for me because I spend so much time with him but I get so lost sometimes lol).  I don't think he tries to change himself, he doesn't see the need.\n\n\nHe tells me stories about how frustrated people get or how they'll joke around with him about it haha. One of my friends (who has trained himself hard to read expressions)  met him and was so confused the whole time, my bf and I got a good laugh. (We were nice). 
5	I've been called monotone.  But who cares?  
5	My face is pretty monotone but not my voice. 
5	Ya and doesn’t help that I have resting bitch face \n\nAt least it reduces wrinkles :D
4	Monotone when I’m not interested in the topic. \n\nAnimated like a crazy wild-eyed mad scientist when I am, think Doc from Back to the Future. 
3	Uhh, no, well, I kinda had to work on the way I acted, with both facial and vocal expressions and don't think about it anymore. Theatre helped in HS. I just wish my eyebrow muscles could help me show a bit more sadness like cartoon characters...or like Jon hamm
3	Yes. Students didn't like when I would read to the class and that's the exact words they used.
2	Yeah, My Facial Expression and Voice are super monotone which clearly annoys people that I’m taking to because they can’t read me.
2	I used to be more monotone. Didn’t do anything on purpose, just kind of picked up characteristics here and there. Listening to podcasts drastically changed the cadence and tone of my speech. Interacting with animated people, too. 
2	My default is monotone but I’ve developed a range of emotional expressions through practice. Honestly, doing theatre in high school and then being an NCO in the Army were two things that really made me more outwardly expressive.\n\nSo pretty much get into something where the impact of your expression is the tool you need for your task and you will learn.
2	I used to have this problem, along with not enunciating words and resting bitch face. I wouldn't care except for people wondering if I'm okay or why I'm pissed
2	I've learned to replicate other people emotions, tone, expressions, etc in most situations. Unless you know me when you'd never know I'm attempting to be human with you. If it's a situation I've yet to master then I become your typical istp, initiate robot and disappear the moment you blink.
1	These answers are so interesting, because my ISTP (confirmed) friend is very expressive and excitable. He loves to explain things to me, especially how he became really good at okcupid in his dating days, lol. another suspected ISTP friend of mine was pretty expressive too, especially when he was very excited about showing me the tiny house that he built. I guess there are variations in ISTP...Alex Honnold seems like the classic monotone ISTP (if he is one). 
1	I'm not, plus I'm p much happy all day long and on social interactions I like to change the way I mention things as much as possible
1	I am sometimes but its only when i dont givea fuck
1	My fiance always tells me I'm like a robot. Then he makes fun of me by making robot noises. Be-boop-boop. \n\nI get really excited about some topics though. (Like whatever my hobby is for the month). I'm pretty certain the excitement comes through in my voice when I talk about those things.
1	Apparently I can sound very apathetic even when I'm not. According to my one sister I'm more monotone than a lot of people but I'm less monotone than my INTJ sister.
6	How often do you go get lit at the club?	
22	Never. Waste of time. 
9	Never. After about 30 minutes it stresses me out and i just wanna go home. Way too much energy for me. 
5	Never. I get lit over video calls in the middle of the night with my friends
5	Club? Never. But I’ll get lit at a rave/festival/concert. \n\n\nClubs aren’t about the music. They’re about getting fucked up and grinding on some greasy stranger. I don’t go to shows for the people, I go for the music. And being lit makes the music more fun. 
5	The thought of a loud crowded night club makes me shudder at this point in my life lol (31)\n\nI used to visit them in my early 20’s every week or two and would get just absolutely shitfaced every time I went. Took me a while to realize I was drinking heavily to compensate for my anxiety from being in a noisy crowded club. I didn’t like the atmosphere but couldn’t admit it to myself because I didn’t wanna miss out or seem uncool. \n\nNow, every once in a while I’ll go play pool at a dive bar or something. MAYBE even karaoke if Im feeling social and crazy that night. But a dance club will forever remain a big nope 
3	Sometimes, and usually with MDMA...
3	"The club"? Never, I will never go to a club.\n\nThe bar? Not so much anymore. Used to go every Friday and stay until they closed. When they banned smoking, a lot of the people I played pool with didn't come back.\n\nBig concerts, yes. Though within reason; I've missed a few by being too messed up too early.
2	In my early 20s quite a lot. Now almost never.
1	Literally never.
1	N e v e r
1	I used to go out (almost) every week. Got lit beforehand cause we were all broke and messed around till 4. Nowadays I don't have friends so I just get hyped on music on my own till 4 in the morning in bed.
1	2019: 0 times\n\n2018: 0 times\n\n2017: twice.\n\n2016: once. \n\n2015: maybe 4?\n\nI can’t really remember further back than that.\n\nIt’s just not something I’m interested in. I don’t mind sitting down having a pint and a chat, but I can’t be doing with loud music that I hate and drunk people that I also hate. 
1	I prefer festivals and punk/metal/edm shows. The club is not my domain.   \n\n\nMDMA helps, though. 
1	Every week son, fun as fuck, good chance to engage Fe, good music, alcohol makes you stop overthinking
1	Club or Bars, Never they are the worst. \n\nAt the frat house raging with my brothers, that is another story
4	Does anyone have any experience dating their type?	When it comes to platonic and intimate relationships, I see a lot of info on how *theoretically* healthy it is to step outside of your comfort zone and constantly be challenged in your ways; personal growth and all that. But if I'm being totally honest, I've been in a LOT of relationships for someone my age and, looking back, I'm almost positive that none of them were with an ISTP. I also can't help but be intrigued when I read descriptions of other ISTP women and how they act, dress, and see the world. I find myself wanting to know more ISTP's. I get that it would be totally unhealthy to to bury myself in a world that never differs from my internal one, but just indulge me for a bit:\n\nDoes anyone have any experience dating their type? How did it go? What were the strengths and weaknesses of the relationship? What was ultimately your undoing? Would you do it again, knowing what you know now?\n\nThank you!!
3	One of my best friends from uni is a walking stereotype of ISTP. I don't know enough about functional stacks to say definitively that he is or isn't. But I assume he is.\n\nWhen the two of us are hanging out together without our SOs we just keep ramping up like the PENIS game in human form. Neither of us can say no, neither of us wants to stop.\n\nHim: Want to take a shot?\n\nMe: Yes! Wanna Sing Karaoke?!\n\nHim: YES! WANNA SET SOMETHING ON FIRE?!\n\nMe: **YES!!! BUT FIRST LETS HAVE ANOTHER SHOT!!!!**\n\nI'd imagine if we actually dated each other we would both burn out very quickly (pun totally intended). \n\nMy H is ISTJ and I think it's just the right difference of similar enough to not get on each other's nerves but different enough to keep each other on our toes. As long as I am able to keep my P-life together well enough he doesn't feel the need to push his J on me and as long as he doesn't force his J on to me I don't feel the need to run back to P in rebellion.
2	I could never date someone like me, way too infuriating
1	Dear god no, I don't need another me. Give me an Intj or an Entp any day 
3	What is your mbti and love style?	
5	quality time/physical touch, i don't like giving or getting the other ones much
6	love is for losers and weak people who cannot be alone
2	Istp, acts of service, physical touch 
1	Quality time mostly. Not sure about the other ones.
13	What style do you have guys?	It is just interesting what kind of clothing style ISTPs have.
27	zip up hoodie and jeans all day everyday, at home change jeans to sweatpants.
13	Just about every thing I wear is black and grey and must be comfortable. I  guess I don't like to stand out. I like to do my eye makeup but never any type of bright colors and skip colored lip stick. 
11	Guess ISTP's dress what they are comfortable not fashion (minimalists we are).
8	21 m istp. Im like torn half and half between wanting to wear the typical Van's, ripped jeans,  graphic t, bracelet and a logo hoodie, or like the most out- there style ever.  I'm talking tank top and samurai pants or even like flip flops, jeans, and a floral shirts.
6	Something comfortable and sporty
5	I *might* be an N (I've been looking more deeply into the function stacks but still not 100% sure)\n\nBut anyway I'm a skinny/average 23f and I have an *almost* tomboy style. Picture: skinny or fitted jeans, casual sneakers, ribbed tank, flannel or graphic top, a choker, and beanie with full-face makeup (but not overdone). That's my style like 90% of the time. The other 10% is a mix of "I'm going to my stereotypical middle-class parent's house today" and summer boho-chic in...well, the summer.\n\nEdit: oh right and pullover hoodies lol
5	Comfort over everything! I could never sacrifice feeling comfortable with looking stylish. Love sweatshirts/hoodies combined with yoga pants/comfortable pair of black jeans. Black, cobalt blue, yellow are my fav colours to wear as tops! Though most of my closet is monochrome, I don't mind some colour
4	Used to be plain, minimal logos, jeans. Now I rock Pikachu and Stitch in each other's pajamas, a pixelated Sonic and still kind of plain-ish. Nothing crazy, except sometimes the Santa shirt n belt my family got me for Christmas around the holidays.
5	My style is all over the place. I like feeling good in my clothes, but also looking at least a bit unusual. When I'm lazy I will usually wear a crop top with jeans and an oversized hoodie or a huge sweater with shorts and thigh highs, sometimes with makeup, sometimes without. Then there are days when I want to have a "look" so I go for more non-ordinary combinations and do some colorful makeup. Those times I like to match jewerly and my septum piercing to my outfit.\n\nAlso, I consider my hair a part of my style, used to have long neon yellow, but then I shaved it all off and now I dye it any color I want while waiting for it to grow.\n\nBasically I wear what I want and do what I want with my appearance, don't care about current fashion trends and stuff.
3	I wear colorful shirts, or black ones, I wear hoodies, I wear sweatpants, rarely jeans, and skater shoes
3	All depends on the occasion. \n\nMy day to day: jeans that make my butt look good, are comfortable around the legs with a t-shirt, flannel, or 3 quarter sleeve that is _just_ tight fitting enough with my steel toe work boots. \n\nAverage Going out: jeans that make my butt look good, but are actually very nice (designer) and have a tighter cut. A slim fit button up, top three buttons undone, maybe sleeves rolled up, shoes depend on weather, but anywhere from leather boots to suede sneakers. Goofy/fun socks. \n\nDressing up: pair of tailored slacks that make my butt look good, leather dress shoes (brown or black depends on the shirt/pant color combo). Slim fit button up with a smoking jacket. Goofy/fun socks. \n\nHome: sweat pants that make my butt. Nothing else. \n\nEdit: everything I own is comfortable. When it comes to being stylish, I will spend the extra money to have fewer clothes that are more comfortable. I will also never shun away from a 10 year old t shirt that is perfectly warm in. 
2	black jeans or leggings, hoodies or simple oversided sweaters and pumas or vans, rarely some mascara, it just needs to be comfy
2	I live in the tropics so I make sure I'm wearing comfortable and good quality fabric. Linen and cotton. I dress up when the occasion calls for it, but I go for t shirt and jeans all the time. and leather sandals. 
2	When it's not my day to day basic fits (usually a sweatshirt or hoodie for a top, black jeans or navy chinos for bottoms, and white Van's for bottoms), I love experimenting with my style. \n\nCan go from a pink sweatshirt to match with my [pink Golf Le Fleur shoes](https://stockx.imgix.net/Converse-One-Star-Ox-Tyler-The-Creator-Golf-Le-Fleur-Geranium-Pink.jpg?fit=fill&bg=FFFFFF&w=700&h=500&auto=format,compress&q=90&dpr=2&trim=color&updated_at=1538080256), or a creme cardigan with oversized brown pants and brown shoes. Or if I want to freak people out at my school a bit, I'll wear my techwear outfit.\n\nMy biggest thing about my style is my standoutish-ness though. For example, my campus hosts a day called "Day Without Hate" and I'm wearing [this on that day.](https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-stm8v/images/stencil/500x659/products/1434/3617/NO_VIOLENCE_VEST_1__89276.1550325391.png?c=2&imbypass=on) I've always worn stuff that scares or confuses people. 
2	I wear cargo pants, a t-shirt, and combat boots every day. If the cargo pants are tan i wear a light colored or red shirt, if dark anything but light colored shirts. 
2	Vintage clothes I find that the thrift store or just steal things from my grandmother's closet. 
2	I would like to wear jeans and metal t-shirts everyday like I used to, but being an adult means I usually wear button down shirts and slacks. But I do wear New Balance sneakers. 
2	17M-Black skinny jeans, Hawaiian styled/trendy t-shirt, a huge faced minimalist watch, skater shoes
2	25F, I'm very unstylish for my gender.\nPlain everything, no graphic tees, some horizontally striped ones. Mostly black, grey and blue. Red or yellow if I'm feeling fancy that day.\nHot weather: t-shirt, short pants with pockets.\nCold: t-shirt, hoodie, jeans.\nI usually wear running shoes or vans.\nNo make-up, kinda short wavy hair with volume that I style with my fingers.\nI've thinking of adding some shirt to my wardrobe and a pair of less-sporty shoes.\nYep, I'm a minimalist.
2	Male,20,skinny frame.  \nWhen I want to look good/going out : Skinny black jeans,black doc martens,white t shirt,leather perfecto jacket.  \nWhen I'm chilling or just not doing much: skinny black jeans,black hoodie,reversed snapback, black nike high tops. Hood is always up,even over the hat!   \n
2	26F - Minimalistic/Small wardrobe \n\nCombat boots, black skinny jeans, tight black top, black leather jacket. \n\nSometimes I add stuff or remove things to change up the look. (Like a flannel tied around my waist).\n\nI wish I could just always wear the same thing *everyday* and not have to worry about this.
2	Dark and minimalistic. Black jeans, black boots, black sweater, and dark green coat is my go-to winter outfit. 
1	tshirt, shorts, teva sandals
1	Depends on my mood. For the winter it's been fleece leggings, boots and a sweater. If it was spring I'd just wear pants. Don't want to deal with pants tbh.
1	I usually wear jeans or demin shorts with a sweater or t-shirt. I have plain and graphic shirts but I wear the plain ones a lot more. When I feel more fancy I have these boxy button down linen shirts I really like and 60's inspired blouses with bows or bell sleeves. Shoes wise I usually switch from combat boots to flip flops in the summer. 
1	Fashion is one of my main hobbies, but even though I have a beautiful wardrobe I love very much, I find myself wearing comfy jeans and a grey hoodie most days
1	Jeans, hoodie.
1	Whatever Vans has on sale. 
1	Jeans and a T, even to work. \n\nSometimes I change it up and wear sweatpants
1	24, male, teacher. Cossack haircut, well fitting plain t-shirt and jeans/chinoes, sports watch, awesome shoes, usually variants of allstars, then leather jacket or my awesome varsity jacket. Id say my jacket and shoe game is pretty much on point. At home I always change to fairly tight sweatpants :)
1	My style is more conservative/classic.  I work at a somewhat high end store and get a pretty good employee discount.  So my usual outfit consists of some pants, a button up shirt, a sweater or waistcoat, and boots.  My tastes are more masculine, but on days when I feel more feminine, I'll go with a nice dress with flats and a cardigan or jacket.  \n\nAnd most of my things are either blue, green, or a mix of the two.
1	Edgy Classic, mostly black with some dark green, grey, red.
1	To school or work : Jeans and a basic shirt or sweater\n\nTo hangouts or other stuff : Dresses\n\nColors : Dark Green, Blue, Bordeaux, Black and Floral
1	I'm obsessed with 90s punk (senior in hs)\n\nBaggy jeans/pants, shirt if some sort, leather jacket or windbreaker\n\nGrease my hair back
1	I have 5 of the same black long sleeved shirt and jeans. I usually wear that with a pair of black boots and hoop earrings to work. My hair is long and a bit curly, and I leave it down. Make up is a tiny bit of eyeliner. Maybe a tinted moisturizer. All of 1 minute to go from pajamas to out of the house. At home I wear hoodies and jeans. I went through an all black phase a while back, but decided to tone it down recently by adding dark blue jeans into that mix :P 
10	Teach an Fi user to give no fucks like y'all	Please help. ISTPs seem to do what they want and have no qualms with people being offended in common interaction. Some people might be turned off by that, but I personally admire it a lot. I believe this is a function of Ti being in the dominant position for you all but I'd like to hear other your explanations on how this works for you.  
24	I am actually VERY insecure about how others feel, but only ever after the fact. And if I still believe I'm right (which I often do) I'm not going to say I was wrong just to make things better. I kinda hate it and I'm glad I'm an introvert because relationships (intimate and platonic) can get very tough to maintain when your mind works that way. People want to be right, or they at least want to know that you don't mind being wrong. I don't mind being wrong. I really don't. But I don't come across that way, and saying so doesn't really mean anything when you're still holding your ground. 
16	The only way I can explain it how I learned the term "self actualized" in psych classes. It's hard to explain, it's more of a feeling that I learned and embraced as I got older.\n\nIf I had to explain it, it's something like: I'm happy with the me I am, I owe who I am only to me, I worked hard to get here, so I'm my own top priority. My happiness is more important than people who would seek to minimize my happiness (for many various reasons). My values are important to me, and I generally admire those who espouse the same values and have zero fucks to give about people who act contrary to those values.\n\nI don't think it's a matter of not caring if I offend people. Since I live by my own personal code, it's important to me to respect other peoples' personal codes, so I try hard to understand and not overstep. But at the same time, to me, my code still trumps if there's something that runs afoul of mine, I'm back in "dgaf" mode.\n\nI don't know if that comes off well articulated or not. It's kind of hard to explain why you don't care about something because "not caring" is in itself, a lack of any sort of explanation. \n\nIf I had to overgeneralize with platitudes, it would go something like: you're the best you, be the best you, and if anybody tries to change that, they don't deserve any emotional investment on your part.
5	i honestly feel waves of gratitude nearly every day that i am not a feeler, so i sympathize with you. i am virtually unaffected by what those around me think and i’m pretty happy and content all the time. though there are great things feelers do for the people around them, it seems like you all mostly just suffer personally for it. both my sisters are INFJs, and i see this every dang day. your overall experience with anxiety also depends on how active your cingulate gyrus is, which is not something under an individuals control (as far as science knows so far). \n\nTL;DR: i cannot help you, i’m sorry <3
5	I don't care about certain things like I love to get into political debates or do things like talk about **things** that others shy away from or makes people angry.\n\nI guess it seems trivial to me that some things are taboo so I just don't care about it being a rule. But when it comes to asking someone something personal about themselves or their feeling or expressing certain feelings of my own sure I can get very nervous.
3	Vodka helps.
3	I strive to be honorable, I don’t always succeed. And I don’t mean “honorable when people are looking” or “ignore a person in need if I have plausible deniability.” or “only be honorable if you know the favor will be retuned in kind”\n\nSince I approach life in that manner it is much easier to think: I don’t give a shit about what you think of me. What I think of you is all that matters to me.
2	It's a process for me.\n\nStep 1: Do I know about this thing/person/ (or anything)?\n\nStep 2: If yes, do I have something new to add/say?\n\nStep 3: If yes, how will I say it in a way that it's going to be received as something helpful?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf answer to Step 1 question is No, I prefer to shut my mouth. People say it's IDGAF attitude. But really I'm just being honest to myself that I have no purposeful opinion to add. Or refraining from being /imsoverysmart\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
1	What type are you?
6	Sleep schedules?	Changing my sleep schedule may prove beneficial. Has anyone ever tried segmented sleep?  What sleep pattern do you have?
3	I have tried but not to make it constant. One thing I do like doing on occasion is to break up 8 hours of sleep into 2 segments. \n\n\n\nI work best between the hours of 2am-4am. My head is clear, its quiet and there are few distractions. I do very well going to bed around 10pm sleeping 4 hours and waking up at 2am. I then go back to bed around 4am-6am and sleep another 4-6 hours. The problem I have is that I feel a heck of a lot better after the first 4 hours of sleep than I do after the 2nd 4 hours, which leaves me feeling kind of tired all day but with the majority of my work done. I've found this schedule hard to keep two nights in a row but haven't been exactly disciplined with it. \n\n\n\nI do believe the modern 8 hour sleep schedule most people keep is almost a corporate model we've adopted. I often wonder what my farmer ancestors did as far as a sleep schedule. Frequent naps? Sleep whenever tired? Wake up in the middle of the night to restoke the fire? Work early in the morning when its cool and sleep during the heat of the day? 
2	The best quality of sleep I’ve ever had is from devoting about 10 hours to resting and sleeping about four hours, being up doing something chill for two, then sleeping another four. \n\nIt’s difficult to maintain, though, since eight hours a day goes to work and I like doing things in the evenings. 
2	I never tried segmented sleep, but regular sleep schedule helps me a lot.\n\n  \nI sleep for 8h, in exceptional situations minimum is 6h (if I drank a lot of alcohol i add one extra sleep hour). It is better to have 15-16 good hours than 18 shitty hours. When I do not sleep enough I'm very phlegmatic at morning and unproductive at work, but if I sleep well (and wake up before alarm) I have so much energy that I want to dance to music during making breakfast or destroy something with bare hands. \n\n  \nGoing to sleep at a fixed time allows for a better use of sleep time. Body accustomed to regular sleep hours produce hormones, regulates metabolism and do other magic things to fall asleep at specific hour, and wake up at morning with extra power.   \nI recently noticed that getting up very early is better than sitting at night (currently I try to wake up at 6 and go sleep at 21-22). I can go earlier to work, finish earlier and I have more motivation and energy to do things after work.   \n\n\nNever use snooze or set multiple alarms, extra 10 minutes will not make you feel rested, it's addictive, and it will fuck up your sleep cycle (I needed 3 months to fix my sleep cycle)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI use sleep as android app with mi band 2 to track sleep. For me the best feature of this app is go to sleep reminder based on lack of sleep in the last days.  For now I disabled smart wake up at optimal sleep cycle for more constant wake up time (its help me with snooze addiction)
1	~I use an app called Sleep Cycle, which gradually wakes you up based on a set time, and how deeply you are sleeping. Made it really easy to start getting up at 7AM.\n\nWorking back from that, I decided that going to bed at 11 would be best, with an alarm set for 10:30 for me to end up whatever I’m doing and start getting ready for sleep.\n\nProcrastinating in bed on Reddit is a bit of an issue, but I think some willpower should overcome that.~\n\nEdit: woah, totally missed the question. Haven’t given it a go, I like my 7 and a bit hours of sleep to happen without interruption. So can’t see myself wanting to break it up. Other than a trip to the loo then back
1	Go to a forum with navy personnel, former or present. The navy has the goofiest schedules, 4 hrs on 4 hrs off, 5 on 10 off, amongst various other concoctions. And they’re on that schedule for at least 6 month at a time.\n\nI’ve found that navy guys have some pointed opinions on this matter.
16	What's your use Of Se ?	In socionics, there's the concept of [Dimensionality of functions](http://www.wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=Dimensionality_of_functions) which is a way to describe the strength of each function. It works in four stages :\n\n* **1 Dimensional :** "Experience." Basically, trial and error is all you can do, aka, your own experience. \n* **2 dimensional :** "Norms". You can use your experience + the experience of others in the form of "norms". What's usually done, etc, even if you don't quite get why, you know the rules/norms. \n* **3 dimensional :** "Situation". You can use the norms, or what's commonly done, but you can also deviate of said norms and improvise in some situation. You see opportunities at one moment. It's not a social faux-pas, you actually succeed/get it better than the norm. \n* **4 Dimensional :** "Time" or "Globality". Not only can you improvise on a specific situation, you also can tell how it's going to evolve over time. If "situation" was a snapshot, then "globality" is a movie. Maybe includes the "Meta" level. \n\n***\nTo give some examples, both of our type have 4D Ti, aka, the level of globality. When we try to understand, we try to understand it on a "universally applicable" scale (at least, as an INTP, I do that. Is that accurate for you too ?)\n\nIf we compare it to others types :\n\n* INFJ have 2D Ti, or the "Norm" Level. They can learn, but they are pretty conventional in their thinking ? They don't really improvise, they don't really find a quicker way to do stuff. That's why they are kinda "by the book" in their approach (that's it, when they don't ignore Ti entirely). That's why they kinda like to quotes authors, like in philosophy, or find "Guru" of sorts ? \n* In ESTP/ENTP, Ti is 3 Dimensional, or at the "Situation" level. That?s why when you talk with one of them, they are right, etc, and can give you a run for your money in a debate, but that's it. They are right, but like, 80% right, it lacks sometjing. They didn't take the idea to it's logical end. They can follow in the debate, but they didn't really formalize it or saw the greater consequences of what they said.\n* In ExFx. Ti is 1 Dimensional, or "Experience". It's kinda trial and error for them, so even "simple" stuff looks complicated for them. I know one ESFJ girl and an ENFP who managed to fail a very simple test once. To me and my iSTP Friend, it looked so simple that it looked like a trap question, but they failed. It wasn't something they could know/learn, it was pure deduction. If they were shown, they probably would have been able to do it, though, but it was the first, so they failed...\n\nEtc, etc. Examples can be produced like that for all types.\n\n**Which brings us to my question :** What's your use of Se ?\n\nMine is 1 dimensional. It's trial and error for me, when I don't ignore it since it's my PolR/Blindspot function. Through research, I kinda understand what Se does, but not really.\n\nSo what Se thing do you notice in some situation ? What opportunities for you see ? What Se "Norms" do you understand you can break, while say, ENxJs don't understand ? How clueless do us INTPs and INFP look to you ?\n\nAsking here since the ESTP sub seems dead.
6	Se isn't working on its own, we use it through the lens of Ti and it's still influenced by Ni, which would give it that 4D characteristic you're talking about. Either way this varies greatly between person to person and the time in their life. At the baseline, Se probably contributes more situationally, but that goes to shit if you're caught in the Ti-Ni loop. So what does it look like? There's no clear answer since it's working through the personally applied logic of Ti. Functions can be understood on their own, but it's not the same in people. These traits will always be in relation to their stack and personal experience.\n\n\nThe closest thing I can give you to what you're looking for is 'grounded logic'. I can explain something to nearly anyone (in person) and make them understand. This is because Se points in a direction, and then Ti fires. This direction is grounded in the real world and facts that can be understood by anyone because we all live in the same world. I'm guessing other ISTP's share a similar unconscious understanding of the world around them just from living in it.\n\nAnyway I hope this helps you in some way.
3	I would say 3D, in general but mostly the Se, we are aware of what people do and are aware of what we did and when it comes to improvising Se is a perceiving function and we learn to improvise better as we grow up. Maybe that's just me, my improvisation skills aren't that great because I am still 19 and I got more Se to develop.
2	I'm very aware of my environment, and how it's affecting how I think, or the subjects of what I'm thinking, and what my day will usually turn out.\n\nFor example, I'm sitting right now at the balcony. I am observing almost everything, from how the glass looks when it's left at the window. From a far, I can see how the sunlight slides past through the coconut trees. There are hundreds of birds chirping up the two big mango trees next to our house. Some chickens are all over the garden based on the sounds they make. I know what's my mother is cooking based on the smell that goes up my room. I can tell the time based on the angle of the window light. I know it's low tide because people are going to the river to forage shells. Etc.\n\nBut I can also shut my Se off after picking a tangible object and then my Ti would deepen it. I can look at a tree, and then research the whole day about it, what furniture it can make, the cost, how long it would take to cut it down, etc..
1	My use of Se. I use my Ti to find everything I am a fucking bitch about. Then I use Se to be the exact opposite. Mostly in habits. And its hard to continue things all day. It can get really boring. But it is discipline for me which I try to overcome everyone with. \n\nLike, every Inconsitency I see in my life, I try to fix. Which is a long term goal and if something is fixed.. well you know the feeling. \n\nTo learn means to suffer. You don't learn in your comfortzone. And most of the time I can see my Ti comes up with some hardcore crazy shit if I am hustling against my fears and bad habits. \nAfter I realize.. my cock arise.\nBut only possible with the use of Se(which I try to improve with this way).
1	I relate to you
0	Survey on Flirting behaviors and personality	Hey I am a doctoral Student at a University in the South. I am studying flirtation behaviors, specifically trying to catalog specific flirting behaviors taken from several experimental studies. I was wondering if I could post to this community as it seems relevant to my topic. Thank you in advance for taking the time to take the survey there is an opportunity to win a gift card if the entire survey is completed. You can back out at any time.\n\nHere is the link to the survey\n\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JMQP5PJ
5	Just do nothing, i'm a pro
7	ISTPs: what’s flirting?
4	I honestly genuinely don't know what flirting even really is. 
1	Done, and done my friend
1	Are you sure that MBTI is an accurate method of categorizing people and their results? Of what I understand, MBTI is pretty un-scientific, and was only based on Jungian theory, not being actual scientific research itself. A better judge would probably be to use the Big 5 test as a method of grouping results, separating individuals by majority scores in each type (+- 50%). For example, all individuals that score low on extroversion, high on conscientiousness, low on agreeableness and openness in one group. 
1	Make witty jokes and pose correctly
4	Is Dom Ti the most detached function from emotions and just in general ?	
5	I can't say if it's more or less detached than dom-Te.
2	Ti is Ti, it doesn't concern feelings directly, so in that sense, no. Say, Se isn't full of feeling eitheir, it's just Se. All the non F function are detached of feeling on their own.\n\nThat being said, the function aren't in a bubble. They all are part of the stacks . Having a strong Ti means you will have a weak Fi, and a weak Fe. As such, it's kinda true. Although, the same can be said for Te which push the F functions down too.\n\n
2	Favourite podcasts?	Ideally on Spotify but doesn't matter too much! Looking for all sorts of recommendations
1	I had a lot of fun with Reply All for a time. Check out episode 16 "Why is Mason Reese Crying" if you want just an episode to dive into, but my favorite is 64, the "On the Inside" series. They start by investigating Paul Modrowski, a man who's running a blog from prison. That's all I'll tell you but it gets pretty crazy, imo. True investigative journalism. \n\nHello Internet is a good "two dudes talking" podcast. Youtubers CGP Grey and Brady Haran talk about anything and everything. They're funny, have an interesting chemistry, and talk about some thought provoking subjects. \n\nLast Podcast on the Left is really funny, but can get really hard to follow if what you're looking for is a story. I'd start around the 40-100 range to get a good feel for them.\n\nRadiolab has some intriguing episodes, if you haven't already discovered them. That's where a lot of people get started with podcasts. \n\nAnd now my head hurts. I suck at recalling things I've already moved on from. Hope this helps!!\n
1	Sayer is a sci-fi story podcast, kept me up on many a long drive 
1	Optimally Living Daily. For those interested in productivity, self-improvement, constant learning etc. The guy narrates top blog posts by self-improvement bloggers, releases 1 audio clip per day. \n\nNot sure if it's on Spotify, but I use Overcast. I listen to it on commute to work every morning. Have learnt a lot and penned down key insights in my learning journal since. 
1	I used to watch the JRE once in awhile but now he sucks. Mostly only good when Joey Diaz is on. The Daily Wire I watch sometimes and sometimes Impaulsive
1	Joe Rogan, Secular Buddhism, Rubin Report, Dan Carlin\n\nBut\n\nI’ve basically only been listening to audible recently, totally neglected my podcasts, there’s probably hundreds of episodes to catch up on. 
2	ENTP or ISTP	So basically all the tests ive done so far came up as ENTP but I did one at  [https://www.sociotype.com/tests/](https://www.sociotype.com/tests/)  as someone suggested on the r/entp \n\nReading the descriptions I think im more of an entp but the redditor seemed quite sure of this test and that i'm an istp.\n\nI'm more confused about the whole types and which functions fit me. Thoughts?
3	I thought i was entp for a long time. ENTPS never shut the fuck up and argue for the sake of arguing, whereas ISTPs are assholes who only care about themselves and argue for the sake of validating Ti ie being right
2	The more tests you do and the more MBTI descriptions you read, the more confused you're going to get. I've only been privy to Jungian psychology, on which all of this is based, for a little over a week now. What I learned after taking my 7th test is that there's a lot of generalizations, sensationalized articles, and just straight up misinformation to dig through. If you *really* want to understand this to a point where you can actually apply it to your life, it's going to take some work on your part. \n\nSearching around on YouTube (I'm a true ISTP, so visual mediums are by far the best way for me to learn things), I quickly came across a channel by the name of C.S. Joseph. I've since watched multiple videos a day because this guy just... gets it. He's an awesome teacher and he really gets down to the heart of what Jungian psychology is all about. The production values are pretty baseline, but it doesn't bother me. The information and the way he puts it is invaluable.\n\nIf I were you, I would start with his "how to type anyone" video so you can A.) Get a pretty much immediate and 100% accurate answer to your question, and B.) Get a feel for the channel and the guy running it and see if it's what you're looking for. After that video, you're going to want to dig deeper and figure out what each of the type descriptors that he uses means so you can understand the type grid he shows you. I hope this helps!!
18	Making friends	Hey guys,\nSo I'm an istp, I live in an amazing warehouse of 30 people and I get along with everyone, I'm obviously closer to some people than others\nBut I don't seem to actually connect with anyone "properly", like I find it really hard to make friends, let alone close friends, join in a conversation or never know what to talk about etc\nDo you guys have any advice to give me ? How do you guys do with this kind of issue?\nI've also recently moved to London and except from the people I live in, I don't really know anyone else...
14	Not sure I can actually help you with this but I can at least say, you're not alone in this. I get the idea that I may present myself as standoffish. When I do converse with people, I have a tough time keeping the convo going and trying to find common ground. The things I'm working on to try and improve this are:\n\n1. Being excited to see them and to bring more emotion into the conversation/connection. I find this part the hardest. I tend to be all monotone and expressive-less by default.\n2. Trying to find common ground and branching from there. I'm trying to keep the HEFE method in mind (hobbies, entertainment, food, environment). \n3. Invite them to do something outside of what you normally do which they may be interested in.
8	I’m a female ISTP and I can relate. I can get along with other people but I can’t really seem to form close friendships or connect with someone properly. Although I’m totally fine and don’t think about it often, I do tend to ponder over it from time to time.  \n\nNot a lot of people approach me to start friendships either, probably my lack of charisma.\n\n
5	I have zero interest in speaking to people for the sake of socializing but I do understand the desire to socialize. I would suggest to find a hobby or interest that you like to do that also involves socializing with people whether it's DnD, hiking, or sports. There's bound to be locals there with similar interests.
6	I’d say a great start is find one you know you trust and be vulnerable with them. If they return the favor, it’ll lay the groundwork for a deeper bond and friendship. 
2	My job covers 99% of my spcializing needs
2	30 people? Next time you come home bring a couple cases of beer. Doesn’t matter if it’s that cheap tekate shit. Everybody likes the guy who brings beer. Maybe get some cups and play beer pong. 
1	Any Bipolar/BDD ISTPs here ?	
4	Nope?
2	Thought I was, WTF years are a bitch
2	Well this is odd. I've been trying to figure out my mbti type, can't settle on anything.\n\nWent from thinking INFJ -> ENFJ -> INFP\n\n(I was thinking of the cognitive functions, yes)\n\nBut then I think I just experienced my first episode of hypomania, and just got into my "normal" state after I dont know how long. So obviously my mental health is unreliable until I get to this doctors appt, so I dont think I can help.
23	I have a question for ISTPs and maybe INTPs about how you react to situations.	I’ve been wondering for awhile about my self and how I react to situations or don’t react, like a death in the family I just don’t feel anything, or once I was robbed and shot at and it didn’t bother me it was like I was playing a video game, or everyday things in my neighborhood shootings murders being in fights it just doesn’t bother me. \n\nThe thing is I’ve been aware I was like this for awhile but it’s starting to be more noticeable because of how I see people perceive me like I’m not human or something, and seeing how others react to stuff it’s like it’s a house fire but all I perceive is a small flame, let me know if any of you guys can relate.
29	Sounds more sociopathic. Not all sociopaths are evil assholes. Some of them are just normal people who genuinely don’t feel shit. 
12	I am ixtp,honestly I do react to situations but I do not get too emotional, it just pass by. I might cry at the time when the situations happened but at the next day I usually already feeling better and act like nothing big happened.
9	Yeah, this is common. The heroic flow state for IXTP is the Ti.\n\n\nYou can see this in boxing or professional fighting. Often it’s ISTP vs. ESTP in the ring, and the ESTP is very outwardly focused, while the ISTP is running through his practiced logic trees in his head.\n\nSince ISTP has tertiary Ni, which is underdeveloped, and unbalanced, with no acknowledgement of Ne alternatives, ISTP also has a pure sense of certainty.\n\nNi:  “I saw that I had to do it.” In which case, the actual strong functions take over. Ti does methodically what Ni has seen is the only course of action.\n\nINTP is a little different; they’re more stone cold parsing through vast quantities of alternatives for the working answer, but this is more done in a lawyerly way. An INTP can make fair, logical argument, accuse the other party of injustice, swing the sentiment of a room in a purely logical: if I say this, they will believe this, cold, sociopathic way.
6	same as an ISTJ , im a bit robotic/ autistic. yes its hard to feel 
11	Buddy , everyone thinks they have it all figured out in a crisis but then life punches you in the mouth 
6	I don’t react, I respond.  Everything has to process for a few seconds, but then I act.  Great for most emergencies, terrible for a fight.
5	OP, I react the same way basically. Death in the family (or a birth, etc. etc.) or some violent asshole accosts me in the street. My reaction is just 'meh'. Anger is the only emotion I feel very strongly and it takes someone being a total asshat to me to get that reaction.
5	Self-acceptance is a life-changing milestone for me, peaceful...\n\nDeath is never scary for me because from childhood i learned that it's a fact, what's variable is the when. I didn't feel sad when my grandparents died when i was in elementary school. My father just died the end of last year, i wasn't sad. I feel pity because he could not achieve his goal of witnessing at least one of his children get married. What scary /makes me sad is the suffering potentially preceding the death. \n\nI'm not good at affective forecasting anyway. I might feel entirely differently (e.g. optimistic instead of scared) in case i suffered from deadly disease. 
2	I too am a ISTP and act very similar in those situations. I've never been shot at, I have been robbed with a gun threat being made but I just was calm about it and gave the guy what he wanted (I didn't have anything of value so that part made me not care). I  sometimes think about what I would do if I did get shot and I concluded I would just have to accept it. When it comes to death it doesn't phase me much as it is a part of life everything that lives also dies. I also like to be happy about the life the person lived and not sad about the fact that they are gone. My friend who lived down the street from me died when we were in high school and it never really phased me I could only think about the good times we had. 
2	I just see most situations as everyday things cause that's kinda what they are. Somethings like being robbed or rough people coming up to me looking for shit catch me off guard and I do feel quite nervous but other things like witnessing a car crash or if a family member dies its just like thats an everyday thing. 
2	I feel the same as you when it comes to many situations. For me it comes down to "it is what it is", and no amount of worrying, or tears will change the fact that certain things happen, and can't be changed.
2	In general I don't react to deaths immediately. I mourn in private, but family deaths don't "excite" me immediately. I'm just like...well shit. That said, my parents have passed and when that happened it fucked me up pretty good, the first one for months. The second one was almost expected, like a sigh of relief...it was weird. \n\nI've also had an apartment broken into and that one fucked up my trust for a while as well. Now I'm paranoid of ground floors and windows, but in a careful way. 
2	Can't relate at all. \n\nSounds kind of sociopathic but I'm hesitant to suggest or peg it as that.\n\nIn emergencies I am calm but that never means my emotions have left or aren't there or can't be involved. It just means I'm not scared of danger. What I am scared of is losing people, it hurting others. \n\nSo it's not that ixtps (or at least istps) are robots, we're just not scared of what most are scared of. My fear lies elsewhere. 
2	Infj. Been robbed multiple times, sometimes been able to scape, sometimes not. I don't feel particularly anything about it? Feel the same about gunshots, broken bones, exploded fingers, knifes, bleeding. I don't have any reasons to do not deal with this things as trivial. \n\nIt can happen to anyone, anytime. (For me) being prepared is key.\n\nFamiliarized with the "non human" side of being perceived by others. 
2	Usually when it comes to grief and traumatic situations, Fi comes out of the shadow. To say that we don't have emotions is a lie, though we generally repress Fi with Fe.  \nWhat you are describing is maybe more along the lines of desensitization from being exposed to a lot of hardship.
2	My man! I have similar experiences of not feeling anything in particular from death of a family member and seeing incidents like i'm in a video game.\n\nI think its more because we've Ti-ed the situation already and went to problem solving mode. No Fe involvement needed\n\nMy blalala died: "Oh, well humans die eventually...nothin i can do to change it. Oh well, that happened." OR, "huh, should i cry and wail? What's the point in doing that? Its not like it'll change anything."\n\nSomeone got shot: "oof, that sucked. He still alive? He got insurance? Is he safe now? Ok. Any other shitstorm happening that might affect me if i stay around here? Yes, oh ok i'm gonna go now, good luck."\n\n
2	Yeah, I feel you. Roommate is an E/F type. anything I would consider a negligible event, she blows it out of proportion. 
2	I think you react, you just superunaware of that. You are concentrated on your Se I guess. It is mostly ISTP shit, not INTP. INTPs softer, they don't show, but they feel the shit out of things. As about ISTPs, ISTP reacts emotionally when his Introverted Thinking switches on Introverted Intuition and after Extraverted Feeling and hell starts. \n\nBut if you are a more healthy ISTP, your Introverted Thinking switches on your Extraverted Sensing and you become literally like James Bond. It is just ISTP's standard role in society, **a troubleshooter, mechanic in emergency situations.**
2	It depends on how close I am to someone who died. I grew up in a very large family and relatives, so every year there's always someone who passed away. I didn't feel anything. It's more of a curiosity of how they died, and the relation of this person to the people who he/she left. \n\nWhen my first boyfriend died, it's a totally different game. And also when my grandfather passed away. I lost my shit. I sobbed like a fucking retard.
1	I'm not sure whether I'm ISTP or ISTJ, but that's exactly how I am. To be honest, that happens mostly when other people are around me and I know they are reliable enough to fix this situation, and then I just get so nonchalant about the whole thing I become completely useless and just watch other people freak out / take care of things. When I'm on my own and something happens I take action but I do get nervous about the whole thing if it's something quite serious.
10	Being put on the spot	How do y’all handle it? For instance, at work if you’re being asked a question in front of 10 coworkers. Or just any group setting and you’re expected to talk / verbalize. \n\nDo you calmly get to the answer or does it go in 100 different directions to try and answer it? Sometimes feel like I’m good, sometimes not. 
9	I learned a trick to not do that.  If I have a piece of paper, I start writing for a couple seconds to give me time to get rolling, then I do pretty good.  If I don't have a piece of paper, I repeat the question while thinking of the answer. If I just start talking, I tend to wander.
6	I really don't mind it, but I'm slow and deliberate, so I'll take my time to answer.
3	It kinda depends on my mood. If I'm feeling confident I'll give a boastful answer. If I'm feeling a little depressed I tend to stutter and struggle to find the right words. 
3	That doesn't really bother me. I can usually come up with something that sounds good and more or less represents what I actually think about the subject. What bugs me is being made to elaborate. I *do not* like being the center of attention. 
3	Normally I would put on a pensive expression and take my time to answer, but if conditions are right I'll crack a joke or give a sarcastic answer and formulate a good response during the ensuing laughter.
2	i've learned to ignore the pressure and think for a few seconds about how to react, but sometimes i'll panic and not be able to think of anything intelligent to say
1	Entirely dependent on how much I know about the subject in question. It's ok to say you don't know, unless you absolutely should know. The best approach is to prepare prepare prepare and get ahead of potential questions. If I'm lazy, and don't keep my mind on my work, my knowledge gets lax and it shows in my ability to produce information or input. I come away from those instances wanting to know more so I can be more effective. And frequently, if I was unable to answer something right off, I will follow up with the questioner if possible to provide further clarification. So, in the end, it's a mentality of accountability, for me.
1	Not a problem.
1	I usually handle it well. 
1	On the spot is when I am at my best
1	Handle it totally poorly. Make up some bullshit that somehow everyone tolerates, if not agrees with and praises me for.
1	I take a few moments to think of a thorough answer, and depending on the question, give either a flat answer or wax philosophical.
22	Thoughts on physical pain?	A long time ago, even as a kid, I decided pain is temporary, and it really is. Of course there were the times where I cried and bawled at getting needle shots stuck in me but some time after that, I decided I can just wait for pain to go away. Getting winds knocked out of me, just sit for a minute and wait. Getting charlie horsed might make me chuckle and limp for a bit, of course it hurts if it's hard enough. And I don't know what getting literally shot is like but I imagine one of my reactions going something like, "Are you serious?" I'm curious about whether or not other ISTP's are like this, too. I'm not a masochist haha.
21	hmm..i dunno if it is ISTP specific , but i also have a high pain tolerance.  i just tell myself that it's my nerves telling me there's something wrong, and i recognize that, and then just deal with it.  \n  \none time i hit myself in the leg with an axe while splitting wood.  it took a chunk out of my shin.  my skin and flesh were splayed open and you could clearly see my shin bone.  i got a ride to the hospital, and walked into the emergency room.  i go to the counter and ask for some assistance.  i am remaining calm at this point, but in a lot of pain obviously.   the nurse behind the counter gives me a clipboard and says, "fill this out".   i ask to be seen quickly and she dismisses me.  i then hike my leg up onto the counter and take off the wrap that was holding my skin and flesh together.  my leg is laid bare to her and point to my bone and say, "this hurts a lot.  can i please have something while i wait for the doctor?"  \n   \nshe catches her breath and yelps, "ah! ugh!  yes!  come with me!  come through these doors!"   i got helped right away :)   
14	Reading the comments made me feel like I'm a little bitch.\nCan't take pain for shit. Though it's not always the pain itself, that upsets me, it's more of a fear of the wound getting infected or staying as a scar. Usually it's "Shit, I hope this thing heals by itself, I really don't wanna visit the hospital".\n\nSo yeah, maybe it's not actually the pain that sucks, but the permanent damage that can follow.\n
11	Like u/bumpty, I also look at pain as just warning signals that something wrong. I think of it like a little alarm or diagram in cockpit displaying damage to a robot or something.\n\nThat's when I feel pain though. Some times I wonder if I even do feel pain, because I can't remember the last time I felt pain. I hit my head hard on concrete a week ago, I don't recollect any pain or anything
7	I dont know if its ISTP specific, but ive had a few times where ive gone to the hospital, once in an ambulance. The time i rode in an ambulance i split my head open in a logging accident, (wasnt wearing a hard had, learned a lesson) and when i was sitting at the volunteer fire station waiting for the ambulance i was trying to calm my brother down even though i had 2 people pulling wood chips out of my skull and trying to stop the bleeding. Haha i have a pic somewhere of me in a neck brace covered in blood giving a thumbs up with my brother 
5	Thoughts on physical pain? It literally is the way the brain warns you of something being wrong in that area.\n\n\n\n\nDo you know the cause? Is it not that bad? Chill if it doesn't last long;\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you not know the cause? Is it not bad? Chill if it doesn't last long.\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you know or not the cause and does it hurt bad? Either do something or wait until it goes away. Is it taking too long? Go check it at a doctor.
4	I was just thinking about this while walking in the snow and wind the other day, with my face completely frozen. I have this thing where I can almost embrace certain types of pain and then it subsides. I usually close my eyes for a second and let out a slow exhale and the pain fades.  \n\n\nI haven't broken any major bones but I did tear a tendon in my foot when I was younger that made me yelp like a dog whenever I bumped it the wrong way. That kind of sharp immediate pain is much harder to control in my opinion. I always feel foolish when I hurt myself doing something stupid. 
5	ISTP's have a big ego about being physically tough
3	Another thing I forgot was when I was getting appendicitis but it wasn't figured out yet, but right before they figured it was appendicitis, the health aide was pushing on my bottom right abdomen which would cause an intense, sharp pain. Instead of exclaiming Ow, I would flinch, raising my leg up. My mom, knowing me and my pain tolerance, had to tell the health aide I was hurting hah. Blah
2	stop being a punk and walk it off!!....which has led me to having to go to the ER multiple time in my life and do NOT recommend 
2	I'm an ISTP and I do have a pretty high pain tolerance.  For physical and emotional pain.  I've broken a few bones, had a couple kidney stones, smashed my toe so hard my toenail fell off.  And I've been through some bad tragedies.  I was pretty stoic through it all.  Never go to the doctor unless it's very obvious I need to.  Like when my forearm was broken into a 90 degree angle.  I think because our main function is introverted thinking aka logic, we are able to keep our head and talk ourselves through these situations.
2	yea im pretty good at that
2	Hi. High pain tolerance here also. I tend to fall under the belief that part of the human experience is to test your limits and understand what you're capable of. This naturally leads to doing a lot of stupid things and injuring myself because the only way to know your limits is to pass them on occasion.\n\nBecause of the "voluntary" nature of it, I'm regularly classified as a masochist. 
2	[deleted]
2	I also have a high pain tolerance, but idk if it's ISTP-related. I recently got DNA testing done, and learned that my higher pain tolerance is genetic. 
2	Pretty sure my pain tolerance is low, but I like the sentiment that pain is temporary. That is, until it's not. I always dislike the thought of life-altering injuries, or even small injuries that will affect me for the rest of my life. I used to assume I was invincible.\n\nNow, even with moderately low tolerance, I realize that pain is simply brain signals tied to nerves. Pain isn't anything except mild electrical signals. It's usually there as a warning sign of something, so pain is good to pay attention to but something that needs to be shut off or at least turned down most of the time.
2	It all really comes down to what causes the pain. Like you said, there's temporary pain like charlie horses and getting the wind knocked out of you, but then you have longer lasting pain like physical injuries or getting your wisdom teeth taken out. Drugs help a little, but they still hurt like a bitch
2	Pain is inevitable in life, suffering is optional.\n\nI also have high tolerance for physical pain. I learned that the more you ruminate about the pain, you inflate its importance, the longer it lasts and then possibly turns into suffering. So i never give a serious attention to it and just move on with my activity. It might also because overall i'm an optimistic person? Istps in general might too?: pain is temporary i can get it over with.\n\nSome people commented about not liking to see a doctor / go to hospital. I would say hospitals and doctors are part of sickcare instead of healthcare. It's very rare a doctor advises you how to prevent symptom/disease, they prescribe or take a look at your health. It's how they make money. I also hate pharma industry. They are trying to keep you sick and earn a lot. That's why i take good care of my health: proper nutrition, sleep, exercise, meditation, and just enough social contact (for mental health, we're social animal anyway).
2	I think I have quite a high pain tolerance. for instance, last summer I cut my finger very deeply on a scythe and had to get stitches put in and was also asked to go on antibiotics for some reason. I hadn't actually realized it happened until I saw a fuck ton of blood all down my hand and on the floor. When I patched myself up I was just laughing about it. After about a week I was just biting the stitches off. Similar thing happened when I was using a power washer and it tore away some skin off my hand,I was just like "that shit stings" .   \nI also have done many tattoos on myself, with machines and stick n pokes and I can just do it and I think I just disregard the pain cause I know what im getting myself into.
2	High pain tolerance here as well. 
1	I like the comments of not going to doctors or hospitals unless we think we need to. I'm the same way. I tell myself there's no point in going to a clinic cause they'll give something for a fever or headache and tell me to drink a lot of liquids, and not something for the sickness, most times. I especially don't look forward to attitudes of doctors and nurses in the town (I live in a village). To me, I get the vibe of, "Why'd you come here? Didn't have to get seen."
1	Sometimes I'm so so numb to pain. For some reason i though i was running my thumb up and down the back (blunt) side of a stanley knife, and then turned out i was rubbing the Blade - I only realised this when I had sliced through my skin and there was blood. I was a bit too calm about it though, just held my thumb together until it started healing
22	ISTP here looking for a tactful, dignified way to avoid small talk.	Hey, Y'all! Lovely sub you have, though I do wish it were more active. But, I digress. The point of this post is to gather opinions, experiences, and resources that relate to avoiding small talk when you're forced to be around a group of people for an extended period of time. \n\nA few things I think you should know before you answer: \nI am new to Typology and still reside somewhere just below the surface as far as my understanding of it all and how I can apply it to the outside world. I'm a pretty magnetic and warm person, or so I've been told. I'm sure that a lot of you relate there, and as ISTP's I'm assuming you would also relate to not really wanting to stretch that trait past pleasantries. It's easy for me to come across as if I genuinely want to "meet" people and know their stories. I genuinely do not know how to be unfriendly or standoffish (unless I'm angry, but that's another post for another day), and it often leads me to being neck-deep in conversations that I just could not care less about. As I'm sure a lot of you are aware, I don't actively feel this way to be rude. I just don't see it as important and I lose interest very quickly, which results in me feigning interest (poorly, in my mind) and makes me feel awkward and self-conscious. I think you get the picture. \n\nSO. Here in a few months, I'll be attending a rafting trip with the managers of most (if not all) of the different departments at the lodge I will be working for this summer. This is so each department head can get familiar with one-another in a fun, no-pressure setting. The only thing I get a little anxious about when playing this trip out in my head is the possibility of being locked into lengthy conversations where I'm pretending to care about people's life stories and the like. I've been in this type of situation in this type of environment before; it almost always swiftly turns into a sort of "Look where I've been, look what I've done" casual pissing contest and I just don't want to be a part of it this time. So, since this post has been long enough for a simple question, I'll get to the point:\nI just want to appear friendly and genuine without inviting eeeeeveryone's story hour during this rafting trip. I'm wondering if any of you could offer some insight, perhaps even some examples (since I AM a true visual learner) of ways in which you've managed to accomplish something along those lines. Thank you very much for taking the time to read. EXTRA thanks for taking the time to reply. And in my mind and heart, you're all heroes regardless. Keep doin what ya do ISTP's. 
16	>  I just want to appear friendly and genuine without inviting eeeeeveryone's story hour during this rafting trip. \n\nThat's a tall order. When you appear friendly, people tend to talk to you about their lives. It's really difficult to avoid that while still appearing friendly. So at the end of the day you have to find the balance between how friendly you'd like to be perceived to be and how much time you want to spend being bored by people's irrelevant stories.
8	Would it be an option to try and find common interests / values and talk about those? \n\nIt doesn’t remove talk, but hopefully the bullshit parts you aren’t interested in 
13	- Earphones, even if there's nothing playing.\n\n- Don't make eye contact with people if you don't want them to talk to you.\n\n- Just don't respond, yeah you look like an asshole but you probably don't give a shit anyways.\n\nWith these 3 tips, you will never have to experience small talk ever again.
3	I've found that body language and gaze direction is a big thing. If you make an effort to not be fully engaged, like if you continue doing your thing while someone comes up to chat and don't stop your work to meet their eye contact, most people will see immediately that you're not interested in a long chat. It also shows them that your work is more important. \n\nI haven't been rafting but I'm guessing there will be work involved such as tying things up, moving equipment around, etc, so I've found that people generally don't like to bother the "busy" people. 
2	Only thing I can think to suggest offhand is to not ask questions. At work, often customers will ask "how are you?" (or similar). Expected response from me "Fine thanks, how are you?", but I typically just go with "Fine thanks", and stop talking. Usually results in getting straight down to business. Problem is, in a social environment, cutting out small talk usually results in awkward silence, and nobody really likes those. Other than that, if you can appear to be part of a group conversation, you can let others talk while you nod and smile along, and listen if you want to!
2	Unless you're stuck in a 121 setting the whole day, there will be people in the group that will "brag" about themselves and you just have to listen (or pretend) like the rest. When/if it's your turn just keep it to the minimum and pass the ball to the next person.\n\nAbout 121 conversations, it's up to you to control it by the amount of questions you'll ask. There are also tricks to stop the conversation like having to go to the toilet, fetch a drink...
2	Make sure you get plenty of "I" time and be cognizant of when your battery for social time gets low.  We can do some damage when when we're really not wanting to be in a group.  Find a reason to excuse yourself.  Even be honest about it.  "This introvert needs a break from you talkers."  Attempt to get understood or everyone will make incorrect assumptions about you.
2	Stop worrying about it ahead of time.  You might read up on tips and tricks for conversation, but once the moment gets here, you'll just roll along with what seems good then.  You'll be fine.  Definitely find common interests, even if it's work related (just not *about people* at work.)  Movies and TV work well as topics almost universally.  Gear, the rafting trip or the things that you notice around you as a sensor that they might miss also works well and highlights your strength.  "Check out that rock" is actually a pretty good conversation starter or distraction.\n\nReally, this is a pretty low stakes situation and as an ISTP, an environment that you may take to naturally, where your situational awareness and the ability to remain calm in intense environments will stand out..  Don't overthink it -- so long as you don't get drunk, your team mates will likely leave thinking better of you than when the trip started.  Edited to say, that you should just go to bed early anyway, get some solo time, and avoid potential nightime foolery.
2	Don't avoid it. Try to get better at it as it is a vital skill to have in business and life in general.\n\nI hate most smalltalk too but have become better at it over the years. That doesn't mean I am a social guru now but it makes connecting with people easier and less awkward.
2	Change your response. Instead of nodding and being attentive when one of the guys starts bragging, just say ok\n\n"Ya know, this one time when I was 9 I caught a shark half my weight" \n\n"Ok."
1	Act as if you don't care then they'll get the message and leave maybe
1	Strategically, don't worry about it, but tactically, what about whittling?  It's situationally relevant, you can do it constantly for days, stay on the periphery of conversations and no one will think you're anti-social, just that you are dedicated to finishing your piece before the end of the trip.
1	Fake it til you make it. For work stuff I will try to turn small talk into a topic that interests me so it's easier to socialize. Just practice, since doesn't come naturally to us.\n\n  In my personal life outside of work, I do not give a fuck about trying for small talk and just physically avoid people I can tell will try to talk my ear off. 
1	You type a lot for a person who “doesn’t like small talk” and is knowingly asking other people who don’t talk a lot.\n\nBeing genuine is easy for ISTPs because we don’t really care what people think. You, however, seem to care what people think.\n\nI think you’ve either mistyped yourself or you’re 19 and haven’t actually settled into your personality yet. In both cases, just chill. You’ll be fine.
0	I wear  fuck off hat. Too agressive?
9	Good ways to differentiate between ISTPs and ESTPs?	Hello, isTipays, interested in both your theoretical and anecdotal views on how to spot an ISTP vs an ESTP? Sometimes I find it hard to tell without testing someone (which I practically cannot do in many cases).\n\nInterested in how you’d see yourself being different both in physical and virtual settings. \n\nThanks very much :-)
14	Anecdotally ESTP are more adaptable in social situations. They are more charming because of tertiary Fe. They tend to say more controversial things because of PoLR Fi. ISTP on the other hand are more cautious because of inferior Fe so they are more afraid of offending people. Not because they care so much, but they have a harder time difusing the situation with low Fe and don't want to appear socially inept as well since we tend to be more self conscious with our inferior function. 
6	ESTP stays till the party is over and organizes the after party.  ISTP makes an Irish Goodbye at 11 -- either solo or with a couple others to go chill.
5	ISTP and ESTP might be hard to differentiate if they don’t seem either extroverted or introverted, but one of the quickest ways to determine which mbti type they are is to see them in multiple social situations. These social situations could be with family, work, school, friends, etc. I will go over those four situations and how each type would likely act\n\nFamily- ISTP’s are more comfortable with family, so they could act more extroverted, however an ESTP in a family situation would be known to be very active, a charming person, who likely has a bigger ego than a fellow ISTP. In this scenario, if the person likes to be around people more than a known introverted family member, they could likely be ESTP\n\n\nWork- An ESTP is generally well liked, as they are outgoing, and are known to be popular. Some people might not like how they tend to put themselves first, and act impulsively in work. Once again, the more outgoing they are, the more likely they are ESTP. The ISTP can struggle in new environments, though they have P instead of J, because of their introversion, if they have a harder time communicating with others they are likely an ISTP\n\nSchool- The General stereotype for an ISTP in school is to not care about School, but from my experience of ISTPS, though that tends to be true for some individuals, ISTPS are generally inclined with specific topics, though it might not be school related. They are called Virtuoso for a reason.  Once again, if they aren’t charming others, class clown/popular outgoing kid, they are likely ISTP. The ESTP on the other hand might observe the situation, realize how to act, then go on to their charming, outgoing personality. It will be hard to know the difference if an individual is only 50-65% extroverted ESTP, but if they are in the “popular group”, or are known to be well liked by most individuals, likely an ESTP.\n\nFriends- ISTP’s with 35-50% extroversion might be outgoing with their friends, but they likely won’t be able to communicate with their peers as well as ESTPs, resulting in them having a smaller friend group. While on the other hand, ESTPs are known to be the impulsive charmed of the group, and will definitely have a much more outgoing egotistical attitude compared to an ISTP. \n\nI hope this small amount of information of the stereotypical types help you differentiate between the two 
2	Hmm reading this thread makes me realize I'm somewhere in between ISTP/ESTP
1	They are quite hard to tell the difference.\nThe main one is that the ISTP is a rational type. They orient themselves around their subjective logic. They are similar to INTP in that respect, but perceive with Se/Ni rather than Ne/Si.  \nWhereas ESTP is an irrational type. They orient themselves around objective senses. Ti is not as prevalent, especially the younger the person is, and it merely serves the dominant function.  \nBut the primary focus of the ESTP is sensation whereas the primary focus of the ISTP is their logic.
1	I don't care about guessing people's mbti in real life. I use it to understand myself. Some tell me theirs. I use that to my advantage, e.g. to be okay to stay inexpressive in front of intj, or to just dance to music in front of infp. I never know a confirmed estp, beside the fact that i don't have that wide of a circle.\n\nStreotypically i read that estps are charming and have many friends? More impulsive and less capable of dealing with theory than istps?\n\nCurious on how you use mbti in real life. Why do you care to distinguish them?
1	No, Ti doesn't pay
9	What's your views/opinions on ISFPs?	What do you like and dislike about them. 
8	My brother is an ISFP.\n\nOne of the things I've always noticed is his (as best as I can describe it) attachment and nostalgia when it comes to creative things in life.\n\nWhile he's very down to earth and relatable, definitely not head in the clouds like INFPs I know, he has very strong emotional ties to certain landmarks around the world, or certain imagery, and will go to great lengths to take photos and hang them up in poster format within his various spaces. One thing that can be hard to pick up about ISFPs is how incredibly deep their emotional side can be, given how relatable and stable they can be otherwise. \n\nI find this quite interesting, and I like seeing that he is essentially what I could have been like if I were instead a feeler while keeping mostly the same functions.\n\nWhat I tend to dislike is that his Fi seems to have this weird stubbornness / attachment to things being exactly a certain way, or being unwilling to try new things. It's different to Si, but it's similar. I've tried extremely hard to get him to try new foods to no avail.\n\nThis part seems much more apparent with INFPs, but otherwise I think ISFPs are closer to us relationally than our commonly associated INTPs.
7	The girls are generally always pretty hot.
3	People I get along with very easily. Also ISFP girls....
1	Very noble but incredibly oversensetive 
1	Mostly harmless. 
1	Control freaks. \n\nGood people to know casually, great as the grandmother of a friend, and good coworkers unless you are an istp and resent control, terrible partners.
1	cute
0	They’re all individual people who deserve the time to show you who they are instead of making useless assumptions based on a 4 letter code. 
0	Conscious/Awareness before birth?	I don't know where else to share this right now but thought it'd be something interesting to share in this istp place. \nI opened my eyes, small space, light coming through this, canvas, or layer, of something, and little red lines are visible because of the light. Veins? I shake or something and at the same time, close my eyes or go back to sleep. Lot of peeps on the internet I saw say we're incapable of memory even before 2 or 3 years old. Another part of this is my mom and dad got married while I was growing in the womb. Part of the marriage was sipping red wine. When I was very young, I was watching my parents' marriage tape and started freaking out at the part my mom sipped the red wine. I was hysterical, "Mom look that's when I had Fire Water!! Look right there fire water!" Hope that was interesting.
8	Sounds like you have a very active imagination.  It's a gift.
7	Maybe your mom had a little too much fire water when she was pregnant with you...
7	everybody gets false memories 
2	Interesting. It's possible that we have memory from birth. But, not in the sense of vivid long-term memory. More like my action - my mother reaction. E.g. if i cry and my mother come comforting me or giving me food, i would just cry if i'm hungry or if i wet myself.\n\nI also wonder if light can penetrate the uterus. I understand that you can feel the light even though you've closed your eyelids. Maybe the skin/flesh to uterus is thicker and less translucent?
1	This is illegible
23	question for other women istps	I've been reading this book about how to use liminal thinking to reprogram your unconscious assumptions, and I started to think about how I have unconscious assumptions relating to "expressing emotion." \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm going to cut the preamble there, basically: I think that I have programmed fake "emotional responses" that I developed to meet social expectations of being a woman. This is not a conscious thing at all. I act out emotional responses that someone "should have" in a situation or in reaction to something, but I don't actually "feel" those emotions. The only emotion I strongly feel is anger. Anyone else? Could it be a result of unconsciously held assumptions or programming?
16	I agree.\n\nIn many conversations I have with women I notice my feminine responses are only feminine because that's how I'm supposed to act, not because that's my initial response.\n\nNot going to change that because it makes my life easier.\n\n&#x200B;
9	Anger would prob be the strongest emotion I feel too. Mostly because of all the fallacies that were all surrounded by on a daily basis. It’s all about thinking and removing yourself from the situation before reacting. You should look into some different philosophies and adopt some principles that can help you see things in different perspectives. Stoicism is my favorite, “we are not affected by events, but by the views we take on them”. The external world is completely out of your control, but what you can control is your level-headedness and your way of navigating through it. \n\nRegarding trying to meet expectations of what we’re suppose to be like as females I can see where your coming from. You might’ve picked up on certain behaviors you may perceive as being deemed as acceptable in our culture/society. When I go into work I have to put on a mask for eight hours so customers don’t leave us bad reviews. The first two weeks I acted like myself, and got three reviews with people saying I was rude, arrogant, and detached. You can either take that criticism personally or use it to improve upon yourself. I think most people expect you to be bubbly and extroverted in the hotel industry. I had to decide whether I would quit and work somewhere else, or adapt. 
7	I relate to what you say about acting the expected emotion. It's funny when someone throws a curve ball at me and I'm like "nope, no idea what face to make here. You get furrowed brow, pursed lips, and slight nod."
5	Guy here, feel like anger is the one emotion of myself i understand \n
7	[deleted]
8	so yes and no—somehow. lol. this is me.. but not quite. i would say i actually DO care about people and their dumb life shit, but the way i care is by helping them, not taking on or mirroring their feelings. i am a career coach, so people come to me all day every in half hour or hour increments to talk about how to reach their goals and organize their lives, and there are a LOT of sob stories and awkward come to jesus moments. somehow i’ve just been able to skip feeling (or pretending to feel) the emotions most people would by jumping to what we can do to solve the problem. then once we get a little ways into that, i’ll say some reassuring things or ask some questions to get them to start transitioning from ‘woe is me’ to ‘this is not the end of the world after all’, and that’s my way of making sure they do actually work through their feelings. but i’ve never felt like my pretending to feel something would help (in my particular setup/life). and work is the only time i speak to people i don’t know intimately. lmao
5	Yeah, it's because we're lacking in the compassion and empathy departments, not because we're sociopathic dicks ;) I've found that I'm very selectively empathetic and it usually has everything to do with something I've experienced myself or something I can foresee as possibly happening to me.  I'm getting better at being less selective, as I'm in my 30s and have had lots of public facing practice, but as quickly as I turn that on, I turn it off, because it's exhausting to use and feels disingenuous.  \n\nOtherwise, yes.  I feel strong and passionate anger.  I've also had 30+ years of experience in dealing with the negative outcomes of that and learning to control it.  I think it might be a very early learned reaction in young TP girls in response to also being misunderstood from a young age.  As early as you can feel misunderstood and manipulated, you can feel anger.  I think in many ways anger is a TP female's most developed emotion, especially if we grew up in SFJ dominated households, at least.  \n\nThis is my completely on the fly assessment.  Arguments welcome.\n\n--intp
4	I completely understand that. My reaction to bad news or even something that others find amazing is fairly monotone on the inside, but I have default responses for people. Oddly enough, many people find my reactions sincere which surprises me, but I keep it up anyways because connections are how the world works in this day and age.
1	It's the inferior-Fe. We have relatively low experience in social interactions because Ti prefers alone time and space. The closest thing we can do it is to feel/act on our feelings deliberately (to keep harmony). When confronted with new or extreme emotional situations, we get pumped up easily. Thus, anger (or walking away to avoid being angry).
1	[deleted]
1	Well I don’t know if it’ll help to give you an ENFP perspective, but I always like to compare to see if something is type specific or more universal. I’m a female and I often feel a lot of pressure to say things that are not honest to my girlfriends and it drives me crazy. That’s why for a very long time, my closest friends were all guys. I couldn’t stand how much I hated myself for just smiling and telling someone that their hair looked great when it didn’t. I hate funerals and how fake it seems. The last two funerals I went to were for people I cared about deeply, but were not always good people. It made me very angry and uncomfortable to hear people say dishonest and broad sweeping things about the person. I cried about their deaths in private but didn’t feel sad at the funerals. I don’t feel emotional at weddings either except once when it was my closest friends. Is that what you mean about emotional responses? \n\nBut I do feel emotions strongly. I feel sad, happy, and cry during movies. I also feel anger really strongly, but I think it’s a strong emotion, so that’s natural. I also care about people a lot and I don’t like seeing them hurt when it’s real. I’d be curious to hear how to relate or don’t relate to this! 
1	Female ISTP - it’s the strong emotions, especially anger I’ll feel the most. As a woman it’s really hard because it’s expected to be a certain way. In a team of men at work they all say I’m the cold-hearted one. \n\nOne thing I feel like is that we do recognize emotions just the same as others, but they aren’t the most important thing going on in a situation. I see this mostly at work when dealing with someone’s performance issues. If someone just isn’t doing a good job, but they’re likable, or they seem like they want to do a good job, it won’t make a difference to me. I’ll recognize the feeling of empathy and then move on - it’d be unfair to let an emotion get in the way of solving a problem. I also think society confuses empathy with enabling way to much. 
1	I dunno if I'm much help here, because emotions come naturally as I'm opposite of ISTPs. Anger is just confusion about emotions because it's just a mix of irrational conflicting emotions.   \n\n\nI guess the feeling of not feeling is a bit of detachment and unwillingness to take chances to be vulnerable.   \nHere's a bit about dealing with feelings when dealing with others: [https://youtu.be/n3Xv\_g3g-mA?t=504](https://youtu.be/n3Xv_g3g-mA?t=504)
1	neat
1	I also operate in the same way as you: logic based emotion. In situation A people expect to get reaction X so i give it to them, situation B reaction Y, and so on. Internally, i usually feel just neutral. \n\nBut whether i care to "express" emotions depends on the person. E.g. my brother knows i never react strongly to anything, so it's safe to stay stoic in front of him. If i deal with expressive new person, i will try to be more expressive as well as not to kill the (happy?) vibe. \n\nThis is because like any other conscious brain process, logic based emotion is exhausting and energy hungry. You have to keep the map between situation and expected reaction in your working memory. Actual emotion is unconscious and therefore more energy-efficient.\n\nAs for anger, i used to feel it strongly when i was a child. Now i'm in my late 20s and i don't give a crap for people trying to disturb my zen mind. Mindful meditation also helps a ton.\n\nMay i know the title of the book? I want to learn more about emotion beyond the amydala, but never find enough time to satisfy all my interests..
4	Would you like to know that your friend might potentially be seriously ill or would you rather not be bothered until there was certainty?	Probably very individual, but I'm still interested in inputs. If a person you love was awaiting a test, that might show a serious health condition, would you like to know? There's nothing to do but wait and it might even turn out to be nothing serious going on. And out of curiosity, how would you react if you were told?\n\nEdit: Here's some context: \nI (INTJ/f/36) is the one waiting for the test. Haven't told anyone because I hate when people react with feeling sorry/try to comfort me. The pressure was getting to me (much as I hate to admit it), so I told my ISTP/m/35 friend. And just as I expected he had the only reaction I needed. Basically "This sucks. Hope it turnes out well". \nIt was really helpful until my over-analyzing INTJ mind kicked in: "Did I just worry the shit out of my friend to make my self feel better? Would he rather not know since there's nothing to be done but wait?"
13	Of course I'd like to know. I won't have much of a reaction, but I'd tell them that I hope everything will turn out fine.
9	We handle information much better than most. \n\nMost people in your shoes share an issue with the expectation of getting emotional support. We suck at emotion support. Our first inclination is to figure out practical solutions. (Find the most qualified doctor for a second opinion, how to pay for treatment, how to overcome obstacles in daily life that may arise from the condition, these were the thoughts he had) The person seeking emotional support will see us as cold and uncaring, and minimizing their emotional needs.\n\nWhen he said, that sucks hope it turns out well, what he meant was that sucks and he hopes it turns out well. You probably picked the right person to tell, and if the diagnosis is confirmed this friend will probably be the first you should tell, because he won’t wallow in pity, he will jump straight to practical matters that you hadn’t considered.
7	I would rather not know until/unless something can be done about it. That said, if that something is just to take the load off your shoulders I don't mind. \n\nA simple "hey thanks for listening, it feels good to tell someone" will let me know I've just done something useful for you without stressing about what reaction you want from me to make you feel better, if that makes sense.
3	I don't think you needlessly worried your ISTP friend, they are likely quite aware that there's nothing they can do to help or fix it, so why worry needlessly?\n\nIf this is a really close friend that cares about you, telling them might be a good thing. It might give them information they need to do what they can to help: be a friend, help you do things you need to do, etc. \n\nIf it's not a very close friend, it might have seemed a little weird to them. I'm reading their response as a not close friend, and it's coming off to me like "I'm not emotionally invested in this person so I don't want to get too involved". But then again, it's impossible for me to know based on what little I've read.\n\nThe fact that you confided in this person does seem to make them important to you and I'm glad you were able to find some outlet for that. Perhaps you knew instinctively that they would be the best of your friends to not get too deep into it? Like just a vent without too much hope for a deep, meaningful investment in return.\n\nI do hope it turns out ok for you, and this can be a scary time, I hope you have a support network you can reach out to.
2	Typical INTJ se inferior worrying about giving someone a bad experience.  Dont worry,  an istp is the perfect person to say this to.  He likely decided that there is no use worrying about it before you even know if you have it.  And if you are sick, he likely still wouldnt worry much about it, an istp is a take action type, so they would immediately start coming up with a plan to treat and manage the illness. Worrying does not fix a problem.  I also hope your test turns out well. 
26	I deleted all f*cking social media	My life ks f*ckin mess andga was addicted to this garbage called Twitter. I was doing nothing all day... except getting influenced by Social media lmao.\n\nInstagram : Useless. Basically posts pics of you ? I have a mirror.\n\nTwitter : people crying all day\n\nSnapchat : same as Instagram for me\n\nI keep Facebook to keep track of ol' friends now I feel better
33	Hi welcome to this social site Reddit.\n\nEnjoy your new addiction.
11	Never got sucked in to social media. I dipped my toe in the water and it all seemed so fake and self absorbed. I don’t care what you are eating or where you are partying.
8	Thought that kind of behaviour would be rare around ISTPs
8	It's been 3 years without using social media for me. Never felt better. The whole show-off mentality and dependency just doesn't make sense to me. The further I am from social media, the better.
8	Ye i deleted social media too.
8	Smart move. At least Facebook still pretends to be about the connection between friends, Instagram is just about self-presentation and showing off your "uniqueness" and amazing life.  I hate the superficialty of it. 
5	Social media is curated to your interests.  Instagram and Snapchat are mostly just dumb vanity, but if you avoid following anyone or anything political or current events related you won't see people crying all day.\n\nMy twitter feed is mostly Jung quotes.\n\nThat said, the less screen time the better, regardless.
5	(INFP) I also deleted all social media outside of reddit. What did it for me:\n\n1. I looked back at old posts and saw that I didn't like what I said, and didn't like that things I didn't like that I said were set in stone. Its like, years of personal growth for nothing.\n2. An ex got a hold of me, and I didn't care to talk to him or hear his apology. Again, that part of my life was behind me and I was happy for it to be done.\n3. The drama...the drama...the drama....THE FUCKING DRAMA\n\nI figure, if people really want to get a hold of me, they'll fucking text or something.
4	Yep! I had kept Instagram for a bit but I never felt the need to post stuff and I was slowly getting addicted to scrolling down the feed. I hated it. I hate just staring at my phone. Even on Reddit, I go on to specific subreddits on occasion. I'd rather read or paint or study. Something productive. You took a good step towards the "right" direction dude!
3	I love Snapchat. But I don’t use the social media side. It’s essentially just replaced text messaging for me. I snaptext way more than I use actual text. 
3	I use Twitter, but usually in write-only mode, I post screenshots from Discord there :) Sometimes I do read it, but I only follow like 20 people I know.\n\n(this sounded better in my head)
3	That's great. Less social media, less screen time, more living and being present in the real world. \n\nI've been on and off social over the years, and wish I could go completely off sometimes. I use it as a way to maintain relationships (remind others I exist?) because I'm not really social irl with my wider network of not so close acquaintances/friends. I don't browse feeds or talk to people much on social. I just simply post and respond to the occasional comment that comes in. Find that it's a way of still maintaining a level of connection to others, and this sometimes has a professional/career dimension to it as my colleagues are on social. 
2	I started using Twitter regularly a few months ago, but that shit was so toxic I had to quit. I still use it as there are some bands I follow, but I stay out of the politics. I won’t even go near r/politics
2	Yeah did that a couple of weeks ago, I only use reddit now and many people don't even know what the fuck reddit is but Idc, it's the best place to waste my time on.
2	I post nothing personal on Facebook and i use reddit for home improvements and life advice. anyone on facebook that posted what they are doing was unfollowed

3	istps you just amaze me!	you guys have this aura. im talking about the unhealthy istps lol\n\n\nmost gangsters,crimanals are istps and estps, and you guys just amaze me by the fearlessness you have, you can just do anything you set your mind to. \n\n\ni knew this one istp friend he just had this aura of confidence!, he turned out going down a bad road, into drugs and stuff. but hes fearlessness just amazed me!\n\nopinions?
21	What? Being a criminal doesn't make logical sense since the risk is almost never worth the reward.
18	I know I don't speak for everyone, but in general, if we are confident, it means one of three things:\n\n1. We've dealt with the situation before and are in our comfort zone or taking a controlled risk.\n2. We are in an unfamiliar situation but we have heard/read about it because we like to have contingency plans.\n3. We have no idea what the fuck we're doing but we feign confidence and hope our wits get us by.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I am not a criminal. I just break rules that I deem arbitrary/pointless.
7	I know what you mean by aura, but I believe it is your mind tricking you based on your perceived opinions.
2	Healthy ISTPs are just like that, but were not running around doing criminal activities so its not as noticed.
1	Criminal? Lmao. We're too beautiful to pass.
1	Don't know why you think it's flattering to come in here and assert that most unhealthy xstps are criminals but it's not. This is stupid offensive and you should feel bad because who the fuck even says shit like that to someone???. WTF makes you think that's a good idea? At least back up your bullshit claim.
1	Ok
2	Can't tell if INTP or ISTP	I'll try to keep this as concise as possible, because most of these posts are unreadably long.\nI think about the universe and its constructs alot and what could be outside of it.  But I've also loved building things and working on physical projects, and I've been told I'm charming.  Maybe my ADD OCD and anxiety are making me think I'm INTP?\nI'm only 17 and I get terrible grades in school and I joke around in class, but I have lots of ideas of ways to make money.\nI play in a band and fix people's guitars.\nAlso, I fuckin love cars and modding anything I can, and built my PC and play games all the time, as well as learning how to program.\nI have a lot of concepts and ideas.
5	So this sounds a lot like me and I think it’s possible to be an IxTP. To be so close in sensing vs perceiving that you act like both. Too tired to explain fully right now but yea. 
6	I knew from the first sentence you’re ISTP. Dominant Ti ponders the universe and its constructs, that’s not exclusively an INTP thing.\n\nAnd brevity certainly isn’t an INTP thing. 
3	I test like 40% intp and 60% ISTP on some comparison test i found 
2	My INTP boyfriend has same attributes like you. Cars, building things, working on physical projects, and incredibly charming (oozing adorableness). A programmer. A self-made man.\n\nI'm ISTP. We are very similar. We follow each other's Ti rather flawlessly, but he's more chatty and great at storytelling (Ne), while I tend to grasp information and synthesise (Ni) for practical use.\n\nHow we differ is in emergency situations. This is the big difference because he lacks Se. He cannot decide or act 'instantaneously' when confronted with problems. He prefers to retreat and think through possibilities.\n\nFor example, when given with a task new to him, (he'll either ignore or research tons of it). Say, we're traveling and I ask him to get burgers. He'd research, check apps, check google, check info. As an ISTP, I'd rather go out and ask someone nearby if there's a burger shop in town. I want concrete info from real world.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
1	How much do you ramble in conversation and how many open tabs do you have on average?
8	I keep attracting you beep boops. Why?	Welp, got the answer. Feel free to talk about this kind of thing if you'd like.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n"TL;DR, why do ISTPs like ENFPs, ENTPs and ENXPs?"\n\n&#x200B;
34	I'm not going to try and decipher this, if you have a specific question, please ask it without all of the nonsense. 
16	Good looking, a good sense of humor, not overly emotional, those three things are really attractive in a woman. I've always had a thing for ENXPs, if I had to guess why it's probably because of high Ne. I think Ne brings a lot of fun and great conversation to the table, something I can appreciate since outside of my snarky remarks and practical knowledge I struggle to talk with people for too long. ENXPs have something that keeps me interested and talking for longer than any other type, so I can feel a bond growing with them quickly. Hope that makes sense to you and answers some of your doubts! 
6	[deleted]
5	\> I keep attracting you beep boops. Why?\n\nBecause you're smart, funny and physically attractive. It doesn't have to be more complicated than that.
3	what the hell is TL DR I've always wondered
7	Ugh. This stream of thought writing style isn’t conducive to understandable written communication.    \n  \nPlease use paragraphs at least when you have changed direction.  \n\nI have no idea what you are even asking.   I’m only replying because you called us “beep boops” and I found that entertaining.   \n\nStop being so self analytical and go with the flow.  
5	this is why you don't do a rail before making a text post. 
1	Shut up ENTP, I'll dropkick you and your bitch
6	Jet's MBTI - Cast Podcast	Hey Reddit, my name is jetplane48 (ESTP 7w8 sx/sp) and I am starting up a podcast in relation to MBTI. Fundamentally, the goal of the podcast is to educate the viewers of several Typology systems through a series of one-on-one's with others who are interested in the same topics. I have been conducting interviews for many years (MBTI related) and this is just an extension of that, however, I want to discuss topics that the audience wants me to cover. Naturally, I'll come up with my own material but I would love to explore topics that others have in mind. I am busy with school for the next few months but when I finish, the goal is to eventually be more consistent with these podcast uploads if this turns out to be popular enough. I'm very excited to get this started, and let's see some questions!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAR20eDTSOg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAR20eDTSOg)\n\n&#x200B;
1	This is really cool! Thanks for putting in the effort to help others understand themselves. I hope you receive the proper encouragement to continue! I haven't been able to get to a quiet, still place to give it a listen yet but I love the idea. 
15	ENFJ-ISTP Couple	I’m an ENFJ (F), dating an ISTP (M) of the same age. He’s my first boyfriend. As for him, he was previously in a 5 year relationship.\n\nWe connected on a dating app. He was my schoolmate, and I knew of him but was no acquainted. My BFF was his ex-classmate and the one who told me to like his profile and one thing led to another...\n\nIt took like two days of texting before we started to really connect with each other and catch feelings. (He says he already had positive feelings for me from the start, though) I generally take awhile to trust men, so it was really surprising to me how fast I fell into this. \n\nEventually, we made it official. Fast forward 5 months. It was great at the start. He’s never met someone like me, who’s really expressive, funny and direct. I’d never met someone like him, who didn’t play games and was just direct and honest. It helped that we both love working out and watching political satire.\n\nThings haven’t been great the last month. He was so busy with work that he had to keep cancelling on dates. I tried my best to be understanding, though I did tell him that I really wanted to see him. He started to become less expressive and consistent when texting. We finally met after 2 months of not seeing each other, and he didn’t even initiate any physical contact. \n\nI spoke to him about this. I also communicated that I felt neglected and alone in the relationship. I didn’t expect long conversations, but sometimes, he only drops me like 3 texts? He apologised for making me feel this way, but he said he had no idea I was struggling. He then said to discuss this at a later date.\n\nThen, it was 4 days of radio silence, until I initiated contact and asked to go on a date. He couldn’t because he was meeting his friends.\n\nContact resumed and just when I thought things were finally alright, last week, it was a full week of radio silence. He only called me after I dropped him a text telling him to do so, so I could ask him out. I’m planning to see him this week to talk about what just transpired.\n\nIs it time to call it quits?\n\nI’m so confused by his inconsistency - I have no idea whether his feelings have changed or he seriously thinks a relationship is supposed to function without engaging in any contact?\n\nI knew an ENFJ/ISTP relationship wouldn’t be easy, since we’re as different as night and day, but I hadn’t expected it to be this tough.\n\n
27	This is not an ENFJ/ISTP thing.  This is a guy breaking up with you thing.  He no longer wants to have a relationship with you, and, in fact, *is* no longer in a relationship with you.  He should just tell you, but at this point you should be getting the hint.\n\nI’m sorry to be so blunt, but it’s time for you to throw his number away and move on.  
7	[deleted]
7	> Is it time to call it quits?\n\nIt's up to you to decide how long you will allow to be treated this way. But it is actually a good question to raise directly to him.\n
6	Socionics says this is the perfect couple. If he suddenly starts changing his behavior, there's a problem. And I'm also baffled by the fact that you're still having to set up a date after 5 months. Sorry but I think you should just end it. Maybe he'll come to his senses then. But probably not. -ISFP 
3	Totally agree with tool-user about it not being an MB relationship thing, but wouldn't go as far to say it's over. My ENFJ SO has to drag my feelings out of me sometimes and whilst initially I'm reserved, because emotions aren't as important to me compared to trust and common interests, I always gain something positive from the experience. However in my earlier years I would quit and run pretty quick or, in my last case, bury my head in the sand and let it carry on for much longer just ignoring the issue. A lack of communication is usually the issue and if in honesty you aren't getting what you want from a relationship that should be a reason for you to break it off with him.
4	How old are you guys? He sounds like me at age 15 before I had any idea how to act in relationships.
3	This should be about your personal relational boundaries, and not up to him. I understand that it's your first relationship, but it's not the end of the world. \n\nLeave things as they are. Move on before you regret and lose respect to yourself.\n\n&#x200B;
3	Yeah this doesn't have anything to do with personality, it's just him being bored I think. Be direct and cut it off. This is a life lesson for you: When other people drag you along without reciprocating, don't simply cut off contact but be direct and tell them exactly why you're doing it, and draw the line. Ghosting while breaking up is just as bad as ghosting during the relationship.
1	[deleted]
1	If I don't talk to someone in a week I kindof forget they exist. It wouldn't necessarily mean I dislike them but it also means I'm not really thinking about them. Just my experience
1	> Is it time to call it quits? \n\nYes\n\n&#x200B;
0	Yeah, this isn't an ISTP thing. He just wants to dump you. None of the ISTPs I've been with pulled this on me, not yet anyway - had an ESTP do it though, such a motherfucker.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf it makes you feel better, he's actually your conflicting partner. You want an ISTJ.
28	I don’t know if this a Ti dom thing, a ISTP thing or just in general with people, but I’m wondering if it’s easier for you guys to work when your by your self and not being watched by cameras?	
28	Cameras don't bother me too much because it's just a fact of modern life. Having managers and supervisors around sucks it out of me though. My rationale: if they're watching, there's a reason. I want to figure the reason out as quickly as possible to help them get to the resolution so they can leave and let me do my thing. If it's an audit / observation type thing, that's great, but I prefer people just be upfront and say "I'm going to watch your work process for a little, go ahead and do your thing" rather than try to be sneaky or invisible whatever.
19	Yeah when someone's watching me preform something  when I'm usually not watched I will get thrown out of my "flow".
6	I hate people watching me work, but don't care about cameras.
6	If I know people watch me I get nervous and watched and it will not go right. I don't know why but I had this since I was little. I can work better without being watched. But I'm not sure if cameras will give the same effect. 
3	I work better if i'm being observed, or I start  using instagram, facebook, tinder, reddit...\n\nAnd being observed doesn't botter me, I actually like it
3	For me it’s not so much about being watched as it is about being interrupted. It seems like anytime you make eye contact with a manager they ask you to do something. It adds to my mental to do list and the effort of remembering more things makes it harder for me to get things done. 
3	I hate people watching me in general.
3	Yeah... I cant stand being watched when I'm trying to work on something... I usually have several iterations of attempts throughout my thinking process and would rather people not see the early attempts >. >
1	Yup
1	yea
13	What to do next?	Sorry for posting a relationship post (in case these types of questions are annoying to you guys) but I really like this guy and don’t want to mess it up. :)\n\nI am an ENFP, he’s an ISTP. We met about two weeks ago on a dating app and hit it off immediately. He’s hot, super sweet and easy to talk to. A few days after we met, I texted him inviting him to go to a hockey game with me, but we ended up staying in and chilling at his house, which was fine by me. I’m not the type of person who has sex with someone until I really feel comfortable with them and he was basically still a stranger to me at that point so we didn’t do it, but we fooled around a bit and I ended up staying the night. He made me feel so safe and comfortable and never pushed me too far even though I could tell he wanted it. \n\nAfter I left, he texted me every day little things like how was your day, hope you’re having a good day, etc. It took me aback a little bit since it wasn’t something I was used to, but I assumed he was just thinking about me a lot, and I was thinking about him a lot too, so it was fine. I went over to his house on v-day before heading out to dinner with friends and it was really nice. I could feel myself feeling more comfortable around him and enjoying myself more. He mentioned something in passing about having to focus harder on schoolwork and he also said he was really tired because he hadn’t gotten much sleep recently. After I left, he called me right when I got in my car and gave me directions all the way home because my gps wasn’t working. It’s things like that that make me smitten with him. :)\n\nBut I haven’t heard from him since. I think it’s fine, because he probably is just focusing on school but it does make me a little uneasy in case I did something wrong. I’m also self conscious that he may be no longer interested since I’m not having sex with him right away.\n\nI’m going to wait and see what happens, but I wanted to post here and see what you guys thought was going on and what I should do. It might help stop the what if loopings in my head that are going to confuse me and drive me to do something irrational. Feel free to ask for more details if you like! Thank you very much for reading. \n\nP.S. The first night, I had lost my hair tie and was kind of upset that I had to go out with my hair in a mess and I asked him for a rubber band but he said he usually just throws them away. When I went over the second night though, I saw that he had saved a rubber band on his wrist. :) maybe just a coincidence, but maybe not. Anyways, no more gushiness. ;)
17	Text him and ask how his day is or something. Don't just wait for him to initiate conversation, he may feel that if he's always initiating he is just annpoying you and you're not interested.  \nAnd the rubber band was not coincidental, it was for you
13	We are notorious for needing space and we sometimes don't think about how it affects others. It sounds like he likes you. Just shoot him a text (don't call or show up) and see if he wants to go do something soon. I have a feeling you're over thinking it. \n\n\nBTW my gf is also ENFP. We deal with things like this regularly where she thinks she did something wrong because I don't give her unprompted physical and emotional validation. I just don't think about it like that. 
4	You can't take his interest and his behaviour for granted. Texting you daily is his way of showing interest in you. But if he doesn't get anything back, he'll think that you're not that interested. \n\nIt's possible that he's not texting you now, because he's trying to gauge your interest in him. Your interest doesn't have to be expressed by texting. You can simply invite him to spend some time together doing whatever - watching something, taking a walk, studying together... any activity.\n\n&#x200B;
2	Hey, waffle. Here's how you keep communication with your ISTP.\n\n1. Do not expect your ISTP to initiate. Ever. You're the initiator type, so take charge! You can complain, but never get tired of doing it! We love it.\n2. Always ASK. Don't ASSUME. (This is how dumpster fire of communication begins between an ISTP and ENFP). Remember that we're worlds apart in terms of seeing things. \n3. Believe what he says. ISTPs mean what we say. If we say, "black", it means "black", not "dark grey". \n4. Give him alone time. 2 weeks is normal of not communicating with you. We aren't like you who tend to lose your mind and world for love. And want being always together, cuddling and exhausting all the feelings 'til you get bored.\n5. If you want sex, say it. You refrained not to and yet now you're wondering whether it's causing his detachment? That's all in your head. Stop that habit of unnecessary concern.\n6. You are not the center of his life. What we do is. Remember that always.\n7. Don't be like these stupid ENFPs who plague our lives. Search ENFP posts in this subreddit. You'll figure.\n8. Keep your emotions to your fellow squishy friends. We need only little. Even a smile can make our day. \n\n&#x200B;
0	That is *perfect*. This seems like a duality type in socionics. Your man is an SLI, you are an IEE, this is the best combination an SLI and an IEE can have when addressing cognitive functions, which may explain why you clicked so fast. This is definitely a relationship worth the extra effort. Just dont barrage him, the patience is part of the effort 
13	Help with feelings?	From what I’ve read on here, ISTPs are supposed to have minimal feelings. \nHowever, I feel that I am a very empathetic person, to the point where those short ig/fb/yt clips about sad things make me cry immediately. Pretty much any video with sad music or and lonely old person will make me cry within seconds. Even thinkjng about it made me cry. I will even do this in public.\n\nHowever, I don’t  have feelings about my own life/people around me. I’ve never been emotionally attached to anyone, and while I’ve made really close friends, and am grateful for my family, I feel like my feelings are more of loyalty than of love. Does anyone have friendships like those in anime or movies? \n\nSo, two questions:\n1. Are there any other istps who irrationally cry when they hear sad music or watch a sad video (even if it’s poorly made/not good)?\n\n2. Is what I feel for my friends and family loyalty or love? Does it matter? How do most people feel about their friends?\n\n19, female
31	ISTPs can have very meaningful, deep, emotional connections to things and people. I hate to break it to you, but I think you're normal.\n\nThe whole "ISTPs are robots" thing is a little exaggerated. It doesn't mean we don't have feelings. But at least in my case, it usually means "I share my thoughts regardless of the feelings of others because I value truth over feelings". That can lead to us being seen as cold or unfeeling, erroneously in my opinion.
7	i’ve been crying for 3-4 years. (25M)\n\nSure we don’t show emotions right out. My colleagues think I’m emotionless therefore I dont feel hurt from offensive shit or what not. They are so wrong but I can’t blame them.
7	Unfortunately this is normal and something you are stuck with as an ISTP. We arent emotionless robots, its more that our feelings are more deeply rooted in physical things. The homeless, neglected, abused, hell even old derelicts cars/trucks make me have pangs of empathy, remorse, and sadness. Its just something you have to learn to deal with.  
5	My husband is an ISTP and he suggests that you stop it.\n\nNow my contribution. When we were dating, I broke up with him for a brief time and he cried. He hasn't cried since, but clearly it's a thing that they do sometimes. My husband is very loyal to his family and friends. He just doesn't like most people. The ones he does though, he'd take a bullet for them, I have no doubt. As far as music and movies, he's capable of feelings but he doesn't emote them outwardly at all. He'll say something effects him but he remains stoic. But a lot of his family is like that and they're not all ISTPs.
3	Give me whiskey, play Bob Dylan's Most Of The Time, I'll be reduced to tears.
3	> 1. Are there any other istps who irrationally cry when they hear sad music or watch a sad video (even if it’s poorly made/not good)?\n\nMaybe the ISTP aspect of this is not so much the crying or not crying, but the fact that you label it as "irrational" and ask others if it's normal. :) I think feelings often seem sort of *alien* to us, both in ourselves and others. And many of us might not communicate them very skillfully. But that doesn't change the intensity, or "worth" of the feelings.\n\n> Is what I feel for my friends and family loyalty or love? Does it matter? How do most people feel about their friends?\n\nAren't these excellent questions? :)\nAgain, if you weren't an ISTP (or something close), you probably wouldn't question these things as much. People to whom feelings and relationships are "natural", probably don't _need_ to think about these things like you do. Maybe they take it for granted. Maybe the distinction between "true" and "fake" feelings, is less important for a natural feeler. Always seemed like a paradox to me, when "feelers" are able to express affection in a seemingly much more careless, irresponsible way, because they sort of own the domain. (Obviously this is a generalization and how it appears to us, no criticism intended towards any personality.)\n\nYou don't sound weird to me from your description.
3	I just got my period the morning after I posted this. Might explain why I was so existential 
3	**1.**\n\nNo, I don't. I once leaked a couple of tears in a cinema theater a few years ago because a woman was begging a doctor to take her daughter's rare medical case else she die, and I was stressed out at the time.\n\nAnd of course, my friend was watching me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2.**\n\nISTPs can experience love; we're generally not sociopaths. Expressing it, however, can be difficult. At least for me.
2	> Are there any other istps who irrationally cry when they hear sad music or watch a sad video (even if it’s poorly made/not good)? \n\ni am susceptible to teary eyes when witnessing betrayals or reconciliations\n\n> Does anyone have friendships like those in anime or movies? \n\ni cant pinpoint the feeling of love but i value loyalty and the feeling of caring towards those close to you.\n\n&#x200B;
1	1. Yes, sometimes I do that because I think I recognized my feeling but I dont know how to express it, tears already collected around my eyes. It's like I'm sad/happy/angry, my brain lost the correct words and my body speaks for itself through crying?\n2. Yes, until today I still wondering what is like falling in love, like those depicted in books and movies. Is it like when I'm obsessed with a new hobby/project that I keep thinking about it? But human isn't a hobby or project. 
1	It's probably our body's reaction to us not thinking about our emotions so it comes out that way
1	You are growing up and you are female, probably it's hormones.
51	Married to ISTP.	Just a quick note to say I love ISTPs. I'm a female INTP and I married a male ISTP a few years ago. We have one of the most easy rapports I've ever had. When we met we were like magents. He is my best friend. I love that he is not easily offended, he is honest and straightforward. My head is always in the clouds but he grounds me. I think about the future, he thinks about the present. We love to make fun of each other and things that are stupid or illogical and we seriously love to argue.  Sometimes he will come home from a stressful day needing space and I like to jokingly ask whether it's a good time to talk about our feelings. Hahaha cracks me up every time. Anyways, with some obvious exceptions like Tom cruise, you guys are awesome. Don't ever change ;) 
13	Thanks! \n\n\nI never knew Tom Cruise was ISTP. We do have Harrison Ford though so it's not all bad. 
9	> Sometimes he will come home from a stressful day needing space and I like to jokingly ask whether it's a good time to talk about our feelings. Hahaha cracks me up every time. \n\nIt cracked me up too :D\n
9	Calm down with the Fe that's not allowed here
4	I'm a female INTP married to an ISTP.  I relate to much of this except he hates arguing and isn't so good at laughing at himself but we enjoy laughing at other people. We're jerks. It's fun.  \n\nYou seem to have better Fe than I do. 
2	ISFJ (31F) married to an ISTP (32M). I can't agree with you more. Being married to a logical, respectful introvert makes for a very peaceful life.     ISTPs hold a very special place in my heart!
2	ISTP bf too! Love that they are not easily offended! 
1	Which type are you?
1	I'm an INTP with an ISTP too and you described the dynamic to a "t". ISTP's are great
1	Im an ISTP and hope to find a understanding match like you someday. Being an ISTP isn't always so glamorous.
1	My INTP has been depressed for three months now. Unresponsive. We were magical together. Best dates ever. But he has ghosted me after two love letters. It's almost a month now. First time I am brokenhearted (because he's struggling and he doesn't want me to get near him).\n\nI love you, even when I can't say it or these things to other types. There's just something about INTPs that make me feel heard, respected and so childlike.\n\nSex is heavenly as well. It's perfect. Ugh. Fuck you, INTPs.
1	Thanks,  🍻See lads here's to adventure if they're for it.

I tried hard to reconcile at first but now am trying to move on. Based on this story, should I try again or let it go. I do feel like he's been my best friend despite details below.(Sorry, I'm an ENFP. Sit back for the novel...)\n\nI am an ENFP who was done with my 18 year marriage to an ISTP (too little emotion, too much judgement, too little honesty about anything financial-unknown credit cards, lied about purchases, past jobs, etc. early in our relationship, yet really working on himself later in our relationship) and fantasizing about living in an apartment or condo on my own or with my son.\n\nThen we had our discussion where I told him I slept with someone 15 years ago (super shitty on my part and I had been a hypocrite about all of his honesty things). He said he wanted a divorce right away and moved into the spare room. So angry and rage filled. Emotional talks every night and then we had sex two nights later. Really nice sex that we hadn’t had in years.\n\nDue to my immaturity with conflict and recognizing my true feelings, when I got angry with him I’d withdraw emotionally and sexually. But now that all the emotions were out and all the truths were out, we became more physically attracted to each other (or I at least did to him, he’d been initiating sex for awhile and I rarely “bit”). So sleeping together a few times a week, living under the same roof, sharing a young son, figuring stuff out. Then he said he was moving in with his boss (10 years younger, two young boys, also going through divorce). Took me by surprise at how fast he was moving on yet still wanted connection and sex with me. Keep trying to stick to no sex but it’s been hard because damn, it’s been so good. And so confusing.\n\nFeel like I’m falling in love again. But he’s definitely moving on and still so angry about infidelity. And then his boss who he has a “special connection” with. What the hell people? Now it’s been almost three months since we had the talk where he wanted divorce. Still wants sex and “connection” with me but is texting boss all the time and moving in with her. I’m trying to be in it just for the sex (who knows how long it will be for me again?!) but it’s hard to separate emotions. I feel like I’m fucking myself over but have little self control. I suggested reconciliation about a month and a half in and he freaked out, “Do you think I forgot about what you did?” Oh, lord. What a reality TV show. Is this kind of thing normal? I’ve been together with him since I was 21 and for 21 years. Only had one boyfriend before him. A couple of times, he's tried to say "no sex" and couldn't stick to it. Is it all physical? Or the 21 year connection? Or is it something I should try to nurture?
9	Once an ISTP turns on his apathy, there's no changing it. There's nothing to read. You're a good fuck, and all the years you spent were already set on fire (without you knowing it).\n\nYou are ENFP. You struggle with Inferior Si (everything about the past and mistakes). We don't have Si. We don't give a fuck about our past. It's done.
6	I might be the only one who thinks this, but was you admitting you cheated on him 15 years ago some sort of emotional manipulation? No offense, but the only people I know that would drag something like that out 15 years later are ones looking to get some sort of reaction. Don’t know what you expected from that conversation. The fact that you’re holding out hope for him despite A. Having cheated on him before B. Weren’t happy in the relationship and fantasized about leaving C. Purposefully told him info about you cheating that would permanently damage the relationship, sounds toxic af. 
10	So 3 years in on your marriage you fucked some other dude. Kept quiet about for god knows how long. You stole 12 years of someones life. Think about that. \n\nI kind of stopped reading after that.\n\nEdit: i read a little bit more. I think what happened is, that there is no more trust. \n\nI know for me in a similar situation, such betrayal cannot be repaired. But I’m kind of black and white in that sense. \n\nPeople can pull a lot of shit with me, but once you cross a boundary I’m done. 
3	How about you just show him this Reddit thread and offer to fuck his brains out for a couple weeks? Would make you two produce oxytocin and all that jazz.  Fall back in love, or whatever. This whole thing was tl;dr for me, but ISTPs are pretty sensual people (in my experience), sensual as in, they want to fuck you - they'll usually forgive you after that and some begging, in my experience. Also, the only reason he lied to you, is because he wanted to impress you. ISTPs show emotion by doing stuff for you, you know how many ISTPs offered to fix my car and or computer? That's bascially foreplay.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso he doesn't love his boss, she's the rebound for the intimacy you didn't give him. If you want him, back, just tell him straight up, no emotional manipulation. He changed for you, but you never changed for him. Oh and I'll bet money he partially used you cheating on him many years ago as an excuse to end the relationship, that whole need fulfillment deal.
1	Did you ever apologize in a sincere way about the infidelity?
1	There are so many things I could say, but I'm going to limit myself to answering the direct questions only. In case you want more answers, ask more questions.\n\n>  Is this kind of thing normal?\n\nNo, but then again is it normal to cheat on your husband?\n\n> Is it all physical? \n\nNot only physical, no. His feelings for you are not just gone like that.\n\n> Or the 21 year connection? \n\nThis plays a big part.\n\n> Or is it something I should try to nurture?\n\nThat's very hard to answer. If you keep the sex going that keeps him attached, but it also increases your chances of disappointment when he moves out with his boss. This is most likely going to happen regardless of how much nurturing you do.\n
1	Thank you
1	True that. Well, maybe I’ll give it a shot. Thanks for advice. Gonna have to check out socionomics...
0	As I read my posts, I think, man, just let each other go already. But there’s a pretty unique and magnetic feeling connection
7	Music That Makes You Happy	Music thread fuck yeah. Post whatever you currently listen to that gets you pumped or makes a bad day better. \n\nI'll start. \nI like a lot of EDM. Just a ray of fucking sunshine and energy. Reminds me that that bad days aren't forever. With or without Lyrics.\n\nLove this band called Oh Wonder, their songs are very healing. Helps bring out emotions when I'm having trouble acessing them/letting stuff out that needs to get out that I'm auto-bottling. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAhRiUeJ8E&list=PLXbqqofRCultvbn0XUUvD6DeTn7zLCICq\n\nMAck & Diesle's *The Rhythm* Always gets me pumped. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdstkBrDfdM\n\nAll Don Diablos stuff makes me feel like I have to move too. \n\nNew one I just found today that I've been listening to on repeat for the last hour: Bali Bandits- Girls and Boys https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF8It_la_UE
5	Nothing makes me want to go out and kick some butts like some old school Metallica. \n\nHere's three of the greatest albums ever to have graced this Earth. \n\nRide the Lightning\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=VGzm8rTz8y4\nFavorite song: Creeping Death\n\nMaster of Puppets\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-YQm_1AWpr8\nFavorite song: Battery\n\nAnd Justice for all\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=0NNadbG60Co\nFavorite song: Harvester of Sorrow
3	i like a lot of different kinds of music, i guess rap makes me happiest though. i like old school groups like wu tang clan, three 6 mafia, mobb deep, bone thugs n harmony, etc. and newer shit like run the jewels, lil ugly mane, death grips, teamsesh, flatbush zombies, danny brown, shakewell, ghostemane, $b, night lovell, etc. after that my favorite genre is probably hard rock/nu metal like tool, deftones, chevelle, katatonia, etc
5	Music is a big part of my life. If anyone is looking for new music here are my recommendations. \n\nRATKING and MF DOOM are great if you have an appreciation for boom bap rapping. I really tend to gravitate towards 70s too, taking appreciation to ELO, Queen, Lennon, Bowie, Simon & Garfunkel (both artists respectively), Fleetwood Mac, Earth Wind & Fire, Santana, Toto, Billy Joel, Sweet, and the legendary George Harrison (All things must pass is a dirty dirty album). Currently I am holding off on listening to the beetles (Hoping to save some of the good stuff for down the road). Alternative is great too, MGMT, Kid Cudi’s  WZRD, Sticky Fingers, Weezer...Etc. Rock is dope, I had just found out about King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard and the band The Velvet Underground ( The album w/ Nico is really good!!). Lastly, if you take appreciation to Zelda like video game moog soundtracks go check out Mort Garrison - Plantasia.\n\nThat’s pretty much it classical and piano are pretty cool too! I can add links to my 70s playlist and Alternative playlist upon request. Much love to all who have read, hope I at least entertained one person lol.\n
3	Hope I'm not too late. A song that totally got me pumped last week got me to do 401 pushups in 4 days. The Fire by The Roots. The song before that was Pikachu Use Thunderbolt by Asher Postman. I'm still a noob so I won't try to do links. Oh Wonder is awesome. Landslide was one of the first I ever heard of from them.
2	I like powerful, gangster music.\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/burgosmusic/burgos-i-like-produced-by-bergotti\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/night_lovell/bad-kid-1\n\nWhat you think of it?
2	I like whatever gets me really moving.\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/tisoki/feel-the-power\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/rustyhook2/just-a-lil-bit\n\n\nBut like also slower stuff. \n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/petre-mihai-1/riding-solo-dir-by-aris-jerome\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/vvndvls/shlohmo-jeremih-fuck-you-all-the-time-remix-extended-cut\n\nI try to pride myself in the music I listen to. I see it as a sort of representation of myself. Hard to pin down, but never a bad time. 
2	The music that I listen to depends very much on the mood that I'm in/am trying to get into. I also go through huge music phases in my life where I obsess over a certain genre. Right now it's K-pop/rnb/hip-hop. 
2	Few songs do more for my (immediate) happiness than this one. \n\nUp by EARTHGANG (hip hop, the good kind)\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zgNVvtOp8mU&feature=youtu.be\n\nAs one astute YouTube commenter put it "This song puts my depression in the corner of a boxing ring." \n\nHope you enjoy it! 
2	EDM: deadmau5, rokysopp, dream koala, aphex twin, burial, clams casino, FOMH (YouTube label - British wave music) \n\nRap/Hiphop: Aesop Rock, Tyler, childish Gambino, kid Cudi, joji, xxxtentacion \n\nAlternative/rock: a perfect circle, Deftones, tame Impala, psychedelic porn crumpets, ratatat, Radiohead

1	Anyone works at stretegic consulting?	Hello people\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCurrently i'm at the end of my college degree (engineering) and i'm seriously thinking about applying to strategic consulting like McKinsey, Bain and others consulting companies.\n\nAs any other ISTP, i love to think and solve problems, but I have two major fears about consulting:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1) As consultor, i will need to use a lot of Fe? My last job I had to handle with dumb and emotional people, and this stressed me a lot. I can handle with people issues very well, but everyday in weeks I start to get very stressed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2) I will need to handle too many theoretical ideas without validating them? I struggle a lot when I can't check if my ideas are right or wrong.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSomeone can help me clarify with these insecurities? Thanks a lot
3	Consultants need people skills
2	strategic......might wanna correct your title 
1	First, correct you title please.\nSecond, watch @TheFutur on YouTube. It's a design channel but if you search good for the strategic videos, you will have a sense of how it looks like in reality. He does this really well and explains it good and do able in my opinion. (w/ Melinda Liversy are the good ones I think)\n\nWho asks more questions is in control. 
14	Going back to be being friends	Would you have a problem with going back to being friends with someone if you once had feelings for the person? I read somewhere that as an Istp, you dont want to be reminded of the strong feelings once enjoyed. And going from being intimate to just friendship is like going backwards for the Istp. Do any of you agree on this? \n\nAs an infp/Enfp, this is not how I function so it’s interesting to me.  
13	Depends on three things:\n\n1. Was the ending a dumpster fire? (If no, then I'm open)\n2. Is that person fundamentally trustworthy? It means if he means friendship, then no ambivalence is going to happen. Just friendship. Keep your feelings away from me. (If yes, then I'm open)\n3. Will the person leave me alone and not into gossip, chatting/calling because bored, or keep inviting even though I've refused many times? (if yes, then I'm open)\n\nI'm different in friendship than in relationships. If I cared about you as a lover, don't expect that in friendship. I have a very radical thick line.\n\n................\n\n \n\nI’m friends with my INFP ex. He's an exception (because he doesn't get tired initiating contact and asking stuff.) We chat about what our new projects are, mainly. But he still love-bombs me occasionally and still declares his love for me (drunktexts maybe?). He still calls me, my love. It makes me cringe. While I don’t like to probe, I can’t help but think maybe he’s still in love with me. But I don’t take it seriously. He doesn’t get more than a smile emoji. I’m very clear about my boundaries (and they're not going to change). \n\n&#x200B;
7	Yeah for me I can appreciate what I liked about them from the start. I do need sometime to process before being able to hang out though. 
7	If you are an ENFP you have a very good chance of going back to just friends with your ISTP. I don't know much about INFPs so I can't comment on them.\n\nISTPs in general don't go back to being friends after a romantic relationship, but ENFPs seem to be the exception from this rule.
6	If I can't stay friends with someone I broke up with, it inevitably means I made a very bad choice in associating with them in the first place.\n\nThis is an observation in hindsight.
4	Funny enough, I once dated an INFP that later recommended we go back to being friends when it didn't work out. To answer your question yeah I can't go back to being someone's friend after I've developed a romantic feeling for them. So basically, I told that guy "fuck that".  
4	Nope.  I'd want them out of my life.
3	i’m still friends with all my exes. my thinking is i clearly thought they were a good enough person to date so why wouldn’t they be a good enough friend to have even after we break up? however, i have been lucky since all my relationships have ended without any toxicity. 
3	Its just too much hardwork to go back. They had a good share of me back then. Forward ever.  \nI suppose ISTP's are prone to being misunderstood all the time.
3	When a romance breaks down I tend to see that as the trust falling apart as well - I thought we were helping each other be happy and be better people. I highly value a small number of friends who help me when I need it, and if you don't want to be on that list then I don't care to know you, honestly. Perhaps this is some weird thing where I never learned to separate friendship from attraction, but outside of an intimate relationship my friendships with girls are nothing more than small talk, so exes are reduced to that level, if that.
3	FTM ISTP here. \n\nDepends how the relationship went. Have had a lot of romantic encounters so far but if they end in a way that doesn't break the trust, doesnt betray me, or hurt me excessively, then I don't see how its not possible. \n\nLast ex was a huge dumpster fire and I will never trust like that ever again. \n\nVery recent date i quickly deducted that he was not mature enough/was not what I needed  in a relationship and several things he did made me uncomfortable, and sapped all attraction very quickly. I trust he's still a good person though, and hes helped me quite a bit, so I think having a developed friendship would still be nice while he works on himself. I told him as such, was completely honest with how I felt and why we aren't going to work, and he took it well. Wants to work on himself.  If someone can walk away with being told how uncomfortable they made someone they were super attracted to and still take that criticism and want to be better and have a friendship, you can't tell me theres not good potential. (potential for a friendship. I dont expect him to get better in even 3 years, and don't ever plan on dating him as it stands.)
2	I'm friends with my ex wife. 
1	I'm straight. So no to lady friends, it's kinda pointless. Either you are someone I'm sexually interested in, or just another face in the crowd.
1	A girl (ENFP I think) recently asked me to be in a relationship with her (on Valentines day for Christsake) ,to which I declined simply cause I just feel like I could not commit to a relationship with someone like her. But stuffs kinda been awkward for us since then and honestly I cannot really talk to her normally now and with her saying all this weird stuff over snapchat to me after she sort of broke the ice over the whole thing I just feel like I cant be bothered talking to her. She's very exhausting to deal with and is quite annoying, no offence ENFP's. 
1	If I was in a relationship with the person beforehand, then probably not, even if it ended mutually , it would feel so weird to not be able to interact with them at the same level of intimacy.\n\nIf I just had feelings for them and they rejected me, maybe. But itd be kinda weird as well, them thinking that you like them and all.
1	Still friends with my last gf. Sorta. We were on and off / fwb for a bit, but I still have feelings for her. Things have kinda cooled off a bit recently, and I know I should probably cut all ties but I don't want to 
0	I want to but his girlfriend is so insecure he has to cut out or keep a distance from all of his female friends so :/
5	Recommed any books about loving yourself?	i’m certain ISTPs are capable of loving themselves. i’m just in a rut i know i can get out and its time i get out. i’m really fucking sick of this. I think I’m getting better but I still find it hard to love myself.\n\nI find that books help me a lot so is there any book or writer that is good at ya know helping you see that you come first? And that loving yourself is everything?
7	12 rules for life 
3	The youtube channel "The School of Life". Guy has Ted Talks and books out. Good listening.\n\nGo to the profile page to see playlists. The search page can look overwhelming.
3	i think if you want a change in mindset, you need to change your lifestyle. start working out, eating better, dressing how you want to look, focus on job/school, spend less time consuming media, spend more time doing things that you want to get done (hobbies are important but also stuff like cleaning/fixing up your place, learning about things, pursuing a career), spend more time with people you care about, etc. there may be negative influences you need to remove as well like drugs, unhealthy relationships, other bad habits or addictions (porn, food, whatever). while you're doing this i would reccomend reading books about philosophy and self improvement to keep yourself motivated, but you won't start being happy just because jordan peterson told you to wash your penis or whatever.
22	fellow lady istps i have a question for ya	question : does \~ lady times \~ make you a hormonal maniac and then you're also angry because you *know* you're having irrational emotions ??\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: i should have made it clearer that i'm not outwardly angry - i just realize that i'm being irrational and then am angry with myself. but thank you for all the comments ! i'm glad most of us are on the same page. 
29	Dude, yes. For me it's like my threshold for experiencing negative emotions goes way, way down. I get frustrated or annoyed by things way more easily. Honestly it's most noticeable when I'm playing video games, if I have PMS and lose a couple games I tilt like crazy. And then I feel stupid for getting mad at a video game, but I can't make myself not be mad, which is even more frustrating. The best I can do is try to notice when it's happening and then stop playing. 
14	Yes. Pregnancy and postpartum hormones shed some light on what “normal” women must experience. 
8	Yes. I want to be left alone the entire week before my period because I am aware of how uncharacteristically and irrationally emotional I am behaving. I can’t endure things like traffic, or being rushed, or people standing too closely to me in a line/queue. I am on edge about everything and can feel all this tension inside of me. \n\nThen, my period starts and it’s like the pressure immediately releases and I’m back to normal again. I hate it. 
12	No.  
6	For me it's more sad/depressed than angry but then I get mad at myself for being sad for no reason.
7	Neither. But I think that just depends on your body. Hard to mess with hormones. 
7	When I wasn't on birth control I would get too emotional about really trivial things when PMSing, and I'd realize it at the time and get mad because I knew I went being rational- but would still act super emotional because of the hormones reacting with my brain chemistry.\n\n  I'm on birth control now so the hormones don't fuck with my emotions anymore (except very very very rarely, maybe 1 or 2 cycles out of a year). Much better.
9	no, i don’t let my feelings control me despite the time 
2	Yeah. I get mad at myself for being so irritated over nothing lol. But tbh my pms doesn’t go beyond that
2	Lots of understanding and stuff, but man does this thread make me love my penis! That little fellah is a trooper AND doesn't go apeshit for a week and pump me full of hormones and pain. I feel for yall!
2	I cried on the way to the grocery store the other day. Sooo, yeah. Not a fan of feeling that much negative emotion at all. 
1	definitely. and then i get ‘mad’ at my bf for being inconvenienced that i have emotions for once. lol. 
1	Not angry but I am more Fe when it's near that time. My husband you me my car was junky last month and I teared up. He was extremely upset because he thought he hurt my feelings while I had already Moved on.
1	FTM ISTP here. Gonna answer anyway. \n\nYes, period horn is real and it is hell. I've never been angry for it though. Just excessively horny and wet. I've only ever had some frustration that the constant desire to jerk off kept me from getting shit done, and it was annoying. Doesnt happen that often though. \n\nOtherwise I've never had any chronic moodiness or PMS from periods. Like, maybe once? But mine are kind of rediculous and aren't ever consistent. 
1	Haha, yes. However, I don't usually get upset.
1	Not really.
1	i'm a guy and an istp and i act irrationally a lot of the time, everybody does. nobody is never not controlled by their emotions
1	Istp or isfp?	I took the personality test last year in school and i got istp, but I've been doubting whether I'm really thinking or feeling recently. Took 2 quizzes which 1 of them I got thinking and the other quiz I got feeling.\nHow do I really find out which one am I?
4	the dominant function is completely different, Ti vs Fi. read about the differences between them to see which sounds more like you. there's tons of descriptions of the functions online but here's a short one of each\n\n>Introverted Feeling is constantly taking in the world around them. They filter it out through a lens of “good/bad” or “this is me/this isn’t me.” An introverted feeler is very self aware of who they are and their place in the world.\n\nand\n\n>People with Introverted Thinking want the world to make sense in a logical manner. They form an internal framework of how the world works. It is constantly being modified and improved through life experience and experiments.\n\nfrom personalitygrowth.com, first link that comes up
2	probably istp, thing is, i'm the same way, you're probably borderline, more of a thinking than a feeling. which is good, check out the isfp subreddit, if it makes you cringe, then you're an istp, at least the way i see it
1	HELP: is my friend istp or intp?	alright, fellas, i need some help with typing my good friend.\n\nfor months I was certain he had to be an intp, the descriptions fit him quite well and he seems to agree. functions wise i have never doubted he's a Ti dom. dichotomy wise, i - t - p are all very obvious in his behavior. we've both been introverts our whole life and somewhat lazy.\n\nhowever, me and him were talking about mbti today in class, this isn't something we usually do, because he is not even remotely interested in reading about functions. or mbti theory in depth, i believe it bores him (made me suspicious because it seems like intp's are at least moderately invested). During this conversation, he mentions reading the intp sub and not relating, apparently people seem a bit stuck up, decorate their sentences with pretentious word and in general, aren't "chill enough" etc. i think: idk intps are obviously all different and this is the internet.\n\nlater i wondered if maybe he was mistyped, and i was biased enough to type him as a intuitive because of something subconscious. Ne isn't all that present in him, at least not externally recognizable. we are both fond of deep conversations and it's genuinely something we enjoy doing. say we're talking about immigration: if we did things his way there would be an exploration of immigrants until we both were satisfied and ready to move on to the next topic or when the awkward silence appears.\n\nin retrospection - i am always the one steering the convo to loosely related things, making connections and bringing in anecdotes "thats like..you know when...similar to". he follows along and isn't irritated by this at all.\n\nconfirmed Se users i know tease me for always bringing so-called random experiences or ideas into a discussion. the problem is that, he doesn't fit se stereotypes either. he definitely is a thousand times more observant than me, but "active", "hands-on" and "thrill-seeking" aren't adjectives i associate with him.\n\nwhat do you think? any traits that are very istp i should be looking for:)? how does one differentiate?
3	ISTP.\n\nSe: He's bored with theory, he's not a generator of related topics/ideas and he's very observant.\n\n"Active", "hands-on" and "thrill-seeking" come with a strong Se, but Se isn't that strong in all ISTPs. I myself am very close to the middle of the S/N axis and even though these stereotypes are too strong for me, I still identify with them to some degree.

2	Not all ISTP's are badass adrenaline junkies, even though some of us are. You can still be an ISTP and want to be more chill/domestic. \n\nS vs N in Ixtps comprise our learning mechanism. How is your friend learning? Via observances, things he can see, touch, taste, feel? or is he learning via imagination, abstracts and concepts?\n\nI find when it comes to learning the goals are different between the types. \n\nThe INTP wants to get obsessed so they can find out everything about a subject and all that it relates to, and culminate so much knowledge that they can pull it out of their ass whenever needed. They want to be the human equivalent of wikipedia. Even if the information isn't personal, relevant, or related to them, they may still want to stick around and listen just for the sake of absorbing more more more more info. (youll see them make lots of associations, conclusions, and branch off the original topic easily, whereas the ISTP will be more focused, will want to stay on the topic while learning, "how does this relate to xyz im learning about? How is this relevant?" will be their thinking, may be bothered by irrelevant associations.)\n\nThe ISTP wants to get obsessed because its 1. Fun. 2. They simply want to be good, or competent at something. May show more disinterest if they can't find the value in it, or relevance towards their lives. The closer it is to their interests, the more theyll light up and pay attention. \n\n**Other notes:** \nYou may also find that some INTP's will exhibit some of the pretentiousness associated with that of the fuckboi/incel crowd in regards to beliefs of intelligence. Please venture to r/iamverysmart for examples. This prententiousness can be seen in various NT's across the spectrum depending on development. I usually see it the most from Ni-Dominant people (INFJ/INTJ), however it all depends on the individual. I have met some very openminded kind INTJ's, and then I have met some INTJ's that comprise the worst of these stereotypes. \n\nI don't see much of this in ISTP's. When ISTP's tend to have bad perspectives, it usually involves a very "cut the bullshit" attitude? You'll see their Se has hardened them into a narrower viewpoint in sense that if they don't see it in reality, they don't believe it. Actions over words always. Very distrusting. Like someones x war veteran dad. \n\nNT's also tend to display a very strong sense of apathy towards others that I don't see in ISTP's. 
3	Is he a vindictive asshole or a clueless asshole?
1	Look at Ni vs Ne.\n\nIf he listens to you and gets to synthesize to a premature conclusion everything you said (just to clarify whether he got it right), then he's ISTP.\n\nIf he expands what you're saying and deepens it with associations (without quickly coming into conclusions), then he's INTP.\n\nBarely a difference, but that's me and my INTP boyfriend in discussions.\n\nAddition:\n\nSe vs Ne\n\nISTPs use past real world experiences to give breadth to any subject. Example: death = his experience when a  relative died\n\nINTPs use concepts and theories to deepen a statement. Example: death = (insert his favorite philosopher's take on it) \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
1	I have a strong Se dominant.\n\nI'm fine with theory as long as it's a cool topic. And I'm not too much of a thrill-seeker.I like to delve deep into ideas that pertain to me.\n\nTeleportation is a neat idea, but it doesn't spark my interest. I'll still listen.\n\n&#x200B;
11	Sports?	What are some sports you like?\nEdit: Realised I wasn't super clear: I meant playing sports, but you can talk about sports that you like to watch too. 
17	None. I can’t even fake support the local teams. If someone asked me about a local athlete I would be so clueless that it would be obvious that I didn’t know anything.
12	Oh, I see that we have a problematic lack of separation. Watching vs doing. Anyways. Watching: pretty much limited to the super bowl,  people are awesome videos, some drifting and the occasional extreme sport video. Doing: All of them, can't remember a single sport I didn't like. As for hobbies I've done: football, basketball, skateboarding, mountain hiking, biking, running, tennis and freediving. Esportsy videogames.
8	Anything with an internal combustion engine and at least two wheels/tires. \n\n\nMy favorite being Formula Drift. But I’ll happily watch F1, GRC, WRC, Indy 500, super stock, etc. Only racing I really can’t stand is nascar. \n\n\nI don’t follow it religiously the way people do basketball/football/baseball/etc. But I generally do stay pretty close to Formula drift simply because I’ve been around the drift scene for 10 years. \n\n\nNow as far as sports i participate in, I don’t do many regularly. However I’m a huge fan of disc golf, competition shooting, and autocross (although I don’t get to do autocross very often anymore because I sold my project car). 
6	Watching men play with balls is akin to watching paint dry to me. I'll maybe watch the world cup every 4 years, until we get eliminated. Motor sports I like, but I have a limited attention span. I used to enjoy playing Football (proper, not American Handegg), Badminton, Tennis, Table Tennis.
4	Hockey.  Soccer.  The rest are boring to me.
3	Swimming. Solitary sports.
3	Climbing, running, swimming, paragliding and skiing mostly
4	Do esports count? If so, Overwatch. 
2	Hockey, love that shit. Playing hockey and making music are my two favourite things. Don’t really fuck with any other sports tho, I suck at them.
2	MMA is the only one I like to watch and participate in.  
1	Association Football. Squash, badminton, tennis. 
1	Floorball
1	Soccer
1	Love soccer, both playing and watching
1	Watching? None.\n\nPractising? A bunch - cycling, table tennis, running, weight lifting, volleyball and probably more.\n\n&#x200B;
1	What are these words you speak of? Team, sports?\n\nI don't know about you but me as istp, I'm so introverted that a concept of a team bigger than 3 or 4 doesn't appeal. Roll with the tight crew or none at all.
1	Used to be really into paintball in the early to mid-2000s before it sorta died down
1	Running is my life!
1	I play badminton. Kinda into handball and table tennis too.
1	Motocross, supercross, arenacross, endurocross, enduro, trials, supermoto. 
1	I like to play volleyball and table tennis. But I'm not super passionate about any sport. 
1	i'm not good at sports but i like playing them. i guess basketball would be my favorite, idk how the actual game works but shooting hoops is fun. i've never liked watching sports, except a few years ago when i was into betting on csgo matches if that counts
1	[https://www.medieval-combat.net/](https://www.medieval-combat.net/)  \n\n\nThis  \n\n\n&#x200B;
1	Big boxing fan, casual basketball/football/mma fan.
1	Soccer, swimming, crew (rowing), sailing 
1	Surfing, skimboarding, wakeboarding, fishing, Rock climbing and any Motorsport. 
1	I like to play soccer though I am not that fit for it so I just play goalie
1	I LOVE swim. 
1	Football (soccer if you prefer), Handball, Biking, Running
1	Skiing and Basketball\n\nI love the concentration required for skiing down a steep line, or working on my technique. All my thoughts are focused on the feeling and planning my next turn. All my problems disappear.\n\nI love the competitiveness of basketball, the feeling when the ball leaves your hands and goes straight in. Or when you intercept a pass. They're small wins/successes over a course of 40 minutes. 
7	Move on or pursue ISTP?	I recently went on a couple dates with an ISTP. Thought they went really well and we were planning on another. Unfortunately I got a text saying that he wants to take time off from dating (my understanding is that he recently got out of a long term relationship).\n\nIs this over or is it worth reaching out to him at some point?
28	Lol. We mean what we say, or at least I do. For me, it means "he wants to take time off from dating". Don't complexify it.\n\nEnjoy your life, and he'll come back when he's sure about it. 
6	Depends how patient you are.  If you are very interested,  I think you could send a text once every 1-2 weeks and use his responses to gauge where he is.  If he's still in a funk after 2-3 months, then you should probably move on.  The important thing is not to drop contact completely because he will likely assume you weren't that interested after all. 
4	It is over for now. Who knows about the future. You can reach out to him at some point if that's what you want to, but there are no guarantees that anything will come out of it.\n\n&#x200B;
5	Recently, I had an ISTP tell me that if she wasn't so useless, she would fall in love with me.\n\nSpent a minute rereading that and then went about my day.\n\nI don't always get you folks, but usually the best step is to ignore what you say until we cross paths.
3	What is your MBTI type? That will help to decide. Also, of he's just gotten out of a relationship then it's best he take some time before getting into another relationship. 
1	It's over for now. If they were into you, they'd prioritize you. You can reach out again some time later, but I would not expect too much.
-4	Redditor for 33 minutes?
23	Are you a magnet to mentally ill ENFPs? What's your story?	I've been with a few. But the most recent one has been the worst (and also the most awakening experience) for me. A lot of self-growth, really.\n\nLet's call this guy David. We went to the same university. We met there and only had a few interactions. 6 years later I moved to the city where he lived, not for him, but  to pursue MBA. He's the only person I knew at that time, and this was everything started.\n\nDavid is a very social person. He has the city in his hands in terms of networks. He liked to bring me to parties, drinking sessions and awesome adventures on weekends with his friends. As an introvert, this was a shift of reality for me. Exciting.\n\nAs we got closer, David started to share with me his most deepest secrets. He said I'm the only person who knows this. He's born out of rape. He doesn't know who his dad is, and he hates his mother for leaving him to neighbors (his foster parents). I never felt a high degree of empathy 'til I got to know him this closer and what's behind his goofy, whimsical and incredibly optimistic exterior.\n\nWhile he's able to keep up with all his friendships, he left me an impression how important I was to him. He calls me his best friend. Later, he'd go to my apartment at 10 pm, sometimes slept in my couch, and invite me for some beers. Months later, I started to pay for his drinks because he lost his job, and I paid for his stab (huge money) at a bar. He became depressive (completely dark and locking himself inside his room and not eating for two straight days). It worried me.\n\nI had a motorbike accident, and when I recovered, I decided it's best to return to my hometown because I lost a lot of money during this recovery. David thought it's a regressive decision. He said it's best to leave my apartment and share a house with him (which he rented with a friend). I did consider his suggestion. Months later, I found out he'd not been paying for his rent and that friend had been struggling to ask him because David is a very emotional guy who hates to be confronted.\n\nStupid me, I did pay for the room since I was also occupying it. His friend went to Germany for 6 weeks, and a week before she came back, all bills were piling on David's end. This was when I got myself in trouble because David told his friend I could save him since he had no job. I was unemployed at that time, and extremely unhealthy.\n\nI came clean to his friend and said I'd give my remaining savings and pay the rest when I returned. I decided to visit my family (I was super broke), self-loathing for returning with empty pockets, and stayed there for two months.\n\nThis was the time I didn't know I had been catatonic for many months. I realised I quit MBA, spent so much time with David, always drunk, and holy shit I was in love with him the whole time, an explanation why I did care that deep. Thrice David would come home drunk and try to sleep-harrass me. I kept this truth. I lost huge amount of money. We went to several holidays with advanced plans we're splitting budget, and I'd always pay the bills like an emergency issue.\n\nWhen I came back, David already had a new job. He was drinking wine in the couch when I arrived, and asked me to sit with him and talk. He said I was so selfish and egotistical for leaving, and that I was fucked in the mind. That's the moment I lost the last streak of empathy I could have for him.\n\nI got to know more friends and started hanging out separately with each of them, becoming more outdoorsy, got a high-paying job, and started getting attention from a lot of people.\n\nNow I am at my parents' home. I've decided to move here for good. It's incredibly epiphanic how I can view my life (in a matter of 3 years) happening in that city with David.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDisclaimer: This post is not an attack to ENFPs. While there was a post in the history of this sub how ISTPs attract mentally ill people (diagnosed or not), mine simply happened to be an ENFP. I also replied on a comment that Ne is a trickster function of ISTPs, and Ne being ENFPs' dominant function, I thought there's a connection. I thought this made my own rollercoaster more amplified to delayed knowing of abuse.\n\n&#x200B;
15	I think there's something about an istp wanting to help and fix things that attracts the emotionally unstable partner. The problem is that people aren't as easy as replacing break pads. For the emotionally unstable seeking a relationship is a quick fix to healing their issues, without having to really acknowledge they are/have a problem. Seeking psychiatric help would be acknowledgement of having a problem, so a relationship is easier for them until it isn't. That's when then they seek it from others by cheating or breaking up, running around and then coming back for more. The desire to be helpful in this case is only enabling this bad behavior. 
3	I relate to this title on so many levels. \n\nThere have been at least 5. Why are ISTPs attractive?
4	Dunno if they're an ENFP, but about 4 years ago, we started chatting almost everyday over messenger. when i came home about a year later we hooked up and then decided when i came back home a year later we were going to be together, or her side was we didn't decide this till i came home the second time. During this second time of being away from home she called me crying asking for forgiveness for fucking her EX and his brother ( at separate times). i came home and about a month later i sent a message that may or may not have been that great, another few weeks go by and then she accuses me of trying to have sex with a different girl, it was an old friend i was trying to purchase a phone from, i was stupid and i caved to that pressure and just said i was trying to have sex. i was living with my parents at this time. the next major event i remember was i got a job i got my own apartment, she would come up on some weekends. one weekend she came up and said she couldn't do it any more and she had fallen out of love with me, it was so sudden i was kind of a mess. i checked her phone and she and her ex had at some point been watching shameless either over the phone or in person. and then the breakups started happening every couple of months, then i though we had things figured out and i was looking for a house ( i hate living in an apartment) so we went house shopping i found a house and just before finding this house she had told the EX she missed him. On my own good judgement and my families advice she was not put on any of the house paperwork. after we moved in things started steadily going down hill. the breakups started being every couple of weeks, i was constantly accused of cheating (going to the store, going in my room, going to the library, playing games, falling asleep on the couch, receiving phone calls, asking for time to play my games, porn(because this ment i was sexting with someone)). she wanted to see the ocean, so last year i decided to take a weekend trip to see the ocean, it all went well till she seen some porn on my phone, and of course this means i am sexting someone. she says the porn is evidence i ave been cheating on her the entire time.\n\nsome other notable events:\n\nshe was in a manic episode and made up this elaborate story about meeting a dude she knew at the store and how she and her sisters were gonna hang out with him. it was worded in a way that she was trying to make me jealous. i told her i wasn't worried and this set her off, which led to the events of the next few weeks. as she was leaving for her sisters house i told her not to shove the dick to far down her throat, so for the next day she insisted she sucked his dick and let him play with her tits and then she backed it down to her just looking at it. and she finally shut up about it when i told her i asked the dude about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile i was laying in her bed with her she told some dude she might fuck him, she insists this was not a big deal because i was there and knew she was joking( she was trying to upset me).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nshe received two messages from Her EX i didn't catch the messages, and she screamed at me asking if i saw the messages.\n\nat one point she told me i could go through her phone but she deleted all of the messages between them.\n\n\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\ni love sex and she uses it to manipulate me. i have gone emotionally numb in this entire relationship\n\nshe currently lives in my house pays for some groceries and her car. i love her son he is not mine.\n\nnothing i can do will ever be enough for her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nafter the dick sucking story i told her we were done, she has tried to use sex to get me back several times. it was one of the best times we ever had.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis whole situation is addicting its worse than cocaine and i've never even done cocaine i can't' escape it. she hates my mother and my mother is one of the kindest and sweetest people on this planet\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am sorry for rambling folks,\n\ni show up as ISTP on the MB got INTP once took another one for INTP VS ISTP and it showed me 43% INTP and the other side ISTP\n\nShort Version\n\ni ignored several red flags, made a few mistakes and now i have someone who is batshit crazy living in my house scott free, and i don't have the heart to kick them out, i've told her we were done, but she keeps pulling me back in  \n\n\nEDIT: she has been diagnosed with Bi-polar, borderline personality disorder, anxiety and depression
2	Cool story. Can't say I have anything like it to share though.
2	Sorry, I don't think I understand the point of this post... ?
2	Oh and btw i don’t think it’s fair to say ISTPs attract mentally ill people... seems a big generalisation based on personal experience
2	I browse this board now and then since ironically, I dated a mentally ill ISTP (still friends though). ENFP is your duality partner (ENFJ is actually conflicting, the P/J flip is bullshit btw). That's why you keep attracting them. My ISTP was attracted to me since I appear like an ENFP due to my ENTP subtype (AKA I know how to say nice shit to people).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo yeah, there is a connection, they're attracted to your functions and vice versa.
1	How do you know he’s ENFP? Either way, he just sounds like a messed up, manipulative dude. Sorry to hear.
2	I admittedly tl;dr'd parts of this but I know of several ISTP/ENFP relationships that were all dumpster fires. I like both personality types and really think they should stay away from each so they can be happy. Separately. \n\nDisclaimer: If you're reading this and this doesn't apply to you, I'm glad for you, you are a rarity.
1	Aw this post makes me both sad and a little down on myself. I'm an ENFP and have had a history of mental illness, but I would never take advantage of anyone so please don't think we're all like that. I love feeling safe and taken care of though, because of my history of being hurt a lot and I think ISTPs are really good at that. Before I met an ISTP, I always thought they were cold and quiet (because they are rational) but reading this subreddit and meeting a really healthy and wonderful ISTP made me realize how much you guys care about others and how cuddly you can be (must be the Fe, which makes you guys very different from ISFPs, for example).\n\nBut maybe also take a closer look at yourself and why you're attracted to those types of people. Not meant as a criticism at all and I hope you don't take it that way, but I know that I was attracted to a certain type of person too when I was more depressed. It might have way more to do with the individual than Myers Briggs.
1	I seem to attract a lot of "Mentally ill" people, I remember that one ex who was BPD. To be honest, I was kinda an asshole to here when It got too much for me, as I just totally disappeared from her life (Blocked her and moved on to another city).\nI couldn't handle all the drama, ups and downs etc. \n\nOtherwise, most people I've attracted were depressed. Maybe that's because my very nature is to fix things, and somehow they sense that.
1	Loving the 2 out of 3 ENFP's in the comments who flocked to this thread to tell us how all our experiences or perceptions are wrong because they *don't agree*. Please fuck off. You don't get to decide whos experiences are or are not real just because you don't like it. Grow up, contribute something, or GTFO.\n\nThat being said: I've had similar experiences. I don't know what the fuck it is about ENFPs that make just such a perfect unsuspecting simpleton vs overdramatic overassuming teenager relationships, but thats been the jist of every single one so far. \n\nNone of them have ever gotten so far as romantic because I'm good at communication and ENFP's (that I've experienced) can not handle criticism or honesty well at all (giving or receiving). Ultimately, I want to spend time with people who will treat me well and as I would treat them, and actually perform duties of a friend. So far most ENFP's I've experienced tend to treat me as a fun toy which they assume they know more about than they actually do. Then backpedal and accuse me of being a demon when I point out that "hey that was kinda rude" or "no you dont know me or x thing all that well please stop." and cause needless drama. It's stupid, it's tiring, I don't have time for it. \n\nWould love to meet an ENFP that has a handle on their bullshit or likes improving themselves. 
37	It's mostly 20% Learning Zone and 80% switching between Comfort Zone and Fear Zone.	
11	Thinking about it, I am past my comfort zone. I spend most of my time in the fear zone and have some learning zone days and I hope I can make everyday a learning zone one day, I think that I am close to being there.
5	Yesterday I started a job at an Indian restaurant. I'm a white dude who doesn't speak any Indian. I have thrown myself into the unknown and it's both exciting and scary. I have no idea what's going on lol. I have problems integrating myself in my own family's culture let alone Indian culture...
3	Turning 34 in the green!
3	The learning and growth zones should be the same dimension , but the creator of that illustration really wanted 4 colors/zones.
2	I recently got a promotion at work that i am like half qualified for, but its an easy-ish position to learn on the go. Just takes making a lot of judgement calls and managing time. Its basically been trial by fire my entire time so far, but im finally starting to get the hang of it. 
1	Thanks for the picture it's amazing.\n\nFellows IPs and Ti doms, growth is the way forward of life. The perpetual unending process that gives meaning, joy and greatness overall. Thanks for the reminder. 
1	Great picture but I don't agree with the title at all.
11	Do any of you ISTPs find hard to look people in the eyes, or interact with them if they’ve lied to you about something,they gossip, or their just a untrustworthy person?	
24	I don't find it hard to look people in the eyes. I despise interacting with them if they gossip, lie and are two faced. Come to think of it- i hold an uncomfortably( for them)strong eye contact then. 
11	It's easier to talk and think when you're not looking at the person, this is a scientific fact. I'm not an articulate person so this helps me, but people interpret this as like disrespect or me having aspergers. I do make an effort to make eye-contact more though.
8	Personally, I don’t like eye contact. My INTP friends use the N part of them to see into my soul XD. \n\nBut yeah, I don’t actually interpret eye contact or facial expressions - it confuses the perceiver part of me actually. I can get more information if their face is blank. \n\nIf they’re a lying, gossipy, and untrustworthy person, I can tell from a distance, and usually avoid being near them at all. 
9	i don't like eye contact i feel like people are staring into my soul
5	Depends how I feel, if they're shamelessly lying to me/something similar AND I trusted them before, I can't look at them because I'm disgusted.\n\nBut if I'm angry or I didn't like them in the start, I stare them right down. They should feel the shame, and apparently my glare is quite the something.
3	I was taught very early to look people in the eye, so no issue there. I find in life that there are very few people I must interact with.
3	Eye contact makes me feel awkward in that I never seem to know if it's too much or not enough, but also am I blinking too much? So I end up feeling off balance and thinking more about the eye contact than the interaction. \n\nNow I mostly just let myself focus on the interaction and not get caught up with as much direct eye contact unless someone is trying to stare me down. Then I don't care if I'm socially awkward, I'm not easily intimidated and I'm usually not about to let someone think they have that power over me. Well, unless it works in my favor.
3	I have no issue w/ looking at someone in the eyes, and if I'm intrigued with what they're saying I do look them in the eyes.  But one of my few central principles is all of my friends are completely trustworthy and loyal.  Show me loyalty and I'll have unbridled loyalty and respect for you.  If you take advantage of my loyalty, I'll see you as subhuman.
3	No
3	I have the opposite problem. Apparently people find it intimidating 
2	No. The opposite is true for me. If I don’t think a person is honest I’m likely to be extra assertive.
22	I can do anything, perfectly, once.	more than that im bored. bye
9	Lol that happens to me now and then and everyone asks “how’d you do that?”\n\n“Uh......magic”
8	I've unfortunately realized this applies to my work. I keep getting new assignments but I keep becoming bored with them in a couple months. The only thing that keeps my attention is learning something new. Unfortunately, people don't pay you to learn forever. You eventually have to do something.\n\nSo now I'm job hunting trying to solve the existential crisis of finding out what I can handle wanting to do more than once. 
4	My boyfriend is an ISTP and he’s that way too. Just naturally good at things for the first time.
4	I have this thing when im learning a piece of music where once i memorize it (which is pretty quick) and can play the whole piece perfectly, i  start to fuck it up for some reason. 
3	k
2	This applies to me when playing VNs.
2	Depends on the thing. I have somethings where I have just dropped it once I've mastered it. Other things are more permanent. Like there are boardgames I can play forever. 
2	Ok, but can you beat me in Fighterz?
1	I have something similar with music and that's why I never look up lyrics of songs I like. Once I know the lyrics I become bored with the particular song and have to move to another one. 
1	Agreed. The first time it's thoughtless, off the cuff, pure instinct. Bam, nailed it. \n\n"Do it again!"\n\nWell shit, now it's expected. Fail.
1	Same. Same. At work I’m lucky enough to have a job where I work on new things all the time but once I finish a project and have to go back to it it’s like a mental temper tantrum happens. 
16	At work	Do you ever just put your headphones/earphones on just to avoid unnecessary conversations at work?
14	90 % of the time
6	My coworkers know my rule. Send me a message on Slack, don't interrupt me. This way, I can divert my attention away from my individual task at a proper stopping point. It's more efficient, and has also saved me from the unnecessary conversations that OP is trying to avoid.\n\nOnce they have my attention, I become a pleasant person to be around that genuinely cares about what they want. It makes everything acceptable. 
6	I wish, but my whole job is talking to people and I fear I may soon lose my sanity.
2	My boss told me to lessen my “headphone time” so I can be more approachable. I get her point and don’t blame her but sometimes I just need to get in the zone to work properly. 
2	I really want to but I am a lead in a NOC so my job is to know what's going on around me at all times. \n\nOnce my management promotion goes through I'll get more headphone time 
2	I work all night on my own doing security so nobody else to talk to lol  
2	Sometimes I just put the headphones without music to just avoid conversations.
2	Yea but it usually doesn't work tbh. 
1	Buddy, that's 90% of my work day!
1	Basically always. 
1	No headphones because that’s unprofessional but I do avoid unnecessary communication 
1	Always
1	Nothing better at work than the days where I can just shut my door and work in peace
