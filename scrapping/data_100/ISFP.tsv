10	rant	i know i definitely don’t make a big effort to maintain friendships if they’re not that big for me but at the same time i don’t get why people complain that i never contact them because they never contact me either so can people stop making it like it’s not a 2 people issue
6	It’s just an obligatory social formality. Something that (fake) people say to ease what they perceive as tension in the moment because they cannot comprehend that some people really, truly have no problem with solitude.\n\nSo to keep from feeling awkward about not reaching out more, they say dumb shit like, “omg it’s been FOREVER! We should TOTALLY hang out more, why don’t you ever call me?!” and then we nod and smile, knowing we won’t. It’s all a dumb charade.\n
4	I hate when people do this too. It's like they want to hear from you but not enought to put forth their own effort. It's so disingenuous and hypocritical. Hate it! 
2	Right????? 
2	True to that! People who do this are playing a dirty game, trying to put us in a guilty position.\n\nI would tell them that next time you miss me, don't wait up for me calling you, you can call me too you know! So why didn't you?
13	Frustrated when people aren't candid with you	When they're playing a part and got their walls up and it's so obvious (but they think it's not) do you ever get frustrated and just rage quit? Happened with a guy I've been talking to, I just felt like he wouldn't be real with me so I said my bye byes. Suddenly he gets real asking what happened. I straight up told him I was bored. In truth I was frustrated and tired and understimulated and just not having it. Well he asked me out pretty soon after that, no more games or playing coy.\n\nI think people really don't value each other. Just feeding each other fake bullshit to protect themselves. If there's one thing I can appreciate about ISFPs it's that we seek what's real and if it's real, we don't judge it, we respect the balls on someone who can be candid and we respect human nature. In fact without the real we *wither*. You can feel it in the exhaustion and frustration that seems to come from nowhere as you interact with someone. I mean when something is manufactured it isn't emotionally stimulating and we can feel it it's so transparent. How dissociated do you have to be to get used to that. We shouldn't have to get used to that lifeless bullshit nor should we waste our energy on what doesn't give us life. \n\nSorry but I'm just not coping with that for anyone anymore. Life is too short to waste energy on what doesn't nourish you. If someone wants to be in your life, make sure they've earned a spot by actually being brave enough to show up with you the way you show up with them. Otherwise are they really worth your time?
7	Hoy FUCK this is exactly what has been going on with me.\n\nI started seeing my old.,,. not boyfriend, not FWB, but something in between again. But he is SO. BORING.\n\nSo boring. I will pour my heart out and he will reply with “you’re silly.” or he’ll pick and choose what to reply to in a conversation. \n\nEvery day it was a “How are you?” or a “What are you up to?” and I started getting really frustrated because I want REAL conversations and he only wants small talk. I want him to talk to me about real shit and not ask me “What’s up? Oh cool. Silly. I miss you.”\n\nI can’t explain it well. Basically I ended up straight up telling him I didn’t have feelings for him multiple times but it seems he never comprehends shit I say, so.\n\nI ended up telling him a few days ago that we have nothing in common and he replied, with something to say finally, that “We have more in common than you do with most people” (this was after he said “smfh” and that I was “saying mean things out of the blue”) and I got really pissed off at this. He meant it as in he knows me the most because he’s known me for “so long”. \n\nHe doesn’t talk to be about anything of value, he doesn’t know shit about me as a grown woman, the last time I saw him I was 19 and apparently he thinks I’m still a teenage girl bowing down to his existence for giving me slight attention, and he has the audacity to act like he knows me more than my friends and shit, I BARELY remember any of our past conversations. I barely remember him at all.\n\nHe said “we have more in common than you do with most people”, as in ME, but then he NEVER mentioned himself. He didn’t say “than I do with most people”, as in, he finds that I have a lot in common with him, he said ME. So he’s my knight in shining armer who thinks I’m this sad lonely woman who has nobody to relate to, but like, he has a million others he finds things in common with? Like, should I say thank you??? \n\nI try multiple times to tell his thick skull I’m not interested and I don’t like him and that we should stop talking. He likes to make me feel guilty and he tries to hurt my feelings when I try cutting him off though. I’m too ugly to deal with this, that’s supposed to be the one benefit I as an ugly woman gets, damn it.\n\nHowever, I noticed he’s following a 14 y/o on instagram and liking her posts and I don’t wanna assume anything but I’m gonna go ahead say fuck no on this one.\n\nUh. Sorry.\n\nFeel free to downvote me fam. It turned into a rant....\nI just.... I just.... I had to let this out somewhere.\n\n.... \nAnyway.\n\nTldr: \n\nI feel you, same.\n
3	Yes. Preach. 
3	infp here-  pretty focused on authenticity too but also walled and defensive. I'll never be fake but I need to feel safe and I guess..wanted? when I'm opening up.\n\nI have a close isfp friend I think is getting bored with my candidness though. I can't really tell, he rarely answers anything I say with something clear and meaningful. He says he appreciates honesty and realness but in the moment when I'm putting myself out there he doesn't seem to appreciate the vulnerability or that i'm waiting nervously to see how he responds. Answering with nothing and telling his own story or changing the subject makes me wonder if there's any point in opening up to him. It's just...really tiring feeling like I'm talking to open air.
2	Couldn't agree more. It's definitely noticeable. \n\nSometimes it doesn't even fully matter what they say; often the bravery and honesty of just being real/open is **soo** damn beautiful.\n\nI wish more people understood that. I am literally the least judgemental person you will ever come across. I think we all are.
10	ISFP of all ages, what do you look for in a partner?	Is it:\n- Someone who you could admire?\n- Someone who is creative?\n- Someone physically attractive?\n- Someone who is intellectual / knowledgeable?\n- Someone who is emotionally aware?\n- Someone who is structured and ordered?\n- Someone who is good with people?\n- Someone who is solution oriented?\n\nOr maybe someone who has some other qualities or interesting quirks?\n\nWhat do you look for? Or what are some of the qualities your partner has that you adore?\n\nHope you can state your sex as well, because different sexes could potentially prioritize different qualities
2	Out of the things you listed, I prefer a man who I can admire, is emotionally aware, structured and ordered and good with people. I'm a 20 y/o woman.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think the best trait is emotional inteligence. If I go too detailed, I will never find my man so... Well heck I love big and tall men too.
1	I am an 18 y/o woman and i look for partners who are emotionally mature, good communicators, and supportive/nonjudgmental. I also prefer fiscally responsible men who understand the value of money and men who are decisive without being domineering. 
1	27M, ISFP  \n\n\n1) Definitely someone I can admire  \n2) I love creative people  \n3) I don't give much thought to physical attractiveness. Again, this is a debatable  and everyone has different views.  \n4) Definitively someone who is knowledgeable. If I find interest in that particular subject, it's a Win-Win  \n5) ISFP's are emotionally aware people. It would be horrible if our partners were unemotional. Generally speaking, if I am communicating with someone who doesn't show emotions, I stop communicating. Not worth my time.   \n6) I'm extremely laid back and messy. But I wouldn't mind someone with a certain degree of structure and order  \n7) Definitely. Someone who is a douchebag to others would eventually be a douchebag towards you at some point.  \n8) Being able to find solutions is a great ability. Sometimes I get pissed at people suggesting solutions because I just wanted to vent (to make myself feel better).\n\n:)
1	27 Male\n\nHonestly I just want someone clingy. Clingy people know just how to make you feel appreciated. I'll take a fucking psycho at this point in my life. Sounds exciting.
1	Someone reasonably attractive, emotionally attuned, open to new things and able to engage in a wide variety of deeper conversation topics. I don't care too much about the rest. 28F
1	Honestly most of the men I've been most attracted to have been INTx. I feel like they balance me out. It would be nice to be with someone who was more in touch with their emotions but those guys also tend to bore me unfortunately.
1	24M - someone in good shape who cares about their appearance and fashion. women who work out(resistance training) and have a good shape are most attractive. creativity is great as well, I love when someone likes to draw/paint/make music and is passionate about it, and can appreciate art + aesthetics of things. I am really into pale, blonde women, but like other skin/hair colors as well- this is just my favorite skin/hair combination.\n\noverall a relaxed personality is great, but I like them to be into me enough that I don't have to go out of my way too much to initiate things. \n\nalso someone I can talk to about everything with, like a very good friend. very important too that she's kind and playful\n
1	(19/m)\n\nDon't really want a relationship, but if I had to think of the perfect girlfriend:\n\n* Physically attractive.\n\n* Tough exterior, soft interior. Type of person that doesn't take other people's bullshit and calls them out on their crap, but isn't a troubleseeker. Tries to maintain peace and be pleasant unless provoked. Only shows their soft, caring side to people close to them, and really cares for those. Still has a bit of a playful, spunky side to them in general. \n\n* Has similar interests. \n\n* Open minded and flexible, helps me out of my tunnelvision and challenges me in some ways, but sometimes just more down to earth as well.\n\n* Deeply cares for the things and people she loves.\n\n* Honest and authentic. Clever and aware of things.\n\n(I wonder which type she'd be)
3	What do you like and dislike about your personality?	
3	I like: Im never angry or arquing about something stupid.\nI dislike: child like and quite shy
3	I am way too shy and closed off when I first meet or encounter someone \n\non the other hand I think I enjoy talking to people and getting to know them genuinely 
1	Pros: Extremely chill, almost never angry, got hella good humor\n\nCons: Will almost never strike up a convo first. Unless I actually need it. Hate breaking the ice, and apprehensive around people.
3	Married/engaged/widowed/etc ISFPs: how did you meet your significant others?	Also, did you kind of *know* or whatever when you met them?? Idk, that’s always seemed like a very Ni-ish thing to me, just curious if any of you have ACTUALLY experienced that:).
1	/crickets
18	What emotion(s) do you feel the most?	This was an interesting question friend my asked me yesterday. It took me a while to think about it. I wanted to say happy, however I don't feel happiness all the time. It's not like I'm sad all the time either tho. So I just said I feel 'at peace'. I don't know wether that is an emotion or not but that was my answer haha. 
25	Anger.
11	We feel all emotions. Sometimes within minutes apart between emotions. ISFP's are sensitive towards that. 
9	According to my observations, Fi doms give off a vibe of seething inner rage. Ni doms seem merely sad/grieving. Happiness seems to belong to extroverted P types. Explosive anger to Te types. I get no vibes from Ti doms :P
7	Im blessed and almost never feel depressed/sad. I wont even quantify that feeling with something as high as 1% of the time because that would still be an overestimate. I am a bundle of joy like 90% of the time, and filled with white hot rage the other 10%. It can change from one to the other as easily as a light switch is flipped. My mood swings are like Hades in Disney's Hercules.
4	does emo count as an emotion?...
5	Emptiness.
3	It takes considerable effort for me to not be a doomer. Despair I guess
2	Lol hope this isn’t TMI but... I’ve cried while having sex 3 different times. Once out of pure love. Another time was from being upset with my partner and feeling emotionally disconnected like I couldnt stop thinking about the issues in our relationship. 
2	The most? Discontentment. I'm an extreme perfectionist and no matter what something can be made better. The aesthetics of my environment, of myself, my knowledge, my emotional intelligence, my sense of humor, cooking skills, there's always something to improve and it's like I never have any rest, never have that feeling that something is done and I can stop. I'm like 90% pretty sure it's what lead to my eating disorder.
2	Lost 
3	Either love/joy, or disgust/anger. I don't get sad or fearful often. \n\nI know there is a lot more variety and nuances to emotions tho...\n\nEdit: INTP here.
1	Anxiety
1	I mostly feel anger, joy, anxiety, and contentment if I had to narrow down the feelings. \n\nHowever, I find that I’m most susceptible to the feelings of those around me, and the empath in me will begin to pick up on those feelings and react accordingly. 
1	Exasperation and dismay
1	Frustration \n\nToo many things that I want to do and I'm just not in the position to do. 
1	sadness and boredom
12	I wish my Brain would make up its Mind...	Hi all, I’ve had a really weird thing the last few days which I get quite often and does my head in. So I’m currently on my week off from work and I’ve been having some time alone at home, my brain will go into the, ‘I want to talk to someone’ faze, my cousin will get home after some time and my brain will just be like ‘omg I want to be alone, jeez’ and I’ll be sitting there in afterwards like, can you make up your mind please!! Does this happen to other ISFP’s often? 
6	Yeap. That's about as ISFP as it gets. Completely normal. 
2	Yeah, it’s normal. I think it also depends just how much social activity you personally can take. I think I can take quite a bit, and I definitely crave it sometimes. However it also doesn’t take me long to want to hide away and regroup. Just the introversion in us, you’re all good!
2	I think we prefer the company of people rather than purely talking to them. I hate being home alone when my housemates are away but lol I don't actually wanna talk to them. 
1	How do you deal with your friends Alienating you?	
8	Go into a deep depression for a couple of hours, take a nap, wake up, get over it. 🤷‍♀️
5	Welp as the friend alienator myself my advice to you would be dont take it personally.\n\nBut then again i allienate everyone equally. If  youre being singled out then that does suck and im sorry. In that case id probably say, allienate them back? Idk what id do.
1	Allow myself to feel angry and sad, until I go to bed. The next morning, it's almost as if they never existed, no matter how attached I felt I was to them. I think the "INFJ Doorslam" is actually "ISFP Doorslam".
19	venting	i want a girlfriend that loves me or hates me.\n\ni want to sleep 17 hours in a row.\n\ni want two buckets of chocolate ice cream.\n\nI want someone to believe in me.\n\n I want to be kissed and relieved when I go to sleep, no matter that I already am an adult.\n\ni want people to invite me out.\n\n I want people to value my songs and that everyone knows who I am.\n\ni want a lot of friends.\n\n I want to be more handsome.\n\ni want to be understood.\n\ni want to be so fucking persistently texted and wanted by a girlfriend and knowing that Im important for her.\n\n I want to have a fight with someone and my face broken.\n\n I want to get off on a rope instead of the ladders in my college.\n\nI want a giraffe costume.\n\ni want to cry while i eat shit and play videogames.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nunmade bed confident keyboard comprehensive bedroom
9	You sound bipolar
8	I wish I was a little bit taller  \nI wish I was a baller  \nI wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her  \nI wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat  \nAnd a six four Impala
5	Sounds gloomy, miserable, yearning and upsetting. 
5	People will love you when you love yourself. Work on yourself and all these things will come 
3	I hope all of your wishes come true. Especially the giraffe costume ;)
2	Sounds cute x) I hope you get all of it except the broken face part xd
1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsbv27QaQ-U
1	Why a girlfriend who hates you?
1	You can have your wishes. You have to build faith in yourself.
49	Sounds familiar...	
11	My farthest future planning is just an overall ambition
5	For me I have “plans” but not necessarily a time frame to do them, which is weird. 
1	You guys don't have a chatroom?
7	Does the weather affect your mood?	I'm super moody on days like this. Just want the sun to come out. Everything just looks grey and unmotivating. How do you cope with shitty weather? 
3	I can reassure you now that seasonal depression is definitely a thing. Once winter hits where I am, my mood and mental state can get much worse. You just need to keep in mind that it's only temporary, and it's going to get better come spring/summer. Everyone gets it.
3	I prefer sunny, warm, bright days. Days like that makes me want to be productive and just feels good. Rainy days makes me feel nostalgic and laid back. I don't let it bother me too much because I can't change the weather. I just endure it and hope for better days to come. 
2	Sleep as much as possible tbh. A bitch got insomnia and shitty rainy days where you don't feel like driving and going out can be a blessing. I I take advantage of my depression, fam. 
2	Yea i get bummed out all winter pretty much. It snowed the other day and i almost cried when i saw it haha
2	Very. I feel totally dead inside and moody with typical autumn/winter weather/settings around. Grey skies, dead trees, coldness, etc. Blue skies with clouds, sun, warm weather and trees full of leaves make me happy.\n\nI don't really mind rain, though. (Unless I'm outside while it rains)
5	What goes through your head when creating art/anything? Could you explain it if asked?	I’ll try to keep the explanation short, I’ll have a TL;DR at the bottom anyway.\n\nSo, a couple weeks back I was in English class, when we had a mock exam. There was two options for this writing paper; description of a given picture, or a “story where something unexpected happens” . I thought a bit, until I had this idea and wrote about two people on a them park ride gone awry. \n\nAnyway, I finished the paper but wasn’t massively happy with it. I thought it was decent, but nothing special. Fast forward to a couple weeks later, and my teacher absolutely loves it. Top marks. I’m not sure why, and honestly the compliments fell on deaf ears. Still, it was nice to hear. She read it out to the class as i sat there surprisingly uncomfortable. It was a nice gesture but god, I felt I was shrivelling up in my seat.\n\nShe finishes the story, I receive compliments and whatever. Mainly glad it’s over. But then she asks a question. She comes out with “so, what was going through your head when you wrote this?” And I just froze. Not out of anxiety, but genuine confusion. What was going through my head? I sat for a few moments, saying nothing. She rephrases. “Honestly it’s fine, I just want to know your thought process?” And the best I could come out with was “uh.. i just had an idea? I didn’t plan it”. \n\nI just thought it was an interesting thing. Has anyone else experienced a similar situation? Just completely unable to provide an explanation for something, particularly something you made?\n\nTL;DR: Wrote a short story. When asked by a teacher to explain how I created it, couldn’t find a genuine answer.
4	I don't have an explanation either. With drawings something pops up in my head and as I draw it I "fix the imagination holes".
5	Yeah I can’t really explain it, it’s kinda best when nothing is going thru my head. I get into “the zone” and it’s all instinct. I’m an audio engineer so most of what I do is very abstract anyway and it’s more about a feeling than any analytical thought process\n\nI know what you mean about compliments, my work is never good enough for me but often people are amazed by it
2	 I mean, it's very cool that you received such a response. and i want to read your thing now, too.  \n  \n*do you read a lot? were you aware of using writing techniques learned in your lessons?* i guess that's the sort of thing they might've been after.  \n  \nAnyway - nice one! hope you feel encouraged if it's something you enjoy doing.
2	I always just have a very vivid idea and once I do it I can alter it and flesh it out however I want. Usually I just try to think of a style or feel I want and something fitting that description eventually comes to me
2	It's always striking to me to learn that a well loved piece of music/art/writing was looked upon as subpar by its creator (Maurice Ravel's *Bolero*, for instance).  It's at once encouraging, that beauty is indeed in the eye, or ear, of the beholder, and discouraging, that someone perceives such depth in something created under less than inspired circumstances.  Art is so weird.\n\nWhatever goes through my head as I'm creating is unique to the piece, and I'm usually happy to give a somewhat superficial explanation of the process.  Sometimes the process is nobody's business.  Like I'm kind of surprised at your teacher's presumption that you'd be willing to share it in front of everyone.
2	Just comes from our subconscious I'd say. 
3	Survey on Personality and Flirting Behaviors	Hey I am a doctoral Student at a University in the South. I am studying flirtation behaviors, specifically trying to catalog specific flirting behaviors taken from several experimental studies. Thank you in advance for taking the time to take the survey there is an opportunity to win a gift card if the entire survey is completed. You can back out at any time.\n\nHere is the link to the survey\n\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JMQP5PJ
2	Error with questions 218 and 219 onwards. They both say “I remove clothing” as an example of flirting (now call me insane but I think that is). Unless my monitor is acting up, that’s quite a lot of questions with the same error. 
4	Damn, survey is long. I think adding a "nonbinary" gender option would help some folks :)\nAlso, survey asks about sexuality but defaults to questions about the opposite sex?\nHope the study goes well!
3	Dating an INTJ	What's your experience being like dating an INTJ? 
3	 I have never dated an INTJ in my life. I only had a very close friend with that MBTI type. \n\nPersonality wise what makes you attracted to him/her? 
1	INTx types are my type, apparently, as pretty much every dude I've been very attracted to has been one. My current boyfriend is an INTP. I have dated INTJ's in the past but I don't think I could ever be in a serious relationship with one. I am a hardcore P type and J types in general are just way too structured for me (and conversely my lack of organization and planning would probably be really annoying to them). I like the NT combo though, I feel like they help round me out and get me to think about things more holistically.
11	Can Someone Explain the ISFP Cognitive Functions to Me?	I'm not well learned on the subject and I would love to know all the types of functions and how they affect me.
8	It’s not specific to ISFP, but check out the Personality Hacker podcast, episode 225.\nIn general, it’s a cool podcast for anyone interested in personality types and how they affect our daily interactions. Episode 225 delves into how to determine the cognitive function stack for each personality type.
6	This site did a good job explaining the first four https://www.typeinmind.com/fise
6	DaveSuperPowers has probably the most accurate explanation. His explanations are super simple and not wishy washy or contradictory like all the crap you find on the internet. Start there. 
3	Your functions are Fi Se Ni Te, in that order. Fi and  Se are your conscious functions, which means they are under your control, and Ni and Te are your subconscious functions, which means they are less under your control. Fi is introverted feeling, Se is extroverted sensing, Ni is introverted intuition, and Te is extroverted thinking. Fi is to do with your personal moral values, what is right and wrong to you, such as being authentic, being honest, and being true to yourself. I find that these are common ISFP values, though they might not be true for all ISFPs. Each ISFP decides what his personal values are. Se is how you express those values. Namely, Se is your ‘doing’ function, so you prefer to express your values through your deeds rather than your words. This is what I like most about ISFPs, you are doers, not talkers.\n\nOf course there’s a lot more to Se than that, but that’s a good overview, and you can look up how subconscious Ni and Te effects your psyche at the other aforementioned websites. I hope this helped you start off. Happy self-discovery.
62	ISFP in the wild	
3	1000000% me
3	EVERY TIME . like why do I even agree to these things??
2	Me all the way!! 
2	Meeee
2	Yeah, pretty much
2	I feel like I’m usually the opposite. I never want to go out, but usually end up having fun 🤪.
2	Omg this is soooo meee. Yet that’s not me in the pic loooool. But yeah I went out that one time and I was like “oh noooo I shouldn’t have gone outtt lol  “ and then I stayed out a bit longer and then eventually went home and it was just as lame 😂 soooo relatable like omg are you me??? hahaha duuuude this is too funny 🤣
7	Out of 16 types, 8 are light and 8 are dark. ISFPs are one of the 8 light types:	
7	Fuck you I'm *edgy*
6	heey... I'm writing a story, I guess.	They were lying down in a single bed watching some series and movies, when she said: -hey!  What if we could get into a movie?\n\n—could be an indie movie please? I don’t like the fan service.\n\n—yes! In a indie mumblegore drama movie, what would be your name?\n\n—wait, why it has to be drama?\n\n—shut up, what would be your name?\n\n—I’d like to be called... Kyo.\n\n—You have given that name to the characters in our videogames.\n\n—yes, and if I had a dog I’d put him that name while I wait for having a kid—. She got playful and looked him in the eyes:\n\n—so you’d want to have a baby? —she asked\n\n—I mean... —she got closer, ready to embrace him, and he felt in a siege of intimacy in where her look was a powerful transparent trojan horse.\n\n—what does your name means?\n\n—I don’t know. It surely has a general meaning, but you’re the one who puts a meaning to your name, right?\n\nShe looked at him perplexed and excited: —yeah! having an assigned meaning is silly. I’ll be Yui EmbraceYourFavoriteSocks.\n\nHe laughed and asked: —what?\n\nshe took advantage of the fact that he lowered the guard, and suddenly tried to kiss him quickly, but she hurt her lip with his teeth. She lamented: — How stupid, I ruined our first kiss :’(\n\nHe kissed her and said: —personaly, I feel this kiss is just as good as what the other would have been.\n\nThe phone alarm rang. Kyo had to leave his room and go to work. Why does everything end at the most inappropriate moment?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\---\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm planning to write a page every week because if I don't do it I'll become a sloth. Also, I'd like this to have illustrations. any illustrator here wants to work with me in this project? it could be your style, and also, simple drawings, not much effort.
1	Go for it!
4	What are you excited about/working towards right now?	I'm just drunk right now and wanna know what other ISFP's have going through their heads. Heard any new music? Got your dream job? Wassup? Whatchu passionate about?
5	Ah I'm knitting a sweater for myself right now. I'm also digging music and fashion/dresses. I might start doing clothes in the near future (whether by knitting or sewing or something else)
5	I’m working towards buying my own land and building a house. 
4	For me, I get promoted tomorrow to a training manager, which I’m very excited for! I am also excited for going on the Postal train and geeking out with my friends about that one! 😅 
3	I have a full time engineering job, taking a part time masters (Management Psychology) and 10,000 words into the book that I'm writing
3	running for president of a club, just applied to work at my school’s women’s community center next semester as well as a mentoring programming! \n\nin terms of hobbies, I’m excited for the weather to get warmer so I can start practicing roller skating again and jumping rope outdoors! 
3	Preparing for a 2-month trip around Europe starting in a few weeks. Having a fairly hard time settling on a route/things to do, though, and my brother hasn't really been particularly prompt about getting a new passport, so some stress is starting to build up. But it should be pretty lit once it starts more properly coming together and we actually leave.
3	I'm really enjoying Undertale.
1	My puppy is losing his baby teeth and I'm excited for his adult teeth to grow out
26	DAE feel embarrassed after temporarily losing control and “exposing” emotions?	I’m not just talking about the obvious situations, like allowing yourself to have a negative reaction to someone confronting you or hurting you.\n\nI’ve noticed that when I drink (which is almost never, for reasons I’m about to mention) I have a moderation problem and tend to cut loose in a way that’s overall regarded positively...in fact, many have said they love me when I’m drunk.\n\nBut I wake up the next day completely ashamed and humiliated and not ever wanting to be around whoever witnessed it, again.\n\nI went to a wedding last night and had too much to drink. I danced for hours, laughed, made friends, talked to everyone and in general acted like a person my husband and all his dumb friends wish I was irl. They all liked me more than they usually do.\n\nSo why am I so fucking ashamed of myself now? Is it the loss of control? Is it allowing a group of people that I generally dislike, to actually know me and parts of my personality I intentionally keep hidden from them?\n\nWhy am I like this? I hate myself.
10	Yeah. I wasn't expecting or ready to be so vulnerable in front of certain people. Sober me would've been perfectly pleasant, sure, but definitely highly self-regulating in those new social situations. Showing the best or weirdest parts of myself to strangers often leads to regret because I usually feel like they haven't earned it and I feel less special.
5	Yeah, I get this too. One time I was drunk and like, comforted a friend who was getting sad in the function; still felt bad afterwards for this reason. Maybe we need to express more truer emotions in daily life, so that it’s not a sudden shock when we do it when uninhibited? That’s what I concluded.
3	Yeah I also don't drink or do drugs with others, I can't stand the idea of being that vulnerable. Feels like I'm blowing my cover. 
3	"and in general acted like a person my husband and all his dumb friends  wish I was irl. They all liked me more than they usually do. "\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's so fucking sad to read that. Really... that makes me sad. I've got introverted friends and I like them better when they "really" are themself, not when they are "extroverted-induced-drunk". It's so fucking cliché to say that but people should like you for who you are, not for whom you're """"""""""supposed"""""""""" to be. Sorry for the f words, non-english native, but really it upsets me...
2	Awwww x)
2	Girl, I feel this too well. I was drinking with some friends one night and the host invited her family members and I started the night super shy and composed per normal. Woke up the next to them laughing about how I kept telling everyone I wanted to eat their ass. I avoided hanging out with them and drinking for like a good 5 months because I was so ashamed. 
2	> I’ve noticed that when I drink I have a moderation problem and tend to cut loose\n\nMeditation helps with that in a big way. Do it a couple of evenings before the day. You still let yourself lose, but in a way that feels more true to you.
2	Oh yes, when I lose my shit and say nasty stuff I always end up cringing really hard afterwards once I cool down. Because of that I try to control what I'm saying when I'm angry. Luckily I'm just not a confrontational person irl, but sometimes a comment here and there on reddit happens.
21	Anyone else sick of ppl trying to control you ?	rant incoming it's a big one:\n\ni'm just fucking sick of friends, bosses, coworkers, people, parents, potential partners trying to control me. like they want to manipulate us into doing what they want when they don't fucking realise that if they just gave us the freedom and respected our autonomy then we *might actually WANT to do what they want* because SHOCKER we actually do want them them to be happy we just need to take care of ourselves first and WE know better than anyone what WE need. do they even realise that the more they try to cling and control the more they actually push us away?! maybe if you LET us do whatever we want you'd realise that "whatever we want" is actually really beautiful and can actually be in your best interests and way more satisfying than the bullshit you try to choke out of us?! maybe you're actually STAMPING OUT the creative potential that you're trying so hard to force out of us and in the process you're actually making us hate you. maybe if you just created a environment where we felt free to explore our potentials and have a great experience without pressure we would actually do something amazing. this has been the narrative my entire life even as a child like STOP MANIPULATING ME AND MAYBE I'LL ACTUALLY RESPECT YOU ENOUGH TO WANT TO DO THIS SHITTY THING FOR YOU JUST BECAUSE I CARE ABOUT YOU. THERE'S AN IDEA HEY??!?! THAT I COULD ACTUALLY, SHOCKER, *OF MY OWN VOLITION*, *WANT* TO HELP YOU. THAT I'M AN ACTUAL PERSON AND NOT JUST A PAWN IN YOUR LITTLE GAME. it's so weird how we're the selfish ones when the actual pricks that just made us hate them don't realise that they've actually created their own self fulfilling prophecy. my boss was another one, micromanaging the shit out of me and stamping out my flame then complaining why i put such low effort a year later when i started off on such an enthusiastic high - like mate you actually destroyed any desire i had to create something nice for you, it's amazing that you can blame that on me when you just lost an employee that built sick shit that you actually had to beg for months afterwards for me to come back because you realised how difficult it was to replace me. same with friends who start putting pressure on me for this or that, like do you like me as i am or not, because i sure accept you as you are, if you value that in a person then stop trying to force me into your little story and let me make my own decisions. same with romantic partners who just want to take things too quickly when like you just destroyed any chance of me actually wanting to get with you at all, how about that? like fuck off. i'm so over it. from now on i'm just gonna tell people straight up that i'm not gonna abide their subtle attempts at manipulating and pressuring and if they want to enjoy what i have to offer they've actually got to chill the fuck out and let me do my thing. otherwise bye bye let me know when you've learned to stop sabotaging what you have. i'm done.\n\n/rant\n\nedit: and not only that, i'm sick of people just devaluing what i do only to learn later how much they depended on it..like did you think your weird hostile dictatorial environment would actually encourage me to keep producing value?? what the fuck are you on? like do you like ME or do you just like how well i follow your instructions and abide your hints and demands?
6	It’s actually amazing how close to home this hits for me. My work has learnt that to get me to perform you literally leave me to it, or I’ll make everything hell. My friends that have gotten too clingy or tried to change me or ignore me in a clingy or unhealthy way, I’ve pushed them all back now, it’s going to take someone very special to get close to me again. And I’ve been single for so long due to multiple issues that once again, I’d rather be single than with some toxic person.l that hindered my ability than just lets me live my life. I love my freedom, I love people being themselves and really achieving there goals but I can’t tolerate the manipulation or the clinginess that some people as you said was suffocating. 
3	Yeah i feel you. I'm totally happy to help someone with their goals at work or whatever situation for the pure satisfaction of helping, and contributing in my own way. But when I feel I'm being controlled or manipulated I will go completely in the opposite way and will completely disengage, turn into a shit employee/friend or just quit altogether 
3	I endorse this rant 100%\n\nI could not have expressed what you just did as well as you did.  I relate to every word in it. \n\nFuck those guys with a 10 foot pole.  \n\nYou know what?  Fuck them 10 times harder so they have an actual reason to bitch and whine about yourself being assertive.\n\nHad someone INFURIATED and REVOLTED about me making the statement "Do not nit pick and scold me all time time about petty ridiculous trivialities."  OH MY GOD.  I WAS SO AUDACIOUS....FOR...WHAT WAS IT   oh ya.  They said my transgression was getting "DEFENSIVE."  And furthermore, it was "EXACTLY WHAT I ALWAYS DO.  SHIT LIKE THIS."  \n\nYa.  Well for this "person," there will not be me being "defensive" again.  I let her know any attempt whatsoever to contact me in any circumstance will lead me to being "offensive."  I will hit her 10 times for the shit she intends to do to me in future, and 10 times for all the shit she has done to me in the last two years.  \n\nYou wake me up screaming to do some stupid assed shit like put a couple things in the trash I didn't do out of respect for them?   \n\nYou better hope it's not the 80th fucking time you have attempted to emotionally abuse me.  \n\nIt's over.\n\nIt's never fucking happening again.\n
2	– Ugh! Why you gotta be like that?!  \n– Like what?  \n– \*angry sigh\*
1	Lol yeah. I just don't care about them. People that loves you and knows you won't pressure you into doing things you don't feel like doing.\n\nI always welcome contrary thoughts tho. If I only act by impulse I would be a piece of shit.
1	I agree
5	What is your opinion on minimalism?	
7	As an idea to break out of the capitalist way of thinking and proving to yourself that you don’t need materialistic items to be happy, I think it’s a great step forward for anyone. Its less wasteful and promotes behaviour that will benefit the environment and everyone on this earth. It’s something I practice and want to explore further. 
4	as an aesthetic (ie architecture, textiles), i love it.\n\nas fine art, it’s whatever.
2	I love it but I'm incapable of it.
1	I love it, I never used to be able to maintain it, but as I’ve gotten older I’ve gotten better at it! 
1	I like the idea of it a lot, but I don't know if I could maintain it. I sometimes try to dress with a minimalist style, but I also like more interesting stuff a lot too
1	I have an interest in minimalism, and I've been wanting to practice it for some time.
1	I love it, been a minimalist since I was a kid. Helps keep your mind organised. It's actually only now that I've been buying more stuff and treating myself.
1	I am actually very interested in Living a minimalist lifestyle and i look up to it.    I don't think i want to live a minimalist lifestyle for my whole life tho just until i retire.\n\njust for my young years when i start working onto maybe 35-45 years old?   And save all my money not spending it on stuff i don't need. \n\nso i could be using capitalism to my advantage by living a minimalistic lifestyle still try to get a nice hardworking job so i can retire early.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ni  love the idea of of being a successful person but living relatively humble lifestyle with only the base essentials and hiding my wealth so no one will judge you for it and use you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\njust recently iv'e had a rain check on why material privileges can be hurtful and damaging. As it can always be taken away from you and leave you behind.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
1	I watched a documentary on it on Netflix (called minimalism lol) and I LOVED it and made everyone I know watch it. I initially got rid of a lot of stuff after watching it, and have been better about getting rid of stuff I don’t care about, but I’m definitely not a minimalist, and I continue to be extremely messy. I think I love minimalism in theory, but not in practice. Tbh, I think I got super into the documentary because the videography and music was absolutely beautiful, and as stereotypical as it sounds, I wanted to become a minimalist just for the aesthetic lol.\n\nI’m definitely more of a minimalist when it comes to clothes. I say all the time that I wish I could be like Steve Jobs and wear the same outfit everyday, but I’m a girl and I’m still in school, so if you wear the same thing over and over, people start asking lol. But if I could, I would wear my nice fitting San Francisco navy blue sweatshirt, skinny jeans, and my checkered vans every single day. Choosing clothes everyday seems like a needless hassle, and the whole fast fashion business is disgusting in its general treatment of workers.
3	What are your views on culture?	
3	I feel that culture is everything, every interaction, every influence. All cultures are constantly changing and morphing, it's a dynamic thing and the blending of cultures should be celebrated. It's cool to appreciate the lost cultures of the past however I feel that efforts to preserve dying cultures are wasted. I think people can be too precious about how sacred their culture is. I know this is a controversial mindset but I grew up in a very multicultural town and am so greatful to have been able to experience and embrace the cultures of my friends. Despite not being born into their cultures, I feel that they are a part of my own.
2	it's good
2	Culture to me is fascinating, I love learning about it, but I would never go deep into it at the same time
2	Some are good, some are bad.  there are good and bad aspects of some
1	No real opinion, not too interested overall. Some aspects are interesting, though, like folk myths/legends.
23	anyone else a very lonely person?	
22	The worst feeling is feeling lonely in a group. 
8	Yes and no. I have a large friend group, and support system in general. But I feel like I tend to feel a little lonelier in large groups than I do completely alone...
6	yes
6	Weirdly enough, I feel lonelier when I'm in a group than when I'm alone. I can't click with most people. Even on Tinder, I can hardly find someone I can picture having casual sex with because it just doesn't feel right. I feel lonely on social media too, I feel no one cares about me and just follows me "because". They never even reply to my questions widget, it's really void and I just can feel the gap between their ways of being and mine. I only become "hypersocial" when I'm manic, but I really hate friend groups. I had one last year. It felt like a constant strain, I was overwhelmed, I was the "out of place" one who didn't like Kpop but thought I was able to change, I didn't have anything in common with them and they were always calling me "overly dramatic". I didn't get their humour, I found it lame and almost embarrassing. They fucked me over several times and I called it quits by disappearing, and though they later apologized, I was never able to come back.\n\nBut once I'm entirely by myself, I don't feel so lonely anymore. Sure, I need social interaction like any human, but my two therapists and the strangers on the street, or my mum (when we have something to talk about), are enough. I have one very close friend who lives in India, and while we can't really talk right now because she's busy af (she's graduating soon, the homestretch is always hard), I know we always have this love for each other and it's just what I need. I sometimes visit my relatives too when I've got money for train tickets, and it "recharges" my social meter, so to say. I always feel good around them, and I can never feel unhappy after spending time with them. A few weeks ago I went to visit my great-aunt who lives 2 hours away from me, and I loved every little bit of the weekend. Even the Airbnb host was really good to me. It was great. It's the simplest pleasures of life.\n\nI only need myself, my cats, my family and my friend, whom I feel is possibly the person I want to spend my life with. I don't need all that "have a group of friends" garbage, or parties, or "nights out with the girls". That stuff is excessive and completely overrated. Simplicity and trust are happiness, in my books.
4	Not really. I have the fortune to be in a great family, and I have a very supportive group of friends. I'm very lucky and happy they exist.
3	In what sense?
3	Im not very lonely but Im little bit lonely because I dont usually start the convorsation when im talking to the stranger and I dont like to be in a big group. It gives me anxiety somehow meaby because I think too much what people think about me. 
2	Absolutely. When I have good friends I have this horrible feeling that we're in the process of drifting away. Every time I see a good friend I worry that it's going to be the last. When I meet people who I click with, I'm self destructive and don't make any effort as a defence mechanism. So it's self inflicted, and I know I need to shift my perspective because on paper I have a lot of friends and I should be really happy.
3	Favorite YouTube​ Channels	Hi! I'm posting this for my ISFP husband because he doesn't have a reddit account. A few days ago, my family talked about our favorite channels and what we watch are so different. My strategist INTJ brother spends most of his time on informative or historical channels while I (mechanic ISTP) love watching a guy tearing down phones and game consoles. My husband just watches movie trailers and some game reviews on YouTube but he doesn't have any specific channel he likes.\n\nSo do you guys have favorite channels to share? He's into games and anime but is open to anything. He's more curious to see what his type likes to watch. Thanks!
5	I mostly watch vine comps, the Try Guys, Kurtis Conner, Brad Mondo, John Oliver, Trevor Noah, etc. I basically only watch comedy centered stuff tbh.

16	What are some unfair assumptions you make about other mbti types?	Any person who claims to be an ISFP but has an anime character for their profile pic or talks about being *obsessed* with anime, I automatically assume is an INFP. Am I wrong? *Almost definitely.* Am I able to stop this assumption? *Not really*. Do any of you have weird, inaccurate assumptions about other types??
10	I now assume every INTP is a jerk r/iamverysmart type that doesnt know shit about emotions and how to deal with them.\n\nHopefully there are INTPs that learned about these things and are mature enough, but I always assume this. 
4	Everytime I see a person who is an xSTJ I automatically assume he/she has good work ethic. Could not be the case for everyone but lol\n\nIt doesn’t in any way affect how I deal with them, when it comes up in my head I try to acknowledge it as not necessarily true though\n
5	TIL I'm an INFP.\n\nI'm not sure how inaccurate it is, but I generally view FJs and TPs as rather emotionless. Mainly ExTPs and IxFJs.
4	ENTJs are overly competitive in social situations \nand are insecure about their deeper emotions.\n\n\nENTPs habitually use people for gain.\n\nEdit:i think i just missed the intention of this post. Sorry. \n\n
2	I fucking detest people who use an anime picture as their profile picture. I'm sorry dude. I know you feel like a ninja, but you don't even kind of resemble Naruto. Also only a casual watches that crap. Fight me.
2	Idk about you guys but every ISTJ/ISFJ i have met i have had an incredibly hard time trying to have fun with them because (in my experience) they’re only really comfortable doing things that they’re comfortable/familiar with and never want to do anything new so the assumption grew on me :/
1	Wait what? All the ISFP's I know love anime.
1	I mean, having an anime pfp =/= obsession with anime. I don’t watch anime anymore but still use some characters as profile pics because i’m lazy
5	what are your favorite human senses?	
9	I would probably be most devastated if I lost my hearing. Music is everything to me. Would be super depressing not being able to hear music ever again. 
3	If I lost hearing It'd be over. Like /u/latroargentum said music is everything to me and it gives life colours that I thought it never had
2	1. Taste\n2. Hearing\n3. Touch\n4. Sight\n5. Smell
2	I'd say intuition. 
2	Hearing, no doubt. I'd rather be blind
2	Sight and touch.
4	What pokemon type would you be?	
5	I’m very laid back but can be very fiery if something greats my interest, I would like to say Dragon type but I think Psychic or Dark would be closer lol
5	Flying 
5	Easily a ghost type. I ghost people all the time. I only reveal myself to very few people. I'm a homebody. I hate intruders. Must I say more?
3	Not sure, but I'm a big fan of Ground Pokémon.
3	Id be both grass and fire type
3	Snorlax is my favorite. Chimchar is adorable as well. That's all I know, lol.
2	Squirtle x)
2	Either Ice or Ghost. For a specific Pokemon, I'd be a Banette.\n\n~~but technically being both Ice/Ghost would make me a Froslass, fits too I guess~~
29	Does anyone here have a kind of hero-complex?	Like you always need an altruistic goal in life? You feel that unless you are working for a bigger cause, your work and life is of no use. You are always sticking up for the underdog in any situation, and the first thing you do when you see a new event, is to judge it by your moral yardstick. You always end up making underdog friends and are intentionally a bully to the bullies.
4	Yep. White Knight Syndrome.
2	I had that in middle school then got my ass handed to me
1	Yeah, for sure
1	Yup
1	I have always been drawn to working with people with disabilities and I can identify with this. Every time I have thought of leaving my career in special education, I’ve been drawn to other jobs involving helping people who are disadvantaged. 
1	I'm the opposite, I find people who think their worth is decided by how selfless and helpful they are rather annoying. Can't hate them, though, since in person they're pretty nice. Their thought process just pisses me off.
2	"Fly me to the moon Let me play among the stars Let me see what spring is like On Jupiter and Mars	In other words, hold my hand\nIn other words, darling, kiss me\nFill my life with song" - Diana Krall\n\nDiana Panton cover: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=xBSuxSQQkFE\n\nLove these lyrics 🖤\n\n\n\n
4	Any other autistic/on the spectrum ISFPs?	Also, what differences do you notice between you and other ISFPs?\n\nFor me (I have Asperger's), while I do know ISFPs don't really value Fe, I know most ISFPs are still pretty good at actually using it. For me, it's quite stunted. I also don't really do typical Se activities, I generally just stay indoors and spend time behind my PC.\n\nI'm also under the impression that my Fi is even stronger than that of the average ISFP, I can get offended very easily by the right words or actions, but most ISFPs seem to be pretty chill and have a "live and let live" attitude. Like, I mean I won't actually confront someone or call them out on something, but it definitely makes me resent people easily.\n
3	I have really bad anxiety and depression, so I have to take pills. I get offended easily, am scared of picking up the phone, and get extreme anxiety when I am in the presence of a high class person. I could stay home forever as long as I have Wi-Fi. Humans scare me. Dogs and cats are cute. I also have ADD. 
2	🙋🏼‍♀️ 
1	I just did the [aspie quiz](https://rdos.net/eng/Aspie-quiz.php) on the beautiful rdos website. apparently i'm a bit more neurodiverse than i was jan of last year!  \n  \n>Your neurodiverse (Aspie) score: 118 of 200  \nYour neurotypical (non-autistic) score: 76 of 200  \nYou are very likely neurodiverse (Aspie)  \n[the diagram thing](http://www.rdos.net/eng/poly10a.php?p1=87&p2=80&p3=59&p4=57&p5=41&p6=55&p7=48&p8=85&p9=25&p10=85)
13	ISFP art - (M/16) - First ever attempt at drawing anything representing me/the ISFP personality. Isn’t anything necessarily crazy, nor impressive, but I felt happy enough with it to share. Have a go at understanding it, I’ll happily explain in comments if asked :)	
2	The first thing that came to my mind... what does the 100% battery mean? And the thought bubble above it? 😃
2	Very nice ! Are you going to color it? 
10	me_irl	
5	Don't ask questions that you don't want the answer to.
2	I mean would ya really want them to say yes? At that point the Fi just becomes Fe
1	When Fi shines
1	yeah isfps like what we like and each have very individual taste
1	"Shit's dope"\n\nI probably say that like 150 times a day
6	Does anyone else have a hard time getting along with INFJs?	I find them almost impossible to get along with. It annoys me to no end how they think they have me/other people “figured out” and they usually come off as really disingenuous to me. I also just find it hard to talk to them about things in general unless it’s super abstract (not interesting) or about me (I’m very private). They seem to need to control the conversation all the time and if it doesn’t go their way they start to get weirdly stressed. 
9	Yes. They’re totally self absorbed. I’m in an ISTP group on Facebook because I border ISFP/ISTP and that personality type, in particular, (along with INTJ’s) are constantly barging into conversations uninvited to share their opinion. INFJ’s appear to at least want to contribute to a conversation but they manage to be overly involved and feely. INTJ’s want to dominate a discussion and make everyone else look inferior. They’re so fucking annoying. 
8	Yes, actually! I tend to get along with just about everyone, but INFJs tend to rub me wrong. Usually I’ll try being friends with them, and they’ll end up being kind of cold or rude, so I think it’s more that INFJs don’t like me for whatever reason. Usually, the INFJs I’ve known have been kind of loners, so I try to befriend them, and they just do not like me.\n\nI knew an INFJ who’s family immigrated here illegally, so her family was pretty financially unstable. I became friends with her (or so I thought) and learned that a lot of times, they didn’t have food in their house, so I started bringing her lunch everyday. I didn’t make a big deal about it in front of others and she always seemed grateful. At the end of the year, one of my best friends told me that the INFJ said that I was annoying. I don’t get my feelings hurt super easily but *damn that hurt*. When I messaged her about it (basically “hey, I’m really sorry if I got on your nerves, but I wish you would’ve asked me to back off instead of talking about me behind my back”.) she was super apologetic and said that “she didn’t think I thought of her as a friend either”.\n\nThough my experiences with other INFJs haven’t been as extreme, they’ve been similar. Idk, INFJs tend to seem kind of nice at first but end up being kind of fake and self absorbed. It might just be something about me, too, but I think I’ve had more negative experiences with INFJs than any other type.
29	Who here is not a fan of their birthday?	Because mine is coming up and every year I get irrationally meh about it all
8	I don't celebrate them haha
6	I use to not be but after my last birthday im starting to appreciate them alot more
5	Oh my goodness me!!!!!! I never thought that had something to do with my personality type. I have issues with all attention on me. I hate it. It’s the reason why I’m eloping. \n\nI feel like it’s so much pressure!!!! Something I started doing is just not getting on Facebook at all on my birthday. I felt like it was so stressful telling everyone thank you and it was taking away from the day. Not to say I’m not thankful for people taking the time to wish me happy birthday, it really means so much. It was just taking away from the day. I now get on there and personally thank each person the day after! 
3	My friends will decline my invitations to hang out every now and again, but they never turn down my birthday. Such a good excuse to get all of my close friends and not as close friends into the same area doing some nonsense. Normally I do a barbecue and tell people to bring their own beer. I love my birthday.
3	I don’t like getting reminded I’m getting older so I just see it as another day. But people have gone out of their way to make it seem special in the past so I appreciate that. 
2	I’ve always had something really important that comes up on my birthday so I’ve never really found it special. Last year I travelled to Australia on it because that way it was a good excuse to ignore the birthday messages lol. But I like the placement of them, not necessarily the attention that comes with it. 
2	Today is my birthday and honestly.. https://youtu.be/CSKVAo9CK7Y
2	Idk i started to like then after a while 
2	finally someone feels the same way I do! i really dislike my birthday I always feel like I have to live up to people’s expectations and never truly enjoy myself. I really like celebrating other people’s bdays tho
2	I'm just okay with it. As a kid it was always great to get gifts and have visitors, but nowadays I don't really have much I want (well, I do, but they're too expensive to ask for a birthday gift) and I don't really have many visitors I want to see. The people I do want to see I see on a regular basis anyways. And yeah, the attention is really ugh.
1	I utterly despise my birthday. - INTJ 
1	Oh yeah I hate my birthday 
6	What are some of your toxic traits? What are the parts of you that really make you feel shame?	and for the love of god please dont say some egotistical shit like "I care for people too much ;( " 
15	When I am in a bad mood I project it. I see myself doing it too. Which makes me feel even worse. Which makes me keep doing it. Its a fucking endless spiral.\n\nI constantly flake at the last fucking second. Its because I never wanted to go, and when it finally comes time I just admit to myself I will be happier not going. People don't invite me out as much as they used to as a result. Which is fair.\n\nI am very dangerous and irrational when you piss me off. Dangerous in the sense that I don't even know what I am fully capable of. I am not someone you wanna cross. I purposefully become as big of a cunt as humanly possible. I will lose a war to win a battle. I am not too timid to resort to physical violence. I will make damn sure you don't want to cross me again.
12	I can be incredibly selfish, often at the expense of others. 
8	I am territorial about the things that I like and don’t like being friends with people who infringe on my sense of individuality (which is childish and unreasonable) or people who devalue my interests. \n\nI prioritize self preservation over others’ emotions almost every time. \n\nI can be so non confrontational that instead of being upfront about issues i’m having with people, I let negative feelings and resentments bottle up and fester until I’m fed up. I am guilty of ghosting/door slamming people without even a warning sign which is unfair to them considering they didn’t have the opportunity to explain their perspective. \n
6	If someone does something like interrupt or talk over me (multiple times), mansplain, or say something really offensive about a group of people, I basically stop acknowledging them. Instead of working past it and staying on civil terms or telling them why I don’t like what they did. (Cuz I don’t like that kind of conflict.) \n\nIt’s fine if you don’t have to interact with them, but they’re in my work cell at work and currently is sleeping in my living room so it gets AWKWARD in those situations. 🤦🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️
4	I'm constantly late to everywhere I go. Some days I force it so I run so late, I end up pissing off the people who are waiting for me to arrive so much that they say forget it and I get to stay home. I have an unhealthy relationship with my anger. Usually, I can hold back but that just leads to build up until I eventually explode. I hate mess but find ways to avoid it instead of addressing the mess. Every time I get into a new relationship, I immediately don't want to be in a relationship. \n\n:')
4	I tend to talk about myself. A LOT. Because I'm very introspective and constantly try to figure out my place in the scheme of things. I'm incredibly self-centered.\n\nI'm a bit embarrassed to say it but I'm not overly interested in other people's lives. I care about them, but I don't want to know their life details.\n\nI'm emotionally unstable (but it has more to do with BPD and possible bipolar than being an ISFP, I reckon)\n\nAt some point, I just disappear and ignore people. Not with everyone, but sometimes I have friends and one day, everything they do or says irks me for a reason I don't even know. It makes me feel bad but I can't ever bring myself to come back.\n\nI am either super altruistic or selfish to the point of "if you die, I don't even give a shit".
3	when someone pisses me off and wrongs me if i don't express that im pissed of at someone and am alone. i use my demon function which is TI and just start going ham on thinking how i can take them down. \n\nsuch as thinking of actual ways to hurt them by like thinking  to get them to go to a boxing match with me or a streetfight or just thinking of giving them a Suckerpunch and for some reason i enjoy having these thoughts in my head when i am angry at them.\n\n Seems toxic to me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
2	I especially despise people who try to convert me to their ideology, People who get really precious about their beliefs, values and opinions. I don't even pretend to be interested in them.\nEveryone is expected to be part of a group or movement and if you're not interested then somehow you are meant to be part of the problem. I'm an individual human being and I find ideologies toxic. Conversely, that makes me come across as toxic.
1	i isolate myself a lot
5	Can anyone relate to this?	Someone mentioned a while back to add age to these posts, and I like the idea. 28 male.\n\nI don't know many people who are as loyal to their inner circle as I am. If people talk about my friends behind their backs I'll stand up for them even if it causes conflict. I normally go to extreme lengths to avoid conflict. If a friend needs help I will go to the end of my branch to help them. Even if that means risking breaking my own branch. If I see someone doing you wrong, or think someone is doing you wrong I will let you know. If you need a friend to talk to at 3 a.m. feel free to call me even if I have work in the morning. If a bar fight breaks out I will more than happily risk getting stabbed to help you out. If you need someone to call you stupid to get you back on track. I will. If you need someone to help you bury a body. I will. If I can't help you. I will find someone who can.\n\nThese statements only scratch the surface of what I will do for people in my inner circle. If you drove up and just said, "I can't tell you why. Put on this blindfold and get in." I would blindfold up, get in, and not ask questions. My inner circle is a very small list. I know damn well they aren't gonna hurt me intentionally. I don't how else to explain what I am willing to do. I will do almost anything. I'm not gonna join a cult and drink the cool aide with you. I'm just gonna beat the fucking stupid out of you. I am always the person they call when they fuck up. I don't know if its because I'm reliable, or if they just feel comfortable telling me the whole truth. I am always the person they call when they need help, and nothing could make me happier. I pride myself on being able to be there for my close friends.\n\nThis just applies to my inner circle though. I will extend above average human kindness to 99% people, but I won't go out of my way in any regard. This includes my blood relatives with my mom and dad being the only exception. I would kill someone for hurting them. I honestly don't know if anyone else will ever make it into my inner circle. I don't get out much. I'm a homebody. Occasionally my ENTJ best friend drags me into his newest scheme to take over the world, but thats about it. Its not that I'm bad at making friends. I fucking excel at making friends. I just don't become close to people anymore. I only have so many hours in a day, and I have enough close friends to fill those hours as is.
13	Do you feel like you can be super judgmental /selfish sometimes?	I'm a very independent naturalistic kind of person. The thing is I have a friend who is a cog in the corporate machine. I had no idea I was so judgmental until I found myself accidentally revealing my judgement for corporate professional people to her while talking about others. It was too late to backtrack and I just let it slide but I could tell I said something a bit tactless. Similarly I have other judgements about things, like anxiety being an unhealthy thing despite the fact that she very clearly suffers from it. I feel really bad, I probably said 2 not very nice things. It's just that I guess I value individuality so much I do judge those who sacrifice that for boring secure jobs and value that lifestyle. And I know we need all types of people but I have all these unconscious judgements that help me define and differentiate who I am. Especially since I had a really bad experience working in the corporate world which I guess I still haven't processed. Wonder if other ISFPs suffer from this and what you do about it. For the record I do like and care about her even though I probably just made her feel worse about herself which I would not have done if I thought ahead. It's pretty selfish and I guess I wanna know if others here have felt this and what you've done about it.
1	Entp here you might want to just read Enneagram 4 and look at the healthy unhealthy distinctions and that might help give you a guide to understand why your own personal values, introverted feeling might not be good outside of yourself in certain scenarios
1	Not from around here (infp), just curious, you say let it slide, does that mean you're going to leave it as is, with her maybe feeling badly? \nI'm sure you plan to be more careful in future, I just couldnt imagine not needing to clear the air. And I'm curious how you isfp's tick.
1	I only have that when I'm spending too much time online (which is often, like today). Total salt generator.
0	Like you, I am Also judgey of corporate cogs and I hate capitalism. I hate capitalism because it is so harmful to people, animals, and the environment and corporate cogs just perpetuate its existence more than others.\n\nWe should still try not to be jerks though.
1	heard a romantic song on the radio	and it inspired me to make a playlist\nhttps://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwripFCiEgky6BavuiBzbeM65Ehko_P4a
14	Does anyone else not find ExTPs charming?	For some reason everyone constantly says ExTPs are extremely charming and hard to dislike, but I find that they're not charismatic at all. If anything, they seem rather creepy in general. Mature ones are just alright, though.
12	I generally find ENTPs as annoying edgelords and ESTPs greasy and pervy :/ Both also egotistical if immature. I had to call an ESTP friend-of-a-friend today and their voicemail message was an entire monologue of their whole life. 
7	I am an ENTP, and I definitely wouldn't consider myself charming. I'm witty, and I have the skills that are usually associated with being charming, but I never really put much effort into that type of thing. Usually I come across as really funny, unique, and eccentric, which definitely isn't considered charming by most people out there. Along with that, I do have that stereotypical ENTP problem with randomly starting debates about stupid (and often controversial) crap, and then finding some credible bullcrap I can use to argue it (they stand there and look at me like I'm stupid, but they can't find a good way to prove me wrong). Honestly, the charming stereotype seems pretty off, at least for ENTPs. Healthy ones sometimes come across as charming, but the majority of us don't usually give that vibe.
2	My husband is an ENTP and my brothers are ISFP’s. I can’t figure out why my brothers don’t really enjoy my husband, help a girl out!  Haha
2	ENTPs can be annoying, but ESTPs are annoying.\n\nMy Opinion, so feel free to downvote. 
2	I'm here from the ENTP raid. Lol\n\nENTP's are energetic idea generators that use logic to try and discover things. It's my experience that isfps do not like to engage in banter, fast-paced conversation or speaking in analytical ways.\n\nThe ones that I know are more concerned about sticking to what's true about themselves and speaking about their opinions in a very subjective way that makes it difficult for you to say something without feeling like you're telling them that they are wrong in their experience is not valid.\n\nTo be fair I have one of my closest friends that might be an isfp and we grew apart in college and we learned how to communicate and have always been really close and more so and post-college\n\nI also think that the isfps do not speak their mind fully or they don't think out loud which makes for slow going with entps
2	Can someone please get the violent ponies out of here!?
2	What is your gripe with them, how are they creepy?  I would describe myself as charismatic and charming as per outside feedback. I think SFPs and NTPs are just not very into each other in general.
1	I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:\n\n- [/r/entp] [An Ego Check from r\/ISFP](https://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/avxbui/an_ego_check_from_risfp/)\n\n&nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))*
1	Then you haven't met an actual ENTP
1	Meh... they're easy to talk to and seem to be the only type of people who wanna be around me. :l
1	My crush is ENTP 
1	I don’t generally have strong opinions about ExTPs, simply because they are so different from myself, so I don’t generally know any of them all that well. I love IxTPs though, but mostly because they tend to be overly awkward and detached, and I think it’s kind of cute tbh.
1	As an ENTP I feel the best way to describe it’s like being charismatic but never charismatic enough to get anything I want. There’s definitely certain social things that come pretty easy to me, as others in the thread have said I tend to come off as pretty unique and I’m a pretty good speaker and pretty open and honest. So yeah these things all lend me to be pretty charming or at least charismatic in the right moments. But I’ve never got the impression that it was ever enough to get me anything or confirm that I’d win anybody over. I find that oftentimes I just feel out of place and like I’m too scared to take certain risks. I think the people who are impressed by me are just impressed that I’d say certain things. To me the shit I say isn’t a risk, I really just don’t care to hide certain things about me so being confident then isn’t hard. So yeah is their charm there? Sure. Do some just find it creepy? Definitely. Always feel like I’m in this middle zone and I just wish I could cross it.
1	I would call ENTPs charismatic, as a presumptuous generalization, as opposed to charming. \n\nThey often have magnetic personalities, but recall that magnets are polarized - as such, ENTPs tend to be polarizing. \n\nI do speak as an ENTP-A. 
6	What podcasts do you like?	
2	Your classics like My Favorite Murder, And That’s Why We Drink, Spirits, etc. However, I also listen to podcasts that relate to my current interests, such as the Female Farmer Project, and I’ve been looking into some Lutheran podcasts (I’m kind of in the process of converting?) Overall, entertainment and niche interests.

4	When a bear drinks beer it becomes unbeerable.	You’re  just too distant for my arms. Maybe you’re too far for my hugs. Could my imagination be as long to reach you somewhere and taste you? I don’t know what I really feel. I wonder what you think about me, if you're cold enough.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI  wake up at night and cry fucked up. I'm still afraid of the dark. Gosh i’d do anything to have some of your sweetness now. but I'm very scared that  something grabs me from under the bed if I put one foot on the floor.  why you far flan?

7	The 7 Work Habits of Highly Effective Introverts	
5	I don’t like this article. It’s the habits of how to be a successful wage slave. This doesn’t exactly align with my values of success. 
2	> Highly Effective\n\nMe, scanning all seven qualities and realizing I possess none of them: 😐
9	Does anyone else find the ENFP girls the most attractive of all?	they are nice and mentally stimulating, also warm and talkative without loosing their individuality. they're the only extroverts with whom i can watch a lot of series during a lot of time, even fights are fun and entertained. rainbows flow everywhere.
12	I get along with them pretty dang well. Lots of ENFP friends. Over time I usually find them less attractive, because a lot of times it feels like they're obsessed with themselves and most of the time we spend is me listening to stories about their personal lives. Which is fine, it's just not as interesting.\nTo be fair, I'm in college, so like everyone is obsessed with themselves.
7	Most of the ENFPs I know are a little bit on the looney side, which is really entertaining friendship-wise but I don't know if I'd be able to handle it in a relationship. I do like them a lot though! 
6	ESFJ or ESFP for me. 
2	ENFP get easily bored. Even more with an average ISFP. Hate to burst your bubble, but this relationship is usually quite one-sided
1	Met an ENFP during a MBTI Google Hangout call that started from Reddit. She was very fun to listen to. Really attractive too. And cute. And smart. 
1	My best friend is an ISFP (I’m an ENFP) and we vibe so so well. My ex boyfriend was also an ISFP and we both very much were attracted to each other and enjoyed being around each other. Oh and my sister is also an ISFP. I love ISFP’s ^_^
1	My boyfriend is an ENFP :)\n\nCan confirm that he is attractive.
5	How do I stop being rude?	I'm nice to literally everyone I know but this one person can annoy me a lot. I think they're an ENFJ and I always try to be nice to them however after a while the rage starts coming out. It's not because they're like being rude to me as well, it's cause I can feel like they're not acting like them true self. The other day I think I went overboard with the rudeness and we spoke about it over text. I tried explained to them saying why I act this way and after that we kind of resolved it but I still feel like I didn't make them 100% happy. What can I do to stop being rude? 
4	I also wanted to say, this doesn't happen often. It doesn't happen at all. Being rude doesn't define who I am but it's hard trying to keep everyone happy. This situation was my fault tho and I am not happy with myself about it and I don't want something like that to happen again. I tried giving constructive criticism but I don't think that worked out well also. 
1	[deleted]
-6	Lol u not ISFP. They don’t care for shit like this unless when directly triggered like when u tryna hit them or fuck them up.
5	How to call someone out when necessary?	I won’t go into a lot of detail because I don’t think it’s necessary, but there’s been this person that hasn’t been the kindest to me (I’m a senior btw). He was extremely rude to me and basically made fun of me really passive aggressively in front of the whole class. I really wanted to say something to him after because he’s supposed to be my friend (long story) but I became so anxious that I just couldn’t. I keep telling myself that I shouldn’t create an issue and that maybe it’s actually somehow me who’s in the wrong. I know ISFPs generally hate conflict, so do you guys have any advice?\n\nI didn’t put a lot of detail for brevity’s sake, but I’m happy to answer any clarifying questions.
5	my weapon of choice would be joking :) while feigning hurt, i would say something along the lines of, "Really? You had to say that in front of the whole class? How you gonna do me like that man? That was mean...I thought we were friends :'(" \n\nthis is my go-to method for minor gripes.\n\nthough ISFPs are conflict-averse, they can be direct about things that matter to them. personally i'm not afraid of firm call-outs or straight up confronting someone if it's something i really feel strongly about. \n\na firmer approach would be to say kindly but firmly, "You humiliated me in front of the whole class and I really don't think that's okay, regardless of what your intentions were." best case, he actually didn't know any better and genuinely feels sorry and stops being so rude to you. \n\nif he continues to be rude to you then it's time to consider marie kondoing him out of your life because ain't nobody got time for that :)
2	Laugh along as if you're going with it and then say loudly "wow *SOMEONE'S jealous*" in an exaggerated way while looking at him and smirking. Anything he says just clap back, talk over him, interrupt him, anything. Practice in the mirror if you have to. And keep the crowd on your side. Everyone knows he's being an asshole but you gotta call it. 
29	Is anyone else not especially romantic?	I’ve never cared too much about whether or not I’ve been in a relationship or not. I always loved Valentine’s Day bc I thought that pink and red were a seriously underrated color combo, while everyone else complained about being single. If anything, relationships seem more trouble than what they’re worth. I feel more at ease in my own company, and I often feel boxed in and constrained by other people. Is this an ISFP thing or is this just a me thing?
8	I feel like what you're describing has little to do with romance, and more being single and having personal freedom. I dislike romance as in candlelight dinners, buying flowers, making grand gestures, but I very much do like being in a relationship (or rather, I know that not being in one would not be good for me). And luckily, I'm in a relationship that respects the need for personal freedom.\n\nSo, if you could have a relationship that allows you your freedom, and that does not require romantic gestures from you, would you still prefer to go it alone? 
5	Yes, I feel like this too. Even if I'm in a relationship I still feel the need to be myself and do my own things. In that sense I think relationships can hold me down
3	I’m not romantic in a classical sense,  but I do\n*love* love in a logical and sensual way. I love being cuddled up and talking shit to by boyfriend simultaneously if that makes sense 😂
2	Same. I can be romantic, but it's usually in very short bursts. I really hope I don't end up marrying someone someday because it's highly likely that I'd regret it the next day or so.
2	Yeah I don't really wanna get married till I reach my own goals first. But if I do meet that special someone before I reach my goals then idk. I've never been in a relationship however I used to like this girl and she liked me back however I took too long and she doesn't like me anymore. I liked her for a while but I don't care much now. I doubt I will ever meet someone like her again but oh well. But yh I wanna travel the world boii let's go, I'm not eager to get myself into a relationship. My friends call me a free spirit :) 
1	I feel like I'm difficult to get to know in the dating phase. I like to spend a lot of time by myself making music, mixes/playlist and editing videos because my job is exhausting socially. I don't text or call my date very often and that can be misconstrued as me having little to no interest in the other person. I can't date extroverts because they have to have constant attention and need to text all day every single day and it just tires me out. Sometimes I'm really interested, but I just don't know what to say or how to initiate conversation. However if I do really get to know someone and like what I see I tend to ruin the relationship because I want to be around them a lot even if I'm not talking to them (just be in the same space).\n\nI don't know relationships don't tend to work out for me. I unintentionally ghost in the beginning (they lose interest because I don't text/call back quick enough) or they ghost me later on because they think I've suddenly become clingy. I'm hoping my current dating situation works out :)
1	I completely relate, but also disagree. I actually really do enjoy being single, and relationships seem like a lot of work. Valentine’s Day just feels like another day to me; I don’t love it or hate it. I’ve never been very open about my emotions, and grand romantic gestures make me cringe so I can’t see myself ever being especially interested in anything like that.\n\n*That being said*, because I’m so comfortable being single and never make an effort to show my interest, I’m about to turn 18 and have never even been on a date. I have a lot of friends (and most of my close friends are guys), I’m funny and friendly, I’m not especially ugly, I’m smart and have hobbies and talents and ambitions and *blah blah blah* but because I’m so uncomfortable with romance, I’ve never even experienced it. I genuinely do like being single most of the time, and I like having independence and freedom and being able to make life choices without needing to consider how they would effect a significant other. But sometimes I do wish I’d at least experienced being in a relationship, and everything that goes with it. I’m definitely not romantic, but I really wish I was sometimes, because I feel like I’m completely just blocking out an entire chunk of life.
6	ISFPs – how do you feel about the combination of weed and music, or art in general?	Let me preface this by saying that I didn't know my MBTI-type until recently, and I didn't really care all that much and I still don't, but there have been one or two small revelations. My university recently made the results from our selection tests public, and apart from some formal maths stuff, intelligence and logic tests they apparently also ran a MBTI test, and apparently I'm ISFP, which explains a couple of things or habits that my friends have been pointing out for quite some time now – for example the fact that I love to find "beautiful things" everywhere I go. Whether we're in the woods or walking through the city I'll often go "Hey, doesn't that look really nice?" – well, I guess that explains why I tend to see those things more than other people.\n\nMore to the point though, music is my life. I have been making music since I was six years old and I listen to everything, but mainly I think Progressive Rock is the best thing in the world. Now, two years ago some friends got me into trying weed and one thing I quickly noticed is that music gets EVEN BETTER. I mean, movies and other forms of art as well, but music is something different when I'm high. I have been told by other people that music is pretty relaxing when they're stoned, but I don't think anyone I know ever "feels" the music like I do. Does anyone here have similar experiences?
1	I feel ya brotha 
1	I feel the same as you do about music and stuff. I listen all the time and write and play music. Its weed that doesnt sit right with me. Any time ive gotten high i have a terrible time and one time when i listened to music and it made it sound lifeless and empty and terrible. It was really quite a bad time. Plus it caused me a week of psychosis after i stupidly ate an edible one time knowing that weed doesnt sit right with me. Anyway I stay away from the stuff.
1	Yess!!! Hell yess, music when high takes me to another level completely. Stretches out time as well, like a 4 minute song feels like a lifetime and I can feel the layers of music. I listen to Indie a lot. Bands like The XX.
1	I'm against using drugs for myself, goes against my morals I guess. I love music and appreciate the beauty of our world though
1	Yeah I feel that. Weed makes music everything. 
1	One thing I noticed is that weed really makes me get hung up on certain parts of songs. Like I'll notice something I never noticed before and have to repeat the section 2 or 3 more times. In a way it makes it harder for me to sit back and enjoy the music, but it will also make me appreciate the artists a lot more for the creative and subtle stances they take in the writing process. 
5	Ideas for my ISFP wife	Good morning, I have been trying to type my wife lately, and I believe that she is an ISFP based on the eight cognitive functions. My only concern is that we have never really done anything artistic. I would like to give her the opportunity to explore that aspect of her personality (perhaps on a date), but I am unsure about the best way to do this. Do you guys have any suggestions? Are any of you lovely people also non-artistic ISFPs. I am an ENFP, so extroverted sensing is my worst cognitive function; so I am very out of my element here. Any advice is appreciated. Thank you!\n\nEDIT: I would like to clarify that my wife is an amazing writer and has an awesome blog. So she doesn't lack artistic talent, but I want to give her the chance to use all of her senses in different ways.
3	Hmmmm... how about a coffee art course or crafts workshop? There's no reason why you can't join in and learn some artistic skills of your own.  \n\nidk im just throwing out ideas (ISFPs please chime in if I am off-base)
3	Maybe take her on a nature walk and then you two can spend some time painting or taking pictures of all that you see, if you think that’s something she would enjoy.\n\nAlso, just because ISFPs are very artistic doesn’t necessarily mean that they are artsy. Sometimes they enjoy art in the form of aesthetics. For me, personally, I’m pretty awful at art, and it doesn’t hold my attention very long, but I’ve moved to places that are the most aesthetically pleasing, and I enjoying being surrounded by places that inspire me. So we don’t always need to get our artistic sides out with art, sometimes we just like being surrounded by beauty. Maybe consider taking to her to a place she would deem aesthetically pleasing.\n\nBest of luck to you! It’s super cool that you’re thinking about this aspect of her personality and wanting to take action on it.
2	I like to think of the ISFP trait as creative, not necessarily artistic (in the sense of classic studio art). Your wife’s writing definitely fits the bill. I personally like some types of creativity but not others. (I’m not into painting, but I like photo and movie editing.) I also greatly appreciate other people’s creativity and beautiful things, which I think is our sensing side. Especially from artists who think outside of the box. Also nature. \n\nMy recommendation would be to find out what new creative thing your wife is interested in trying and go in that direction. It could be that she’s interested in expressing her creativity through dancing, making studio art work, playing a musical instrument, writing poetry, making a movie, making jewelry or something that could be sold on Etsy, or enjoying a really nice day outdoors (etc.)
9	ENFP Male Interviewing ISFP Male Julien McLaren Fi-Ni SC/B(P)	
3	Lol omg this made me so self conscious. Like looking in a mirror. Am I as pretentious as this guy? Probably. Shit :( and esp how the ENFP is just so clearly bored and FiNi is caught up in his concepts he doesn't know how to dial it back. This is why I don't socialise.\n\nEdit: ok but as I watch more I have to say the guy is self aware enough to realise that he isn't really doing himself favours with the tribe and I commend him for that. Coming to the same realisation myself and hoping to work on that demon Te. It's a lot of work, especially when your internal world does cloud everything... Thanks for sharing this is really helpful.\n\nEdit2: watched the whole thing, probs overreacted a little bit soz. as they say seeing your type is kind of traumatic. actually really enjoyed this conversation, both really grew on me, the ISFP is on point about how to grow from your typology blindspots and it was all really fascinating :) thanks!
5	i have a crush on my therapist	
8	She cannot accept it. It’s called transference in therapy terms. She’s caring and nurturing but that is her job. Good luck. 
3	yikes, good luck
3	Find another crush elsewhere
3	You should probably switch therapists.
3	Oof
42	I found a Japanese proverb that might be fitting for a lot of ISFPs.	花鳥風月 (Kachou Fuugetsu) Literally: Flower, Bird, Wind, Moon\n\nMeaning: Experience the beauties of nature, and in doing so learn about yourself.
6	I like this. =) I wanted to add that nature isn't always about experiencing things only in the outdoors, you can also find such pleasant natures in many things like people, music, art, objects, etc that can help define our inner world or of who we are. 
4	This is beautiful. 😌
5	Perfectly describes me! I left the big city a month ago and I feel so peaceful and I’m so much better at introspecting.
2	Amazing. I love this. 
1	What do you think?	u/thechessgoddess and I are currently working on gathering answers for how thought processes work in types. This is just out of curiosity, not an attempt to stalk you according to how you think of grave crimes. All replies are appreciated!\n\nIf we count moral obligations out of the equation, \n\nQuestion 1: How is murder logically fine?\n\nQuestion 2: How is murder logically wrong?\n\nNOTE: Feel free to write down whatever thought you have, whether it is emotional or just plain retarded. This is a place to express yourself, after all. 
3	one, because morals have no objective basis in reality. you don't usually kill people because it feels wrong, but if you'd be better off with them dead and are only thinking rationally, there's no issue\n\nother than two, which is that there are typically very harsh punishments for murderers. it's a pretty dumb question though, there's a lot more to discuss about the moral aspects of killing another person
5	Can ISFPs be Highly Sensitive Persons (HSPs)?	I'm wondering what this would look like with 2nd slot Se. 
1	Maybe? Do you feel you might be both of those things? If so, what traits do you have that lead you to believe you might be both? I’m as unsure as you are, so it would be cool to unpack this and see.
1	Yes they can. 
1	Yes they definitely can depending on what they've experienced in their life. I don't know if I would consider myself an HSP, but I guess I fit the bill. I do find myself inside my head often analyzing various situations and scenarios that often turn out not be as convoluted or bad as I imagined. I feel and pick up on people's emotions almost instantly and I am immensely affected by my environment. I also need lots of downtime and I abhor violence and cruelty in real life, but not in video games or movies (I play mortal kombat and watch horror/thrillers all the time).
1	Yep. And it's a nightmare.
-2	Nah they are just emotional
7	how much of you can be taken away before you can no longer call yourself you?	
5	Great question. \n\nAs things are taken away, new input comes in to replace it and/or the older pieces grow to fill the empty space. \n\nWe are always ourselves.
2	There's a great story in the beginning of John Dies at the End about a hatchet. One day the handle breaks, and a new handle is attached. Not long later, the blade breaks, so a new one is attached to the old-new handle. Is it the same hatchet? \n\nIt ends there but here's how I take it. Now, as a collective of materials, it isn't the same at all. But as a construct with a purpose, it is absolutely the same as before. So are you a collective of materials, or a construct with a purpose? \n\n&#x200B;
2	Nothing can take you away from yourself. Even if someone can temporarily blunt your personality it will always comeback or you will fight against them and claim it back. Sometimes the not so great parts of our personality need to go away so that they can be replaced with better aspects learned through wisdom and life experience. You will always be true to yourself however. I've seen people change a lot over time for better or for worse (depending on how they handle things), but I've never seen someone's personality do a full 360. 
14	I will find a way.	I've just wake up at 3 AM and I'm unable to fall asleep again. My mind started its routine of bombarding myself with concerns. In a few days I start my 3rd year of my career, and still can't imagine how will I get money after classes for food and books. I would simply get more anxious by wondering why my boss sudenly fired me last month and by telling me how unable I am, but I prefer to think that, as always, I will find a way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't go hollow.
7	Very similar problems here man. Lost my job 2 weeks ago, rents due in less than a week and I haven't even payed this month's yet, and I still need to buy an online access code to take an exam this week because Ive been coasting off the trial version until now. I've been in this situation a few times before, I don't know how I keep letting myself get into tight spots like this. But yes, we will find a way
4	I believe in you guys. Keep working hard
2	Dont be too proud to seek help. Figuring it out doesnt have to be a one lane road. In the words of Carrie Underwood. I believe we were made to be here for each other.\nBe safe friend. Don't you dare go hollow.
29	why are dogs and cats so fucken cute	
3	Just because they are! 
2	I can't wait till I leave this swamp and I can finally get both 
2	Bc they have lil floofy tails and give snuggles
10	Are you guys really sensitive, like me, and take criticism/insults hard?	I am always aware of how i look and what I’m saying, and I’m constantly insecure over it. I also remember almost every time I’ve been insulted and still think of it.  I was insulted years ago, someone said i had teeth like spongebob and now i think of it every time I open my mouth. I take insults really hard and if someone gives me criticism, even if I ask for it, I find it hard not to burst into tears, and most of the time I do. How do I stop taking everything so personally and hard? 
2	I get annoyed as well however I forget about them very quickly. Whenever someone insults me I say to myself that they're not okay, cause normal people don't insult others for no reason. What I love doing is giving people compliments after they insult me. Their reactions are beautiful. 
2	Yeppp, I can relate. I can handle gentle constructive criticism (“hey, this is pretty good! But you might want to fix this...”), but if someone directly criticizes me, I get my little spirit crushed lol. Overtime, I’ve started just blocking out the majority of my negative emotions, though, because I’m not good at dealing with them, so I’ve started at least *pretending* criticism/insults don’t bother me...:)
2	Whoever said that about your teeth must really have a psychological problem. They certainly said that to attack you and make you feel down, making them feel a whole lot better about themselves. It seems the problem lies with them, not you. There are times when they do feel like personal attacks, but we don't have to take it that way. You can either choose to forget and ignore it or consider it in a positive way or action for your self benefit. Like while looking into the bathroom mirror, "My Spongebob teeth look hella fine on me. Who cares what anyone else says. No one else can pull that off better than me. \*smiles"  You could even have been the better person and thanked them for the compliment. I think Spongebob's teeth are actually cute tbh. He takes extra attention and care of them and are usually, always pearly white. Spongebob isn't Spongebob without those nice teethes of his. You really shouldn't let things like that get to your head unless you truly believe them to be. \n\nI know that there are times even when it's hard and I can't take those things in well or it doesn't sit well with me. But I try not to let it get me down and bother me. I don't want those things to weigh me or drag me down in any negativity form long term. Don't give in to the pain forever because you can be so much better than that. Those things do not define who I am. I know what I am. Sometimes, I ponder and try to see the meaning behind said things. Why did they say those things to me? What do I need to improve on if I do see where they are coming from? What could I do differently to overcome this? Does this person even know or are aware of what they're saying? If they just want to make themselves feel better, ignore them if you can. But if they criticize you and want to help support you by telling you what things to improve on, you can take that as someone who is trying to help you better yourself in a good way, not that they want to look down on you or anything like that.  Sometimes I just need a little time or space to make me alright again. Even a quiet, comforting hug will do or talking to someone about it can help ease the burdening weight. A person once told me not to take things too personally to heart and I'm still learning ways to take what that caring person said, to heart. It really boils down to how you take it in. These things are inevitable and just takes some time and how you go about treating the conflicting issue. \n\nI hope that this will make you feel better, can be an eye opener for you and possibly help you in some ways. =) 
3	Looking for some good playlists	I usually listen to soundcloud and youtube but not spotify.\n\nThese are some of the playlists I listen to. All of my music in the soundcloud list is in my likes.\n\n[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOEvyC6mknLZH_0n9AU8ulpzm1-QI7yXX)\n\n[Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/user-804042698)
2	That's my playlist:\nhttps://open.spotify.com/user/22oh6llruwbby57xcdhotmkfy/playlist/6CCHaZ0exmugd7ooUpaRty?si=3JqJ1xGxQoicCuEnLhoEGw\nI like it,dunno if you're gonna enjoy it but it doesn't hurt to try
2	My playlists are mostly indie but feel free to explore https://open.spotify.com/user/emacietti?si=lsvSXZSkRvSBEQJZWweRzg
11	ISFPs, how do I deal with this situation?	Okay, so I’m an INTP female seeing an ISFP male. \n\nI don’t really know where to start, so I’ll start with saying that I really like him - like, a lot. I’ve been getting to know him for the past 7/8 months, and it’s not much that we meet. During those 7/8 months, things have been very up and down - despite not seeing each other more than twice a week (if lucky).\n\nHe’s hard to get to know, but I am willing to take all the time in the world. He’s had a tough past with his mum and his ex, and I know that it still plays a big part in how he is now. \n\nThe dynamic between us is romantic and sweet, however I found out that a few days ago, his grandmother passed away. I messaged him as soon as I found out, sharing my condolences and told him that I’m here for him. He replied saying “thank you means so much x” and that’s it.\n\nI know he wants space, but I really and genuinely want to be there for him. I miss and and love him.\n\nSo, ISFPs, how do I go about being there for him and showing him that I’m there for him, without him feeling like I’m too ‘needy’?
13	Please go anyways and be there for him. We tend to push people away when we need it the most.
6	Be there, but don't push your support on him.
6	Turn up with some food like chocolates. He’ll invite you in if he wants company if not you’ve made a nice gesture. 
5	My fiancé is an intp, and I’m an isfp. I can go ahead and tell you that our personalities make for a great relationship! For me, so much of my emotions deal with my senses. \n\nYou could message him saying that you understand if he wants space, but if he wanted to get out of the house, then you all could go for a walk through the park. I think it’s a good idea to offer your presence, but be okay if he chooses space. \n\nI have issues dealing with stress. It’s nice to have someone there, but I don’t like anything to feel forced. \n\nI hope everything works out for the very best!!! 
7	made a playlist while i was tired	and i mean tired tired. been awake for 20 hours straight. why? don't ask.\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwripFCiEgkz6DRbv7wtAEP1h8MtW5I1S
2	Why were you awake for 20 hours straight? Sleep is important my guy
2	Does anyone else here like ESFJs?	Asking from fellow ISFPs. In my opinion they would be the perfect partner for us to have carefree fun/do creative endeavours with and have a close friendship with. They're stable, supportive, loyal and caring. I've had a long close friendship with an ESFJ (I still keep in touch with her sometimes) and it was amazing. Also, Si generally seems like a somewhat misunderstood function to me. What are your thoughts on/experiences with ESFJs?\n\nedit: on a side note, types that I've felt most energized hanging around with were ESFJs and ISTPs.
3	Yeahp, they are really fun and easy to be around.\n\nBut i have no clue on how NE child works. Or sort of how to use it to my favor. Is it simple as just saying you like them or saying what you want? 
2	All of the ESFJs that I've had experience with are very set in their ways, which isn't a problem, until they talked down on the way that I view things. I love being around them in short bursts though!
1	I loooove ESFJs, from a slight distance. When they’re really close to me, they can make me a tad crazy, especially because a lot of ESFJs I’ve met (not all!) have really strings ideas of social norms that everyone needs to follow, and they’ll kind of be passive aggressive in their judgement towards people who don’t fit social norms. Overall they’re usually very sweet, and they tend to kind of take care of me, which is nice since I’m usually the one taking care of all of my friends. Also, they’re way better at time management and help me keep my sh*t together:). I think in general, I love ExFxs, but of the ExFxs, ESFJs are probably my least favorite.
1	My long term girlfriend is an ESFJ and we get along really well. She is really affectionate and loyal, yet gives me my own space when I need it. We get along better than any of my previous girlfriends, who have generally been introverts.  She also is great at helping me get my shit together when it comes to planning, organizing and cleaning. 
1	No.
5	which piece of technology do you find yourself using the most?	smartphone here 👋
6	Smartphone
5	woven clothes.\n\ni know, i know, I'm sorry! 
2	PC and tablet.
2	Anyway, Smartphone 
2	Any technology I can use to play The Sims (4)
1	Computer 
1	Smartphone and Switch!
1	Fortnite
6	ISFPs, if you're interested in something do you stop everything to learn it?	Right now my interest in mbti is through the roof such that I'm spending my entire sunday. I haven't eaten lunch or showered/brushed my teeth and it remains doubtful whether I will at all today or in the next few days. I'm in the zone. I'm learning about each type and creating grids in my notebook.. it's almost how I get when I'm working on art, but it's like.. informational art. Is this a typical ISFP experience of learning stuff? But it makes me wonder where learning has its place in the functions? Te inferior?\n\nFull disclosure, I am learning this stuff because I don't want to be blindsided by my trickster Ne ever again, esp with just not bothering to learn and predict other people's intentions. I am motivated to be able to learn to type people and understand how to make them comfortable and avoid ppl with nefarious intentions, my biggest struggle in life being relationships.
10	Please remember to brush your teeth dude. You only get one set of 'em. Gotta take care of them.
3	I remember a time when I spent like 14hrs creating a race track for some racing game. 
2	I think you’ll find it’s normal for ISFP’s, I do exactly the same thing when I really get into something new and I’ll make entire spreadsheets and constantly talk about it, I’ve even been known to cancel plans to continue working on it, for me it’s like a sense of satisfaction. 
1	Whenever I am creating art or grinding for some rare armor/weapon in a game, you bet your ass the only thing I'm gonna be doing is leaving my seat for bathroom breaks only. 
1	Yeah I did the same. Was obsessed with it for over a year. Then I realized my reason for learning it was not really to learn it but rather to use it understand myself better/explain myself. Sounds like you've identified a similar reason helping you improve relationships. \n\nSo yeah I think Te plays a role, especially in the charts you're drawing in your notebook, lol. And our being ok with putting people into 16 boxes. But it's probably mostly Fi feeding the obsession.
1	sometimes I focus on one thing for hours until it's done, other times I'll go back and forth on a project for days, maybe even months, adding a few things here and there. 
12	ISFP gamers! What types of video games do you enjoy playing?	I personally like RPG and strategy games.
5	Minecraft! I also really loved Portal. 
5	bioshock series, life is strange, stardew valley, borderlands 2 if i’m playing with my friends, runescape bc i still live in 2007 (even tho i play rs3...)\n\ni have a lot more on my “to play” list. like a LOT more. but not much time to play them rn 
3	Fighting games, platformers, some fps games
3	Sims, Minecraft, ark, house flipper, audio surf 2, Mario kart, ssx, zoo tycoon, animal crossing, 
2	I really like RPG too. BioWare games and Kingdom Hearts are my favorite 
2	Same as you 😊
2	I can't stop going back to the Dragon Age series recently. I really loved Origins and Inquistion. I also love Persona and Final Fantasy games. I guess I'm an rpg fan. \n\nAs for online games, I've been playing LoL, Overwatch, and Maplestory. \n
2	Don’t play much anymore but I used to love WoW, I was the best guild master ever. Lately I’ve been working on finishing fallout 3 😂
2	The games I love the most are games which have a fantastic set of characters; they’re really what I remember the most from a game rather than the story or gameplay. Games like the Mass Effect series and Chrono Trigger have a special place in my heart for this very reason.
2	Ive been playing Dota for like 13 years. Had a brief LoL stint. Then there is alot. Played WoW, diablo 2, dungeon seige, serious sam, bioshock, Deus ex, witcher 2&3, portal, half life, CoD, battle feild, borderlands 2, need for speed, age of empires, C&C generals, warcraft 3, assassin's Creed 2-4, lotr battle for middle earth. There are a lot more. \n\nSoo I enjoy playing games. Any rpg with a decent story, and shooters and driving games for stress relief. But I mainly just play Dota 2 now. I do enjoy playing with a friend more than playing alone. 
2	JRPG (Dragon Quest, Xenogears, Final Fantasy, Disgaea, etc), Metroidvania (Mega Man Zero and ZX, Castlevania, etc), Hack n Slash (God of War, Metal Gear Rising, Dead Rising) and pretty much anything with an anime aesthetic like Danganronpa and other VNs.
2	I enjoyed playing God of War series as well as marvel vs capcom. Also liked dota, red alert 2, Diablo 3. 
2	I usually only play RPGs like Skyrim, Witcher or RDR2, with a dash of FPS every once in a while. I also really like JRPGS
2	Any RPG where my decisions in the game actually have an effect on what happens, and its not just a different route to the same ending.
2	I only play Stardew Valley so idk if that makes me a gamer but my 400+ hours on there speaks for itself.
1	Fighting games and games with alot of exploration. I find street fighter and melee lots of fun and I love to endlessly explore in tloz breath of the wild
1	I can enjoy almost any kind of genre but my enthusiasm doesn't always last so long. My favorite series tend to be action rpgs like Skyrim or the Witcher, sandboxes like GTA and rdr, or sports/simulation type games 
1	female vocals playlist	https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwripFCiEgkyXy5LHzC4XdCNiJoPIoVE-
19	as an adult male ISFP, this is how my desktop looks like.	
6	Me gusta, aesthetic and minimalistic 
1	My desktop only has like 4 icons of games I never play bc Steam auto-added them. It's only clean bc I don't use my desktop, though; home directory and Documents are a shitstorm where some folders may be generic dumping zones while others may be nested down so far and precisely that there's only like 1 file per subfolder, and there's little logic or reason to which extreme of specificity any given directory may have.
7	Do you find it hard to open up to people?	I find it extremely hard, I have lots of friends and people I’m cool with however there’s only like 2 or 3 people I’m my true self with. Is this bad? How do you open up to people?
2	yes, I don't open up to people right away- usually takes a while. I used to be very shy and didn't even mess around or joke with people I didn't know, but now I try to joke with everyone a little bit if I can.
1	I don't think theres anything wrong with that. You don't have to open up to anyone. The way I look at it. Its really hard to hurt my feelings because I don't open up to people unless I know damn well they aren't gonna hurt me. I'm by no means fragile, but inviting people I don't know to well to get to know me sounds like a bad idea. You're just protecting yourself.\n\nI likewise only have 3 or 4 people who I let get to know me. Frankly thats only because they stuck around for long enough. I guess whatever charm my ISFP profile puts off kept them around. Real glad it did too.
1	Lol yeah, I don’t open up easily at all. I have a lot of friends, but we tend to talk about superficial things. I only have like 2 friends in the entire universe I’ll actually talk to about personal things.
3	this playlist is dedicated to my best friend, jimmy	he was the one who got me into anime and he introduced me to different music styles that i haven't heard of before. i combined all the songs together that hold the most significance to me.🖤\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwripFCiEgkx_TUZ914hQ0lTn1p8CvB35
1	it even has the funny chinese rap song that he would play. i remember when he jumped onto my skype call when my league crew were in a game and blasted it at max volume. it was hilarious.
7	People say that I'm boring cause I'm too nice	I mean what a great insult haha. Any other isfps get similar comments? 
7	Whoever has the gall to say something that negative to you isn’t someone you should listen to at all. Healthy, happy people don’t feel the need to put others down. I’m sure you are plenty interesting and being nice is not a bad thing at all. 
4	To answer your question, I haven’t ever been told I’m too nice, but I’ve had people criticize plenty of other things about me and wish I were more *this* or more *that*. I think our type can frustrate people because of all of our potential we hold, and all of our talents and deep thoughts we have. People see these great things and tend to want to suggest ways for you to use them best. But it’s usually not even wanted advice (our type could give fuck all what someone else thinks we should do) and can come off as rude and annoying. 
1	Hes jealous
1	Gotta love insults disguised as shitty compliments. People have told me they think its a waste that I use my enormous brain to devise genius ways to get away with being so fucking lazy and worthless.
1	Their loss bro. Negative people will always find something to give something a hard time about, even if it doesn't really even make any sense.
1	I used to get this all the time when I was younger. My advice is to work on your individuality and authenticity, but also work on developing your confidence through self development books. \n\nAfter growing and developing my "self" I stopped getting "boring" and started getting comment like "real", "down to earth" sometimes even intense (I give full attention to the person I'm with)
4	Survey on personality and Flirting behaviors	Hey I am a doctoral Student at a University in the South. I am studying flirtation behaviors, specifically trying to catalog specific flirting behaviors taken from several experimental studies. I was wondering if I could post to this community as it seems relevant to my topic. Thank you in advance for taking the time to take the survey there is an opportunity to win a gift card if the entire survey is completed. You can back out at any time.\n\nHere is the link to the survey\n\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JMQP5PJ
4	I feel like whoever designed this quiz doesn’t flirt a lot. For example, there were some weird suggestions on there concerning “flirtatious behavior” (like touching someone’s neck or sucking them off...) but obvious ones like “biting your lip”  and “playing coy” were never mentioned.\nSimilarly with the emojis. Never in my history of dating did I send someone a *scared barfing emoji* or 95% of the others shown...but the ones I always used, like 💕😍❤️👄💋💅🏼🥰 👠 weren’t listed as options?

5	made another playlist yet again	https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwripFCiEgkzS71DhVJWTHRuoi_J2og9D\n\nI like my playlists having a total of 15 songs for some reason.

1	Deep pottery
16	Does anyone else find INTJs friendlier than ISTJs, generally speaking?	For some reason I find that most ISTJs appear rather grumpy and distant, and I often get the impression that I'm constantly being judged. Don't have this at all with INTJs.
8	That’s because you share all the same functions as INTJ, just in a different order.\n\nINFP would probably find ISTJs more approachable than INTJ, for example.
5	Nah, I wouldn’t say so.\n\nEdit: I’m intj\n\nEdit: married to an isfp
5	So my husband is an intj and my mil is an istj. I get along with both. I feel like with istj is that they are very black and white on things. With intj I feel like there is lots a room for the grey area. You can reason and talk about your views. I feel like with istj they already know what they think and it’s very hard to change it. Which might make them look grumpy. 
3	I get along super well with INTJ's. So, yeah. 
3	Totally agree.
18	How do you show affection for others?	I’m not very openly affectionate. I’ve learned as I’ve gotten older to make myself say “I love you” occasionally and give compliments to my friends often so they know I don’t hate them. But I’ve noticed that, in general, I tend to make fun of the people I truly care about. Not “you’re ugly” kind of making fun, but more like copying someone’s voice if they say something weird or teasing them about something.\n\nAnyways, I’ve always kind of pushed people away a lot, and it JUST occurred to me that when I’m “teasing” my friends, they might not be interpreting it the way I intend. I usually bond with others over humor, and NEVER being up things I know people are insecure about or make fun of impressions or accents or whatever. But I’m worried others might think I’m picking at them just to pick at them (and not because I love them lol) and get irritated with me. \n\nI’m just curious, is there anything strange you guys do to show that you care about the people in your life, or are you pretty straightforward with your affection?
5	Im the same as you. I think teasing is just an easier way to talk to people when we are not too close with a certain person, but care about them. Its like a way to mask my own insecurity of getting rejected I think.  Usually, once the other person shows the same signs of caring or wanting to know each other better, then I'll reciprocate by being more serious. 
4	This is heaps relatable to me -- I'm also very teasing with people I love, as long as I can tell they'll know that I'm just teasing. With my friends, it's pretty much just that on top of doing stuff for them that shows I care about them, like giving them rides when they need it or helping them clean their kitchen or something. 
3	If I'm really close (like basically just my little family, 2 kids and husband), then it's easy for me.  I'm always showing love, affection and praise.    It's harder with other friends and family that are outside of my protected little family bubble.  I guess I just feel the safest here at home, it's hard to be vulnerable with other people. 
3	If I am close to someone I show it through availability and reliability more than anything else. If you're looking for company I am only a phone call away. I'll be there to save the day. Superman has got nothing on me.
1	We roast each other in my family to show love. My best friend is very affection and gives lots of praise and love, this was hard for me to adapt to and I am uncomfortable a lot of the times giving or receiving affection from her. We’ve been friends for 3+ years and she’s hugged me like 3? Times? I’m not here for it. But she’s super picky and I used to roast/tease her for it all the time until she told me it really hurt her feelings. Love languages are hard. 
14	Thoughts on a ISFJ (25F) and ISFP (34M) relationship?	I’ve been dating this wonderful ISFP for about four months now and I’ve really fallen for him. His sensuality and laid back nature is unmatched by anyone else I’ve ever been with. I feel like I fall into such a relaxed trance when I’m with him, forgetting about all my worries and anxieties. As someone who is constantly overthinking everything, this is an *amazing* feeling. \n\nWondering if anyone has opinions on this matching? I feel like we are great for each other and excellent compliments. Often times I have to drag out of him the things he likes about me and us. He would much rather communicate those things using his eyes or body (which he does so well), but I love to hear words every now and again. We both have very busy schedules right now and he makes a consistent effort to come spend time with me, which I really appreciate.\n\nWhat do you all think about ISFJs? What do you like and dislike? 
2	I'm a 27 year old male ISFP with a 53 year old ISFJ dad. He is a good dad, very stoic though and old fashioned, he believes in traditions and history and the-way-things-are-done, which I absolutely hate.\n\nThe things I like about him are the groundedness and stability. I respect the way he puts family before himself and has a strong relation with the community. This is something I could never expect that from myself. I don't operate this way.\n\nISFP and ISFJ are polar opposites, our priorities are very very different (cognitively). Every function that one has, the other has as shadow functions. In my opinion, there would be a lot of arguments and disagreements, but if there is equal levels of respect (typically ISFJs would find it difficult to respect ISFPs, but also vice versa) then it would be a lot to learn from each other, and you could cover each others weaknesses
2	Ive been with an isfj female and Im isfp so heres my point of view. In general, it was hard for both of us to open up and communicate freely about our feelings because she needed affirmation, but I did too. We Isfp's also tend to overthink everything and worry. The best solution I see is to make him naturally express more by showing more expression from yourself. He wont do anything out of his comfort zone if he doesnt see it being necessary. Right now he probably is not completely comfortable with expressing everything but itll probably come sooner or later in the future. If you want to step it up though, I would give him affirmation so you could naturally get a response from him.
1	If that relaxed feeling fades what do you have? Honest question\n\nHe might still be the same guy but you have more worries now and he can't keep up so then you have nothing to fall back on\n\nIt's great you feel this way but you have to plan for more otherwise it could fade.\n \nPeople, like with food, get caught up in the taste and how it feels but what happens after we eat that whole pizza? Nothing but an empty wallet and diabetes\n\nTldr Sounds like a good guy, don't just connect in one area
1	This is the same as my gf (ISFJ) and I (ISFP). I'l try to give you my perspective. \n\nWe fell for each other hard as well, since when we first started dating our lives matched up so well. She's known both by her family members and friends as the "anxious" one, but when she's around me she's very lovey-dovey and relaxed. I do make a consistent effort to be with her, and I think the time we spend together is how we tell each other we love each other. I don't tell her often enough how much I like to be around her, which frustrates her sometimes and it seems like you dislike it too lol. Just figure that if I'm hanging around, I'm having a good time. \nIn my opinion, I think that there's enough give and take between our personality types to keep the relationship fresh and consistently good. What I have found is the key is expressing how and why we feel a certain way (ASAP) to each other to avoid confrontation
7	What makes you happy? :)

6	My dogs \n
6	Everything. I'm easy to make happy
4	(INFP) My family, my home, videos on youtube, food, music
3	Freedom
2	Good anime and games, quality time with friends and family and good food.
2	spending time with good friends, also drawing/painting and exercise
2	That tiny little squeaking sound you get when you rub two pickles together.
24	[Meta] Suggestion: Tell your age when asking a question	I see a lot of posts that I'd like to offer my 2 cents on, but can't quite estimate what stage of life OP is in. Because you don't want to give a 17 year old the same advice you'd give to a 25 year old. I think this would be a very productive new rule. Asking for advice on the internet isn't as straightforward as people think. I truly appreciate seeking advice from people who view the world from a very similar lens, but without some details about the person's specific situation, I think those posts can not foster a healthy and productive discussion where we can all learn from each other.\n\nWhat do you guys think?
4	Yhh that's a great idea
4	Best idea everrrrr
2	Totally agree with this! 
2	Why wouldn't you give a 17 year old and 25 year old the same advice? In many cases they probably could both apply the same advice, depending on the situation. I think people make too many assumptions about others based on age alone, so I don't normally tell people my age unless it's relevant, which it usually isn't. People don't always neatly fit into "life stages" boxes. It also greatly depends on which country they live in. 
1	You are a genius.
18	Do you get annoyed when people act fake?	Personally this is one of the things that pisses me off the most. 
11	Yup. 
5	Yes. Yes yes yes yes. 
3	One of my biggest pet peeve. 
3	Omg yes I hate it so much
3	It’s the worst 
2	Few things piss me off more.
2	Yes!!!
2	well as Fi doms we value authenticity so yes most of us hate it
1	Does this include fake smiles?  Like, maybe I just don't want to be somewhere that I have to be.  If yes, then I'm a total hypocrite.
1	Who doesn't?  
1	Yeppp. Especially when people are very clearly try to portray a *certain* image 🤢.
1	Yes! My absolute pet peeve! 
7	How do you ISFPs guys approach a girl? Girls help me out too	Any tips or advice for me if I ever wanna talk to a girl but I'm too shy or don't know what to say. 
5	Hey brutha, just don't take rejection too seriously. Im much of a pussy myself too and I know its hard, but thats just who we are. We just gotta fight our fears. We gotta beat it one by one and eventually itll be easier. Practice makes perfect, ya know? Get rejected instead of missing your chance. Youll regret missing your chances more. Good luck to you brutha
3	For me, what's helped me a lot is realizing all girls, regardless of attractiveness, are just humans. Any female you idealize/fantasize have a bunch of cons and negatives to them you can't see. Just because they've made their face and hair, put their best cute self in public, doesn't mean they are the right girl for you. There's lots of crazy, boring, incompatible girls out there. The more girls you talk to, you will become more selective and relax when you approach girls. 
2	I'm really passive and usually just wait for them to show some interest in me before I ask them out or whatever. I'm not hugely successful since most women won't approach men, but that's just how it is. Sometimes i'm a little more proactive and will go up and talk to them first, but that can be hard depending on what setting you're in\n\nThe girl I like now has talked to me a little bit, next time I see her I'll probably just ask her a question about something and see how it goes from there. \n\nI definitely agree with the poster below - just think of them as regular people, because that's what they are. 
6	If you could have one thing that you wear all the time, what would it be?	
6	Definitely my glasses.
4	We wouldn't want that. Variety is the spice of life.
3	A watch. More people should wear them. They look good. If you get a nice one anyway. Those crappy $20 dollars watch you can get at a supermarket look trashy.
3	A great boiler suit, it’s my current sewing goal.
2	Socks, I don't like seeing of showing feet
2	My bomber jacket. Looks cool, many pockets, comfortable. 
2	I only own 2 identical pairs of pants so I actually do wear the same thing all the time.
2	Nicely fitting jeans.
1	my white tshirt 
1	I’ve always been intrigued by the idea of having a personal uniform, like Steve Jobs. I love aesthetics and design, but I feel like choosing clothes in the morning is such a hassle. I would wear my navy blue San Francisco sweat shirt (that fits perfectly) everyday. I already wear skinny jeans, vans, and dark gray or black nail polish (almost!) every day. I like to dress *nicely*, I.e. stuff needs to fit well and suit my style, but overall, I don’t care much, and tend to put more effort into my hair/makeup.
1	Tanktops ! 
10	Am I ISFP if I’m okay with tradition and commitment?	I’m trying to work out my personality type and I’ve gone through my cognitive functions and stuff and I’m pretty sure I’m an ISFP. It seems to fit pretty well except for two things: tradition and commitment. I’m okay with things being progressive however, as a Catholic, I value tradition as well. I also kind of like structures since they help me be more productive when I would otherwise waste my time (like school schedules). I also really value commitment, especially in relationships. Are these breaking points for being an ISFP?\n\nEDIT: I also get “vibes” from people. I don’t put TOO much stock in them, but I get them nonetheless. Ahh this is so complicated to figure out!
6	I believe you think of the types too much as stereotypes. Yes, it is okay to be an ISFP and value commitment and tradition, but not merely because ISFPs tend to be loyal and value their friendships highly, but because this is what most of humans do. Even as an introvert you still need good people around you to give you energy.\nAnd when it comes to tradition, I think everyone who can understand the value of it can respect it, regardless of their type.
5	It's ok to not fit your type's description %100. But if %80 of it sounds like someone secretly has been listening to your mind for your entire life, then you know that's the one. /u/ravetildawn said it right, we're actually very committed people, but we're just very picky with what we chose to commit to. \n\nAs far as traditions, I think there's a part of us that can chose to go upstream and completely against a trend/tradition/standard when we can't get un board with it. And we rebel in our own style, doing it differently, as the inner artists of lifestyle comes out.
11	         Okay, when it comes to commitment: ISFP’s are really loyal, and expect the same from others. I find I take my relationships (family, good friend, or romantic) seriously but, only when I see them as a potential to be serious part of my life. When I have those friends from class/work, that I never see outside of there, I could care less about them.  \n         \n         As for the traditional part, I’m not sure how to quite answer that. I can say that I do follow certain traditions, that I like to keep mostly because they’re ones my family has, not me personally. \n\n       I hope this helps at least a little! (: 
7	what about you do others find annoying?	when I'm with friends and in the moment, I tend to be a bit oblivious to my own annoying tendencies. it's not until I look back at what occurred and I realize, "oh I guess I came off as petty/self-centered/annoying/etc"\n\nfor example, I experience fomo a lot and get salty being left out of social situations, most of which are usually pretty trivial. but I tend to blow up my hurt feelings and I feel like it annoys the people around me when I keep making pointed and hurt comments because of it. another example is when I get so excited talking about myself and my own experiences that I probably make it hard for others to chime in into the conversation. or when people interject and the topic changes I'll steer it back to continue talking where I left off.\n\nself-reflection is pretty important to me but no matter how aware of my faults I am, sometimes I get too excited and still commit these above tendencies. pretty frustrating. \n\nwhat are some of tendencies that other people might find annoying? how did you overcome them? or how are you working to overcome them? 
4	Same way although I would say it has gotten better\n\nI try and talk less but say more meaningful things and realize I will always and everyone will always have fomo, it's just life\n\nGood supportive friends help 2
3	An ISFP perceiving things as they want them to be. My mother is an ISFP, and while she does mean well(seriously), she comes to believe things that never happened and are not true. She'll sit on things for a long time, somehow come to a conviction about something, and then- that's it... that's it- it's done....... decision made. At times, I would know exactly how she's feeling as after 2 decades I picked up some patterns, and when she doesn't respond to others than clearly she's upset.... but should I ask about it I know it'll give her reason to just let it out all and tell others that other people are wrong and not her(Not all the time, she would have -I felt- genuine concerns at times.) The victimization of ISFPs is very, very annoying, because their loved ones might have no idea what's even the problem should they happen to not see the ISFP for a couple days or so.\n\nAnd should she finally build up the courage to disrupt the flow of things, then she expects everyone to fall in line as it took a lot to come bother people with her problems, and that she only held back out of kindness and consideration for others...... No. Time taken out of consideration for others does not make one right. And then should anyone offer another opinion on the perspective, even my grandparents, than she reverts to a couple versions of "I can't even." Some of the things she'll say: "That's just your opinion" "Well, that's just my opinion" "It was a miscommunication(not admittance of fault, which would make the other person feel better)"... or at times she just CANNOT be in that room any longer if anyone slightly tells her No on certain days and on certain issues, and then the rest of us are like, "?????" Literally, it's a very common IFP thing to believe that the feelings are just SO CLEAR- they are not. Also, her feelings change literally every day and the rest of us don't do that, and if not for my understanding of the system and watching a David Bowie(ISFP) interview than it's likely I wouldn't bother to tell you these things. I understand that Fi will never be Fe, but it's annoying that she would never take fault through that self-righteous value system.... but if she never takes fault, why would anybody else around her?\n\nShe has an ENFJ best friend, and my mom doesn't know about MBTI(not without trying on my part though), but so often I found myself biting my tongue to not just tell her that she ought to just talk to the only person who seems to care about her(since apparently her children might as well be watching her drown to the beat of slow jazz)- the ENFJ. It's annoying that when she doesn't feel that her emotions are heard she forces them onto others instead of getting over her initial fears of confrontation; which would solve everything(at least in our family.) It's one thing to want to be left alone, to be respected, and to have one's feelings heard.... but it's an entirely other thing to force those values onto others. If you involve others then expect backlash as one knows an ISFP, at least this one, would do the exact same. Being apart of the problem will never be a solution.\n\nMany times my mother would burst out into tears when she pulls a lot of this stuff, and do you know the worst part about it all? I believe her. It hurt me, a lot. It's annoying that by an ISFP's self-righteousness that they don't realize that people actually do care about them, but that they have lives to live as well. I'm currently on the outs with my mother, have been for a little over a year now, and when my sister gets old enough she likely will be as well as she funnels deeper and deeper into her feelings. \n\nI do hope you can relate to something in this seemingly over-dramatized backstory of mine, and I wish you well in your quest for self-growth. I would not want to see an ISFP, or anyone else, reach such a point with their loved ones. \n\n&#x200B;
2	Relationship advice	Gimme any tips and advice on relationships please, have a nice day 
6	1. communication
3	Give each other some space, make time for your friends and activities that you enjoy outside the relationship. \n\nBe respectful of each others opinion and ideas because you may not always be on equal terms about everything. \n\nBe comfortable being who you are in the relationship because that will make you both happy. \n\nIf you feel something is making you feel a certain way, be calm, open and honest with each other and find some time to discuss it. \n\nAlso, to get what you want in the relationship, you should learn to give it first. Give more of what you want to receive. If you want him/her to understand you, you have to start by understanding them. If you want them to respect you, you have to start by respecting them. If you want them to show you more love, you should show and give them love. This can benefit in any sort of relationship really. 
11	Life's tough. Like, tough tough.	It feels like everything I do is just a distraction from the painful truth that life is pain. How the hell are monks able to meditate for literally hours on end? I stopped my addictions which were video games and anime, but without them I feel so alone.\n\nThis feeling of being alone is torture. It's so boring. Time is just passing me by while I achieve nothing. What is there to achieve? If I work hard and make decent money, I still won't be able to have a beautiful wife/girlfriend. I'm unattractive. \n\nI have been coping throughout my whole life. I looked up to Bruce Lee and Rey Mysterio because they were short like me. It made me feel better about myself. \n\nI pretend that I don't need women, but it's just a form of coping. "I save a lot of money from not going on dates anyway", "I can use my energy for better things", "I won't have to pay for child support when the divorce happens", "I won't have to worry about being cheated on", etc.\n\nI just want to live like I did when I was a child. Have fun and lose track of time. Days passing by so fast, but at the same time slowly. Days are passing by fast for me now, but I wish I could enjoy them more. I feel like I'm just rotting away slowly. \n\nI don't know where I'm going with this. If you can relate, then I'm sorry that you have to go through these kinds of things. It's rough. Life is like a game, but you don't get to choose the difficulty like in Kingdom Hearts. \n\nI won't give up though. I know what it is like to be at the very bottom of the hole. So depressed that you think of a plan to end it all. There was a post here that said "figure it out." I relate to that quote very much so. My goal in life is to figure it out. There is always a way out!!\n\n
11	My big tip. Get yourself 3 hobbies:\n1. To keep you fit\n2. To make you money\n3. For creative purposes\n\nYes you can have a hobby which has all 3 aspects e.g. Gardening.\nHowever at first it may be hard and you may not like the hobbies so keep changing it up till you find ones you like.\nYou may not like some at first because your not instantly good at them but remember nothing comes instantly.\nPeople (I'm one of them) easily give up nowadays and don't have proper hobbies since it's very easy to get easy dopamine from YouTube, anime, videa games etc however if you have proper hobbies with proper goals and see yourself progress it will keep you busy and happy. Hope this helps. 
3	That figure it out post was mine. Its how I live. No matter how down I get I always think those three words. The closest to hitting rock bottom I ever came was when I considered breaking my leg to get out of a deployment. Went so far as to ask a friend to do it for me. I really only asked because I knew I needed someone to talk some sense into me. Thankfully he talked me out of it. Granted. I chose someone I knew damn well wasn't gonna hurt me.\n\nReaching out for help is fine. Don't ever let yourself think that needing help makes you weak. We all need help. I'm sure Rey Mysterio and Bruce Lee needed help at some point too. I know when we find ourselves in holes it always seems easier to find a shovel than a ladder, but there is always a ladder. Sometimes you gotta dig it up though unfortunately. Find that ladder. Figure it out.\n\nAlso. Brother to brother. You probably aren't as ugly as you think you are. No homo. The human mind is significantly more critical of itself when looking in a mirror. Someone told me that a while back and it made me feel a bit better about myself.
2	(INFP) Stay strong, friend. Hopefully it'll all seem better soon.
2	Don't suppress your feelings. I know it can be painful so it's helpful sometimes to rationalize away, but from personal experience I know that connecting with your reality - the painful and the ugly - can tell you where you need to go next. Have you sought any outside help from therapy/friends/family etc. ?
2	I can completely understand where you are coming from. \n\nLast year I went through one of the most awful head spaces I have ever been in. My 2 best friends got together and shut me out, before hand we were spending every day together and then over night I was lucky to get a text response, that and with not feeling like I was progressing at work I literally felt like I deserved it, that I wasn’t liked and that I had no hope for a future. At one point I rewrote the lyrics of songs that I knew and was listening to at the time and these all references feeling alone and ending my life, I even went as far to try and quit my job on the spot so that I could go and kill my self, luckily my work wouldn’t let me and got me in contact with a councillor, I started taking depression tablets and I started seeing a therapist once a week. It took time, I remember one morning on my way to work after I moved homes as my previous one wasn’t habitable thinking, ‘I don’t want to think like this, people still need me and I actually don’t want to die, there trying to help me dig myself out of a whole’ and automatically from that day, I haven’t looked back. \n\nFast forward 6 months I don’t even have to tell myself this anymore as people always come to me! I’m no longer taking medication and I’m not seeing the therapist. I’ve made new friends and those friends I spoke about earlier have come back into my life, but I’m cautious around them now and won’t let them get too close again. I’m not saying it’s easy, but one thing we have is understanding of others and the equality that goes with it, something that I now apply to myself. One thing I think a lot of people forget. \n\nI’m sure you will get there! And I’m hoping that this may help even a tiny bit. 
2	I feel like life is often a never-ending stream of suffering and struggle. But the good things here and there mean too much to me to give up. Instead I try to look at the struggle as a way for me to get stronger.\n\nI agree with the guy who said to get three hobbies. I've recently (last six months or so) made a serious effort to get back into productive hobbies I used to enjoy and also get in shape. It has really helped.\n\nAs far as being lonely goes and thinking you're too unattractive to get a girlfriend, don't let your looks hold you back too much. Take care of yourself and try to dress well and you'd be surprised. I know I don't generally care too much about what people look like. If I like someone's personality and we have fun talking or gaming together or whatever it is we do, I will start to see things about them that I like, I.E. their eyes or their hands or their hair color. Not even that I have preferences for any of those things either it's just what I do. And I have talked to others who feel the same. \n\nMeanwhile everyone tells me I look great and I get random men hitting on me even IRL but no one I feel connected to is interested in a relationship it seems. But I've only been single the last year and a half so I figure there's lots of time for me to meet someone to be with who actually wants to be with me.\n\nAnd I bet there's lots of time for you, too! :)
27	nothing beats sleep	the silence and peace. the feeling of drifting off. no having to worry or think about anything. so relaxing.\n\nnothing to me beats sleep. 
7	sex would probably be tied. or maybe even better. who knows.
6	I used to hate sleeping. I've learned to accept it as my condition gets severely worse if I go too long without sleep. I've done about 10 days without sleep before, although that could be wrong as you lose track of time after about 5 days.\n\n 
6	It's incredible how much do I feel identified with all of your posts guys. god damn it this is like reading my diary.
2	God yes.
5	tell a secret	
13	im not actually okay
12	I don't eat the daily recommended amount of fruits and vegetables
5	I don't want to invite my classmates to my discord server cause there are some really crazy stuff there.
6	I'm not actually too sure if I'm an ISFP or not. And don't I really care if I'm wrong. I just need an "anchor" because I often feel like I don't know who I am or I feel like I don't relate to myself if that makes sense.\n\nOf course I obviously don't want some personality test to define me, Of course not. It's just nice to have SOMETHING to hold on to and feel fairly secure about. Even if that means I'm living a lie...
3	I just learned I'm actually intp.
3	I’m sad
3	I never got over it.
5	(INFP) - I've never been in love with anyone except for myself. I've never felt like I was on the same wavelength as someone else to get that far. 
2	i have a new boyfriend and i love him a lot but i can't fall asleep at his house cause i feel too anxious cause he's so cute, and i also get really gassy and i'm afraid i'll fart in my sleep :(
4	Check out my new (android) dating app for MBTI and Enneagram communities!	
5	What type is your Partners type?	What do you like and dislike about your relationship with them? 
5	My bf is an INFJ. I like that our relationship has been awesome and that he is sweet and understanding. We get along well and there's a lot of promise. We're both incredibly drawn towards each other. \n\nI dislike that sometimes we can have different communication styles and that there's 10 hours of difference between us, so we have a hard time finding a time to talk with each other (without either one having to compromise their schedule).
2	He’s an intj. ☺️
1	My partner is xNFP (thinking more I than E). I like that he talks to me a lot, we have the same sense of humor, he is down to go on adventures with me no matter how small and that we understand each other really well. \n\nI dislike that we can both be a little insecure about our relationship at times (thinking one person likes the other less, etc) but other than that I feel like we’re a good match
1	He’s an ENFP!
1	ENTJ\n\nLikes: Committed, sensual, reliable\n\n\n\nDislikes: TERRIBLE communicator lol 
8	hey isfp men! a question i have for you guyz.	do you act feminine sometimes, a lot of the time, all the time? if someone who didn't know me saw me hang around my friends, they would prob think i was a homosexual. i like to get super close to my guy friends. sometimes i will rest my head on their shoulder or hug them. i also like to send them cute messages and call them "bb", "babe". \n\ni'm not homosexual. i repeat, i am not a homosexual. and I don't have anything against homosexuals. can anyone else relate? is this normal behaviour for isfp men, or men in general? i see this type of behaviour in the sad chill community a lot. 
16	Can you repeat that one more time, maybe add a "no homo" in there too? Just to be safe.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSometimes. I think it has to do with us being childish and ability to freely to express our emotions. It's a running joke between my good friends that I'm in the deep deep caves of the closet. Even my gay friend's mother jokingly once said I'm gayer than his son... But I'm not homosexual. I repeat, I am not homosexual.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: No homo.
5	also, i would make an educated guess and guess that millennials and Gen Z are the most likely to show this type of behaviour, because the newer generations tend to be more accepting of people, are rebels and aren't very traditional. just mah two cents.
7	I'm bisexual. Most of the time I don't present myself as feminine. Sometimes I get in a mood to experiment with my appearance in a way that could be confusing to a lot of people with more traditional gender ideas. But that's like once a month maybe. 
5	I'm bisexual. I have a feeling a larger percentage of us are. \n\nThe fact that you had to declare that you have nothing against gay people AND stated "no homo" three times suggests to me that you might be bi too? Because you sound exactly like me before I accepted that I was bi, and people who are secure in their sexuality don't tend to speak that way.  It sounds like you're looking for reassurance that it's possible to be straight while presenting as a gay person. It's possible, but rare.  Although so is being 100% straight.\nJust something to think about. :)
3	lol I do it joking sometimes x) 
4	Yes, I'm totally straight, but do everything you described. Many people initially think I'm gay. I just get physical to show affection sometimes and act slightly feminine 
5	Maybe a little bit, I'm definitely very reserved but I think I give off a masculine vibe. I'm not super affectionate with my guy friends but sometimes I do joke around with them. I wouldn't say I'm completely straight, but I'm not attracted to guys enough to say I'm bi either\n\nI also like taking a submissive role with some women, so maybe that has something to do with it 
3	Yup. I've always been asked if I'm gay, and in relationships I generally prefer my gf to wear the pants. Once I really open up around people I have a lot of feminine interests and behaviors that I hide most of the time. 
2	Do you have a father figure? Or a close masculine influence in your life (brother other familty etc.)\n\nGet one if not and hit the gym, pretty much it. 
2	Well, I'm neither a dude nor an isfp, as it happens, but there are loooots of F dudes in the world and the younger ones in particular seem to have trouble expressing their love for each other, due to the ever limiting and inherently damaging societal norms.  If it's what I think it is, it comes out as a lot of over the top, surfacey pseudo-homosexual pretense.  \n\nWhat you're engaging in is not feminine.  It's healthy philia (Greek for friendship) love.
1	The exact opposite is true for me. I spent far too many years in the closet. Lets just say my parents were not supportive of such things. I adopted the straight persona so well that to this day gay men don't approach me. Unless you look like you need a hug all you're gonna get from me is a handshake or a pat on the back.
1	My friends normally guess that I am gay, I can be more feminine but I believe I’m a mix between that and masculine. I am very touchy with my guy friends and tend to have very feminine guy friends which are all straight funnily enough lol. But I choose who I am like this with as I’ve been hurt in the past, and only the guys I trust I will be like this with, 
1	Yes
4	What’s your relationship with your parents like?	And what types are they
5	My mom is an ESFJ. We definitely have our differences (she talks a LOT more than I do, and cares much more about social etiquette), but overall she is very sweet and probably the most selfless person I know. She *never* does anything for herself. She always lets us choose what we watch or what music we listen to or where we go for lunch. She constantly buys us small gifts, but feels guilty buying herself anything unless it’s on sale for really cheap (even though money isn’t much of an issue for us). \n\nMy dad is an ESTP. Our relationship is a little more complicated. I’m definitely more similar to him, especially when it comes to interests and sense of humor. But we’re opposites when it comes to morals/ beliefs, which can cause us to butt heads fairly often. He is also pretty self centered, and I’ve often gotten irked that he doesn’t try to help my mom with stuff around the house, even though they both work full time (I try to help her as much as I can because I don’t think it’s fair she should have to do everything). When I was younger, he would scream at me, swear at me, and insult me over small things if he had had a long day. About a year ago, he screamed at me that I didn’t “f——ing love” him because I apparently wasn’t excited enough when he had given me a necklace a few weeks prior. He also told me that I didn’t really love or care about anything other than myself, and that I’d probably never get married. I don’t think my dad is a bad guy, but he was raised in a very abusive household and really, *really* needs to feel liked by others, and gets his feelings hurt very easily, which usually results in him exploding. \n\nSo I’m definitely closer to my mom lol. My parents actually get along great though, because my mom likes feeling needed and like she has a purpose, and my dad doesn’t mind other people doing stuff for him lol. For the most part, though, I get along with my parents very well, and overall, we tend to have a lot less day-to-day drama than a lot of other families I’ve seen. 
3	Mom ( I N F J )  That's just a guess though\n\nHonestly don't talk to her much. Never really did. My relationship with her was much better before she had her stroke though. She really isn't the same woman she used to be. A lot less judgmental than she used to be though. I just sit quietly with her for a few hours each week. We know we love each other, but we hardly have a damn thing in common. Never did really. Neither of us are talkers either. I used to play Scrabble with her a lot, but her vision is so bad nowadays that she couldn't play if she wanted to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDad ( I S F P ) Like father like son\n\nIts been eleven months since he passed. I fucking miss him. We, likewise to my mother, shared no common interests, but had the best conversations. At some point I stopped trying to make him proud, and from then on its like I had a really old best friend. I used to visit home once a week and me and him would stay up until the sun came up talking about stuff. He was my best friend. Starting to cry so I'm gonna stop at that.
2	Mom - INFJ\nDad - ISTJ\n\nMy dad is quite controlling, my mom talks a lot. My pet peeve for both of them is telling me things, in great detail, that I already know despite my protests.\n\nOther than that, we seem to get along quite well—at least, much better than my sister (INFP?) and my parents.
2	Intp(for sure) and Enfp(I think).\n\nMy dad's pretty funny, and I have many good memories including him. I've always been a bit of a daddy's girl haha. However, I don't feel like I know him too well. He's not forthcoming about himself, and he never tried to teach me values or skills or anything like that, so I dont know what he believes in really, apart from a few things I've weasled out of him.\n\nMy mom has betrayed my trust hard in the past so I've kept an emotional distance from her. She's tried being affectionate and caring and I appreciate that, and feel bad, but I dont trust it. She's more forthcoming about her opinions, and she took me and my siblings to church (though those beliefs didnt stick). Like my dad she never really taught me many skills. Shes also a lot chattier than I am, and talks about topics that I dont find engaging.
2	My dad is ISFP thought, lol. I get along with him now but teenage years fucked everything for a while.\n\ndon't know the type of my mom completely sure, but she typed ENFJ in a test and I can see her like one. I don't get alone with her since she's extremely unhealthy with a lot of things. 
13	How do I stop giving a shit about other people's opinions?	I'm very easily triggered by trivial things like people saying they love something I hate or vice versa, I just can't help it. Nothing else pisses me off more, actually. I realize it's useless and pointless, and I don't even get why it pisses me off so much in the first place, but I've always been like that.\n\nHow do you do it?
3	I have the same problem. It helped me to realize that the person doing these things probably doesn't have the same reaction to "love" "hate" type phrases, and therefore would not find that kind of thing offensive. Therefore, they wouldn't expect you too either. Some people just say everything in a very intense way, and may not even feel as strongly as they're coming off. 
3	Let them have their opinion. Everyone is different, but we're all human. As long it doesn't physically affect you, who cares what other people think? Occasionally it's good to engage a bit with them and try to understand their perspective, but it's also important to just learn to accept that not everyone is the same as you.
2	i think... work toward understanding that both your opinion and another's are valid. not everyone has the same relationship with something as you do. and that's fine
2	Explore why you want others to have the same opinions/tastes as you. Does it make you feel accepted and validated when they are in agreement with you? Why is your value placed on others validating your own likes and dislikes?

1	Jet's MBTI - Cast Podcast	Hey Reddit, my name is jetplane48 (ESTP 7w8 sx/sp) and I am starting up a podcast in relation to MBTI. Fundamentally, the goal of the podcast is to educate the viewers of several Typology systems through a series of one-on-one's with others who are interested in the same topics. I have been conducting interviews for many years (MBTI related) and this is just an extension of that, however, I want to discuss topics that the audience wants me to cover. Naturally, I'll come up with my own material but I would love to explore topics that others have in mind. I am busy with school for the next few months but when I finish, the goal is to eventually be more consistent with these podcast uploads if this turns out to be popular enough. I'm very excited to get this started, and let's see some questions!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAR20eDTSOg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAR20eDTSOg)\n\n&#x200B;
7	ISFP Creativity	Hey ISFPs,\n\nI’m INFP.  Which type is more creative?
30	Creativity is subjective 
19	Judging from your user name, I’m gonna go with INFP.
5	I don't know. I don't really fucking now. \^\_\_\^
2	INFP: Creative\n\nISFP: Artistic
4	how do you get rid of the biological desire for sex	
7	Just accept that it is apart of your Biology and countless centuries of evolution. \n\n  its a natural instinct especially for males to desire sex. Dudes have something like 3-5 times higher sex drive than their counterparts anyways. 
3	Why, though???
5	Do nofap long enough.
6	Leaving MGTOW won’t do that, but it will likely make you happier, which could reduce how much you care about this particular issue. c:
4	Get old
2	Why do you want to?
2	reducing internet related pics, and distracting yourself when you feel an urge. You will have to read or watch videos with tips about nofap, etc. once I did 101 days of nofap. that was my longest streak, now im on day 1
2	Have more sex or masturbate more
1	I don’t 
11	Mood cycles	Ok, so maybe this problem is not related to being an isfp at all, but my mood goes in dramatic cycles. \n\nAt my best, I am social, confident, productive, happy, and carefree. Inevitably, it seems, my mood will turn to the opposite. I become frustrated with everyone and snap at people, i want to be alone but feel extremely isolated, I can’t get anything done and I hate myself. \n\nI seem to flip between these two moods with absolutely no trigger. Sometimes, I go months in a good place before it flips, and sometimes it’s only a few days. Either way, it seems inescapable and I have grown tired of being thrown into this state every so often. \n\nDoes anyone else have the same issue, or know how to escape it? Like I said, I am sick of this and I’ll do anything to stop feeling this way
5	I feel the same, for the past 2 weeks I've been pissed off at everyone for some reason. Today I just said to myself life's not worse this sort of hassle so I just decided to just smile and think positive thoughts, this is what helped me. 
4	Same. And my cycles are unpredictable, so whenever I’m in a productive phase I get very focused and annoyed when I think someone or something is “getting in the way” of me achieving my goals. \n\nI can go from Eeyore-mode to “not now chief, I’m in the fuckin ZONE!” from one day to the next. My family is used to it but I imagine it could be frustrating for some people.
1	Mood Cycles are HORRIBLE. I have them too. It's exhausting. Some days I'll wake up and be extremely motivated, and you'll need to go out of your way to piss me off. On other days, someone's breathing will piss me off and ruin my whole day. I'm assuming that it is an ISFP (like myself) thing. Sadly haven't found any way to fix the issue. Sleeping helps sometimes.
14	Thoughts on Being an ISFP	Small preface: Primarily just a browser and I identify as ISFP but I really have to thank this sub- it's contents and users for giving me confidence/comfort in what I have/am experiencing and feeling - overall, being relatable. Anyway, here's some early morning thoughts I had on being an ISFP:  \n\n\nPerhaps the biggest physical flaw to an ISFP (or maybe this extends past us) is that we are only human. When we experience something that fulfills our senses, it is a but unfortunate that we are confined to the five human senses. As a human these senses have certain physical limits - such as only being able to see/perceive fragments of the color spectrum, or in the same light hear certain sounds, or metaphorically not actually being able to feel the rush of air flowing past and under your wings as you soar through the sky. Now in writing this, I also realize that this so to speak "flaw" is also what makes us so amazing and unique. Though we are bound by the human senses while we heavily embrace all the various experiences of our life (music, paintings, photos, food, etc.) that fulfill our senses and in turn "elevate" us and our sense of feelings - those limitations are what push us to elongate those experiences and prolong that sensual high. I guess a good analogy would be like searching for that next hit or next "high" of whichever drug. More specifically, that is when we take that moment and put it in a different perspective, maybe away from convention even - whether it be changing the perspective, framing, or angle of a photo, shading or coloring a work of art differently, or producing a musical (or non-musical) sound that no one has ever heard - creating that next "hit". Honestly this does not apply to just the traditional arts, but can be projected onto any profession, hobbies or interests that a person has as long as you can imagine it. 
6	This is lovely and true.  I think you're an N, though, not an S :)
5	I love it, I feel like I understand others very well. However I feel like I barely talk to people and its hard for me to open up, even to some friends I've known for a really long time. 
2	Overall pretty good, but I hate having inferior Te.
2	Its hard for me to have a detailed opinion on what its like being an ISFP. Mainly because I am far from educated on what the differences between each type are. All I know is what was written in my section, and how that relates to me. Which might be exactly what you are asking. I scored above the 85% on all of my letters and 96% on the A. A large portion of what was written there was pretty on the nose for me.\n\nWhile I find this well written and well expressed. I just couldn't care less. I am me. Its all I'm ever going to be. I don't sit and think about what it means to be an ISFP. I don't know why anyone would. Go ahead and stuff yourself into that box if it makes you happy. I just sit and think about who I am and who I want to be. I don't care what people think about me. I care about what I think about me. If I can love myself the rest will fall into place. I'm sure of it.\n\nPosting this before I try to revise it.
11	ISFPs and Honesty	So I've noticed that I tend to be straightforward and blunt about things than many of my xxTx friends. \n\nFor example, I was texting my INTJ friend and I told her she should come swimming with me. She told me how much she dislikes her body and she said "I just don't think anyone really wants to actually see me in skin tight clothes/ half naked, and honestly I'm fine with that 😂" \n\nShe kept using the 😂 emoji and became more and more passive aggressive. I tried to comfort her, and let her know that no one else cares about how she looks in a swimsuit besides herself. While I'm aware that she's very self conscious and insecure about her body, I would think an INTJ (who had previously mistyped as an INTP) would be more... straightforward? I wanted to reply in a "tough love" sort of way, like "listen, I know you dislike your body and I know that me saying this isn't going to suddenly make you change your mind, but it's really painful to watch you pass up good opportunities just because of your dislike of your body. Literally no one gives a fuck about how you look, and the sooner you can realize that, the sooner you can be happier with yourself and have a more fulfilling life!" But I knew if I sent that text, she would get butt hurt and start ignoring me.\n\n I know I didn't give the best example but I've noticed that so many people are just so passive aggressive and aren't ever fully honest or direct. Maybe it's just the influence of my childhood ENTJ best friend, but I'm always blunt about the truth. If they need to realize some truths, I want to be able to tell them without them getting all butthurt. After all, if they were to do the same to me (as my ENTJ friend has done to me before), I wouldn't get butthurt and would appreciate their sincere honesty. Maybe I would even realize a thing or two.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the relationship of ISFPs and other types with honesty? Do you think ISFPs have a better ability to both dish it and take it than some other types? Or am I just an asshole? I'm generally a pretty gentle nonconfrontational person, but if I feel strongly about something I'm not afraid to be more harsh and call things out.
7	Yessss, I relate to this. I actually doubted that I was an ISFP for a while because I kept reading about how *passive* we’re supposed to be, and while I can’t really be aggressive or mean easily, I’m actually very assertive. I see no point in lying or not being straight forward. I think it just adds unnecessary drama and can create problems. \n\n   My brother is an ISTJ and he is not straightforward with others *at all*. Whenever we got in arguments when we were younger, he would just pretend things didn’t happen, but I’d be the one to be like “hey, sorry I was being rude” or whatever, and once I would address a problem he would too. He is not assertive at all though.\n\n    I also relate to talking with friends. I kind of struggle because a lot of my friends also will do that whole “I’m so ugly!!” thing, and while I don’t mind it once in a while, sometimes it’s like a recurring *thing*. Once, my friend was complaining about how she always ‘looks like trash’ and I literally said “hey, I love you, but you’re gorgeous, stfu.” I don’t like when people hide from problems or lie to avoid consequences or fish for compliments or try to hide their feelings or anything like that. I’m very, *very* straightforward, and it’s completely unnatural for me to lie (unfortunately lol). 
4	Idk mate, this might be due to influences in upbringing etc. I’m terrible with communication and although I’m a pretty blunt person, when it comes to being honest with people at the expense of maybe hurting them or trying to get them to change their own mindset I will just avoid it at all costs. Lol 
3	I am also much more straight forward than all of my friends. Except my best friends that is. My best friend is an ENTJ, and we have done pretty much everything together since middle school. He has possibly rubbed off on me a little. I know he has gotten much more considerate of peoples feelings over the years too, so maybe he picked up some of my traits as well.\n\nI don't know what it is, but my other friends will never just give me a straight answer. It drives me bananas sometimes. If you don't want to do something. Just say no. I don't want an excuse. I want an answer. Please don't answer my questions with a story. I don't want an anecdote. I want an answer.\n\nDon't ask me if you look fat in a dress unless you really wanna know. I'm not gonna sugar coat my answer. I wish everyone would do the same. I am not being mean. I'm being honest. Lying to you would be doing you a disservice. Lying is a waste of everyone's time, and only adds pain to the world.\n\nIf you are someone I care about, and I see you doing something idiotic. I'm gonna call you an idiot. If you are doing something genius. I'm gonna call you a genius. If you smell bad. I'm gonna tell you that you stink. If you look good in that top. I'm gonna let you know you look fly.\n\nOn the flip side. If I am doing something stupid. Please please please. Tell me. I can handle the truth. I'm a big boy now. I would rather be told I'm being a fool than continue being a fool without knowing it. \n\nI don't care much for being able to dish it and serve it. I just want everyone to be honest with each other. Lying is such a fucking waste of time. All we have is time. Lying would just be robbing each other of the most important resource we have.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are not being harsh. You are being the friend they need you to be.
2	Eh, I don’t know. I’m like your friend, I don’t like making people feel bad, basically, or I don’t wanna appear “rude”, so I’m kind of passive aggressive-ish like this myself.  \n\n😅 (—> see?)\n\n(or maybe... I’m not an isfp???? Nah I’m def isfp. I just have ~social anxietyyyy~ and hate when people are upset with me.)
1	INFP here and I think from experience with Intuitive vs Sensing friendships I see how this went down for her- I avoid that behavior like fishing anyway and genuinely do favor bluntness but in a low enough mood it comes out. Personally I know I'd be less prone to that passive aggressiveness with people if they were generally more forthcoming with nice or attentive comments - particularly in recognizing the need to hear these things in that low mood.\n\nIt's when you start down that path, of saying something self deprecating and making yourself vulnerable for a moment, and the conversational partner doesn't just fail to indulge in the common social script ("of course you look fine in a bathing suit"), but tries to subvert it or pivot the conversation, perhaps thinking to teach.  This alerts me, as an iNtuitive, that they disapprove of my behavior (itself, a terrible feeling) - whether they're being mean or direct or not, it's that unwillingness to indulge my clear moment of weakness as a friend that makes me feel twice as embarrassed. It becomes a question of why doesn't this person just want to make me feel better. Why don't they realize what their words are doing to me right now. Why did I have to start this conversation in the first place. \n\nBut I can take the tough love if it's part of a compliment sandwich. I value honesty above everything. I just need something like a verbal hug sometimes, to see how much people care, and everything feels alright.\n\nA quick bit to add to your hypothetical tough love example that would work a little better (on me anyway) -"It's painful to see you pass up opportunities *because I really love seeing you happy and sharing it with you"*  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso - I know you said it's not a perfect example but cut your friend some slack. Body issues are complex and deeply ingrained for anyone. Being squirrely about certain extremely sensitive subjects doesn't mean someone doesn't value honesty and bluntness like you do for most other things. We all have a few things that break our typification.   \n\n\nAnyway, I don't know how you responded to her, maybe you answered in a way that I would have completely agreed with and responded well to. But you described a pattern I've seen in my friendships and I thought an iNtuitive take might help you understand where her behavior came from.
