7	Best matches for ENFJ?	Hi guys,\n\nSo I am thinking a lot about types we mesh with well and those we don’t in a relationship. Many of the types that we do well with (NF types, some NTs, a couple SPs) are easy for us to understand and communicate with. However, I would also like to gain further perspective on the types that we don’t mesh well with. I’m assuming that especially a lot of ST types are hard for us to handle. Anyway, let’s review.\n\nLooking at my friend group, I can see two ENFPs, one INFJ, an ESFJ who thinks that he is an ISTJ, and an INTP. I also have been friends with an INTJ, but we had a falling out. \n\nWhich types do you think complement the ENFJ the most and offer the most room for growth? I think probably either INTP or INTJ. What do you guys think?\n\n\n\n\n
7	For romance, I almost inevitably end up having sparks for IxFPs. \n\nINFPs: a lot of same same but different. We just get each other really quickly and deeply, and a lot of our relationships are just tacitly understood. Instant emotional chemistry. Push me in many ways, especially emotionally and to think deeply and critically. It's great. However, I find them a bit too in their heads sometimes. They attract a lot of chaos in their lives as they try to figure things out, particularly when they're less mature, so I've had some turbulent times with them. \n\nISFPs: a lot of same same but totally, totally different. Instant chemistry, especially physical. So easy to get along with, and not pushy. Cool as fuck - know cool people, and do cool things. Learn a lot about the real world and whatever art they're into from them, while still maintaining their individuality and whimsy. We offer some stability and pragmatism to their life. \n\nFor friendships:\n\n* xSFJ for closer friendships. Great rocks to lean on.\n* ISFP and xSTP to have in the general friend groups. So fun and chill. \n* ENTP to spice things up. Too crazy and never takes anything personally.\n* INFPs for partners in crime and to get weird with and cry together.\n* ENTJ for same same but different and more career-driven. So driven but extremely chill and fun when they're in downtime mode.\n* INFJs for same same same same same but only slightly different. They just get me and vice versa - me: "I'm thinking x, is that crazy?" them: "nah bro I think the same way" me: "OH THANK GOD" both: "HEHEHEHEHEHE".\n\nCould take or leave:\n\n* STJs - booooooring. I mean into "traditional fun" things, but not easy to have more than a surface level conversation. Good at taking care of people's needs though, so nice to have them around for those kinds of things. 
5	I am an ENTP in the early dating stage with an ENFJ!\n\n\nWe're already looking out for each other and we complement each other really well. Typically the ENTP/ENFJ relationship is one of growth where we both have lots to learn from each other. For me, this is exactly what I want in a relationship.\n\n\nI worry that I'm not enough of a feeler/people person for her and I think this will be the biggest challenge
4	The ISFP would be the perfect match for the ENFJ; I don’t say that lightly. There a couple of issues that come up with the match, but they’re good issues if they are properly addressed.\n\nFor one, usually finding someone of the opposite middle function is preferable as one can either favor the tertiary or auxiliary. So if you have Se preference, finding an ISFP with Ni preference would be key.(it.makes.a.difference)\n\nSecondly, Fi will never not be Fi, they will never concern the self with the feelings of others as Fe would, but if the ENFJ can come to respect that given that it’s still in the realm of feeling then they will exponentially grow a lot. And so too would the ISFP in regards to accepting Fe. A lot of people claim the inferior function to be the biggest issue in one’s life but that’s not true. According to Jung it was the 5th function, an ENFJ’s Fi; the concern for one’s own feelings instead of EVERYBODY ELSE’S..... and then they could finally have happen all their pretty solid Ti ideas. However, since Ti isn’t usually used it kind of sucks since it’s not preferred(sorry), but no worries since the ISFP can help with that given their Te. The ISFP can actually be kind of bossy even through their seemingly kind nature, their trying to release themselves of their Fi by means of Te, and they get to do that a lot since.... the ENFJ would actually really appreciate somebody being on top of them about things. For once, someone would be concerned about them, and would give their all to try to help their Ti along. Finally, someone is helping them, and they found a place to belong, where their ideas and thoughts are arguably always seen in a good light. \n\nAlso, be wary of the blind spot(7th), but also know that each type helps the other with it. Usually there is an over-attachment to the 6th function since it lacks the validation of the 7th... or a better way of saying it: the ENFJ believes they can do ANYTHING(don’t tell them they can’t, they will prove.you.wrong) since they have exaggerated Ne; all the possibilities. They lack the ability to do, as another ENFJ pointed out, the “traditional activities” of the Si STJs. However, given the desire of “anything is possible”...... they run themselves ragged, at least in my experience. Don’t get me wrong, every ENFJ I’ve met is a literal superhero of movement, care, energy and accomplishment, they can and WILL get something done if need be.... but man do they not take care of themselves. Usually, Si would be the function to provide one with rest, to just rely on what worked before. And in the relationship to an ISFP an ENFJ would be provided with that. While the ISFP can be exciting and gogogo they are actually quite creatures of habit, Si preference, which the ENFJ can help with - to bring that excitement into their lives. And can you guess what calms down the ever moving ENFJ? Appreciation. Genuine appreciation on the part of the ISFP. \n\nMy mother is an ISFP and her best friend in the world is an ENFJ, and they literally have been best friends for.....  20 something years?? And usually her best friend is the only one my mom will listen to because to my mom she is just the wisest person in the world. Her ability to “instantly read” people just amazes her, nothing but genuine praise from my mother.\n\nI don’t know an actual ENFJ x ISFP romantic relationship, but I know both of them separately and the theory behind the functions, so maybe that’ll be enough for evidence purpose’s. Hopefully it helps either way. \n\nEDIT: I can’t express enough that one can find love in any types, my reasoning is based solely on the functions...... one wouldn’t think one would have to say that, but best to be careful. 
2	IxFP is a great match for ENFJ's
1	More than half of my very good friends I have ever had are INFJ's. Two of my 3 or 4 of my 6 best of friends are INFJ's. I can't stop being attracted to them, and they all get along with each other. My wife in an ENTJ which is great almost all the time as well. 
1	In my experience, INFPs and ENFPs are ones I’ve clicked with almost instantly.
17	How do I gain more confidence as an ENFJ?	Hey all! So happy to find out there’s a sub for my personality type. I was hoping I could enlist some help from you fellow ENFJ’s. \n\nSome of our main weaknesses as an ENFJ are fluctuating self esteem and being too sensitive. I had a long phase of social anxiety and this definitely made those things worse. It’s been several years since then but I still struggle a lot with these things and would love to be a more confident person. What are some things that you have found to be successful in gaining more confidence as an ENFJ?
9	Not sure what your enneagram type is but as a 3w2/4, I’ve found that by picking up something I love & getting really good at it has made me more confident in all areas of my life. It’s made me think: hey, if I did X, I can do Y. \n\nAlso, 10/10 recommend working out. I found joy in lifting and it’s made me feel so much more empowered & badass. I had to think about my life and what makes me feel successful is still and probably always will be (unfortunately?) external things. Lifting has made me switch my mindset into thinking that hard work makes you luckier & luckier and it’s also pretty quantifiable. It’s made me believe in my body & myself. Once I felt in control of my health... I felt like I could control my life. It was weird for me to realise how much my physical health influenced my confidence in abilities that were not even related to health (like academics, social skills, etc).\n\nAlso, just pushing yourself outside your comfort zone even just a bit at a time helps a lot. Anxiety was definitely a huge issue for me prior to the long journey of finding what I’m good at and working on it endlessly. So that every time I’m not confident, I can think about experiences where I have succeeded. 
7	Oh I want to hug you!! I’m an ENFJ, and because I’m an extrovert and an Aries, I come across as a confident, bubbly, social butterfly. In reality, I totally have social anxiety and some insecurities though and only those very close to me know about any of that!
6	fake it til you make it.  Keep telling yourself how awesome you are and pat yourself on the back when you do something good.  I'd feel anxiety and then out loud tell myself how great I am.  Basically this exercise is to teach you how to internally validate and affirm your efforts. Eventually, it'll become a reality.  
2	I feel this 100%. People always seem to perceive me as being happy/confident, whereas I’m really anxious at times (especially socially) and can be hard on myself.\n\nIn addition to what others have said, I think realizing that everyone has their own weaknesses is a way to feel more confident. I don’t mean going out of your way to criticize or scrutinize someone, but rather, realizing we’re all human and make mistakes. If you see someone you otherwise perceive as “confident” make a mistake, use that as a chance to remind yourself that it’s not the end of the world if YOU do the same thing. \n\nI’m still not as confident as I wish I was, but realizing we’re all human and fallible, and have universal emotions/experiences to at least some degree, will help you be a little less worried about the small stuff.
1	*Talk and confort to yourself when sad or offended.\n*Know that people's words can't automatically destroy you\n*Know you are the queen bee\n*Do what you want, wear what you want, who cares what people say?\n*Try not to overthink what people say :)\nI'm a ENTJ and I am trying to let another layer of thick-skin, I want to be more insensitive. 
1	Do magic mushrooms. Changed my life. 
1	Pretend to be ESTP, naturally i’m an ENFJ but I feel very limited as a person if I don’t venture into other ways of being and learn how to improve as a person. I recently fell into this weird thing where I became everything an enfj embodied because I liked the idea of being a friendly leader, but then I realized that there are some times where not being an enfj would not help. It’s definitely not easy and not something natural, but if we don’t step outside of ourselves (sounds funny coming from an enfj) then we’ll be limitted to only what we know.\nHope this helped! Lmk if anything isn’t clear❤️
1	Accept and embrace yourself. Accept all your flaws, embrace all your strengths. Accept that you're not perfect and will never be but your strengths are also extraordinary and you can truly reach minds. Accept that you cannot be loved by everyone and that's perfectly fine, as long as you love who you are ❤️
1	Hang out with your soconics duals, the ISTPs, those guys and gals have enough confidence to last 3-4 people. It will slowly rub off on you.     \nLow self-esteem seems to be an ENFJ issue that was [mentioned in this description of the type](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/57803-EIE-Misconceptions) (their EIE is same as ENFJ) and hanging out with Beta STs, this is the ISTP and ESTP in MBTI, seems to go a long way to help an ENFJ feel more confident and supported out there in the real world.
8	Which type don’t you get along with?	Hi there ENFJs,\n\nSo I was wondering, which types don’t you guys usually get along with? I get along with most types, albeit maybe a little superficially. I struggle with people who place an importance on Extraverted Thinking (Te). These types include ESTJS, ENTJs, ISTJs, and INTJs. I get along with the intuitive types better, but I still find them insensitive of others’ feelings. \n\nWhat do you guys think?
9	yea I agree with you.  Unless the T types are matured, I can't handle ones that haven't grown up yet.  It gets aggrevating because you try to show feels with logic.
6	My best friend is ISTJ but I have a very tough time with them. ESTJs even more so. And ENTJs. Makes sense because of the Te demon. SFJs drive me up the wall and other ENFJs annoy me unless they're older and more mature.
2	Estj is the effing worst match for enfj gahdd. My enfj bff told me that this estj officemate just told him that he wishes gay people would stop being gay bluntly ( my enfj bff is gay btw). He had the worst office environment ever 
3	I dated an ISTP for years and it was like I was dating an alien. 
25	Daily, internal, irrational struggle as an ENFJ	Me (ENFJ) \n\nfeeling isolated/misunderstood \n\nbecause I’m not getting the same support I give \n\nbecause everyone thinks I’m fine\n\nbecause they’re not as intuitive as I am \n\nand I’m pretending to be fine: \n\n“Do I burden everyone around me or continue to suffer in silence?” 
8	You're not a burden. ENFJs are amazing. \n\nAs the giver you also deserve to let other people give to you--to be supportive to you too. \n\nYou deserve to be heard and understood. \n\nYou deserve to have genuine, authentic  relationships where you can just be you. \n
5	Hey everyone this “relatable post” was meant to just demonstrate a common pattern of giving a lot in relationships, holding back feelings and feeling misunderstood that I think a lot of ENFJ’s can find themselves getting sucked into, not really an advice-seeking one. \n\nHappy to say I have friends who support me and the ability to seek help with needed. I do think a lot of ENFJ’s get caught in a cycle of being very supportive in relationships and holding back personal feelings in order to fulfill that supportive friend role, causing them to become one-sided if the ENFJ represses their feelings or doesn’t make their needs known. \n\nThat being said: I very, very much appreciate the solidarity and support. That’s why we’re here! It’s clear that many of us have had similar internal experiences, despite approaching people and external situations in different ways. \n
3	Vocalise how you feel directly. Explain it clearly. They come around or you will realise it’s time to leave.
6	Nobody deserves something they don't/won't give back, that's why you should burden them, if they want to be exposed to your love and passion than they have to pay for it because your love and passion are one of the most valuable things in this world and it shouldn't be free, if they can't handle you and feel awkward about your venting than walk out of their lives, yes it's hard to not win over everyone because that is our instinct and it's very hard to go against it, but please try your hardest, you are not a perfect being nor will you ever be, and they should understand that and if they don't, they should go fuck themselves, the struggle of holding sooooo much in but not letting it out because those around you are addicted to your kindness should not exist, you are not an angle and you should make them know that.
2	I am exactly where you are man, I feel like I burden people sometimes. I feel like I'm a bit much. 
2	Does the 'burden' feeling also come mixed with worrying you'll be too 'exposed' and too 'vulnerable' if you let them know what you need/feel?  That you may not be as in control of your persona if you crack a little?  Are you keeping your feelings/needs from them for them, or for you?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust asking because sometimes it's easier to overcome our personality traits when we exclude the subconscious part of our behaviour that is serving our own unspoken needs/fears.  My own example of this is a recent realisation that I try to be too nice (often with people who are frankly verbal aggressors or bullies) mainly because of my own need to keep the channels open in case I need them, and for my own need for a harmonious, collegiate environment at work because that would protect my sensitive feelings if we're all being nice to each other.  I thought I was being 'nice' because I want other people to feel happy and nice (part of it, but not all).  Once I let go of my own desire for harmony, and to protect my feelings, I realised that if some people plainly refuse to live in harmony, then I can just allow the disharmony to sit, and maintain my dignity instead of adapting myself to their aggressive behaviour to keep the peace.  Recognising my own subconscious needs was the key to solving a more important need, which was my need for self-respect and the respect of others.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis may not be the key to your question, but it very well may be part of it.  Wishing you happiness and health.
3	Need to vent, but good day at work:D	Second post.\n\nWhen I go to work, it's like playing a video game on "medium difficulty". Not too hard, yet challenging. That's until you introduce the human factor. Next second, the difficulty level goes up into "nightmare mode". People walk around the truck like I'm getting in their way (A woman basically told me this). When they're entering an area with a sign reading, "No pedestrian access". Not to mention people using the fire escape. I just want to be a smart-ass, and say "where's the fire?" People are truly unreasonable.\n\nI'm a driver down at this shopping mall. Been doing this for a little while now, and I've found it to be very enjoyable. Not the best job I've worked, but far from the worse. Can't remember who was the first bad customer, but I guess it doesn't matter.\n\nI think my first bad experience, was almost hitting two teenage girls. Driving down the main street, going well under the speed limit, just cruising. This was around the bus stop area, so always plenty of people around. Without much warning, two girls ran into the middle of the road. As soon as they see the truck, they freeze up (this was nighttime). They could of beat the truck if they kept running, but nope! They stop dead in the middle of the road and hugged eachother when facing the headlights (they really did hug eachother like they thought they were about to die). I only have a split second to react. I slam on the brakes. The tires screech, as I manage to manoeuvre around them. I can only imagine how close I came to hitting them.\n\nI'll tell a funny one now. I pulled up to the boom gate, and waited for it to open. Suddenly, I hear yelling and swearing. Turning around, I find a guy in business attire. He had just walked into the side of the truck. This wasn't some old guy, dude had to be in his 20's or 30's. We make eye contact and he gives me the middle finger, then starts pointing to move forward. By this stage, the boom gate opens and I can leave. It's just funny that this guy blamed me. Like somehow, I made him walk into the truck on purpose. Sadly, I can't do Jedi mind tricks. :(\n\nI've had a lanky teen yell at me from his car "I'm going to stab you in you're f***ing face!" Funny enough, he lost all his courage when I pulled up next him in traffic. I look down at him, he's looking straight ahead. Not breaking focus. I'll quickly just say why he threatened me. He erratically drove around someone at a stop sign, while I was pulling out into the road (guess he thought he was playing GTA). I had the right of way, but he was attempting to pass me. I could of stopped, but decided against it. After all, if he hit the truck, he was in the wrong for reckless driving.\n\nIt's at this point, a bit of a make or break situation happens...\nI go to unload at the docking bay. It's not unusual for the odd car to drive by here. Normally because they're looking for where you collect online shopping. It's a small area, so you normally can't go fast around here. I think you can see where this is going.. So, I'm going to unload and walk around to my usual path. It's on a slight steep, so it's easy to go a little fast when walking down it. When I get out to main part, a car suddenly rushes past me. I have to slam on the brakes, and try to pull myself up, otherwise hit the side of a fast moving car. This car does a quick U turn in the little zone, then speeds off. This is the moment! Coming face-to-face with the metal beast, I saw the comedy of it. The absurdity was truly hilarious.\n\nJust wanted to end this by saying one thing. Just today, I went to go into the bathroom, as an elderly man was about exit. He had one of those 'walking stands', and I noticed his heavily strapped knee. My brain is like, "well... are you going to hold to hold the door for him?" Of course I would. I squeeze my body around the corner, while holding the door. I wanted to give him as much space as possible. He told me. "You came at the right place, at the right time." It warms my heart. Knowing that I temporarily made his life a little easier.
6	How do you not piss of an ENFJ, and views from ENFJs on INFJs	I’m just wondering. So if you have the time or will to leave an answer, thanks.
14	My two best friends are enfjs. I keep one of them happy by trying to do a lot of things for him when I can tell he’s getting into a bad mood. He’s a big baby so it’s clear when he’s grouchy, I bring him my leftovers from restaurants a lot. My other ENFJ friend is much easier to please and a lot of times I just send her music or videos or little things that make me think of her and she explodes with love that fills my infj heart. \n\nThey both love when I get emotional or serious and talk about my problems with them 
17	Try to not bring out people short comings/judge other people quickly, don't be too self absorbed and try to be less messy, other than that INFJs are usually among the ENFJ's favourite types
6	Don’t be cocky, don’t mock/ bring down others. Being problematic and dishonest can make me upset. 
5	Infj f dating an enfj man. I would say the things about me that bug him most are \n\n• when I seem too private. I don’t share everything cos it’s not necessary or interesting or relevant to me, but he takes offense if it’s something of importance to him or something he’s opened up to me about. I’m not being sneaky I’m just not disclosing every little detail because I don’t see why.. opening up when prompted probably helps \n\n• don’t dew enfj’s as sunshine happy innocent Labrador retrievers. I used to tell him he reminded me of a dog cos he loves people and is optimistic and has so much energy and I often equated him as the opposite of me, mood wise. This was taken as me saying he was shallow or ignoring that he too feels the depth of all emotions and feels lonely and misunderstood. They may be 100x more cheery comparatively but that doesn’t mean they lack any depth. \n\n• when I want to stay inside all day. Even if he asks for a “lounge day where we do absolutely nothing and never leave bed” after a long week, by mid afternoon he is usually stir crazy. Plan activities even if you don’t leave home. They get bored. \n\n• when I don’t give quality attention. This one is sweet and might not be an enfj thing but my love gets hurt when I’m studying or focused on other things while he’s talking to me. He adores eye contact and active questions and follow up remarks about things from me days later. The enfj is listening with intent, reciprocating that for them is huge! 
5	It pisses me off when people don't give a shit.\n\nI try to make the world a better place nearly every second of my day. If you're actively lighting things on fire... Fuck you.\n\nThrow away your trash. Take proper care of your pets. Be kind to people--both in the present and in the future, by leaving a good legacy. And use your goddamned turn signal.
5	Be loyal to them, try to be punctual, don't judge other people, be open to other people's points of view. Also hug them and give them compliments and thanks them profusely for advice they give you that is useful.
4	Lots of hugs, little unique gifts, music recommendations or collaborative playlists.. anything that’s really positive social feedback and or indicates you were thinking about them on your own time. 
3	Be aware of social cues, though INFJs usually don’t have this problem. Don’t say inappropriate comments at the wrong time. Be aware of surroundings before speaking. Be aware of the ENFJ’s value systems. 
2	Oh yes and be punctual! Be cognizant of how you treat people in their life such as their family and close friends! Do not harp on them for opposing views, but do discuss 
1	Im and enfj and my bestie is an infj. I overwhelm her at times with my extrovertion(is that a word, bot?) I find her quiet nature makes us work well together. Plus as a child i was introverted so i relate to her. I think the two are a great combo if you have enough in common. Also, she is 3 years older, and we have the same birthday and kind of look alike. Really, the i and the e is the only difference.
1	Thanks for the feedback :D
2	ENFJ Fe~Se loop	I'm caught in a Fe Se loop right now, I tried to do some research on it but it's just not talked about a lot for some reason. \n\nDoes anyone know ways to get out of a Fe Se loop? I know how I got into it but I don't know how to get out of it. How do I start using Ni again? I exhausted my Ni over the course of a couple years when I lost 6 animals and 3 relatives and now I really want to get it back in. \n\nCurrently I've been doing everything looking in a straight line and not thinking about next week or anything, trying to get the high from talking to people constantly, wasting time, not having any ambition not having any incentive to get my homework back on track or anything.\n\nAny help would be very appreciated
9	Hey man, I get how you feel.\n\nWhat I usually do, start slow. Don't try and do everything at once. Get one thing done at a time. Small victories should encourage you to do more! Start by say making your bed every morning for an entire week, then take the next step.\n\nHope this helps! 
8	Conflicting results	Hi :)\nFirst time post here.\n\nGuess I'll start off my life story...\n\n[2 hours later]\n\nAnd that's the story of how we defeated Dark Souls 3 in a weekend. Haha!\n\nAll jokes aside... probably posting here to see if I can form a connection with someone. I feel lost at sometimes! While there's no problem with talking to people, at times, it seems we are on different wave lengths.\n\nI think I was born in a strange time. I've had a difficult time of accepting the internet as a form of socialising (in high school during the rise of MySpace and Facebook). I think that's why I have difficulty in forming a relationship.\n\nA weird irony...\nOne day, my sister says to mum and me. "You know how everyone sees themself as the "protagonist" in their own story of life? Kirk is like the "sidekick" to other people's stories."\nYep... She said that.
3	that's how I see myself sometimes! lol
3	Couldn’t agree more with the technology getting in the way of forming meaningful relationships. While I use social media, I don’t like what it’s become and while I appreciate its value, I don’t enjoy texting. Kind of tough to cope with that in today’s age but I guess I’m just a little old fashioned :)
3	I like how convenient it is to chat with my friends using messenger.  As we get older, we all moved farther away from one another, making it inconvenient to visit spontaneously . So we use that as a form of medium to schedule visits and the like.  For me, it's a tool I can use.  Depending on how I use it, it could be great for reconnecting with others and making new friends.  I was socially awkward even before technology was super prevalent. When the internet was starting to boom in high shool, I didnt' really have anyone to connect with prior to that. Finding a crowd has the same wavelength as you will be difficult, but like relationships, it's a numbers game.  You gotta keep going at it and meet a ton of people before you find that group that fits you.  I've participated in a ton of organizations in college and met thousands of people.  Took me until the end of my college years to find that handful of people that got me.
2	I'm an INFJ but I like to form connections too! Hi friend :) 
14	I don't believe someone would love me.	Topic sounds like a bummer, its not I just wasn't sure how to put it!\n\nSo, this is what I'm feeling:\n\nSo I've been dating a girl for a few months now, and I fucking know I'll marry her, no doutb about it, but something is bothering me. Its my mind.\n\nI've been with girls before, nothing serious, but as an ENFJ I feel like I've always given myself ti the person I'm with completely. I love being open and feeling what I feel and not thinking mucy about it. My head is always in the clouds, I l9ve helping people and the person I'm with and having big, almost unrealistic dreams.\n\nSo, girls I've been with really took advantage of me always willing to help. All of them suffered from depression or heavy family issues and things like that. I was always there to listen. Thing is, I didn't realise at the time they were projecting their unhappiness into me. I became a scape goat. Everything they believed about themselves they blamed me for. I was told I have to be realistic with my dreams, I was told I can never help them, I was told I shouldn't haveblong hair or a beard or I should dress differently. All of this hurt like hell, so I changed myself. I changed into what girls expected of me.\n\nOneday, I went to a club with this girl. First, I fucking hate clubs, but here I am trying to keep her happy. I don't dance, I know I can't but I try anyway. 10 seconds later she stops and tells me this is embarrassing and goes to her friends. It was humiliating. I just left, walked halfwat home and sat in the street crying. I didn't know what I was doing or remember who I used to be.\n\nSo, I decided no more women. Started growing my hair abd beard with no end in sight and decided to travel and prioritized my friends above all.\n\nMonths later after I was happy with who I have become I met my current girlfriend. Now I will finally get to my point.\n\nWhy am I still in the back of my head wondering when she's going to get sick of me just like all the other girls? Why do I expect her to lash out or to suddenly change her feelings of mind? I know it happened before, but I know in my heart it won't happen again. This girl genuinely loves me. Why can't I accept and believe it? Will this change with time? I hate feeling this way.\n\nSorry for long post, hope someone reads it. 
7	It seems to me that you're unconsciously doing that to protect your soul, as you've been hurt in the past. I think that you should actively try to persuade yourself that that was the past and that your current girlfriend genuinely loves you, as you said. Maybe asking her to help you with that?? 
4	Perhaps because you are one of those people who use their past as experience that they are learning from, I'm not expert but I've experience this kind of feeling, It usually will fade away once you keep in your mind to see only the good things that happeneds between you two, but it might needs time until you can be completely accepting, usually the solution that I saw people around me using is finding the weak spot and overcome it in their memories, such as when they have bad memories in a club or garden or any other case they go to that place again with their recent partner and either react these memories or just speak about them with their partner, the respond from their partner is usually the solution that they need\n\nThat all I know, I hope it can help you or at least gave you an idea to figure out a solution for yourself on your own.
3	Love everything everyone has already said. Few things i'd add - if you haven't already, I'd research 'mindfulness' or work with a therapist on this topic (this bunny comic is a great initial summation: [https://www.redbubble.com/people/thelatestkate/works/37358538-lets-get-you-mentally-healthy-mindfulness-101-bunny-comic?asc=u](https://www.redbubble.com/people/thelatestkate/works/37358538-lets-get-you-mentally-healthy-mindfulness-101-bunny-comic?asc=u)), as this is the training you'll need to diminish the frequency of these thoughts. I always liken them to black lightning in the brain - there's these existing neural pathways in your brain that are not aligned with who you are now, but they're still trying to protect you in their own dysfunctional way.\n\nThe other thing I'd recommend looking into is love languages. One of the challenges for us ENFJ types is learning how to express our needs, as we're so busy fulfilling the needs of others (and grow used to toxic people using us to fulfill their needs while offering nothing in return), that our familiar pattern can get to a place of \[Work hard to fulfill needs of others\] >> \[Get short endorphin rush of helping others, but there's a nagging feeling that we can't sort out\] >> \[repeat until it builds up and kills your relationship in one of a thousand ways\] - and it's that we aren't similarly fulfilled but we don't know that. The book 'The Five Love Languages' contains some pretty dated bad christian 'science' at parts, but overall is a great primer and system to discover what will help capture that 'fulfilled' feeling.\n\nIf you're an moderate to high anxious type, like me, you do need to accept low-level anxiety is a part of your life and something you've got to deal with. But these tools should help mitigate the danger in those treacherous waters, and calm them over time (beyond these sources therapy is always 110% encouraged and meds to mitigate the purely physical aspects of the anxious condition).
3	can’t help but agree. &im going through the whole blocking everyone out and trying to find myself phase right now. i honestly don’t think anyone would truly love me ever. everything &everyone was just a lie. \n\nwish i was actually important to someone 
5	This is a typical trauma response. Your brain is trying to protect yourself from pain based on the past. Doesn't mean those feelings are real tho - it's just a triggered response. Have a Google and read about the amygdala. \n\n\nThings will change but it takes time to rewire your brain in order to feel safe again. Have faith! Be open to your partner so she can support you as you work through it. I've done it. It's worth being patient and forgiving of yourself to allow others to love you in the way you deserve.
2	Stay with her for a year or two before you decide? It took me quite a while before I got comfortable without with my girlfriend and decided I wanted to be with her in the long term. I think that being uncertain about relationships for one reason or another is an ENFJ thing, or so I've heard.
2	I can really relate to you my friend, I don't think I can help you but I'm also sure this could be the one. The one who was worth past trauma, the one you happily live with. Never lose your faith, no matter what
1	Survey on personality and flirting behaviors	Hey I am a doctoral Student at a University in the South. I am studying flirtation behaviors, specifically trying to catalog specific flirting behaviors taken from several experimental studies. Thank you in advance for taking the time to take the survey there is an opportunity to win a gift card if the entire survey is completed. You can back out at any time.\n\nHere is the link to the survey\n\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JMQP5PJ
1	Damn this survey is long. Only got to question 136 before I got exhausted 
1	Took the survey, was a bit long but wasn’t bad. 
11	ENFJ of all sexes and preferences, what do you look for in a partner?	Is it:\n- Someone who you could admire?\n- Someone who is creative?\n- Someone physically attractive?\n- Someone who is intellectual / knowledgeable?\n- Someone who is emotionally aware?\n- Someone who is structured and ordered?\n- Someone who is good with people?\n- Someone who is solution oriented?\n\nOr maybe someone who has some other qualities or interesting quirks?\n\nWhat do you look for? Or what are some of the qualities your partner has that you adore?\n\nHope you can state your sex as well, because different sexes could potentially prioritize different qualities
26	Someone who has depth that isn't obvious. I find joy in solving problems and discovering something beneath the surface - be it a hobby or uncommon trait. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEmotionally aware and intellectually curious are super big. Creative & people-persons are not that important to me. I like thinkers and generally tidy and organised people. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
12	Being a team like partners in life. I would want to be seen by friends and family as a team, we'd just work together on everything and we'd just know each other well. \n\nI know it's not a common preference, I'm a guy btw.
6	Me and my girlfriend talked about this recently. She is an INFP and I'm sure it'll take a lifetime to figure her out.\n\nWhat first got my attention about her was her being shy. I wanted ti know more but she only ever so slightly let me in. Now, as aj ENFJ this wasn't cutting it. We are very open people and usually people open up to us because of this quality, but she didn't. Drove me crazy. In her eyes, she opened up a lot at the time, but I'm not at all used to that.\n\nAnyway, so we got to know each other, and fir some reason it was only later that I realised she is absolutely beautiful. Dark, almost black eye, black hair, and so small and fragile.\n\nAs we got to know each other I couldn't help but see the intelligence radiating from her as she thinks about things, listen and consider what I say too.\n\nNow we've been dating for a while and the think about an INFP girl is your going to be surprised at how different they are from us. I knew we were different but she is able to do things I will never learn to do. She can spend endless hours alone, while we ENFJs NEED people. She is very content eith herself. So, I also admire her endlessly.\n\nThis was a long story, thanks for reading if your at this point. What I'm trying to say is its hard to point out particular things that attracts someone to someone else. Its more like a way of being that you find attractive. The way she just is, and all the very very small nuances.\n\nI've never loved someone like this. 
5	Female and hetero - and I'd say all of the above, but in the past I have had the tendency to settle if I find ONE of these things lol. Trying to make a habit of not doing that anymore and working on myself to see why I did settle before :) I would say the most important to me would be emotionally aware and solution oriented but honestly they are all important, as these are the qualities I strive for in myself. I tend to always find something to admire about almost everyone so that's one that wouldn't be as important.
3	I like the following traits:\n\n* Someone who's mildly aractive, doesn't need to be gorgeous, more so adorable and nerdy if anything\n* On same intellectual level as me and is funny\n* Strong communication skills and emotionally/socially aware\n* Someone willing to compromise and understand empathy\n\nMy INFP guy is my one and I kinda felt a giant rush of either endorphins or dopamine after meeting him.  I dunno if love at first sight is a thing, but that's probably as close as it can be with it.  I felt like I was floating for a week and this is after chatting with him for 5 hours the first time we met.  I'm a female btw.  What caught my attention was the similarities between our life experiences and how we connected on the same values and passions in life.  We both came from different worlds but sought the same goals in life and looked for the same kind of partner to share experiences with.  He compliments me quite well in how I love to be high energy and pragmatic, while he's more laid  back and an options sort of guy.  I usually make the decisions while he lists out options for us to do.  It works out pretty well . He also is very big on communication so we typically hash out all issues before they become big.  He also affirms and validates me a lot.  We getting married this year.
5	24 y/o bi female here. As someone who has experience both very positive and very negative relationships there are a few qualities I’ve learned I like and dislike in a partner. My ideal partner would be \n\nSomeone who is open minded and fun (but acts their age)\n\nSomeone who challenges me and themselves \n\nSomeone who has similar interests \n\nSomeone who is respectful of not only myself and my family but to everyone in every day life, waiters etc. \n\nJust a few things that immediately come to mind when I think of past relationships and their deal makers and breakers \n\n* I switch between INFJ and ENFJ
1	I look for beauty first.
5	INFJ needing help with an ENFJ	I'm an INFJ who has fallen hard for an ENFJ. We constantly flirted for a week now and I feel like we've connected deeply on one occasion. But the problem is I have a gut feeling shes not over her breakup with her ex 8 months ago. So I don't know if she geniunely likes me or using me to feel better. Should I stop intiating hangouts and let her come to me? Should I straight up ask to talk and say that it seems like she's going through some stuff and that I really like her and I only want to hang out if she truly wants to hang out with me? Or ahould I just not give a fuck if she's over her ex or not and be with her and make her happy?What should I do? Please give me some of your ENFJ insight and perspectives.
9	I’d openly discuss your concerns with her.  As an ENFJ, she will appreciate your honesty, be flattered that you care so much for her and frankly, help her confront what may be her own ambiguity about the situation. Plus, if your relationship is to last and have a future, it must be based on honesty, trust and good communication. Why not start to build that now? 
1	>Should I stop intiating hangouts and let her come to me?

Please give me some of your ENFJ insight and perspectives.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnswers in order:\n\n1. If you feel really exposed and outside your comfort zone, that's probably a good move. You want to make sure your serious interest is reciprocated.\n2. I don't think so. Clearly she wants to hang out with you. If what you actually want is for her to admit serious romantic interest in you this move may be too much too soon and scare her off.\n3. I think you should just take things at a pace that you're comfortable with and enjoy her company. Give her a chance to come to you and you'll see if your interest is reciprocated. If you realize that her level of interest isn't high enough for you move on.
1	enfj’s are my weakness, I can relate 
1	Just be honest with yout feelings.
30	I tell people to get what they want, but I can't get what I want.	It bothers me that I tell people to get what they want, but I can't get what I want.\n\nI told a guy a few months ago to utilize his strength as a linguist, when he was applying for accounting jobs and failed. A few months later, now he's working in a language company.\n\nShared the same view with some guy on a road trip, he said, living on the edge, and yeah, he's living on the edge. \n\nTold somebody to expand and learn, and yes he did what I advised. \n\nBut when it comes down to my own personal problems, I find it so damn hard to plow through the people I need to deal with. As my persuasion is not working anymore with them.\n\nDon't know if you guys have met situations like this before and how did you deal with it?
6	I feel the same. I'm in my late 20s and am sill trying to figure that out. I've only gotten as far as thinking about the reasons why I do it:\n\n* I think to myself "it's ok, maybe I'll give it a little more time to play out".\n* Sometimes these situations are very uncomfortable and while knowing the logical solution, it's hard to pivot your life if it's already moving in a certain direction.\n* Sometimes these situations also involve intense interpersonal conflict. I avoid these where I can if I can try to find a way to rationalize or figure out an alternative solution. \n\nThe most success I've had in trying to "follow my own advice" has been just to stop thinking about it. I often talk myself in circles and psych myself out, but when I've been "ready" to accept that I need a change, I say: "I'm not happy in this situation. What can do I do to fix that?" and I just (almost) immediately do the first (and often logical) thing to do in my mind. It's like ripping off the band-aid as opposed to figuring out the most optimal way to remove the damn thing. You spend so much time thinking about it that it never happens. \n\nDoing this requires some mental fortitude and that you not overthink it. I've slipped up in the past, but just persevere and be comforted in knowing that you're either doing the right thing, or the thing that will maximize your happiness, or both. 
3	Because you have no problem with being a parent-figure for someone else, but not for yourself - I gave trouble with focusing on my self too, isn't the easiest to shift that focus back on myself 
2	Find a life coach or a mentor that you trust, or form a “mastermind” group with peers you admire and respect. Develop a life plan. I did this for a major career change in my late 30s. I am now 57 and love my work. My life is not perfect but what I have learned is everyone can use a coach. Even Olympians have one.
1	I wish I had some advice for you, but I know how you feel! 
1	I feel like that a ton, with a bunch of different situations. I find it hard to deal with people too, sometimes.\n\nEven with things like saying how I feel - I'll tell my friends to take the chance with a possible relationship (or even just a friendship they're particularly nervous about), but then I get too anxious myself to do the same.\n\nIt sucks. Because you can see objectively that it's the best strategy, and have strong feelings about it - but those don't always come out on top for YOU, even if you can communicate them to others.
3	I can't decide if I'm INFJ or ENFJ. What can help?	Ive always thought i was INFJ. I took the real,  paid MBTI test about 6 years ago and recieved INFJ. ive taken the free version a couple times since then and still recieved the same. I relate incredibly much to other INFJs and to the Functions they use.  But yesterday i re-took the test.  ENFJ. \n\nIve been trying hard for the past year to work hard on myself and fix many of the issues i have.  i made new friends,  i am figuring out what i want in life,  I'm overcoming my anxiety and depression. \n\nFor some reason i have never read about ENFJ before now and it has me questioning everything. I relate also so much to you folks and i need a way to decide.  What if i was just an unhealthy ENFJ this whole time?\n\nthank you very much :)
7	They look pretty much similar, the difference is Ni dom or Fe dom. if you are looking by stereotype, both look the same except :\n\n- INFJ isnt as emotionally expressive, in fact look more distant or logical with stranger. \n\n- INFJ has contradict desire either pleasing others or not to.\n\n- INFJ feel like they are complex and hard to understand why they are contradicting. \n\n- INFJ is more likely to self-reflect (unless ENFJ has illness that discourage them from going outside, they will often self reflect) \n\n- ENFJ is more pushy, more willing to take assertive action. \n\n- ENFJ has clear idea what to do with people and outwardly more decisive.\n\n- ENFJ is more natural and subconscious in their speech, INFJ looks like they are planning first before speak. 
1	Oddly enough I am struggling a lot with this today as well. I also took the MBTI and received INFJ. I took the online one multiple times and was always INFJ. However it has been a while since I had taken it, and I’ve had some lives changes that have made me happier & more outgoing. I just today retook the MBTI and received ENFJ. Took me as a surprise, but is a personality test. Although I suppose we are always learning and changing. \n\nAlso a close friend of mine is an INFJ as well. He has told me he actually switches back and forth depending on how introverted/extrovert he is.. not sure if this is possible but definitely interesting. \n\nAs for you, I would just ask if you’ve had any changes in your life? I’ll be following this to see, because I am curious as well. 
1	I tested INFJ for years as well. Then after being in therapy, and figuring out some of my depression and anxiety issues, and after a lot of work on dealing with them, I started testing ENFJ. I think a lot of people who are actually extroverts have social anxiety issues, and they believe themselves to be introverts. They aren't getting energy from spending time on their own and focusing on personal projects, but they're afraid to be around people, which can be especially compounded if you're the type of extrovert who really cares about how people see you.\n\nThinking back afterwards though, it made a lot of sense. My goals have always been family and people oriented. I've always wanted to do work that helps society, and I want nothing more than to have a loving family and to care for them. I enjoyed the idea of being part of a decent group of friends, and prefer group activities. I was just afraid to take part in any of that because of concerns over how I would be perceived and what would happen if I let someone down, so I forced myself to act more introverted, despite it making me miserable.\n\nI don't know how many people who test INFJ were in my position, but I can't imagine it's uncommon for ENFJs with social anxiety issues to believe they are INFJs. Being alone for the majority of our time can limit our ability to use Fe, making our Ni seem dominant, makes us feel introverted, and leaves us plenty of time to focus inwardly, since we're busy shutting the outward world away.
1	Try carefully reading through socionics profiles and seeing which ones you identify with. These are more detailed than MBTI ones which makes it easier to figure out your type.     \n     \n[INFJ by Gulenko](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=IEI_Profile_by_Gulenko) | [INFJ by Stratiyevskaya](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/42491) | [INFJ subtypes](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/44198-IEI-INFp-Subtypes?p=40033&viewfull=1#post40033)    \n[ENFJ by Gulenko](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=EIE_Profile_by_Gulenko) | [ENFJ by Stratiyevskaya](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/42485) | [ENFJ subtypes](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/4845-ENFj-EIE-Subtypes?p=103981&viewfull=1#post103981)    \n\n
18	Do you ever feel a little sad when you say goodbye to friends, even if you know that you'll see them tomorrow.	I always get this little "aaw, we won't see each other for a couple of hours" feeling, was wondering if it was an ENFJ thing. 
4	I hate telling people goodbye, even if I know I'll be seeing them that night lol.
2	Everyday haha! My friends always have a look of confusion and pleasant joy when I give them the biggest hugs even though it’s only been a day but I can’t help it! 
2	Yup. Always!
2	it may not be a universal enfj thing, but i will say this applies to me for sure! :'-)
2	Not really. It's more like enneagram 2 thing than ENFJ
1	Not really, if I'll see them tomorrow... although I feel like that also may be strongly affected by the friendships I have. I'm a grad school student and basically all of my friends from undergrad live across the state or in other states. I also have a group of friends who are closer to my house but still not super close (and they're far-ish from grad school, which is in the opposite direction, making it harder to meet up on evenings).\n\nSo with friends I do see more frequently, like the ones I go to school with daily, although I'd NEVER ditch them or undervalue spending time with them, I'm extremely glad just to be able to see them so often and go off and have fun relatively easily (since we're all in the same place during the day).\n\nI do definitely get sad if it's one of my friends that I don't see as often, though.\n\nAnd if not for the huge contrast in the frequency of me spending time with my friends (some I see 5-7 days a week depending on weekend plans; others it could be months), it would probably make me sad on ALL occasions.
17	Occurrences with the Poor	Less than a minute ago, I was approached my an elderly man in the bus terminal who said he just came from the hospital and missed his bus and needed money so he can get home. He even showed me his wristband from the hospital. I apologized to him and said I didn’t know what I could do. He asked me again and this time, his voice started to break and he sounded like he was about to cry.\n\nIt took every ounce of energy for me to tell him there wasn’t anything I could do. It crushed me to say that. In NYC, I run into less fortunate people all the time and it hurts me to see people suffer like this. However, I’ve been played before when it came to giving money to people on the street and had a fight instigated against me because I bought food for a poor man rather than giving him cash. It’s very hard for me to say “no” to these things but with my past experiences, I had to follow through in the same way out of fear that I was being played. I hate feeling conflicted like this.\n\nI’ve always had a dream of establishing a clinic to treat people who are struggling economically or at least help these people and give them hope to achieve great things. It’s tough and I’m not sure what I wanted to accomplish by writing all this but it’s tough to shake off these kind of things
6	I feel the same. My area has a lot of homeless people and honestly these days you can get in trouble for even handing out food to them. If you give them money, they can get violent asking for more. There is a ton of resource centers that provide help to these people, but they honestly don't really utilize them. Also some of them only want cash for things that aren't out of necessity. Its just not sustainable to provide help to every person, especially if you don't know for a fact whether they are sincere or not. The hospital tag could show the guys story checks out, but you don't know why he was in the hospital. It could be due to substance abuse or whatever. You never know. 
6	Where I live, I get approached by people asking for money all the time, usually when I fill up at the gas station and sometimes in parking lots of stores. It’s usually the same thing for all of them, that their car ran out of gas or they need some money for the bus. I respectfully tell them I don’t have money to give and they go on their way, but I have yet to have someone be aggressive. For me, I never give money, I just don’t believe that it creates a habit that’s sustainable for them to progress in life nor will he help with stopping the influx of panhandlers. What I will do is if I’m close by a fast food place, and they ask if I can get them something to eat, I’ll get them something to eat. 
1	I feel similarly, however I'd like to do this as a lawyer instead.
24	Any ENFJs ever have or had a really hard time breaking up with a SO?	I'm in a relationship and I'm really unhappy. I'm almost positive my unhappiness is tied to the fact that I'm unsatisfied, not getting what I need, and often being walked all over by my SO. I don't think he does it on purpose, but he can be extremely critical of me and sometimes really, really mean. Sparing the loads of examples, it's bordering on if not crossing the line of emotional abuse. Again, I don’t think he’s doing it to purposely be malicious. I think this is just who he is. \n\nHe is a real fixer-upper (As an ENFJ I tend to take on men who need fixing-up and end up tiring myself out) and has had his fair share of lady troubles in the past, including big issues with his mother. We've had a rocky road thus far with breaking up and getting back together, but over the last year we've been trying to seriously make it work.\n\nWe've talked up and down about how he treats me and how I don't like it. He doesn't change. I'm tired of feeling like his mother. I'm tired of being criticized and feeling like his friends or even strangers are more important than I am. I'm not seriously considering a future with him and I'm thinking about other men. My parents and friends don't like him and don’t want me to be with him. I love him, but deep down, I know this relationship is not going to last (and I don't really think I want it to).\n\nMy problem as an ENFJ: I feel like I'm sacrificing my own happiness for his - between his criticalness of me and the too-large portion of my brain I'm using to make sure he's happy, I've spiraled into the worst depression I've ever been in. But, I feel like if I break up with him I'm abandoning him (which he has told me I'm doing when I've tried breaking up with him in the past). I feel like I'm the only one who can take care of him, understand him and help him - he has taken so long to come around to trusting and being secure in our relationship, I feel like if I end things I'm going to scar him even further. I feel guilty even thinking about breaking up with him. I also feel like I'm afraid of making this decision and sticking with it, holding strong that I know deep down it's the right one.\n\nHave any of you ENFJs ever gone through anything like this? I truly believe my ENFJness is what is holding me back from finding what makes ME happy, because I'm truly too concerned with the feelings of my boyfriend. Since we’ve met I’ve lost that ENFJ “spark”. Everyone has told me that I don’t seem like myself anymore. No one around me can grasp why on earth I'm still with this person - it's obvious to everyone on the outside looking in that I'm miserable and why. If anyone can offer any bit of advice or support, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you in advance!\n\n**EDIT: wow, i did not expect so many people to reply and so thoughtfully. thank you all for taking the time to share your experiences and your advice. it's been a really tumultuous journey that i know i need to put an end to. i want to be happy. i know that i can be. i'm thankful for all of your support - i feel now more than ever that i can do this.**\n\n**again, thank you.**
11	hey, i just wanted to say i’m going through this exact thing right now, except as of a couple days ago, i have broken up with him. i felt like his mother, cleaned up after him, took care of his emotional needs, but where was my nurture? I know it’s hard and honestly, we live together so i face the guilt every day until I can find a new place. It’s hard when it doesn’t feel like he’s done anything “wrong”, but in reality, somebody doesn’t need to do something “wrong” to just not be the person you need and want. and that’s ok. that’s just dating, all relationships either end in marriage or breaking up. if you don’t see it ending in marriage, do both of yourselves a favor and end it. \n\ni fantasized about other guys, other futures, became really depressed and anxious, and lost little bits of myself i really valued along the way. since breaking up, and it’s only been a couple days, i feel rejuvenated and free. i already feel that fire we enfj’s carry inside of ourselves reigniting. \n\nyour happiness is first and foremost. it’s a hard concept to put into practice, being the caring and selfless person you are, but it’s necessary for your survival. \n\nlastly, what really sealed the deal for me, after i had broken up with him and felt really guilty, was this quote i saw, this one said: stop feeling guilty for outgrowing somebody who had the chance to grow with you, but didn’t. \n\nwish you all the best. please pm if you need to talk throughout it all, the ups and downs. \n \nedit: something i wanted to add: keep your eye on the future, and how good it will be for you and how much happier you will be, but avoid at all costs thinking about the past. if you think about the past, then you are more likely to get sucked back in with his attempts to get you back, as you will be thinking about all the good times, but ignore the bad times. \n\nexpect that he will try to guilt trip you, either by threatening suicide, calling you cold and evil, saying you’re abandoning him, etc. \n\nexpect that he will put on his good face and start kissing up to you. he will start being really nice, helping out, doing all the things you wished he would have done. just remember, if he does this, that he is now proving he was capable all along of being like this, and yet decided not to be, even though you made it clear that’s what you want. \n\nexpect that he’ll try to negotiate with you. hell try saying “let’s just give it a shot for another month,” etc. be firm and don’t be swayed. \n\nexpect that he’ll try, anyway, to breach the break up. he might still try to hug you, kiss you, etc, he might even say he’s only doing it because he just feels sad and really needs to be comforted right now, stand firm and, if it’s something you’re comfortable with, then don’t let it go too far. (i recommend not allowing it at all) when he does this, he’s trying to tap into that part of you that really hates to see someone sad and really wants to take care of them. it’s probably not conscious, but nonetheless, don’t be taken advantage of. \n\nsorry for writing so much 🙄
2	Wow, slightly similar situation, but I have a friend who I feel quite similar about. Everything you described I can relate to. The fact that he’s a fixer upper, has baggage from other people in his life, etc. Doesn’t trust anyone and always talks about how everyone in his life leaves him (and I have witnessed this happening and I’ve always been the one who has been there for him and reassured him that it’s not his fault). He’s a really nice guy and doesn’t criticize me or anything, but he has a ton of emotional baggage that he refuses to get help for because he won’t help himself. I feel like the friendship is really dragging me down, but I can’t bare the though of leaving him like everyone else. I think he actually thought I was different and was gonna stick around unlike everyone else in his life. It’d break my heart to prove him wrong. He was truly one of my closest friends and I love him, it’s just a difficult decision to make. So I feel you, OP. Sometimes the best decision to make is the hardest one and you just have to rip the bandaid off before you backpedal and change your mind once again. 
2	I had issues with this in my first few relationships.  One time I had felt like if I didn't stay in the relationship, my partner would want to commit suicide or something.  The thing is though, you shouldn't restrict yourself to being with someone entirely for their sake.  It turns into a toxic relationship that will end up putting a lot of stress and pain on you as a person.  In fact, you end up being their caretaker, not their partner.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI eventually began to tell myself "pick your poison".  I weigh out the situation.  On one hand if I broke up with my partner, they'd be devastated and do something dumb like suicide.  On the other hand I would essentially become their slave and bend to their every beck and call for the rest of my life, being utterly miserable til the end of days.  So one thing is basically instantly ripping off the bandaid right away, and the other is like a super prolonged ripping of the bandaid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's my advice to you.  People are responsible for their own happiness.  Relying on other people to bring you happiness is not sustainable.  You can't control how people behave or act, and it's not your responsibility to.  The things your partner does is definitely not on you.  If they use you as an excuse to feel sorry for themselves or blame you for whatever situation they are in, that's not on you.  There needs to be reasonable accountability.  You can't hold yourself responsible for the dude's feelings and actions because whatever they do is THEIR decision.  People often feel guilty when shit happens and blame themselves for things they can't control.  I felt extreme guilt when my ex told me that they'd kill themselves if I left them.  In the end though, I came to realize that if they chose to do something like that because I felt we were incompatible, then that's something they chose to do.  I can't put blame on myself for indirectly "causing" it, and I deserved happiness as much as anyone else.  Understanding that what you're doing is not out of any malicious intent and knowing what you're accountable for will help you a ton. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFunny enough, for that particular ex, Cliche is correct, he did attempt to have "one last kiss" and we basically had 3 years of him trying to do more and get back together.  A clean break is recommended and cutting off all contact for a few months will help move things along.  If someone needs to guilt trip you into a relationship, they don't give two shits about you and just want to become a social parasite that feeds off people.  That's not fair to you at all.
1	I have a friend who’s in similar situation. She’s such a great person, so it hurts to see her so unhappy and really stressed out at times. We all make decisions that we regret sometimes, but I hope you find the strength to make those tough choices that will make your life a lot happier in the end.  \n\n\nWe all deserve happiness, the same goes for you OP.
1	I only been in one relationship and the thought of a break up would suck cause I don’t like hurting anyone but if I’m not happy or feel miserable because a person is putting me in a certain situation. I wouldn’t hesitate to leave them. You deserve to put yourself first. I think as a ENFJ we forget that cause we always put others before us. It’s okay for you to move on. Don’t feel bad. 
1	I went through the same thing with my ex. He sucked the life out of me as he grew into a (slightly) better person. He's a fucking man child and I care about him so much but I had to end things. Your happiness is THE MOST important and in the long run you're doing you both a favor. You will find someone who loves and appreciates you as much as you do them, and he will find someone he's actually compatible with. My ex, 3 months later, is still rubbing in my face how he hasn't slept with anyone else and how depressed he is and how he doesn't understand me. I try not to let it get to me but if I knew it'd be this hard I would have broken up with him long before. Good luck with everything, I know you'll make the right decision <3 we here for you 
1	Wow! I can totally relate. I don’t know if this is an ENFJ thing, but I suspect it is, I have issues with setting boundaries and feeling responsible for other people’s feelings and reactions.  I’ve done a lot of reading on codependency and boundaries and some counseling. I think my key learning is that only when I love myself to set boundaries and stay emotionally healthy can I really love the people in my life I care about the most. Once I grasped that, I didn’t feel like I was abandoning people who were actually taking advantage of my good nature.  That freed me to nurture others in a healthy way. 
2	ENFJ-ENFP relationship	I’m in one right now. An unemotional ENFP helps for an emotional ENFJ like me—of course, when I’m willing to actually spill the beans of what the hell is bothering me. The issues are basically stuff against myself, I’m way too much of a stickler for perfection and I end up wanting to shut everyone out when I can’t achieve it (and to think all these years I thought I was an ENTP! Heck. It’s a work in progress now that I know myself better.) Back to the topic, I like to read forum posts about other people’s experiences for fun (and to see if I can apply something new to my own life), and thus this post was born. What’s your thoughts and/or experiences?
2	I find it kind of weird for an ENFP to not be emotional as the F stands for feeler. Haha, I have a bunch of ENFP friends and probably had only one issue with an ENFP that was narcassistic.  I like ENFPs because they are fun to bounce ideas from and get different perspectives.
2	ENFP here. ENFJs are my favorite type, and also the ones that scare me the most. Every interaction I have with them is very intense, there's a vibe they all have that is on a different dimension; it deeply resonates with me. I think it's just the fact that we are so similar in type, but have a totally different cognitive stack. A lot of connection, but a lot of friction. 
1	as a female ENFP who briefly but intensely connected with an ENFJ male, i think that if the ENFJ is willing to open up, it could be a really beautiful relationship. I just found that he was constantly asking me to be authentic and vulnerable which in a connected safe space, i embrace with joy. yet i started to realize how he refused to be either vulnerable or authentic. he gave me a few conflicting statements that just make me believe he isn’t really ready to date for various reasons that make a ton of sense. \n\nthe intensity of the pain is not at all rational for the duration of experience. i hope we can reconnect someday. He was so hot and cold and it really started to hurt and finally the butterflies all died because i was constantly choosing to remain in something that didn’t feel good for me.   Sooo, the only option is to just feel like crap and get through that and then let it go. \n\nHe is a wonderful person though and I hope he is all types of happy. \n\n
2	Fellow ENFJs, how do you cope with feelings of despair?	Hi all. I will try to keep this short and to the point; my life is currently a complete mess in all regards. I'm unemployed, I barely have enough money to get by, and venting to the friends I've helped in the past doesn't seem to do anything, in fact their underwhelming response just leaves me feeling a lil worse after pouring my thoughts on them. \n\nI feel there's no way out. That there's no point in going forward anymore. The fact everyone seems to think I'm happy and strong certainly doesn't help, and I'm sure many of you can relate. Sometimes I just want to be loved, or listened to, but I don't think most of my current acquaitances is willing to be there for me. Why am I perceived as some kind of capable leader when I just don't see the point anymore? Music is pretty much what keeps me going, but it doesn't cpmpletely fill the void anymore. When I'm down like this, I feel the urge to overachieve in order to make up for my shortcomings, but I never do anything about it in the end. How do you motivate yourselves to keep moving forward and living to see one more day?   \n\n\nI'm sure everything will fall into place once I finally manage to get a job. That will cause a domino effect and eventually I'll be happy with my life, I just ran out of motivation to keep trying.   \nSorry if this is too bleak and/or out of place, but I thought maybe you guys could help me or even relate to my words. Thanks for reading :)
1	I get like that sometimes and it's nice to be affirmed and validated when we have these feelings.  Usually if I feel this way, I get to the core of the issue and try to solve it.  When you feel like you aren't achieving the goals you have set for you, it's hard to think positive. It's ok to feel sad and depressed sometimes, as you can't really control some things in life.  My motivation is knowing things will be better because I'll make it better.  In your case, being unemployed seems to be a big oof for you.  Solution is to go out and find a job, any job, just to get by and get that confidence going.  The worst thing for an ENFJ is feeling unfulfilled and not really providing any decent contribution to others.  We are really good supporters, so to feel like you make an impact in some way (be it flipping burgers, retail, desk jobs, or whatever).  My dad use to tell me that when you don't work, you basically don't have anything to do.  Doing nothing is what makes people bored and depressed.  Which is what happens to pets who aren't stimulated mentally and physically.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHappiness comes from doing things that you're passionate about and helping others.  Long term happiness comes from completing goals and tasks as well. I do have my bad days, but knowing I'm a good support for my friends and working to achieve my goals really makes me happy.  Usually things that bring down an ENFJ is not having people they can really connect with, not feeling validated/affirmed, and not having anything fulfilling in life.
1	I can completely relate, I have things knock me down from time to time, and I spiral a fair bit...\nI struggle with it until I have thought through stuff, not always productively, but then once I've had my thoughts go around for a whilst, I just seem to get to work, I set myself a small goal for an hour later, then I keep doing the same thing over n over until I get back I to a productive mind set and set the goals longer term. I do simple things, apply for 5 jobs online over this next 60 minuites, do 50 push ups and 50 pull ups over 60 minuites, make a meal, anything, before you know it things fall into place
26	Not taken seriously	Hi all! Hope everyone is doing well :) And hopefully I can explain this ok...\n\nDo any other ENFJ’s feel like their compliments aren’t taken seriously? I mean because we are stereotypically seen as people who are “too kind” and commonly try to compliment people, people think we are just being nice and we don’t mean them. \n\nI find myself getting frustrated when people assume that when I compliment them it’s not genuine. \n\nJust wondering if anyone can empathize and/or has advice to deal with frustration?
11	Yes, this happens to me!!! I generally find people to be impressive and am excited about their positive life updates, so verbalizing this frequently makes my compliments feel less meaningful. 
7	All the time. And the worst person at accepting my most sincere compliments and words of affirmation? Another ENFJ friend of mine! 
5	I don't have this issue, but it's something I've intentionally worked on as a high performance sports coach. I think the "niceness" of an ENFJ can almost make people uncomfortable who aren't used to complements. In my experience when you balance the positivity and optimism that comes easily to us with a willingness to be brutally candid then people respect your words a lot more.
6	I'm not an ENFJ, so from the other side it's probably a "them problem." I am suspicious of charming people and don't always believe good things people say about me, so I don't think you need to worry about coming across as fake! Being generous with kind words makes you a Good Person, don't stop!!
5	I tell people they're amazing constantly and I always mean it
3	You give the compliments, it's up to other people what they do with them... you can't control how they feel. All you can do is be kind, and be clear that you wouldn't give the compliment if you didn't feel it was earned. The rest is up to them.
2	I cannot count how many times I have been told "you are to nice." I don't have anyway to comprehend that because it is just what I do. I don't think it is us they disbelieve. I think it it a lifetime of not hearing the truth we want to offer. 
0	nope. my words are too convincing most of the time, people have a hard time to reject it. tho i have met one or two "insecure" people who cant feel good about themselves and its really not my problem :) 
7	This song makes my heart happy	
14	Memorable quote from myself in 2015	"People gotta know when to help themselves. Friends and family can provide support but if you aren't willing to take the necessary steps to better yourself,  then you can't expect anything to happen"
5	Yes, yes, yes!\n\nIt's tough love. And tough love is really tough for us ENFJs! 
2	Broke the unspoken rule of not talking about Reddit and posted a screenshot of this post on my social media. This is absolutely perfect. Too perfect not to share with everyone.
5	Halp me fellow ENFJs	
5	An inability and resistance to give time and effort to yourself is getting you to this place IMHO. As an ENFJ who's had life kick me in the balls a few times, I've had to commit to making things like health, well being and self inspection a priority. In answer to your hang up about wanting to control your future - wanting control, period - I always thought that letting go of control of things in my life would be problematic. I've learned that it's not as bad as I thought it would be and it's actually quite freeing.  But you have to. Where you are right now in life is not where you are ALWAYS going to be, and you will get to that point where you realize that those good things you have now really need to be appreciated more while they are still there. I've been there, living the 'life of Riley' so to speak where all the pieces are in place but not being good with myself AT ALL. You may have to turn to counseling, you may have to turn God or spirituality - but my guess is it's one or both of these things. Fill that void, because that void is only going to get bigger (like a cavity hollowing out a tooth) the longer it goes on.
2	I’ve countered this with taking time for self care (self reflection time, meditation, exercise, getting enough sun). Completely not letting the opinions of others guide my actions (true free action). And finally making sure I am doing things for others and giving them great experiences.\n\nThese things seems to all play a role in keeping my mental state at peak. The second one seems to be really important for us. Do not let others opinions drive us. Drive ourselves towards what we want. That plus giving others great experiences through direct free will seem to be a power play for self satisfaction in my experience.\n\nAll of this I realised after  examining the shadow and how it manifests in our lives. 
7	just wondering how ENFJs would respond to this	[u/throwaway3n1p](https://www.reddit.com/u/throwaway3n1p) and I are currently working on gathering answers for how thought processes work in different MBTI types. This is just out of curiosity, not an attempt to stalk you according to how you think of grave crimes. All replies are appreciated!\n\nIf we count judgments of *moral obligation* out of the equation, \n\nQuestion 1: How is murder logically fine?\n\nQuestion 2: How is murder logically wrong?\n\nNOTE: Feel free to write down whatever thought you have, whether it is emotional or just plain retarded.
4	Well there’s no “fine” or “wrong” with logically. Laws and stuff are all emotional at the start. \nPeople don’t want to lose their loved ones, religion, people feeling no one has the “right” to take another humans life. \nGood reasons, but emotionally driven. 
2	I'm gonna go with logically is the wrong word. Also, by murder do we mean the legal term, or simply the killing of another human being? There are some terms that need to be defined here first before I can give an opinion. 
1	Question 1: If the ends justify the means.\n\nQuestion 2: If they don't justify the means.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I'm not an ENFJ, just stalking.
17	Becoming an improved version of our past selves	So I'm always looking for things to improve. How to get better at things, how to be better with people and in life. I'm never satisfied with the status quo, and I always hope for a better, brighter future.\n\nWhat are the things you constantly improve on personality wise, and how do you work on them? What drives you to improve on these things specifically?
9	Self expression is big for me. Being able to fluidly go from thought to reality to another person. I practice by writing and playing instruments. Conversations with others. Drawing. It can always be improved. I basically want others to feel the intense emotion I feel and show them what I am inside. Clear and cut channel to you
5	Great questions! \n\nI was a very emotionally closed off ENFJ until just recently. 3 years ago I moved to the other side of my state (roughly 780 miles away) for school. I was thrown out of the comfort of having my family be my everything, to having to take care of myself completely. While at said school, I started going to therapy (at request of my then girlfriend, now ex). Therapy truly helped me to open up, to be able to express how I was feeling, to the world. I was always the type of guy that would say "I'm doing fine, let's talk about you and your feelings," even when I wasn't feeling fine. Long story long, it was brought to my attention that I needed to open up more and share my thoughts and feelings, and I did, and I've been a better person for it ever since.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've been practicing this new version of me by being as open and honest with my communication as possible, with everyone. Sometimes it's hard for me to do, but I eventually find the courage to speak my truth. I've found it's a lot harder on the psyche to hold onto negative (or even positive) thoughts and feelings rather than letting them out and sharing them with the world. I love sharing positive things with people, and it doesn't necessarily have to be about me. It makes me so happy when I could bring a smile to someone's face from my genuine positive words.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat drives me to continue this path of open, honest communication? The huge sigh of relief feeling I get when I've said something that was bothering me, or the fantastic mood I create for myself when I compliment someone on something I genuinely like about them.
4	Being kinder and not giving advice unless I am asked for it. Just because I can see clearly why someone is stumbling isn’t for me to point out unless they come to me and really want help. 
3	Communication, self-reflection, and being more forward. Thanks to my friends, I grew to become a more confident speaker and try to have that expand to things such as writing, public speaking, and being a conversationalist.\n\nI try to be more mindful with self-reflection and understanding my actions. It helps me to learn from my mistakes and take the necessary steps to improve my character. \n\nBeing more forward is something I struggle with but also want to improve more than anything. More specifically in the area of having the courage to tell someone how I truly feel about them. This is something that has eaten at me when it comes to romance and I keep trying to gain the confidence to one day not feel hesitant when it comes to those moments.\n\nI find ENFJs to always wanting to be the best they can do I’m glad I can read similar responses that others focus on
4	I'm constantly improving on how i deal with my surroundings, especially negativity and how to process it properly. I'm always looking for ways to improve myself mentally and physically and i try to apply that towards my social circles
17	Have you ever loved someone when there was initially no sparks?	I was wondering if anyone has been on a date/ started seeing someone and there were no signs of sparks? \n\nI'm currently seeing someone and although he's extremely extremely friendly, caring and a hard worker- I don't feel my heart racing/ butterflies like I did with my previous partner. We get along super well, very balanced and a lot of laughter. Is this something that can grow over time? 
27	It definitely is, but it's also a constant compromise. I have NEVER had a spark with my husband. We have been together 11 years. I respected that man from day 1, and that is something I had never felt before. Our morals, ideals, hobbies, all connect. \n\nThe sex life is where things get iffy. We have never had a real great one. We never want it at the same time. We are never in sync. When we DO have sex, it's actually pretty damn good. But it is a constant internal compromise of "do I give in just to get some sex for the first time this week, even though I'm not in the mood?"\n\nThe spark is sexual compatibility. The rest is the actual relationship. I am sometimes frustrated, but otherwise very very happy that I chose the relationship as a whole.
4	Yes. The INFJ girl I am dating was attractive and  interesting in first and second date, but only on the third date when we met alone and could touch and explore each other did sparks come. 
2	I haven’t. But to me personally I feel like it’s important. I wish there were more resources and information about the “spark” and what it really means though.
2	I am in an early stage of the same scenario- my partner and I have been together for a year an a half and are about to graduate college, and it's so weird for me to think about my relationship from another perspective.  We were and are best friends, get along very well, have very similar morals and dreams for our futures, but it really does feel spark-less in that regard and it frustrates and sometimes depresses me that I found someone who I can connect with in so many ways but maybe not the most visceral.  She's generally the one to initiate, and when we do have sex it's alright but it usually feels more like a chore...\n\nDo you have any tips on how to enjoy ourselves a little more?\n\nEdit- This was supposed to be a response to u/HotCuppaTeaOof , my bad!
2	A therapist once told me if you’re marrying for love, it won’t work. The respect for the person and the relationship is just as, if not more important that the “sparks” 
2	I was in a relationship where this was the case, we were together for 2.5 years and overall it was great. Although there was no spark, he was more like a best friend to me and I did whatever I could to make him happy, and that included having sex when I was extremely tired and even then, it wasnt the best sex of my life. I think I was blinded by his kindness and love to think that there's a spark between us, but looking back, I think I was trying to do whatever I could to believe in what he wanted to believe, that we were a couple with really good chemistry. It was really hard getting out of that relationship, only because I didn't want to hurt him at all. He's still one of the nicest guys I've met
1	Interesting post. Funny how you can meet someone and have an instant connection.  That happened to me recently, and it had been a long time.  But she did not feel the same.  I think it’s hard to find the mutual attraction thing.  And then, even if you do, it had to be maintained.  I think it comes from knowing ourselves well and then finding some of ourself in another...
1	I experienced that. When I first started dating my boyfriend I didn’t feel any sparks or and my feelings towards him were definitely not strong. However, the longer we dated the more I fell for him. We’ll be 7 years together this year. 
1	I was actually more interested in my fiance's roommate than him when we all first met.  The roommate made good first impressions and we seemed to have a lot in common.  However, that's like within the first hour of meeting them.  The more I talked to both of them, the more I gravitated towards my fiance.  Much later on, found that the roommate was not what I thought he was and turned out we don't really get along.  So I'd say, if you don't feel anything after a month of dating, then it's better not to force it if you don't feel it.  That said, my situation was that after talking to my fiance for several hours, sparks flew like crazy and it just went uphill from there.
36	this quote hit me. what are your thoughts?	"One can promise actions, but not feelings, for the latter are involuntary. He who promises to love forever or hate forever or be forever faithful to someone is promising something that is not in his power."\n\n\~ Human, All Too Human by Friedrich Nietzsche
5	To be faithful is action though, isn't it? Not feeling. One can be tempted otherwise but decide against it. I would also say that Love is a movement of the will. Love is the decision that you are willing to sacrifice for the good of another regardless of how you feel at the moment. Otherwise, it's not love; it's just a warm fuzzy feeling.
4	That is so human. ❤
3	I love that. And my thoughts are that this quote perfectly captures what’s beautiful about emotion. You can make yourself take action for any reason or combination of reasons, but true feelings, genuine feelings, are just what come to you and are inherently who you are. They’re pure.
3	Wow this hit me hard as someone who's recently made the decision to leave a long term relationship (we were engaged). 
3	Nietzche has a lot of good ones, usually those that predict the future (and came true). For this one I'd have to read the book itself, because you can never tell if he's being genuine or a sardonic ass.
2	Disagree. Even action isnt under our control, nobody knows when we are gonna die or get sick. 
6	How do I approach an ENFJ?	Hey, just a lonely INTP here. I've heard that our types are almost perfectly matched although I've never actually been close to one of you guys. So I have a few questions that might sound dumb, but the curiosity is eating me alive so I need to at least ask. Please be gentle, and honest, and objective, thanks.\n\nAssuming I chance upon one of you in the wild, how do I safely approach you to start a conversation? \n\nIf I do end up forging a connection (over time) that I feel is genuine, how do I tell you that I'm interested in you romantically?\n\n
8	You are approaching the master of socialisation and emotions. Relationship is our field, no need to worry on how to get into one with us. Just make sure you exist and stay within our range (visible to our eyes) then the "fate" will fall upon you.\n\n\nYou can confess directly, no problem. We genuinely treat people nice and if you are nice, higher chance we'll like you back. 
3	Assuming I chance upon one of you in the wild. Hahah that’s great I thought of Pokémon. \n\nBe yourself. Be honest. They will get you talking just be near them
1	I agree with everyone here, BE HONEST with your self, with your feelings, your surroundings, everything! I think that what makes us fall in love with someone because we are the realists of the world. If you'd like to romantically express yourself, I think the direct approach is the best way since we love "love" - this shouldn't be a problem :) all the best! 
28	Do you think it is an ENFJ trait to have empathy with animals (not just puppy eyes) and inanimate objects? I once genuinely apologized to a barstool for knocking into it.	
6	I don’t know if this just applies to everyone but I’ve always noticed this connection when it comes to dogs and babies. Whenever I’ll walk by a dog who is maybe barking, or has their head turned the opposite direction, or is panting, they’ll look in my direction with their ears down. Their eyes will track me and they’ll try to walk in my direction. \n\nSame thing with babies. They’ll be crying, or show some kind of distress and when I walk by, they always look make eye contact and smile/laugh. I see this happen *consistently*. Not sure if it’s just an ENFJ thing but it’s an interesting pattern 
4	I apologize to inanimate objects all the time. People chalk it up to my Canadian Ness but I suspect it also has to do with an enfj :) 
2	Totally. I once was on a road trip with my family and I had a cup of ice that I didn’t want anymore, so I contemplated throwing the ice out the window and felt so bad that it would be stuck in the middle of nowhere all alone.... 
2	ENFJ are so cute 🤗
2	I'm British so apologising to literally everything is pretty much part of my cultural heritage 😄
2	I wanted to be a vet initially and i'm an ENFJ so perhaps haha
3	I know of an enfj that has names for all her home appliances like Elena the hard working dish washer.  \n\nWhen one breaks she goes out and get the same appliance again. Even when it's the 3rd time to break because she feels emotionally connected to it.  \n\nI as an infp find this behavior very strange. 
1	Seems INFPs are infinitely more likely to cry over animals than any other type.
1	have never done this
1	Maybe a weak, broad Fe skew, but I doubt you're singling anyone out with that. ENTP and I do feel sorry for objects that shouldn't draw my sympathy.
6	Have you ever met an INFP you didn't like? Actually, couldn't stand?	Serious question and don't be afraid to get detailed on why things crashed and burned. Even I can only take the self-absorption of Fi for so long from other INFPs before I bounce out and seek out an Fe user. I know ENFJs have their limits too and a 'kind of' doorslam, just not as hard as the INFJ. What pushed you to bounce?\n\nEdit: I'm an INxP, and don't mind some straight talking.
8	Honestly, I love INFPs, and they’re my favorite friends and partners. At the same time, they tend to see the world first through the filter of who they are and what they need. Which can be pretty frustrating when your personality is about constantly working to be considerate about their needs, especially when it doesn’t always translate the other way by default. 
4	One of the best friends I ever had was an INFP. But she was a toxic and narcissistic one. Always with the subtle put-downs, making me feel like I was less than human, constantly needing alone time, but also being overly-needy, constant angry out-bursts...\n\nI could go on.\n\nBut after the last angry outburst in public which humiliated me, I was done trying to help her.\n(And since then I have learned what a real friend is supposed to be. Now I have better friends and am well-read on narcissism and toxicity)\n\nYears later she is still lonely and miserable with only one friend because she pushes everyone else away with her awful and childish behavior.\nAND she still trying to get into contact with me to try to have me in her life again smh.\n\nBut despite this, I still adore INFPs.\nI’m currently crushing on someone who I believe to be INFJ/INFP.
1	I was married to an INFP. He was very narcissistic and self absorbed. He was abusive and started to isolate me. But I’m the beginning and during the good times...oh boy, they were great. He was talented and creative and romantic and charming. But the bad was too bad. He was as intense as I was and it just evolved into a toxic codependent mess until one evening I left and then asked for a divorce. The separation was surprisingly smooth. It almost made me wonder if I was making the right decision. I’m so glad I left. 
1	Nope. But I have had problems with INFJs, with which ENFJs are supposed to be very compatible.
1	Survey on Personality and Flirting behaviors	Hey I am a doctoral Student at a University in the South. I am studying flirtation behaviors, specifically trying to catalog specific flirting behaviors taken from several experimental studies. I was wondering if I could post to this community as it seems relevant to my topic. Thank you in advance for taking the time to take the survey there is an opportunity to win a gift card if the entire survey is completed. You can back out at any time.\n\nHere is the link to the survey\n\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JMQP5PJ
1	This survey is too long man... But I did it anyway
2	How to turn it off?	Empathy always causes me to forgive others when they abuse me. How can I scale back the empathy and quit giving so damn much of me? 
7	Set boundaries and when you see red flags you peace out. I use to help tons of people who basically were lost causes. I learned to be a bit more selfish and know how to recognize bad ppl. Suppressing feelings and parts of yourself is not healthy. It's not fair to you to have to feel like you need to cut off parts of who you are cuz of ppl who take advantage of you
1	I found this so helpful, thank you! 
1	It's hard to turn it off but def setting boundaries and knowing you are not a superhero helps.

2	I felt like the HR manager is an ENFJ.	
2	I’m currently studying HR Management (will graduate in a few months) in a class of 29 people and a lot of us are ENFJs. How the HR Manager in this story handled the situation is exactly how it should be done. You want the employees to perform at their best so if they aren’t happy in their job/not producing their best work, you do what you can to help them, even if that means they will leave. Then at least you won’t have someone miserable and non-productive in the workplace. It’s a win-win for the employee and the business if you are compassionate and practical about what is best for both of you.
89	You are worthy of love... but so am I	
12	Wow. That hits close to home. 
9	Are all of us like this?
2	Shit
1	This is a nice quote. 
1	Love that.
1	Ouch. My heart...
1	This. Damn.
1	I can definitely relate to this
1	Is this a healthy way to go about relationships? If not what can we do about it?
8	What makes a connection authentic in your eyes? what are the qualities that look/expect on those authentic connections?	
3	Answering it shortly, I think all interactions are authentic. If someone is willing to talk deeply, that’s great and I value those interactions very deeply in my life. If someone is trying to take advantage of me, I tend to pick it up rather quickly- but I still see it as an authentic decision to act negatively, and I’ll know better in the future when interacting again with that person.\n\nAfter having met a lot of people, I realize that some people don’t open up much compared to others, but to them it might be opening up a lot. So I suppose for me, a connection is authentic if the other person is making the effort to connect with me. Qualities might include taking consideration of what I say, even if they agree or disagree; being at least somewhat engaged in conversation; taking time out of their busy day to meet once in a while.
8	Trying to be more ENFP	I fit the criteria and characteristics of an ENFJ down to the bone. Though, I believe I take life a little too seriously at times, and can be too organised and self-composed.\n\nENFPs are similar to ENFJs, yet seem to take life a lot less seriously. They appear a little more laid back and “go with the flow”.\n\nTherefore, trying to be a little more ENFP could potentially help me to be a little happier. Any thoughts?
4	I totally get it as a fellow ENFJ. Maybe you should post in ENFP subreddit? I wish I knew how to take everything less seriously, too :)
4	Aww no! How come you think being organized and self-composed are negative things??\nI’m an ENFP and my best friend is ENFJ and the things you described, are things I really look up to her for.  She teaches me so much about how to be more grounded, more real, more meaningful. \n\nBut now that you mention it, maybe since I saw these as your strengths I haven’t fully considered how it weighs on you...\nAre you really hard on yourself? Like you feel you _have_ to be organized and self-composed for other people? (I’m just trying to understand to see if I might be able to help. )\n\n
3	Don’t try to be more ENFP. IMO ENFJs are highly underrated. Just do a Google Image search for ENFJ and look at the overwhelming INFJ and ENFP results. My suggestion to you is to spend less time in dominant Fe/planning, and more time allowing Ni to develop your perceptions more broadly. Good advice for pursuing this can be found via the Personality Hacker website and podcast. Good luck. As an ENFJ, I’ve found more free-flowing, laid-back and expansive worldview by relying on my version of intuition (Ni). An ENFP’s version of intuition (Ne) will never fulfill us ENFJs. If anything, an ENFJ trying to force Ne might just feel selfish in the end. Go with Ni. Long live the ENFJ!
2	Why would you try to be someone else?
11	I got some awesome responses when I last posted a video... I (INFP) made this with my friend (ENFP) and we're sharing it with other NFs, hope you like it! :)	
4	Hahaha, I love this, just subscribed. Keep up the great work !\n\n\n\n\nPs: you're adopted. 
38	A new lease on life - Shamed into being INFJ & becoming my true self, ENFJ	I feel like a new person.\n\nI learned about the MBTI a decade ago when it was a requirement at work. The results were INFJ, and they rang true to me. As time passed, I even married an INFJ and became the admin of a meet-up group for INFJ’s. \n\nBut about 3 years ago, in the marriage, I realized how different my now ex and I really were. I loved him unconditionally. I have hope and optimism even when in the midst of extreme circumstances. Sex is critical to me. He was the total opposite in these things and so much more as soon as the honeymoon was over, even though he acted like they were real traits of his previously. We went to counseling, and the chasm of disparity was as wide as the ocean, so we got an annulment. \n\nI kept going to counseling and retook the MBTI a few months ago. ENFJ-A was the result. I didn’t believe it and wouldn’t consider it. \n\nTime passed. I have grown a lot and realized that I was shamed throughout my childhood about my intensity, my emotions, need for people, my artistic mind, etc. to the point that I shut down and changed who I was. I don’t do that anymore.\n\nSo last weekend after creating six new paintings in two days - yes, amazing - after not creating for soooo long, I was over the moon with exuberance. I prayed to be a beacon of light to all around me, and I got a nudge to retake the MBTI. I did, and I got ENFJ-A again. This time, I read through all the results, and it all fits. The weaknesses, how I operate best at work, etc.\n\nSo I came in here to proclaim how freaking happy I am that I finally found my tribe, where I won’t be told I am intimidating because of my accomplishments, where I won’t be shamed for my large romantic gestures, where I won’t be told I’m a weirdo for my pursuit of the best for myself and the whole human race.\n\nBe yourself. Be love. 
4	What an uplifting story! a fellow ENFJ says hi \^\^ 
5	What a beautiful story! Keep being true to yourself :D
4	So cool. Yea I test both ways I think I go back and forth between e and I depending on how my life is going. I tend to be more introverted but also love people and talking with them. In the end it is just a label and I am another person unique in so many ways. No mould could describe how I am
2	Welcome!!  Since you have experience in leading, are you open to a mentorship to a fellow enfj?  
2	I am also an ENFJ-A, don't ever feel ashamed to be yourself no matter what others think! It makes being yourself and living your life the way you want to so much more enjoyable and satisfying. I used to feel "off" when I was told I was intimidating and my old partner never enjoyed the work I put into big things that were important to me that I wanted to share with him. Now I found someone who absolutely adores all of my traits, it's wonderful!
24	So i just found out im an enfj.	So are we like the "personal growth" addicts? Like how can we be better at everything we do and how can we make everyone else be better at everything they do?
12	I definitely find myself to always strive on ways to improve myself. My primary focus in on always improving my communication skills and being personable to everyone I meet. I also tend to be conscious of my appearance because I think that ties in with the confidence and my energy with those I interact with.\n\n  \nFocus on improving the traits that you tend to use the most often. It's really about self-awareness and making an effort to improve upon your weaknesses. Practice self-discipline, set goals, and be transparent with yourself. In regards to helping other people, be enthusiastic and give them words of affirmation. Being genuine is the biggest thing here and it will lead to a lot of good if you speak from the heart. If they look nice, tell them. If you miss talking to them, tell them. If you care about them, tell them.
5	(ENFJ Male here) The best way for you to help others in my opinion would be a couple of things. First focusing on yourself and making an honest effort to improve your own situation. Second is to listen to others and let them know with social ques that you actually have a genuine interest in them. That’s where you can get others to open up initially. The last part is the hardest and that is to ask the right questions when they seek advice or your conversation goes to an abstract topic. My dad always used to say he judges a man based on the questions he asks not his answers. And as I have gotten into college this has applied the more mature I became. The more you try to help others the more they dig in their heels. However because we read motivations so easily ask the question that they themselves are not seeing right in front of them. Just make sure you know them somewhat well before you try and help in a way like that. BTW, Glad to have another ENFJ in the fold! Welcome!
2	For me personally I try to do everything more, whether it’s work, school, hobbies or even relationships I always try to put in more effort than anyone is used to. Sometimes it’s not taken well and everyone thinks I’m trying to suck up to whoever’s  in charge or in the relationship aspect sometimes it can make the SO feel like they aren’t contributing enough, which is a very shitty feeling and I’m still trying to work that part out. \n\nAs far as bettering people around us, I just try to be as understanding as possible, if people around you feel comfortable they tend to do better and that applies for most things in my experience. 
1	Yep. Personal growth addict right here. I am always consistently every day trying to make improvements in all aspects of my life; not only to help me but also to help others. Though I’m mainly aiming to be more self-sufficient these days.\n\nI’m always learning new recipes, watching educational yt videos, and reading books and articles on/offline of various subjects, etc just so I can be the person I know I can be capable of being.
3	reasons why I like ENFPs as partners or friends even though an online article told me it was a bad pairing	thoughts?\n\n\n1) our 1st and 6th functions complement each other. I like that the primary lens that my partner uses through life is a vital tool in my method of critique and self improvement and vice versa. \n\n2) my Se drives me to maintain the tangibly pleasing environment that the ENFP envisions and desires from Si, or to help them turn dreams into plans in general.\n\n3) their Fi gives them strong boundaries about what they're comfortable with; I know I won't get ahead of myself making decisions because they'll let me know if they really want it another way.\n\n4) my Ti is satisfied because they make me feel logical and structured when other types may see me as chaotic or erratic. I don't mind being the weird friend but it's nice to have an ENFP around who gets me.
3	ENFJs in sales	I am now in the sales side of my industry after 20 years of experience in the administrative side of the business.  So I have a solid grasp on the actual industry itself, but 0 sales experience.  Any of y’all in sales?  If so,  how have you used our enfj style in your cold calls?  
2	I work in sales, but not really in the cold call industry. At least, my strength is not in cold calling. I rely heavily on leads. I am really good at closing just about any lead that comes my way, but I suck at true cold calling because all I can I think about is how much the person I am calling doesn't give a damn about our services. I feel like that because I hate when people try to sell to me like that. \n\nMy previous job, that I miss a lot, was more of an account management sales job. Our company sold huge manufacturing equipment projects, and after it was installed I was the customer's point of contact for getting replacement parts, drawings, etc. I thrived in that role, but left for a job that pays more. I often think about going back because that position really maximized my individual strengths. No cold calling. It was awesome.
2	I cold call daily as a lead generation source (I do residential real estate sales). I would say my personality really comes out when I empathize with others and get them to open up about their situation by asking them meaningful questions and shifting my tone depending on how they’re responding and what they’re saying. I use empathy and tonality a lot on my appointments and calls. Every enfj is different tho, so just study the best and go with whatever you feel most comfortable with.
11	Thoughts about infps	It'll be nice if you guys could give feedback on us INFPs,maybe focusing on the good/ bad qualities of them in depth(if possible) ,also maybe first impressions when meeting them,your experiences with them as well. On a side note,you guys are lovely ❤
5	Good listeners and authentic people. If you look up INFP in the search bar of the sub, you’ll find A LOT about what we think about them
3	Very good listeners, open mineded and self sacrificing but a bit too introverted, have a very poor ability of confrontation and a bit too sensitive, I've only had 2 infp friends and this is how they were
2	ngl this comes up every week or so in this forum. just search it man. 
2	good as friends 
2	Smart and adorable and (ime) kinky until you say something they disagree with
0	We love to eat INFP betas for breakfast
1	Milton Friedman - do you know a smarter intp?	
13	ayn speed dating	
49	As an ENFJ, does anyone else feel they hide their true self to protect/please others. I find it is hindering closeness with others. Thoughts?	I have always felt like there is a whole world inside me that I hold back from most of the world. I only let some people in once I truly trust them  to see who I really am. I am super self aware when I am around new people, especially people that I have "put pressure on" to impress... which is something else I do a lot - romanticize people and relationships. Also , I'm always trying to keep relationships "perfect": acting nice, and trying to seem chill and fun. But when people really *really* know me, they see I have a whole range of states -- from super fun and light hearted to a full-rath-rage that can easily be tickled lol. I wish I could show all of me old and new friends alike, but I don't want to let anyone down. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo as an ENFJ, I think this make sense but it also contradicts itself. Because being an extroverted type we of course want to be around people. But I think the people pleasing/giving qualities put pressure on us to always be performing and providing the entertainment. Which in turn makes us nervous about letting people down, makes us keep our guard up, and keeps us from what we need -- which is authentic connection. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoes anyone else feel this way?
15	The guy i’m seeing right now is like this. I complimented him once on who he “truly was” behind the front he puts up and he started crying... y’all are really beautiful people, and it’s really important for you to know that. You can show who you really are!! The world will only be better from it. :) 
12	I completely get this! I'm super open but I was in a relationship with a guy who was just so, so different. It made me more quiet and contained and although I loved him, I could be more open with my friends than I was with him. He came from an abusive childhood and was very negative about the world, and as an ENFJ, it completely suppressed me and made me hide my emotions (even though he didn't have any intention of doing that) But I feel like as ENFJs we can suppress/let out all of our emotions and true selves depending on who we are with 
8	I often do this. I am at heart a people pleaser and I often feel like if I let my true self show then it won't be pleasing. Like, most people don't know that with a select few people I am way different than I am with others. I do that because those few have shown their unconditional love for me and that gives me the freedom to be me. It really is a sad testimony that I don't feel comfortable being myself around others but it is the truth. 
11	To all those saying “yes we are like this”... well yes, an underdeveloped ENFJ is.\n\nAt the most, different people should spark slightly different sides to you – this is normal. You won’t (re)act the same to different people. Humans interact a bit like chemicals in this way. However, if you find yourself changing your core values or completely flipping who you are and how you act around particular people, either or both of two things are happening:\n\n1. You are unbalanced and unsure of yourself.\n2. You are hanging around somebody you shouldn’t be hanging around with.\n\nHow to resolve this? Develop more of a thick skin and unapologetically get what you want out of life too. Also recognise that confrontation isn’t always a bad thing. You will not live forever.
5	I'm an ENFJ as well and yea I feel like that a lot. I tend to put my negative emotions like anger or annoyance aside in order to appear "correct" socially when dealing with someone. Especially with people I see everyday but are only acquaintances. I think it's because we want to be liked by everyone and we want people to judge us positively. We always want to make a good impression. \n\nTo be fair, only my true friends and my boyfriend (him even more) see my real me, like the nice and empathetic but moody and anxious bitch me ahah. And still, I always feel bad showing them this side of me and tend to apologise for being moody most of the time. I overthink social interactions where I felt I've been mean or socially bad to someone.\n\nAlso, I feel like I can adapt to everyone but it's not always the real me they're seeing, it's more like I'm trying to please them by being someone they would get along with. Needless to say this interaction never becomes friendship. \nI think I act like this cause I want everyone to feel themselves and accepted although paradoxically I am not being myself when doing this.\n\nIt's an interesting behaviour..
4	Totally can relate.  I don’t necessarily feel I hide part of myself to please others. It more like to protect myself and only have those worthy enough to share me with me lol if that makes sense 
3	Ditto. 
3	SAME!\n\nI'm very selective of those I want to be around with because I "feed" on their energy, meaning that I end up mirroring them sometimes if I end up hanging out with them too much. 😅 To the point that I once nearly lost myself because I tried to hard to be someone else and nearly became someone else. \n\nIt feels unfair though, because there are people who seem more genuine, people end up liking them more. ._. But, it's hard to be that sometimes because there's the vulnerability that comes with being open and genuine. \n\nSo lately, everytime I feel that way, I tell myself that "it's okay" and then try to not wear my mask so tightly. And so far, I found a few friends that I can be a bit more open with. 😊 So you have a point there
2	I can completely relate. Now as a young adult, I find my self “performing” less and letting people in a bit more. So far so good!
2	I hid my true self for a long time and it only leads to confusion and pain. It is so much more rewarding to live once you've realized that you don't need to hide your true self from the people that matter. Once you've become comfortable with who you truly are and embrace that person inside and out, your life gets so much more enjoyable. 
2	We all wear masks...metaphorically speaking.
1	YES
1	I'm an ENFJ type 8.. less likely to experience that. but really hope you'll overcome it pretty soon
1	Yes, I can relate to this in some ways.  It's complicated, but in some situations I've felt like I need to 'perform' up to my  reputation..but the more mature I get, the less concerned I am about this. It's an "ENFJ" growing older kinda thing, I think. Maybe it's me feeling more secure in my skin, but I don't feel pressure to impress - I just know I can if I act like who I am. Most of the time I'll be successful, but sometimes I might not be..and that's OK. \n\nWhen I was in my late teens, early 20s..I romanticized relationships - and after that first college girlfriend, it was a dose of reality that I couldn't get along with some people, and that I couldn't make it perfect.. 
1	I relate to this and find I censor myself around certain people because I’m not sure they’ll like me (I come across as very sweet and calm). Once I feel comfortable and trust them I’m more outgoing and funny and that catches people off guard sometimes, which then makes me self conscious, it’s an unfortunate cycle lol
1	you don't have to. you can be authentic. it depends on how you frame your authenticity. people might think you're a little weird. they're probably a little weird too. just be confident about it.\n\nif something about you turns out to be legitimately bothersome, then great, now you have something to work on. people will only think better of you for being better. 
40	Sometimes I wish I wasn’t ENFJ	I wish I could be a more independent and self-serving type sometimes to be honest.\n\nMy kindness is perceived as weakness, childish even by some, (also I don’t know if this is an ENFJ/HSP/etc thing but I also cry easily at almost everything even when I’m angry), and I’ve been hurt by many “friends” over the course of my life. I would help them with their issues and try to be the best friend I can for them and I would NEVER get the same treatment back and would even get abuse back. I now have PTSD about making new friends/romantic relationships/trusting people in general bc it has happened so many times with different people.\n\n(The good news is I have better friends now and have learned what I will and will not tolerate from people. Yet I’m still afraid a lot)\nIt sucks when your type is based around people and helping others and they just keep hurting you and letting you down.\n\nSometimes I just hate being such a “feely” type. I feel like I never get taken seriously and thus get taken advantage of.\n\n\n\nTo be able to just turn my feelings off and the intensity...\n\nTo not have to rely on others, their quality time, their reassurance, etc so much...\n\nTo just be more independent and not feel so alone all the time...\n\nIt would be amazing.\n\n\n\nI HAVE no skin. Couldn’t grow one if I tried.\nWhat’s wrong with me? I feel like this is more than just being an ENFJ thing but idk. Maybe someone can help me?\n\n\nDoes this resonate with anyone?\n(I love this sub, everyone seems really nice and understanding. Like a home. Just thought I’d say)
13	I completely understand what you're saying and have definitely had all of these thoughts before. I wish I was more introverted too and could just be happy by myself. The reassurance thing is so silly, since we tend to get it all the time but want it again and again. I really don't perceive anything to be "wrong" with you, it's just part of the weakness that comes with being an ENFJ. You're just aware and honest with yourself.\n\nAgain, I empathize will all of what you are describing. I'm 23 years old right now and I would say things have been getting a little but easier every year, but falling back into loneliness occasionally is still common. Also the feeling that none of my closest friends do what I would do from them always lingers. Can't fully trust anyone in this world except yourself unfortunately.\n\nPersonally I find that staying active helps a lot with these things: working out, going to school, quality time with friends/family, etc.. The more time I have alone to think the more I get into the type of thought patterns you're describing. \n\nEvery personality type is gonna have some flaws and insecurities, frankly I'm pretty happy with the trade off that comes with being an ENFJ. Keep reminding yourself of your strengths and try to push yourself to be content alone from time to time.\n\nPeace and love
6	I definitely understand what you are saying. I feel like people may sometimes consider me a pushover, or want to take advantage of me simply because I want other people to have what they want. I love helping people, and I want to help them - but sometimes it does take a toll on me.I have a desire to be emotionally independent, but the need for reassurance from others gets in the way sometimes. \n\nMy biggest thing is that I need to be true to myself and others It's so easy, almost natural, to just go along with what everyone else wants and thinks. I find myself nodding along in conversation to people whether it's politics, religion, etc., when in reality I could not disagree with what they are saying more. I just want to hear people out and know that they are heard. I believe it's good to be civil, but I go the extra mile by agreeing with everyone around me just so I don't start a conflict of some sort. I hate confrontation, and I know it's something else I need to work on. I stretch myself thin sometimes, and regret it. I need to learn how to tell people how I truly feel.\n\nI apologize for the ramblings of a twenty-one year old just trying to find his place in the world. But always know that there are people in your corner who are going through very similar trials that you are. Maybe we can help each other along the way.
5	I feek you man, I recently really struggled with all of this, say for 10 months or so. Things git better towards the end of last year. Yes you will grow a thicker skin. I also hated myself for being so emotional, but we shouldn't fight it. This is just how we are,  allow yourself to feel. I decided I'm nit letting anyone tell me shit, if you don't like me then piss off. Worked out fantastic!\n\nNow, I have a girlfriend who understands and loves me for me, I have one less friend, and this made a massive positive impact in my life. Here is why : you know that thing about helping others and all that we do? So I used to do everything for this guy like help him register for University, help him with his assignments, do research for shit he didn't know or understand, I was basically his fucking mother, so one day I said I'm done. We grew apart after, best decision I've ever made. I could focus on myself. And I did, and now life is great.\n\nPoint is, you'll be alright. I think it just take a bit of practice to understand yourself as an ENFJ and hoe to handle it.\n\nCHEERS BROOOO
5	I resonate with your post so much.\n\nI give my all when I love someone. Growing up, I gave all my love and attention to my friends, but not everyone appreciated it. I was called “too intense”. It was quite hurtful, knowing that you’re giving your all but people are turned off by it. It made me build a wall around myself, and I gradually began to fear making friends, as it only resulted in pain and hurt for me.\n\nHowever, things have changed in the last few years. Friends who appreciate me have stuck around. I’ve even gained many friends who appreciate my intensity, my authenticity, my sincerity. I realised that my willingness to be vulnerable and to demonstrate affection - is my strength, as it helps me make meaningful connections and form deep friendships with people. Even older people. Sisters of friends. Colleagues.\n\nLove yourself and don’t be afraid to be YOU. You’ll find people who love you for being you.\n\nOf course, there are still times when I wish I were not an ENFJ. When feelings of despair and acute sadness well up, I struggle to regulate my emotions and I’m completely consumed by these feelings. It feels quite painful, physically so. There were times when I wished I were apathetic, as it could save me so much heartache...
3	Omg, you ENFJs are so special. I wish I knew someone who was ENFJ who could always be there for me and make me feel not alone.
3	Keep doing you. Long term happiness comes from service to others (but not at the expense of yourself).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLoving yourself is extremely important in growing and honestly right now all the doubts come from how you feel you should be due tosocial constructs and the disappointment you feel from people you feel you can depend on.  Just take note that when you help someone, you can't really expect things in return from them. Because you should feel good that you did the right thing, not really expecting stuff in return. Otherwise everything you do is transactional, and not as sincere.  ENFJs do not need to rely on others, we help those in need and the help we provide is enough internal validation we require to press on.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm a full on ENFJ and like throughout life, a lot of things I did, did not come to fruition until years later.  I've not heard thank yous until maybe several years after I provided the help people needed at the time.  Sometimes, people don't know hoe much of an impact you put until soooo much later.  Thus, you never really know how much you do until so much later.  There's nothing wrong with you as aperson.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter all it takes time to know what you want and need out of life.  Currently, you just need to do what you feel is right, and do not put expectations behind it.  I felt the same way you did during my early 20s, and once I reached my late 20s, i heard back from people I dont talk to anymore.  It just feels good to do the right thing and knowing internally, you tried your best to help others. Peeps don't really see the good u do until late in life sometimes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: do things you want to do to be nice without expectations.  IF you like doing what you're doing, continue doing it.  If you expect things to come in return for the deeds you do, it's not as insincere and puts you in reliance of external validation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe point of being who you are is to accept it and let it happen.  Suppressing emotions and feelings, never come out to anything positive.  Feelign is what makes us human and ENFJs do a lot to make good in this world. Rock it, dont hate it.
3	I can really relate to this, as a Type 2 ENFP. I find we have a lot of the same struggles. Oddly enough, someone once wrote a story about an ENFJ friend called "no skin" and I couldn't help thinking about it when reading your post. I think having an anxious attachment style can also make this more difficult, though I don't know if that's the case with you. Happy to chat more if you like, so feel free to send me a PM on here! Hugs!
3	Hi, ENFP here. I totally get it because of the nature of our types.\n\nBoth ENFP and ENFJs are feely, people oriented types. My partner is an ENFJ and we’re scarily similar with how our brains work.\n\nRecently I’ve been having a whole identity crisis, not knowing who I am and feeling sharper and harder — not the bubbly ENFP I usually feel like. When I (not legit) psychoanalyze myself, I see that I have a history in the past 2 years that have forced me to not want to deal with BS anymore. It’s kind of difficult to explain, but I got pushed around a lot in the past 2 years and my body is only feeling it now. It’s kind of scary.\n\nPart of me is glad. The other part of me wishes I was soft as water as I once was. I tell myself that a lot — to stay as soft as water. My partner is one of the warmest and softest people I know, if not the most warm and soft, and I adore her for it. She reminds me of my roots.\n\nIt’s important here to understand that:\n1) your kindness is NOT weakness.\n2) just because you’re an ENFJ doesn’t mean you can’t build into the habit of assertion and standing up for yourself.\n3) your strengths are incredible. My ENFJ reminds me of the good in the world.\n\nIf you want to change, you can, you know. I don’t think you can change your core, but you can practice your assertion in tiny ways and build up. Maybe practice saying no every so often when you don’t want to go out to that party. Take the guilt of doing something for yourself over the resent of giving in to someone else’s wants.\n\nBut just know that your strength to be soft and to be feely and empathetic and kind is something that this world needs. There are way too many cold and sharp people and I’m trying to find the middle line where I can be soft and kind and warm, but never let anyone think that my kindness is weakness.\n\nPM me if you need anything, sending love and warmth to you.
3	I resonate with this so much it’s not even funny. Like, every word you said clicks with me. I’m always there for people when they need someone and I really wish that didn’t get exploited, or that someone would be there for me on the occasions I need them. I don’t even feel that way that much compared to how much I help others, but damn would it be nice if someone helped when I DID feel it
2	Yes, yes and yes.
2	Kenny from Half Baked is definitely an ENFJ, lol\n\nHope things get better for you, man\n\nhttps://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/628381ac-522e-41ed-bb83-ebb45450bd20
1	I can only imagine how challenging it has been. I am an ENFJ too, but I know we all have different experiences. I can relate to people mistaking your kindness for weakness, but one of my friends told me that it's other people's loss if they treat you badly. I have had to learn to not take things personally and I thought it was impossible, because I can feel everything. I'm not perfect at it by any means, but I realized that generally people are just projecting their own emotions or thoughts on me and it has nothing to do with me. I cannot help that I'm sensitive, but I do not have to allow other's emotions to effect me negatively. There is nothing wrong with you. It took me a while to finally accept that, and I am sure you will see that within yourself too! :) ENFJs make-up about 3% of the general population...we are special and are greatly needed. Keep your head-up!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, I meditate twice a day and practice yoga and work-out weekly. It really helps as well to have more peace. :)
1	(INFP) I would like some advice: My sister is ENFJ and sometimes I feel like I come off as selfish to her and make her upset just with random stuff I say. Suggestions for making her feel loved and appreciated?	We are best friends, but sometimes I think I come off as so childish and selfish to her, and it seems to genuinely hurt her. Obviously, the last thing I want to do is hurt my sister, so I'd like some advice on how to talk to her using her language. 
2	I think my sister is the same personality type as you, and I am an ENFJ. We  love each other and are great friends but can butt heads in a dramatic way. \n\nI think she can act selfish and demanding and I don't think she sees my efforts towards being kind. I am sure I am misunderstanding her in many ways too, I know it's not one sided. But from ENFJ point of view, what aways really makes me feel nice is when she offers to help me, is patient, and is more giving than bossy. I feel I try to take care of her without asking so when she does it for me without asking, I feel looked out for. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am not sure if that sounds like your dynamic at all, but I hope that helps!
2	Oh boy. I'm an XNFP and my older sister is an ENFX. It's really hard to avoid the Fe/Fi clash :( \n\nI love her so much and I'd like to make amends with her, however she is in a funk. She is very cynical and depressed. Any advice on how to bring a cynical ENFJ out of the dark and back in to their calm, happy, relaxed state. As an XNFP, it's difficult to agree with her negative comments and she wishes I was less PC "politically correct".

4	ENFJ (f) seeking help with her INTJ man! (x-post from /r/INTJ)	Hello all! X-posting this from /r/intj, but curious to hear the (ENFJ) flipside of the coin!\n\nHi all, apologies in advance for the long post.\n\nI (ENFJ, f) have been dating an INTJ (m) for about 4 months now. We are both in our late 20s. It’s been an interesting experience so far, and would like to gather your opinions on our situation.\n\n*Pros:*\n\n* **I love how intellectual he is** (this is a given, of course). He thinks about many esoteric things that I never consider, which is refreshing; and in turns makes me feel motivated to learn more/read more and discuss these things. (This can sometimes be a con because he is quite frequently in his head and it’s hard to draw him out and come back to reality sometimes). \n\n* **His independence, drive, and that he’s headstrong.** He is so steadfast in his vision that his work ethic is very admirable – he will stop at nothing to get something done, or fulfill his goals. I never have to worry about him not being able to take care of himself, and in turn, makes me want to be there for him/support/spoil him even more. \n\n* **His emotional side.** Oh my gosh, it makes me so squishy inside. 90% of the time he’s stoic, absurd, structured, analytical; but when we are alone and when he sometimes reveals his deep emotions to me, it is intoxicating. I know it doesn’t come natural to him, so I treasure outward expression of his feelings, and try to create an environment that is welcoming and nurturing for these intimate thoughts/feelings. \n\n* **He’s steadfast and reliable.** \n\n* **We communicate well together** – any disagreements are level-headed, mature, goal-oriented and never escalate out of hand. \n\n* **When he wants to be, he can be so charming, thoughtful, and hilarious.** Again, intoxicating. The flipside to this: when he is not in the mood (like 70% of the time), he is icy and disengaged, and I feel a million miles away from him. \n\n\n*Challenges:*\n\n* **Differences in lifestyles.** I work hard and play hard. He works hard and works hard, and plays (somewhat, and only his own terms). I’m in a pretty solid spot in my life – I am very independent, my circle of friends are loving, supportive, I have lots of interests/hobbies, have a strong joie de vivre and try to live life to the fullest where possible. He works works works (which is fine), but I want a partner who I can fully bring into my world, show me his, and have amazing adventures and experience all life has to offer together. He says he’s adventurous, but I have yet to see his side of him – all I’ve seen so far is that he’s often reluctant to get out of his comfort zone, which is kind of a turn off. It makes me feel like I need to meet him more where he is, instead meeting somewhere in the middle.\n\n* **Imbalance of effort:** I feel like I’ve tried to really make an effort to integrate myself into his life, be a positive presence and be warm and loving with his friends. It’s not outside of the realm of who I am to be/do these things, but I make extra effort because these people are very close to him, and I don’t feel like he is the same with people in my life. As a result, his friends quite like me… and none of my friends like him. I see the person who I am dating as an extension of myself (and my choices), so the idea of people who are very dear to me being tepid about him is not an insignificant issue. To clarify: I know the real charm of INTJs come from getting to know who they are and not based on superficial interactions, but we are both in our late 20s and I shouldn’t feel the need to “explain” his inadvertent asocial behaviour to my friends. I know he does not want to come off this way but I don’t think he is socially aware enough to understand how he presents sometimes. \n\n* **Imbalance with regard to the emotional aspects of our relationship.** For me to feel intimate with someone, I need some mutual expression of vulnerability/emotions. I am demonstrative, actively affectionate, vocal, and make an effort to be vulnerable in front of him to help foster a space where he can be that way with me, too. Surprise, as an INTJ, he’s not great at that, and often acts in a way I perceive as aloof/cold like 75% of the time (but the rare occasion when he does act verbally affectionate, I am over the moon). I have a hard time making out if it’s because he’s tepid towards me or because he truly is that stoic. It results in self-doubt about what he thinks about me/us; which can sometimes lead to me being insecure and emotional. I try very hard not to let that affect me because I abhor the idea of being perceived as needy, but bottling my emotions is not a workable solution in the long-term either. Second example: he doesn’t put any sort of label on our “relationship”. He doesn’t refer to me as his girlfriend, or even acknowledges that we’re in a relationship. I respect him enough not to push the issue, but it hurts a bit. All these things make me feel uncared for. \n\n* As a result, I feel like there has been some **stagnation** in our relationship. The way I see it: I would never want to push someone to emote or express something they are not feeling. So to me, if he is not expressing that he wants to be more serious with me, then he is not feeling it. (I understand this may not be the case, and he may actually feel something deeply for me, but how the fuck am I supposed to know if he doesn’t express it? And I will spare the awkwardness for both of us and not try to force it out of him.)\n\n* **The clincher:** he is actively applying to grad school abroad, and is uncertain if he wants to return if he goes. He started this process before we met, so I don’t hold that against him; and I would never stand in the way of his dreams. In fact, I have been very encouraging of him pursuing grad school. But when we first started dating, I asked him what he was looking for, and he said a serious relationship. When I asked him how he reconciled that idea with going away indefinitely to grad school, he said “I don’t reconcile them, they just both exist together”. To me, this speaks volumes: \n\n\n1. He is not emotionally mature or experienced enough in relationships to really understand the sacrifice that would be involved in being in a LDR. I’ve had my fair share of relationships and have done LDR twice. I have basically 0 interest in doing it again, which I have expressed to him. \n\n2. That he is a bit selfish. He wants his to have his cake and eat it too: he wants to pursue his dreams AND have a serious relationship, wherein he would find a partner that is willing support his dreams with little consideration as to what she would want or what she would need to sacrifice to make it work. \n\n\n* This is holding me back from fully investing into us as a means of self-preservation.  \n\n**TL;DR:** I like him, but I feel like I put in way more effort than he does into trying to make this work. In all fairness, I know he’s kind of trying (we have talked about some of these issues and he's making incremental improvements). It’s a ton of work and sometimes exhausting dating him, trying to constantly read his mood, analyze his thoughts and act accordingly. As a result, I sometimes feel like my needs aren’t being met, and I’m not sure if it’s all worth it. \n\n\n**So, my dear ENFJ friends: your thoughts?** Shall I keep seeing how this unfolds or back away before I burn out? Any insight is welcome. Thank you for taking the time to read :) 
2	Learn about socionics (Russian MBTI) the ILI type (INTp is the name in Socionics but it corresponds to INTJ in MBTI) and learn about your own type.\n\n------\n\nOne thing that learning about socionics is that all humans have 8 functions, 4 of them are "valued" and 4 of them are "subdued / in shadow" where we prefer the opposite introversion / extroversion energy of the subdued information element^(what Jung calls a function) (which is its corresponding valued information element)\n\nSo both an ENFJ and an ILI prefer Ni over Ne with Ni being valued and Ne being subdued.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNow here is a followup to those two previous paragraphs.  We also have 4 functions we are "strong in" and 4 functions we are "weak in" and 2 of the functions we are strong in are Valued and 2 of them are Subdued.\n\nThus an ENFJ is strong in Ni and Ne^(subdued) but is also strong in Fe and Fi^(subdued)\n\nLikewise an ILI is strong in Ni and Ne^(subdued) but is also strong in Te and Ti^(subdued)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo the stuff I explained is quite easy to grasp and here is the part that is still easy to grasp but the OHHH and I  understand why it is a big deal will not happen until you understand the system.\n\nSo in Socionics...\n\nWith our 4 weak functions, 2 of the weak functions we will always appreciate help with that is useful help that actually makes us better at them in the moment.  But 2 of those weak functions, the ones that are Subdued / Unvalued we only get better at them via experience and we intellectually understand their purpose, but you can't really do a transfer of values from one person to another.  You can't make them like and appreciate this function as much as you do, it just does not work that way.\n\nWorse if you start criticizing them on the use of that function, even the most gentle and loving criticism and they are not invested **in the moment** with working on the function, it will backfire on you.  These functions improve via experience.\n\nWith an ILI these 2 functions they are weak at and are in shadow / subdued / unvalued are Fe and Si.\n\nAnd with an ENFJ these 2 functions they are weak at and are in shadow / subdued / unvalued are Si and Te.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nConservesly an ILI will appreciate help with Se and Fi and tips on how to improve this information element / function.\n\nAnd an ENFJ will appreciate help with Ti and Se and tips on how to improve this information element.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn addition the order of what is more sensitive to an ILI with Fe and Si matters.  Fe stuff will really stress out an ILI and you can't transfer your experience and wisdom of Fe tasks onto an ILI, they have to learn this via experience.  You can transfer your praise, but you can't transfer your experience, or proactive criticism and get a good result.  With 14 other MBTI types you can give helpful Fe advice but on an ILI and 1 other type this will backfire on you.\n\nThe why this occurs with the previous paragraph you will learn and understand once you know more about Socionics, I can't really explain it without being cryptic till you learn the basics of this variant MBTI.  But learning about this variant MBTI will help you understand both what is triggering for you, and also will help you understand what is triggering for your partner.\n\nGood Luck \^_\^
2	This is so crazy to read because I'm also an ENFJ dating an INTJ and I understand exactly what you're going through. We met about a year and a half ago over the summer, he had an internship in my area and was about to finish his final year of college. When I found out he was only going to be in my area for a few weeks, I was hesitant to go into long distance, especially because of how different we are and the fact that I struggled to tell if he actually would put in the effort or not. The way you explained your boyfriend saying that he just sees grad school and your relationship existing together is exactly how my boyfriend went about the situation. Like it wasn't a big deal. To my surprise, he actually did quite well in the long distance. He was committed enough to the relationship to trade drives with me and make our visits special. \n\nI understand the way INTJs come off when it comes to dating, but like you said, it's about who they are when you get to know them. Sometimes it's worth sticking through the cynicism and social awkwardness and all the other confusing parts for those times he really makes you feel great. \n\nJust a final note that i really do understand everything you've written, pros and cons. My boyfriend is exactly this way and it sometimes feels difficult to work on the relationship with someone that comes off so detached emotionally, but in my experience, INTJs care very deeply and very quietly. \n\nMy advice would be to be more verbal with him. I understand being nervous to make him uncomfortable by pushing him into unwanted conversations, but that's the only way I've made progress. And INTJs can be up to facing challenges if it's for someone they really care about. Tell him what you're scared of and what you need to feel safe in the relationship. If he doesn't work on it don't break your back over it. But remember that the ball is in both courts if you're long distance and that communication is key, so he needs to get used to opening up a little more. Hope that was helpful and I loved reading your post and felt very understood.
2	I am also an ENFJ female (21 yo) dating an INTJ male (26 yo). We've been together for 2 years and a half and we are really fusional, there's such a level of trust and love it's crazy. We know we want to spend the rest of our lives together because we're friends and lovers, we know we can count on each other. \nHowever, it's not always been easy and we had to improve our communication in order to make it work. He used to be extremely cold and closed at the start of the relationship and now he tells me EVERYTHING, even the smallest things and he is very honest with me. \n\nI can relate to you saying that you are in a happy moment in your life with your social life and everything. That's completely me, my friends are my second family and they're are extremely important to me. As an ENFJ, I give a lot of myself to everyone who deserves it. So my INTJ boyfriend was very bitter about this because he has his comfort zone where he works a lot to achieve great success but struggle with his social life as he doesn't have many real friends. He was unsecured and jealous about me paying attention to my friends (even though I made a lot of compromises to not go out with my friends and reassure him about loyalty amongst other things, in brief I take great care of him maybe too much sometimes). I had to explain many times to my friends why my boyfriend doesn't like me being out and why he still hasn't made an effort to meet them. My friends understand but he needs to make an effort. After many discussions, he is working on himself to be more social, he is asking advice from me and I am encouragement to do more, without me, with his own circle. You need to take baby steps with an INTJ otherwise they won't even consider making an effort. But you need to challenge him about his behaviour as well. So yea INTJ have their comfort zone and it's to us ENFJ to get them out of it. They are adventurous trust me but they will rarely get themselves out without a bit of help. \n\nFor the vulnerability part, I was annoyed with this when we started dating. I clearly asked him why he isn't more vulnerable. He explained to me that he saw vulnerability as a weakness and to me, as a pure ENFJ, it shocked me that someone could think that about vulnerability in a relationship. I taught him to let himself go and share freely how he feels. It took him around 6 months of relationship to finally open up about his past, his insecurities, his love for me etc. I feel like that helped the relationship progress in so many ways. You need to let him learn to trust you and he will eventually be vulnerable with you and open up completely.\nIt takes time and patience to be in a relationship with an INTJ, trust me, it's not for everyone. But it is all worth it in the end.\n\nIt's so funny that you're talking about him going abroad. When I met my boyfriend, he was planning to go to Australia for his third year of university. He applied to it before we met as well. I remember that he didn't go in the end because he took too much time to apply for it (strange for an INTJ you'll tell me, I think he was really working out if he should stay or go because of me). An INTJ is really career focused and it's gonna fuck his mind up to have to even think about choosing between a real relationship and his career success. So yes, as a logical thinker, he's gonna try to make both work and be a bit in denial and then realises he has to make a decision. I think your INTJ is just in a period of denial because he is happy with you and doesn't want to have to think about decisions yet, and then he will have to think it through properly. I don't think he's being immature, I think he's just trying to make it work but INTJ are very awkward with emotional decisions so your INTJ doesn't get the entire issues with a LDR yet. \n\nSo yes, dating an INTJ is EXHAUSTING I'm not gonna lie ahah. It's a lot of work but it's not gonna stay a one-way effort. INTJ will make efforts but they sometimes need a kick in the ass in order to wake up and realise that we, ENFJs, are not gonna be there forever if it stays this way. On your side, it's you to decide if you're gonna be patient or not. Your needs will eventually be met but it takes a lot of patience. \nIt's interesting to see all the similarities between your relationship and mine. I wish you good luck with your relationship, hope it will work out in the end!
1	maybe he is so focused on his work goals that he feels like taking time for his adventurous side would hold him back or distract him\n\nlucky for him, you have a rich world to expose him to if that's what you want. sounds like he needs to get out of his head and devlop his Ne more for sure.
3	Jet's MBTI - Cast Podcast	Hey Reddit, my name is jetplane48 (ESTP 7w8 sx/sp) and I am starting up a podcast in relation to MBTI. Fundamentally, the goal of the podcast is to educate the viewers of several Typology systems through a series of one-on-one's with others who are interested in the same topics. I have been conducting interviews for many years (MBTI related) and this is just an extension of that, however, I want to discuss topics that the audience wants me to cover. Naturally, I'll come up with my own material but I would love to explore topics that others have in mind. I am busy with school for the next few months but when I finish, the goal is to eventually be more consistent with these podcast uploads if this turns out to be popular enough. I'm very excited to get this started, and let's see some questions!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAR20eDTSOg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAR20eDTSOg)\n\n&#x200B;
47	"ᵂʰᵃᵗ ʰᵃᵛᵉ ʸᵒᵘ ᵈᵒⁿᵉˀ"	
13	From what I've seen, If you made an enfj angry you probably did a lot of very bad things and now you better watch out. 
9	Takes a ton to get me pissed. So it’s usually well deserved and about time, when I actually do lose my temper. 
16	As an INFP dating an ENFJ, this is way too real.  I love you guys, but you can be a bit hot headed.
3	Lmao 
1	ENFJ's have Ti, not Te.
26	Childhood Stories of ENFJs	Sometimes when I think back to my childhood I recall moments, stories and memories that were very ENFJ. I thought we could make this into quite the Reddit post if we all share one.\n\n*I was about 9 or 10 years old as I remember, and I had gone to class with a cold, because I always believed if I pretended I was well or that if I hoped enough then I would be well sooner. Anyways, I had a cold. I sneezed multiple times in a row and my teacher said, “Bless you! Bless you! Bless you! You just want all the blessings!”\nAnd I felt bad. I didn't want all the blessings. I wanted everyone to have some. I held in the rest of my sneezes.*\n\n
21	In first grade I had this math workbook, and the teacher tore a page out to let me work on it at home. Well I started crying and no one could figure out why. They sent me to the guidance counselor, where I showed him the page and told him that now it would be sad because it wasn’t with its other friends in the workbook. He assured me that it was in a better place or something, but man did I get upset over that piece of paper’s social life.
4	I got involved into a fight with my mother when she disapproved of my sister's choice and it hurt the family dynamic. Everyone told me in no uncertain terms to mind my own. I learned at a young age to let people handle their own mess if they don't ask for my help!\n\nMy other sister and I also noticed that my mother was less dismissive and/or disappointed in her when she saw her report card before mine (I had an easier time academically). So we always made sure to show hers first, wait a bit, then show mine.\n\nEdit: Spelling
4	I would pretend I ate all the meat product leftovers so that I could feed them to stary cats waiting outside everynight, I still do that but without the pretending
5	My little classmates were toying with a large shrub, bending and breaking its branches off. I was devastated. Why would they want to hurt it? It had done nothing wrong, and was a lovely place to sit under, with its fresh spring leaves and white blossoms. \n\nI sat under the bush and hugged my knees and cried at the injustice of it all. Eventually, my classmates went back inside at the end-of-recess bell and my teacher had to come looking for me. I imagine she was relieved and perplexed to find me under the bush, still sniffling. \n\nI also cried when my snowmen melted. \n\nI cried very recently when a big tree was chopped down on our block for no reason--just because some assholes razed the house it lived in front of and probably didn't want it blocking their hideous new McMansion. I'm 32.
3	Haha! That’s brilliant. Sneezes all around.
3	I just remember throughout my life I was always like a therapist for all of my friends. Even as a young kid all my friends would come to me for encouragement and advice.\nThey would just unload everything on me and I was always there for them. Just sitting there, patting them on the back and letting them all just talk it out so they could feel better.\n\nIt always brought me great joy too, to feel so needed.
2	I remember being on summer holidays with my family. There was a playground at the bottom of the block of flats we were staying at, and I was allowed to go by myself (I was 10) because my parents could watch on me from there. I was playing and then I thought I will go and get some sweets for my little brother who was 6 and couldn't play without my parents there. I went into a little adventure around the small town with my pocket money and got some sweets for my brother and an ice cream for me for the way back. When I came back my mother hugged me, she was so worried because she couldn't see me at the playground anymore. I stood there not very understanding what was going on and I looked at my brother and said "I've got some sweets for you" ahah
26	Does anyone else can’t function if their room/car isn’t organized?	
9	Yes lol, it doesn’t have to be perfect but I don’t like clutter and big messes.
6	Yes. I’m very particular about everything having its specific place. If I’m not busy (weekends, vacations, etc.), things tend to get messy. But once I start getting busy again with work, school, etc., everything stays cleaned and organized. \n\nIf I don’t have my car, room, closest, etc. cleaned and organized when I’m busy, I get really frazzled and frustrated. I’m super OCD (self diagnosed) about certain things (my clothes being set out for the next day, my keys and wallet in the specific spot in my drawer, etc.) and structured. I even do best on a super strict schedule because of that. I can’t work a sporadic schedule. 
4	Yes, but WAY more so about my car than my room lol.
4	Yes, but I live with a very messy INFP. Learning to deal with it lol! 
3	Nope. Things tend to get organised over time more by accident (ie area for my dirty clothes, my makeup will be together near a mirror and good light, my jewellery somewhere on a shelf together, my books etc). My room may look messy but it's organised to me. I like being able to see everything. My room doesn't stay minimalist clean for long...\n\nI don't have a car but would only keep it clean because I don't want to make others uncomfortable or have them judge me.
1	Yes. Being unable to find my things efficiently is emotionally crippling, not to mention highly impractical. -ENFJ
11	What’s Up Fam!	You guys are literally my fav type but so hard to find 😶\n\nThere’s a group chat on reddit (if you’re not already apart of it) just for ENFJ’s. I know you guys tend to be on the social side so this might be a good way to connect with others. \n\nI think for the time being, most of the people on the chat are other personality types, but that’s not surprising :p \n\nIf you’d rather not be in the group chat, we can chat individually! I’m really just looking for an ENFJ penpal (: anyone and everyone is welcome to comment xx
3	How do you feel listened to? Who makes you feel listened to?	
5	It's a hard question.\n\nI feel listened to when what I say is picked up. In the sense that, it will come back to the conversation, or someone will ask questions. It tells me that what I say has value, even if we are not in agreement. If I get interrupted or no one responds (or someone barely does) I don't feel listened to.\n\nI think my best friend is possibly the only one who makes me feel listened to. I may have just learned what to say, and not to, because we've known each other for over 10 years.\n\nI've learned to accept the pinch of sadness when I feel that my interests have no importance to the people I'm talking to. I just go on and talk about what drives them instead.
4	I feel that being "listened to" is about not only the speaking aspect but the action aspect. For me, I feel "listened to" when I mentioned something in brief awhile ago and someone brings it up again in conversation at random. It makes me feel like someone stored that random tidbit of information on their mental notepad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also think being listened to is about the other party's attentiveness. For example, I might not say that I don't like it when the napkins are folded into squares, but it's not a big irritant. I would feel "listened to" if someone who was helping me set up the table remembered that little thing without me having to note it. 
1	I feel most listened to when someone else shares similar experiences or thoughts. I don’t mean making an conversation all about them, but like, if I vent and they briefly explain a similar situation they’ve been through, I just think, “man, they understand.” And knowing that makes me feel not only less alone in my struggle, but also more confident in that someone’s paid attention to my thoughts. People who are good at relating without changing the subject 100% to them - the perfect balance - make me feel listened to.
4	What is your Enneagram type?	I've recently taken an Enneagram test and I'm typed as a 2w3. I was wondering what your Enneagram types are and how they correlate to you being an ENFJ.
5	3w2.
5	3w2
4	3w2 or 3w1
3	I took the test and got 2w3 too. I’ll admit though I haven’t looked too much into Enneagram 
3	3w2
2	2w3!!
2	8w9 but test isnt that reliable. If i were to consider test then i would've been "2w3" as well
2	I’m a Type 6. Still haven’t nailed down the wing though.
2	I'm a type 9w3 which i dont get AT ALL 😂😂😂
1	I’m 2w1. I don’t know much about enneagram (still learning) but I’ve heard type two is seeking connections, deep relationships with others, etc,\n\nand\n\nbeing type one has a lot of to with striving for perfection, consistent self-improvement blah blah blah blah\n\nAll which seems to ME definitely screams ENFJ or at least this ENFJ anyways.\n\nAny websites/links to learn more about Enneagram would also be appreciated\n\n: )
2	Cant find any validation	Hey guys i just re discovered the mbti test and the result i got isnt right for me. i got enfp but i didnt really fit so i did a more complex test and i got enfj. I feel more related to enfj but dont have all the traits so could you guys help me out discovering who really am 
2	read up on cognative functions. tests aren't always accurate
1	Idk if this will help but the website PersonalityMax.com used to cost a ton of money (it covered MBTI as well as other things)\nbut for some reason now it’s free.\n\nIf you want to take just the MBTI part of the test you got to uncheck every box except the first one.\n\nBut, like the other poster mentioned, your best bet to know for sure is studying the cognitive functions in-depth.
37	Deconstructing NFs	
6	What?
3	Wth 
3	now this is some surreal shit, had to check which sub I was in. 10/10
2	The heck?
1	Explain please
40	I don't know if it's an ENFJ thing or...	When I'm reading a book, watching a movie or tv show, or watching a video online, I start to put myself in these people's situations and it makes me physically cringe. For example, if I'm watching a movie and something embarrassing is happening to the main character, I too easily see myself in that predicament and cannot help but feel horrible for them, even if they are fictional.
23	That's called empathy lol
5	A lot of times I can’t even finish the movie/show because it makes me too anxious  
7	Ahahahaahha that's funny but I'm exactly the same and I think I'm ENFJ. I end up being too emotional and I really need to suppress them if I'm around people but If I'm alone....  Probably this is why I like dramas so much :D\n\nI have to suppress my emotions because I think its not very masculine and I end up too much involved in the character and it's just too painful.\n\nI think ENFJ's are best "chameleons" and can really put themselves in other's shoes.
3	Totally relatable. I recently just got into Hamilton, the musical, and when I listened to “Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story” I bawled so hard, and when I thought about putting myself in Eliza’s shoes, living for another 50 years without the person you love, I cried even harder. lol such a crybaby (x
2	This is literally me too. Especially with reading books. I get so over involved and feel what they feel. It took me three read throughs of Catcher in the Rye before I could enjoy the book and stopped feeling like shit because Holden sucks so much 
3	Second hand embarrassment... I often have to pause shows I'm watching when I'm starting to feel more than the characters themselves.\n\nI don't do it as much when I have people around, but when I'm alone it always happens!\n\nI just thought I was weird hahaha!
1	At least you realize it. Some ENFJs that I know don't and end up believing being someone they are not. 
1	I can’t watch movies. I cannot separate my feelings from the ones displayed on the screen. It’s a roller coaster
7	ENFJ male anime protagonists/important characters?	I've been pouring over anime typings recently, and I've noticed how rare male enfjs are in anime. Fair enough, considering our portion of the real life general population is quite small, and we tend to be almost "forgettable" by the main populace. Are there any important characters that you guys can remember? I'll start a list\n\nAsuna - SAO (MBTI Database)\n\nSanji - One Piece (MBTI Database)\n\nMinato - Naruto (MBTI Database)\n\nKaori - Your Lie in April (MBTI Database) ( this shows the fucking best. )\n\nRobin - Teen Titans ("Dick Grayson" (MBTI Database)) \n\nMaes Hughes - Fullmetal Alchemist (MBTI Database)\n\nYuzuru - Angel Beats (MBTI Database) (Also great example and show. I recommend)\n\nWhat are some that you guys have seen. Doesn't have to just be male.\n
3	Glad you brought this topic up because I’ve always had the same question haha. \n\nFor me, I think of \n\n- Sinbad (Magi)\n- Dino (Katekyo Hitman Reborn)\n- Leorio (Hunter x Hunter)\n- Ace (One Piece)\n- Jushiro Ukitake (Bleach)\n- Manato (Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash)\n- Dazai? (Bungou Stray Dogs)
2	I dont watch much anime but I agree with Otonashi from angel beats \n\nHow about Kyousuke from Little Busters?
1	Starfire comes off more ExFJ. I know people will say she’s ENFP because only ENFPs can be quirky, but she literally leads off Fe imo.\n\nRobin comes off as ENTP, I know he’s a leader, but he actually rarely even takes other people’s feelings into consideration often. From what I remember, he only does this when necessary and it pays off well. 
10	Tinder mess!	I \[27F\] ENFJ met my so called bf \[29M\] ISFJ three weeks ago on Tinder, and we decided to date exclusively -his idea!\n\nWe both deleted Tinder app and decided to try to make things between us work!\n\nYesterday we were watching a video on his phone, and Tinder notifications popped up, he lied and said it is the phone problem and he does not know why the App still there, I asked him immediately to open the f\*\*\*ing app, was 22:00, and found a conversation that started 21:00 while he was on my bed after a great movie night out, he was sending 'hi' everywhere to random girls!\n\nI felt stupid to be in that situation! I felt hurt and I feel shit now! if someone could cry until die; I would be writing this from the grave!\n\nWhat to do?\n\n\*\*TL;DR;\*\* :\n\nDo you think if I continue with him he will do it again? or it is just 'mistake' as he said frankly!\n\nDo you think once a 'Tinder' user you would not quit and settle ? cause you know 'the sea is full of fish'!
30	I’d walk. ENFJ freeze out.
11	Yeah, if y’all agreed to be exclusive cut him out.  Especially if you only wasted 3 weeks.  Don’t trick yourself into wasting more. 
8	What an asshole
7	I don't like tinder cus the peeps i find are there are usually trash like this.  Don't stick with him, dump is ass.  If he lied to you once like this and is cheating, he'll do again.  Cheaters always cheat.\n\nYou deserve better.  I'm also 28F enfj.  I would not put up with his crap.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf he feels bad, it's cus he feels bad that he got caught, not that he sincerely feels bad for doing you wrong
5	That really sucks, OP. You have every reason to feel hurt. \n\nYour first question -- yes, I think he'll do it again. He'll just get better at hiding it. Keeping the app on his phone could be "just a mistake"; messaging several girls is not. That was intentional.\n\nYour second question -- my wife (ENFJ) and I (INTP) met on Tinder. We both quit Tinder permanently after 2-3 weeks of dating. I know of other people who basically get addicted to their dating apps and find it hard to quit them even once they're in a relationship. So it's going to vary from person to person.
4	I am also a female your age, and from my experience, guys that do sketchy things will continue to do sketchy things.  \n\nI do think there is an addiction to dating apps that people can have.  If he still needs female attention while he’s literally hanging out with a girl he asked to be exclusive with, he’s going to continue that trend most likely.  \n\nI would get out now before your emotions get too involved if it were me.  
3	He’s already lied to your face. You need to drop him. Relationships are built on trust, if there’s no trust then there’s no point to the relationship. 
5	one of the hardest things for an ENFJ to do is to love themselves. Walk away. If you cannot be treated respectfully and honorably then they are not worth your time. 
3	Get out you'll definitely find someone better, Yes it definitely is easier said than done but think about it, If he's so ok lying and being such a douche than what is to say he'll change if it gets more serious, Yes there definitely is a chance but it seems very smalll to me.
3	He lied. Give him the boot
3	Oh no honey, you RUN and you don’t EVER look back! I dealt with enough idiots like him when I was on OKC. You deserve so much more! 
3	Ew. Leave and find someone better. \n\nIt’s hard to answer your second question, probably depends from person to person. But for sure you should walk away from this guy, you can’t trust him. He was in bed with you when it happened, it’s a miracle you didn’t smash his face! 
3	you must end it. don't accept a liar. i'm sorry
3	Ditch him. If he does it once he is almost guaranteed to do it again. He's obviously a blantant liar and cannot be trusted. You don't want to be with someone like that.
2	god, hes a bitch. how can u get attracted to that shit ?  \nps im poliamorous, that disgusting lack of transparency doesnt come easy. u gotta be really weak
2	I probably would have smashed his phone to the ground and would have given no fucks.
1	Read modern romance by Aziz Ansari\n\nHe addresses the tinder elusion of choice 
4	This person strikes me as an ENFJ. It’s an uncanny hunch but I believe it is correct. She is working at one of her many middle stops towards her vision.	
24	I’ve found the majority of ENFJ’s (and ESFJ’s) are type 2 “the helper” on the enneagram	I think a lot of the unhealthy qualities or complaints I’ve read have nothing to do with being an ENFJ, but actually are due to a possibly less mature/unhealthy type 2. \nI’m personally a type 4 “the individualist,” so it really took me a long time to resonate with being an ENFJ.\nIt would make sense to me that most ENFJ’s are 2’s as they are driven by their need to be loved. \nIf anyone knows anything about the enneagram please put your thoughts into this! \n
8	Hello! I'm an ENFJ and a type 2. I definitely am driven by my need to be loved. HELP ME. 
4	1000%, the enneagram was the first time when I read my personality result and thought “wow someone really is writing down all my inner thoughts”. I love how the result is 3 dimensional. This is how i interpret the results: 1) who you are (2), 2) who you want to be (4) and 3) who you don’t want to be (8).\n\n1) generally love helping and derive a ton of happiness from it and from others. But 2) why do we do this? We have an inner drive that we desire to be unique and special to other people and ourselves. And 3) we hate being controlled and micromanaged (the 8 is the dominant, assertive type and that just don’t vibe too well with us In a very general sense). \n\nNothings gonna be 100% right but always found this test fascinating. Especially the write ups of the healthy and non healthy types — has helped me become more aware of some bad habits
3	I took the test and was a type 2 but a year later I was a type 4. The first time I took it and got 2 was a time when I was under stress so that could’ve been a contributing factor 
2	2 strong wing 3 here.  Enfj. We are usually a 2, but some of us are 3 with a strong 2 wing.
2	Im ENFJ type 8 cant relate with so many things about "ENFJ" . In my understanding, we are the same in how we function, arriving conclusion about something. But our motivation will decide what we are going to do with it. As a social ENFJ 8 I have tendency to assert control over the group in acceptable manner. I see this life is about people placing wills over on another so it matters to me if i want what i want, i will have to assert control a little bit over my surrounding. i love people dearly without expecting their love in return. 
2	Thanks for your comment! Im always evaluating where I’m at, so it’s a nice reminder to revisit the enneagram! 
2	I feel like the odd duck. I’m ENFJ with 1w2. I think it suits me, but I’m always curious why I’m the odd one out. 
1	I am an ENFJ and a 2 on Enneagram. I don't know if I agree with your perspective that we help out of a need to be loved. I help because I love to help and because I genuinely love people. Do I long to be loved? Everyone does but for the most part I help or give or aid because it makes me feel good to do so. 
1	I am an ENJF Type 2 and I find myself very giving in relationships that have no chance of ever being equally reciprocated. I feel as though I almost set myself up to be disappointed regularly by people. I have found that to maintain healthy platonic relationship boundaries, I have to force myself to give a friend as much as they are giving me; no more, no less out of spite.  I still tend to go way out of the way for people but knowing where these boundaries are help keep me mentally healthy and happy 🖤🖤
1	who doesn't want to be loved? (2 wing 3, seems that's most common)
1	We usually span from types 9 1 and 2
15	This is a video I (INFP) worked on with my friend (ENFP), and we're super proud of it. It's probably our most polished work yet. Our sense of humor can very abstract and philosophical and we thought some other NFs might enjoy it! :)	
4	I was somewhat entertained. Thanks lol
2	I thoroughly enjoyed this! Thank you. (ENFJ)
1	Pretty funny iN meta humor 
1	"Our sense of humor can be very abstract and philosophical"\n\nvomit
8	ENFJs and trolling?	I was perusing an article naming the typical pet peeves of the different types, when I came across "trolling" being one of the top frustrating things for ENFJs. \n\nI'm a huge prankster. Never in a hurtful way, and never to people who would be offended by me goofing around. For example, I have a really thin roommate who I will tell people about and describe as "a huge 300lb woman", and every now and again I mention her bad eating habits. When friends actually meet her (this little 90pound woodland nymph) they realize I've been messing with them the whole time, and usually they get a kick out of it (and sometimes join in on the fun by exaggerating with me about how big she is to other friends). \nThat's just an example, but I do things that like often if I feel it'll bring a laugh. So I was surprised to see "trolling" was one of the ENFJs top pet peeves? \n\nI'd love to hear anyone elses opinion on trolling! Below is the link to the article: \n https://www.psychologyjunkie.com/2019/02/12/pet-peeves-of-every-myers-briggs-personality-type/
8	trolling has a different implication than your lighthearted pranks, and i enjoy being ironic quite a bit as well (though for me it's not mean-spirited and with the intention that i'd be understood).\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntrolling could be described as: purposefully attempting to make others look like fools through deception; gaining pleasure in the frustration and chaos you cause and not intending for your victims to be in on the laugh\n\nin short: it sounds like you're probably aok by ENFJ standards
5	I like trolling and soaking up people's reactions.
1	To me, REAL trolling is disgusting. It’s basically trying to get a rise out of someone to get a reaction from them in hopes of making them look like a laughingstock.\n\nIt’s an extremely childish and immature thing to do. I think only people who are really insecure take it upon themselves to do so.\n\nIt’s all fun and games for them but you end up looking stupid if you give in to them.
0	That's not funny.
9	Dreaming about how you could be	If there was an exercise where you had to imagine a future for yourself, but one that has nothing to do with how things are now, how would you go about it?\n\nLike in a "dream big" way. It would have to relate to you, something you want to get to, but not something that already exists (but could).\n\nWhat is the process you would go through?
5	INFP here.  Dreaming is my specialty because I live in a perpetual day dream.  \n \nThis is how I made my dreams become reality.  The example I will use is my business.\n\nI work in corporate America.  I realized that I would eventually become over qualified and over paid as I grow closer to retirement. I've seen many times older people get laid off as they get close to retiring.  I also realized that I would have to support my parents as they reached retirement age.  So I knew I had to do something about it.  \n\nAt this point in time a friend of mine showed me how to brew beer. I instantly fell in love with brewing.  Not because I loved beer but because I love what beer meant. Brewing was a way to bring friends together.  \n\nSo my dream was to be financially independent and brewing beer is how I wanted to do it.  \n\nThe first thing i did was to fantasize about what it would be like to own a brewery.  I made brewing my passion and I would share my dreams with my friends while we shared some homebrew.  \n\nI talked about it to all my friends. Eventually some of them started believing my fantasies and my dream became their dream.  \n\nBefore I knew it's we were writing up a business plan and looking for a location to build my dream (our dream).\n\nThat was 7 years ago. Today the brewery is running strong.  We have 10+ employees and some of my friends have quit their jobs to work for the brewery.\n\nIt hasn't all been easy but it exists and it was all from a dream.  \n\nSo to recap.  Dream big. Fantasize about how it's going to be. Make it your passion and tell anyone who is willing to listen. Finally, put in the work. \n\nI've also done this same process to lose weight.  I have lost 80lbs and there are 7 people around me losing weight because of my dreaming. \n\nI hope this helps. 
2	There's a concept developed by Stephen Covey in his book '7 Habits of Highly Effective People,' in which he talks about beginning with the end in mind.\n\nIt's about visualizing your funeral and thinking about what different groups of people (namely: family, friends, co-workers) and thinking about what you want they to say to you, ideally.\n\nMy alternative way of doing this is pretending to step into a time machine and talking to yourself at the place where future 'you' lives, and holding a conversation about how you've become so successful in the future. You'll have to leave it to your intuition to imagine the set of values future 'you' would subscribe to- and that involves being true to yourself.\n\nIf you're an ENFJ, I'd suggest with thinking it through very slowly, and letting your intuition guide you. Always start with a few deep breaths :)
2	I need help trying to type my Mother	I am an INTP who got a little bit too obsessed with this MBTI thingy, as it was so precise that I could not see it as anything but true\n\nBecause of that I started to type most people around me but my mother and my sister are problems\n\nMy sister 'cause she never showed me anything at all but my mother... I don't know why\n\nWe've done the test and it never got really precise about her besides somethings many other personality types have in common\n\nSo I started thinking she might be an EXFJ (Even though it would seem she's hard to read which EXFJs in general are not, I'd say I'm just pretty bad at understanding feelers)\n\nBut I don't know I could be wrong\n\nSo here are some of her characteristics:\n\nShe works as dentist and she wanted to be one since her childhood (And because of that I can only see her as an Si Or Ni user)\n\nShe is proactive and she's always doing something\n\nShe's quite easily irritable, if I say something in a tune she didn't like she'll most probably start to yell at me... It would seem that it has to do with the pressure someone's giving her.\n\nShe literally explains things to me even when I already know how they work and things like that.\n\nShe's a little too much optimistic\n\nThe only thing she says she wants to do is to help others... That would be her life goal I guess\n\nWell she's married to an ISFJ so maybe that could help (especially when I can easily say they have never had problems with each other ever)\n\nShe does not like to think, at least not as much as I do...\n\nShe's been the warmest person in the room, and from what I've seen Fi users are a lot colder than Fe users especially when we're talking about extremes like an INTP vs an INTJ\n\nWell I don't know what more to say so\n\nI guess that's it...
5	Some of these things might also just be because you are her child.\nI wouldn’t obsess over this type stuff honestly
2	look at cognative functions. test results may vary because people like to answer as they "should" not as what they "would" do.
2	My hunch is INFJ. It’s a tricky one to figure out since they appear to be outwardly social and really care and help others. Always looking long term and gives unsolicited advice. Maybe you can read more about this type and see if it’s the one!

9	A Political Co-ordinates Test for all ENFJs here	
2	22.2% right 2.8% liberal. Sounds about right. 
1	 58.3% left, 44.4% liberal 
1	52.8% LEFT, 69.4% LIBERAL
1	https://canada.isidewith.com/ \nHere’s a link for a Canadian test but you can choose other countries as well
1	88.9% right, 13.9% liberal
1	53% left, 83% liberal\n\nI'm in no way surprised. Not because I'm ENFJ, but because I'm a libtard snowflake muggle lover.\n\nI imagine reddit skews largely liberal.
1	We on reddit.  You know how this will turn out 
8	Negative thought cycles	I keep overthinking or I get real negative and sort of spiral into this negative thought cycle and can't seem to break out of it... Does this happen to you guys? What do you do to break the cycle? Why does this happen? \n\nAlso I keep having sad/bad dreams about my boyfriend and can't help but think it's my subconscious telling me something... He's a great guy and I love him dearly, but I just woke up from a dream where people were telling me to break up with him because of the doubts I have about him. My doubts aren't based on who he is but my own fears and negativity.\n\nEDIT: Thank you everyone for your response. I've been reading them and referring back to them whenever I start to get negative. It means a lot to me that this sub seems to care so much and I get so much insight. ♥️
11	Regarding the negative spiral- I tend to get them a lot when I'm alone, and can really turn my days upside down. They tend to be around worrying that I might have hurt someone's feelings, or about my own value to other people in the long run. I also tend to fall into a spiral when I am deeply angered by someone (though this happens extremely rarely).\n\nFor me there are two ways to go about this: one is to just laugh about the situation. I think that sometimes, irrational thoughts can be solved by equally irrational solutions haha. The other is to put your negative feelings on a pedestal and really try to understand it. I like to turn my feelings into a mental 'other' and just try to converse with it logically and deduce where the negative thoughts are coming from, then I'll devise a plan to remedy it in the future. (eg. talking to the person I hurt more often, or sending a gift in the future.) [EDIT: actually on second thought, maybe don't do this while you're in a spiral.. definitely wait until you're in a calmer state]\n\nAbout the sad and bad dreams- I think we as ENFJs love answers but take the most convoluted paths towards them. Laugh a little, and try to appreciate him in other ways. I hope you will find what you are looking for in a relationship, but in the meantime remember to stay in the present :) 
6	You’re headed down a bad path. Things will get worse unless you take active measures to change your habits. It’s kind of like taking a hot bath in the winter. If you start the bath while in the tub, you can slowly increase the temperature until it’s very hot. You’re curious how hot the water can get. You think it might sooth you, but instead you leave the tub with a headache from dehydration. But if you set the bath before getting in, youd realize it was too hot and pull your feet out immediately. The point is you’re curious about the pain, you think maybe by thinking it over deeply you might find a solution. But you’re not really thinking, you’re allowing your emotions to take control. The key is when you find yourself caught in a negative feedback loop, is to train yourself to snap out of it - to yank your foot out of the hot water. Physically remove yourself from that environment and do something else. It may seem silly but it’s necessary to overcome this habit. Feel the room around you, your hand feeling the chair you might be sitting in. Think thoughts of gratitude. Do something good for yourself. There is no other solution but to break away. 
6	Or possibly it's not the negative thought cycle that's the problem, but it is symptomatic of certain aspects of your personality that 'kick in' in certain circumstances. For example 'I'm not good enough' may come from a range of sources - a parent who put you down, numerous experiences of failure in childhood, underlying insecurities about your looks or personality, etc. You are right - these thought-loops are born of your subconscious, but may be helpful to understand your subconscious has **no sense of time** which means a situation today might trigger a reaction born of an event when you were six years old and haven't yet processed. \n\nA thing that may help is to take notice of when these loops occur and consider what may be triggering them and if there is something in your past (or current) circumstances that may be associated with them - and understanding why it is happening can help you 'process' the subconscious trigger and reduce its power. \n\nRe your bf, honestly, it depends how old you are ;-) Actually dreams about breaking up etc could simply be manifestations about your general anxiety about being in a relationship which is important to you. On the other hand, maybe subconsciously you could harbour doubts... in any case, try not to overthink and enjoy yourself. As long as you're happy with him, why worry? 
2	It happens to me. Noticing the cycle is the first step in breaking the cycle as far as what stops it I’ve been trying to figure that out for years. 
2	I do this negative-thinking spiralling as well. It’s really hard to get out of when I’m on my own but my boyfriend recognizes when it’s happening and  once I’m called out for it, I can see how it’s not getting me anywhere and try to distract myself with something else. 
2	If there are good reasons for you to doubt him then sit down for a moment a really think about it. We ENDJs sometime willfully blind ourselves because were so hopeful.\n\nIf it’s coming in your dreams it’s probably something that you need address in real life. \n\nIt could be something about him that just doesn’t work out between you two. Don’t waste time and stay with someone who’s hurting you, there are indirect ways of being in toxic relationships. Sometimes people are not meant to be with one another 
2	In order to break a negative thought cycle, I started reviewing the stories I tell myself. Instead of saying "Sometimes I hate myself" interally I started saying "Sometimes I love myself because..." and I give myself some good compliments, as my kindness, sticking to my values (such as humility, equality and culture of peace and non-violence)
2	No problem, you are enlightened and as funny as it sounds being enlightened can be a heavy load to carry sometimes. Glad I could provide some comfort to you :). 
48	This poem by April Hill Writing reminded me of ENFJs.	
6	I'm on a "love and anything related" kind of strike, but that really spoke to me. <3
22	What makes sex good for you?	The most important thing for me is to see my partners orgasm and the satisfaction on their face. It makes me happy to give happiness. :)\n\n&#x200B;
14	Specific to this sub and ENFJ - I'm most happy when my wife initiates sex, as opposed to me doing it.  I don't know if that's my ENFJ talking or not.  At first thought, I'd say no - because we like to be in control.  But it also might be the rush I get being wanted, essential to my partner - ENFJ's love to be wanted.
11	Same. I don’t need anything, sex isn’t a need, and I don’t get upset if I don’t finish every time or whatever. I only truly care about pleasuring the woman I love. If she loves me she will do the same but it’s not on my mind
16	Yes, this. But if a partner *doesn't* think this then... what are you doing?\n\nMy point is: for the love of God *get what you need out of it too*. I'm beginning to lose my shit with the amount of times ENFJs play up the archetype that we only feel (and should only feel) good when we serve others. Are you getting what *you* want too?
9	First and foremost a heart to heart connection. Then pleasing her over and over, which continously builds me. Then the culmination of her satiation with mine. 
8	The heights of emotional and physical union
12	Mutual attraction, mutual enjoyment, mutual lust and tempo. The word you are looking for is mutual.
5	Connection, both the emotional and the physical
4	Attentiveness and appreciation. I’m not sure why but I always fall for the people who put extra effort into the little things. The ones that make eye contact, kiss you on your shoulders, gently caress you. The ones who care to learn who you are as a human and cherish you when you open up. Gentleness and transparency turn me on ❤️
4	Rough housing. 
3	YES! OH MY GOSH! YES! There's nothing as satisfying as bringing her to ecstasy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, I'm extremely playful in bed. So, when a girl reaches up for a kiss, I'll start to go in. Bu then, just at the moment when our lips would touch, I'll pull back. That millisecond of subverting her expectations and making her want me even more, that's just the best feeling in the world. Of course, then I'll dive in for a long and passionate kiss.

49	ENFJ motto	Something I said to a colleague months ago, before knowing my MBTI type:\n\n"If someone asks me for the moon, I'll try to reach for the galaxy, but only give them the solar system, and be sad because I wish I could give them the universe."\n\nA colleague told me this when congratulating me for my work:\n\n"The level of perfection you ask from everyone (and yourself), cannot be reached by anyone, not even yourself."\n\nThese statements really embody who I am as a person, even if I sometimes wish they didn't.\n\nWhat are yours?
21	Mine would be to ”lift others as I climb” because I can’t really seem to justify *most* self gain without ensuring that I am positively affecting someone/my community.\n\n“Don’t let yourself burn just to keep others warm.”\n- another quote I say to remind myself of boundaries when helping lol
5	"Love is only a gift." Is my motto. I honestly feel like I am always bleeding love. I give sacrificially and never realized no one would do that for me.  I have to ask myself why am I doing all this.  If I can answer love is a gift, I may be okay but then I start thinking, I MATTER, "I AIN'T SANTA CLAUS." But matter how many times I do say it I realize "I AM FREAKING SANTA CLAUS." 
5	i'm feeling very attacked
5	Lately I've been saying this a lot that maybe this could also be a relatable motto:\n"I love *insert these passions here*. I love people. I love getting people excited about *insert passions previously mentioned". 
2	Mine lately would be being kind to others and showing compassion even in hard and difficult situations.  \n"Gentle breezes of a kindling warmth is better than the bitter coldness of silence."\n\n"The joy and compassion and acts of kindness is worth every shared value while expecting none in return and appreciating plenty."
2	“Be who you are and say what you feel for those that mind don’t matter and those that matter don’t mind”- dr Seuss. I am an EXFJ (kind of in the middle of ESFJ and ENFJ). I tend to find that I limit who I am, and change who I am and how I act in order to fit what others want me to be and to be the best person towards them.  This quote reminds me that some people just don’t matter, and I shouldn’t let myself be taken advantage of by them. 
2	Love's not love if it's an obligation. Love is when you are happy to have helped someone, not when you're happy that you've helped them so you can finally do someone else now.
2	OP your mottos are so much the embodiment of an ENFJ.\n\nI just want to love everyone with the fierceness of ten thousand suns.
12	ENFJ with depression and anxiety	After learning I was an ENFJ it suited me very well except that I could definitely see myself in an INFJ. I felt like I wasn’t sure what was really me and felt like maybe I was an INFJ trying to be an ENFJ. It wasn’t until discussing this with my boyfriend (who knows me better than anyone else) that he pointed out that I am definitely an E and it’s probably my depression and anxiety that make me an act like an I. Once I thought about this it made sense. I instinctively think like an E but then slowly start thinking and acting like an I. When I think back to before my depression and anxiety started I was 100% an E.  I thought this was really interesting and wondered if anyone else has experienced this?
11	I’m an ENFJ with depression & anxiety as well; when I was REALLY going through it (aka before I started therapy/when I first started therapy and before I was on meds), I felt like such a hollow shell of myself. It was scary cause I could barely recognize the outgoing, empathetic, and driven ENFJ I had always known myself to be. It was like I could see the real me somewhere deep down inside, but I couldn’t reach her. It was so strange and honestly felt like an out of body kind of experience. But like I said, therapy and (in my case) medication definitely helped bring me back to life and helped me get to a place where I could feel like myself again. The depression/anxiety will definitely have an effect on that “E” part but just remember that the real ENFJ you is still somewhere in there! You just have to find ways to rediscover yourself, whatever (hopefully safe) method that might be :) 
5	Yes! I have both depression and anxiety. Also, ENFJ is more of a guideline, I’m sure if you take the test on different days and in different mood you get different results, but more often than not, you’d end up being ENFJ. Just my $.02
3	I definitely questioned myself too if I was an INFJ because I would depress my extraversion during times of anxiety and stress in my high school  and undergrad years. But what helped me through it was reflecting on times when I felt like myself and how I acted during those times (which was acting on feeling/being extroverted and intuition [which makes sense as they are ENFJ’s primary and secondary preferred function, respectively]) as well as talking to a friend of mine who was an MBTI master practitioner. He explained to me that an ENFJ’s inferior function is Ti or thinking, and (this might not be how you’re supposed to see it but it’s helpful for me to understand myself) when I am anxious or stressed I overthink too much and tend to withdraw from the world, which I could perceive as introversion. \n\nSo TLDR: yes I definitely can relate! 
2	I’m so glad to hear that! Starting meds is tough for many reasons and it’s not an easy decision to make but if they’re helping you to find yourself again then I’d call that a success. 
2	Definitely. I've always been outgoing and making friends wherever I go. But my anxiety in social situations has hurt me so much in the past I started thinking I could not handle other humans, and identifying as an introvert early on.\n\nI still don't do crowds, and I still have anxiety, but learning to deal with it has made me realize I'm much more extravert than I ever thought.\n\nI hope you find something that helps you with your anxiety and depression. It's hard to go through life with this, but it's worth it.
8	Let’s Talk About INFPs	Hey you crazy kids!\n\nWhat are your thoughts on INFPs? I’d love to hear about your experiences with the INFPs in your lives. \n\nWhat are some things that worked harmoniously in your dynamic? What elements caused friction?
10	y'all bang on and on about them and I've never bloody met one
6	This thread made me laugh.  I'm an INFP and one of my best friends is an ENFJ.  He's Mr. Popular and makes everyone feel like his best friend. \n\nI can't speak for any other personality type, but being an INFP is pretty tough.  I find it really hard to date people for whatever reason.  As much as I care for people, I don't have many close friends.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm a singer/songwriter and love using music as a way to connect with people and heal them.  I know that sounds dumb and idealistic to people, but it's true.  I love expressing myself through my music.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also do ridesharing and like listening to people one on one and chatting with them.  People get really deep.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think for me, with women, I can get pretty deep and intense too quickly and come across as needy, weird and insecure.  If I like you, it's like "I LIKE YOU" and it's hard for me to stop the insanity.  INFP are also prone to be indecisive, another trait women just LOVE in men...lol.  I naturally get close to people and I think that kinda' just freaks people out.  People don't like to get deep with their feelings and shit..but I do.  Life's taught me to chill out and I'm getting better.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just met an INFJ last week and instantly fell in love.  It was pathetic.  I could not help myself.  We just clicked on everything.  Honestly, I was not really expecting anything from our date.  Course she starts blowing me off and I had to go write a song to process my emotions.  I'm just about over her now, but I got a cool song out of all the heartache and now I can pass that on to others.  That makes all the pain worth it.  Many of my songs, if not all, come out of personal experience.  Most of them painful.  And when I get clarity on a situation in the form of a song, I can help others heal their wounds or see things in a different light.  In that sense, I see myself as a spiritual healer, and that makes me feel purposeful and special.  Like it's my calling.  I relate with Luke Skywalker and Frodo Baggins.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI guess we're all heroes in some way, shape or form...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's my lyric for the tune..peace, love and Bob Marley...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Beautiful Girl**\n\nI’m driving down a dark, country road\n\nWind in my hair, headlights come and go\n\nThe smell of the pines, the damp of the dew\n\nHer countenance shines like the light of the moon\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBeautiful girl, she’s on my mind tonight\n\nBeautiful girl, I want her by my side\n\nBeautiful girl, she’s everywhere I see\n\nBeautiful girl, I’m lost in reverie\n\nReverie\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMars and Venus dance high in the sky\n\nWhere diamonds and rubies sparkle and shine\n\nMy tires keep churning to sad country songs\n\nWhile I dream about her, dream about her all night long\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBeautiful girl, she’s on my mind tonight\n\nBeautiful girl, I want her by my side\n\nBeautiful girl, she’s everywhere I see\n\nBeautiful girl, I’m lost in reverie\n\nReverie\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe sun’s creeping up at the end of the road\n\nAnd I know it’s time for me to let her go\n\n‘Cause she don’t love me, love me the same\n\nAnd I pray to Jesus, Lord please take my pain\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBeautiful girl, she’s on my mind tonight\n\nBeautiful girl, I want her by my side\n\nBeautiful girl, she’s everywhere I see\n\nBeautiful girl, I’m lost in reverie\n\nReverie\n\nShe’s got me lost in reverie, reverie, reveire\n\nWatch me fade into the sun\n\nWatch me fade into the sun
5	Hi! My boyfriend of a year and some change is an INFP. \n\nThings we are great at- balancing each other out. I tell him I want something, he helps me go after it, He "logics" himself into a mood I can be optimistic and cheery and give him hope and a future. We are both very perceptive and both like intelligent humor, we're both great communicators and we both love coaching and teaching and lifting each other up, we are both very committed to each other always putting priority on each other and our relationship above trivial things,  \n\nFriction points- Sometimes he doesn't understand why things are hard for me to do because of my emotions, but to him it's simple-just do it, I need to just vent to him and talk to him about how I feel and cry and not have him tell me how to fix it (this may be just a m/f thing) I always want to go on group dates, do things with friends and crowds and people and he very very much does not-ever, \n\nI'm sure there's more, but that's the first things that popped into my head
4	INFPs. I just cannot understand why I click so much with them but I do. Maybe they deal better with extraversion in others, maybe they see more easily when we try hard and also when we are playing and are not to be taken seriously... I don't know.\n\nFriction... well, sometimes I forget to get in touch and fear they would take it personal. Sometimes their apparent indecisiveness asks for some patience, but they are so considerate and patient themselves all around that no one can get really angry with them.
3	I am an EXFJ (between ESFJ and enfj). I am a litteral INTP, INFP magnet. I think perhaps I am attracted to their differences from me. Me and my INFP friends get along in such harmony it feels like I can practically read their minds. Areas of harmony include general conversation, socializing (not in large groups), games, emotional support, and conflict resolutions. Friction may include try are often disorganized which can be frustrating, they are difficult to share an occupation with (because they have difficulty with planning). Honestly the I am very happy with all of my INFP friends. 
2	Hello Sunshine and Sass, \n\nThanks for the comment on my post! I really appreciate it! I’ll return the favor! Luckily I have met one of my best friends who is an INFP, luckily we get along great! We also come up with extraordinary ideas than normal people and just really do not care about social standards! (which kind of took me some time to get used to) Otherwise, they are awesome people who care about the world. However, they can be really hard to get to know at first, but they are totally different people in a good way once you break the ice! It’s like shyness to craziness, which is one thing why INFP’s are awesome! Also, I have met some of which I have not clicked with. I know tons of them and the INFP can take things very personally, which is why I don’t really get along with some of them. Also, I saw where you are debating if you are a ENFP or INFP. \n\n\nHere is a link with that primarily discusses the differences! Hope this helps! 😁\nhttps://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2015/09/523471/\n
1	This warmed my heart! :)
14	I just want to settle down with someone nice and get married (a vent feel free to ignore)	I'm only 18 but I really want to settle down already. is that weird?\n\nI think it's because everyone constantly lets me down apart from my family and I feel like if I get married that'll be a confirmation from another human being that they'll be there for me through thick and thin. \nas it stands I'm incredibly lonely. 90% of my plans fall through. I got flaked on 6 times the other week. it's the most horrific feeling. I've dealt with varieties of abuse and been through some very tough circumstances but there is no deep, gut-wrenching pain quite like having promising people flake on you. I just wish people would mean what they say. 
10	I feel you. I think marriage isnt what you want as much as you probably want genuine commitment haha but I do relate to that as well... it's miserable having flakey people in your life when you would move the moon just to make someone smile.
4	Girl, I feel you! But I agree with @igotbangz on you just really wanting commitment. Like who wants a scrub who can’t commit. I sure don’t lol. But for me I’ve always kind of wanted to find “the one” who goes through everything with me. 
5	I'm an ENFP and I've wanted to get married since I was 18. I love the idea of such a deep, all-encompassing commitment... but it would have to be with someone remarkably compatible to work long-term. I've never been married and only had one serious dating relationship, and I'm 27 now. I'm not giving up hope though! \n\nA couple of things to keep in mind is that the part of your brain that makes decisions isn't fully developed until you're 25, so I'd be a little cautious about making significant commitments before that age. Also there is evidence that getting married after dating two or more years decreases the risk of divorce, so I wouldn't rush into something. \n
3	I am ENFJ and have literally wanted to get married since I was 15, i think it’s our fascination with love. it took a couple of relationships that were really really hard, but I’m engaged to the most amazing man now. It’ll come with time when you least expect it. Never settle. As much as you want a long term relationship. It’s not worth it if you aren’t treated with  respect and loved unconditionally. 
3	Don't try to rush it. You will eventually find someone you want to spend your life with and who wants to spend it with you. That person is worth waiting for. Don't just marry any random partner because you feel they are then obliged to stay with you. That shit is doomed to fail. 
3	Lol I feel like I’m the weird one who doesn’t want to get married. But having someone who’s always there for you is nice but you don’t need to be married to find that. 
2	I have no idea if I want a relationship again. I would if I knew it was going to last. They are so great when it’s genuine but it can turn toxic out of no where n abso blow up in your face. I’m only 18 as well but after my previous relationships, knowing how much it hurts when they end up leaving is enough for me to just stop seeking them out. If it happens naturally then it would be great but I’m trying to focus on myself even tho it can be lonely as FUCK. (INFP) 
2	No it’s not weird to want that, and hopefully that’s something you get in the next 10 years, man. Keep your options open. If you’re already dating someone, nice! Give your all to feed the relationship and let’s hope this person also does.\n\nThis is something I think about too. There is someone in my life who I’ve given my heart to. I can just hope they’re the one because they have so much meaning to me. \n\nOnly time will tell what will happen but just be hopeful for a great future.\n
13	What’s your favorite type as an ENFJ?	Hello Everyone, \n\nJust out of curiosity, what’s everyone’s favorite type that they get a long with? 
21	ENFJ
18	ISTP/INTP. I do well with people that aren’t emotional because I’m too emotional myself. Lol. 
14	INTJs - one of my best friends and my younger brother are INTJ and I just enjoy them and love talking through the often existential crisis that is occupying their brains currently.\n\nWith my life partner I am super lucky as he is an ENTJ who is very in touch with his emotions so lots of deep conversations, ambition and a great balance to me.
6	ENFJ and ESFJ for sure!!! 
9	- ENFJ\n- ESTJ\n- ENFP\n- INFP
7	ENFJ, INFJ, ENTJ, INTJ, INFP, INTP, ENFP, ENTP
7	Close friends:\n\n- xSFJ for closer friendships.\n- ISFP and xSTP to have in the general friend groups.\n- ENTP to spice things up.\n- INFPs for partners in crime and to get weird with and cry together.\n- ENTJ for same same but different and more career-driven.\n- INFJs for same same same same same but only slightly different. They just get me and vice versa. They're more cynical but so excellent for, me: "I'm thinking x, is that crazy?" them: "nah bro I think the same way" me: "OH THANK GOD" both: "HEHEHEHEHEHE".\n\n\nGood for the lols/chats but not necessarily inner circle:\n\n* ESFP to get my Se going.\n* INTx to get my thinking going and chatting.\n* ESTJ for small talk.\n\n\n
3	I wish I could type people easily! I had a hard enough time typing myself. I only know the type of one friend, the others is just speculation.\n\nI'm stuck with the old "personality quirks" way of doing things. :D\n\nBut my ENFP friend is pretty great.
3	Enfj, infp, estp, enfp, infj, and esfj in that order lol
3	INTP/J lol, depending on certain aspects as I appreciate INTP's Ti, which is ENFJ's Achilles' Heel, and INTJ's Ni, which is ENFJ's main support in understanding the world.
6	INFJ!
4	ENFJ, INFP, ENFP, INTJ, INFJ
2	ENFJ, ENTJ, INFJ, INTJ, INTP, ENFP, INFP\n\nI'd say with ISFJs my relatioships with them are usually surface level while it's quit the opposite with INXX, Not to mention how well INTs are for emotional venting.
2	Any NFs
2	INFP (One of you fuckers marry me already), ENFP(Best friends), ISFP (Especially women), INTJ, ENTJ. I don't have enough experience with other ENFJ's to know.
1	I tend to drift subconsciously most towards INFJs, they’re usually my closest friends. I get along really well with ESFJs and ISFPs next, have great conversational chemistry with ENTPs (my bf is ENTP) & ENTJs, but INTx often intrigues me. Mostly INTJs. But maybe that’s because my sister is an asshole INTP, so I haven’t met many particularly enjoyable ones that I can recall.
1	My very best friend and love is INTJ \n\nTwo of my lifelong friends are ESFP - they get me out of my comfort zone.\n\n
1	ENTJ, INFJ, ISFJ, ENFP! 
1	INTJ\n\nINFP\n\nENFP\n\nENTJ
13	Are Male ENFJ’s rare?	Hello Everyone, \n\nBeing a fellow ENFJ Male myself, wondering if there were any on reddit! Since it is one of the rarest personalities in men! Thanks! 
13	Male ENFJ here. Funny, it never occurred to me that anything other than a 50-50 split of male to female would be the case. 
11	According to my research, ENFJ personality is very rare in men. We are the second most rare animals in this crazy jungle. It's either 3 or 6 percent of the population. Can't remember which.
8	I am a male ENFJ. I wasn't aware it was a rare personality in males.
6	I’m one, and I married an ENFJ lady as well!
4	Had no idea male ENFJ's were rare, rad.
2	Hi there 👋 
2	Hola. 
2	Sup. Enfj male
2	hello 
2	I have never seen others irl and i have never seen so many in 1 subreddit post
2	the tests say that i too am one of this rare breed. i guess you came to the right place bro
2	Also a male ENFJ! 
2	Hello fellow male ENFJ!
2	My best friend is an ENFJ male, I don't think gender really plays a part in MBTI xD
1	I would like to meet more of you anyone interested in chatting pm me. 
1	Yeah I don’t know any other enfj males 
1	Ciao !\nYeah just like the other comments, had no idea this was a rare phenomena 
1	Male ENFJ here. Also have at least one male friend who is ENFJ. But you know, if you divide humanity into 32 parts (16 x male and female) any one part will be less than five percent. We are all rare. 
1	I noticed that there were much more females on this reddit and thats how I made the assumption that we are more rare, Not to mention that I am the only ENFJ I know in real life, Though I have met some online, I do think though that females are more likely to be feelers than Thinkers because like all the guys I know are XNTX While with girls it's usually XNFX and yes I barely get close to S types please don't kill me so I'd say it's quite the opposite with ENTJs and I think if someone takes a look at the ENTJ reddit they could tell.
1	Yep! It’s not very common! 
1	ENFJ male here (looks like we’re all checking in here lol) but I have a brother and a couple guy friends who are also ENFJ. Feel free to debate this, but I think society’s stereotype of what a man “should be” isn’t really ENFJ (feelings, love, etc etc.) and that’s why we don’t see it as much. Think this may be due some nature vs nurture leaning on the nurture side of the debate? Either way, I find that myself and my friends love being an ENFJ and wouldn’t have it any other way. 
1	I am an enfj male and I guess this explains why I usually connect easily to women on a deeper level rather then other guys my age. They are not as upbeat or passionate about anything it’s odd. Though I do find gems and have few close make friends who are capable of contemplating and communicating at the pace I do
1	Do either of you feel like you aren’t necessarily a superior being but like you have a lot to share because you’re so positive that it makes you feel like you are just on the outside looking in at all the negativity that needs to be fixed? It’s a very lonely feeling sometimes but also great because we’re so naturally enlightened. 
1	I (f/ENFJ) am lucky to know a few ENFJ men in person! One is my brother, and another is one of my good friends. Y'all are so much fun to be around! They both rile me up (in excitement) better than anyone else can. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also hear a lot in this sub that people haven't met ENFJs IRL. I know a ton, but I also come from a family of teachers which I believe is a common profession for ENFJs. Maybe that's why. Anyway, glad to see so many of y'all saying hi! As a fellow ENFJ i'm pumped to have ya here! (tip on knowing an ENFJ is posting: count the exclamation points...)
1	Male ENFJ here..come to think of it, I don't know many (if any) other male ENFJs..
1	I’m the only one I know
1	I'm an enfj. I haven't met many other dudes who are.  I wonder how many of us on here are also gay like myself.  
1	I'm an enfj male. I haven't met that many others. I wonder how many of the dudes on here are also a gaybro like myself. 
1	Yeah. They're pretty rare actually. ENFJ males make up about 1.5 percent of the general population. One of the rarest male architypes, next to infps and infjs
5	Study tips please.	I know this isn't a study site and what not. But I need help. So I decided I should ask my type if they have any study tips. Study tips for classes such as US history and Chemistry. Anything could help. I'm trying not to lose hope, but I have to have all As this semester. I know the semester just started but I can see how everything is going and how it'll end. I'll make a C or fail a test have- back up work and my grade would roll over to a B+. I have 2 +As and the rest are high Bs. I've hardly ever failed a test or produced a C until now. I'm not sure what it is. So please help me. Thank you. 
4	Do you find yourself easily distracted when you are trying to study? That has happened to me a lot before.  The best way to approach chemistry (for myself anyway) is to draw everything up nicely. The chemical formulas and structures, draw them all out and label them.\n\nUs ENFJs generally enjoy pretty visuals, and it can help us remember details by drawing and writing them out on paper. 
2	Are you in high school or university? What kind of chemistry?
2	Turn off your phone while you're studying. Otherwise it's just a source of distraction.\n\nDon't study for more than 30 minutes at a time. After those 30 minutes, reward yourself with something - be it a snack, some music, a short video, *something.* Then get back to it.\n\nFind out what noise level works best for you. Some people prefer to study with some noise, a lot of noise, or no noise at all. Try to get to an environment that can accommodate your preference.
2	Flashcards were a life saver for me in college and high school.\n\nPut your question on side and the right answer on the backside. I would shuffle them up and then just go through them all. I would read the question and guess the answer. If i got it right that card went in one pile and if i got it wrong it went in another. Once I had gone through the whole stack I would then go back and work through the missed answer pile and did correct/missed answer piles again. I would go through that cycle until ingot every answer right.\n\nThen I would put all the cards back together again, shuffle, and start over.\n\nAnother thing that might help, if you're a visual person like me, is use colored pencils or colored ink on the answers you struggle most with. I found a colored text helped me remember the answer easier on test day because it created an addition visual element to the material.
2	What are you currently doing with chemistry? I may be able to help you out there, since i'm having chemistry as a course in uni. What i did with history was making chronological summaries, with the date in front, and then then a short explanation of what happened next to it. Once you got that settled out, then you can try to make a story or song out of it, since most people tend to remember stories/songs better than raw data. And some general tips for studying: make sure you have nothing else on your mind ( as in deadlines ) so take care of the rest first. Take breaks after 45-60 minutes for no more than 10 minutes and walk arround for a bit during your break. Get some fresh air after 4-5 hours of studying. Make sure to eat well and go to bed on time
2	I took both APUSH and organic chemistry. For APUSH, try to write down the events as cause and effect. Having things visualized helped me to memorize the details.\n\nFor orgo, doing practice problems and figuring out the patterns is what made things click for me. This applies to gen chem as well so give it a try.
1	I chose to take classes that I liked, which helped with being motivated to study. So I never took US history. But now I wish I did so I can relate more to Hamilton the Musical (x\n\nFor chem, I would definitely use Cornell notes style like take notes on the right and have questions on the left side so that if I review, I can look at the question and test myself - I can then read the answer to the right. Boom! A ready made test and answer guide you made yourself. Khan Academy is a good resource too, and looking at MCAT study books that simplify stuff. Talking it out with friends (or friends who are just a bit smarter and on top of it) so you know what you know and don’t know is best. Drawing out processes, getting a tutor, doing problem tests/tests from the teacher or professor because they usually test the same. \n\nUS history, I’ll just use my background in taking World History. Again, I loved AP World, so it might have just been my enthusiasm but I talked about it a lot with family. I would also use Cornell notes and these helped me memorize the information needed. 
21	Any non-religious ENFJs out there?	We seem to be a very God-Fearing type based off some studies.\n\nMy parents aren’t strictly religious, but they are. Despite this, from the age of 4 I thought the idea of Heaven was too convenient. I consider myself agnostic.
11	Non-religious here. I find religion fascinating, and I love learning about it, but I don’t practice. I was raised Lutheran, and made many friends in the church. I learned some good things there, but after high school I found my belief in God to make less and less sense. I loved taking religious studies classes in college, for the same reason I enjoyed taking political science classes - both are extremely powerful subjects that people will kill and die for. The fanaticism is ultimately what turned me off I think. 
11	YES atheist. I do my helping people without the hope of a reward. But was raised in a cult. 
5	I was raised in a Christian family but I’m a very logical person when it comes to that type stuff. Emotional with people, logical with science and greater mysteries.
2	I believe in some higher power but I tend to challenge my own beliefs frequently. My parents raised me as Hindu but they don’t get upset when I challenge religion as a whole. I’m definitely not god-fearing though. I see them more as a guide in times of need or if I get really lucky, I’ll thank them. Bottom line, I would say I’m agnostic
2	Athiest all the way. I love science, and the idea of a god does not fit into my world view. Also, I am a massive gan of magic mushrooms. As an ENFJ i feel like nothing gets me like shrooms man. Also, on shrooms I ponder about religion and existentialism. 
2	Not religious!! Just admire the Buddhist practice that actions speak louder than any bible of written scripture. I was raised Christian but said nope this is BS lol 
2	Yes, I identify as Atheist. 
2	I am always curious about this because apparently we are the type most likely to believe in a higher power.  I am atheist, though agnostic.  I am happy to see that there are fellow atheist ENFJs.  
3	My parents are Buddhists and around my middle-high school years, put me in some buddhist girl scout program that I had to go to every Sunday.  I really did not like doing it at all and it made me feel like they were forcing their beliefs down my throat.  The kids in the program were also very cliquey and I didn't really like how the environment was.  I like to do things if it is my choice, and in this case it wasn't.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs I grew up, I also saw a lot of reigious extremists who would do a lot of horrible things to people in the name of whatever religion they followed.  My best friends are Christian/Catholic and they were probably the only nice religious people I knew at the time.  I feel like I am agnostic and that maybe there is a higher power up there observing us and bad things happen because it's what free will is all about.  If said higher power were to intervene, it would violate our free will.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy views on religion pretty much solidified in college when one of my best friends got dumped by his girlfriend "in the name of god".  She believed that he wasn't devoted enough to God  and for that she needed to let him go so that he could "find his way".  A few months later, she tried to get back with him and at that point he had already moved on.  He was pretty messed up by this whole scenario and went from being religious to also being agnostic.  (He was also about to propose to her).  At this point, she stated that he should follow God's example of forgiveness and that she cried every day they were apart.  In my head, I'm viewing her as using God to excuse her actions and basically not even considering how my friend was affected by her actions.  I felt like she was blinded by her faith to the point where she couldn' t see how hypocritical she was in this entire situation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn terms of pros of religion.  \n\n* It gives people reason to network and unify together.  Having the same faith gets people together and essentially creates a family out of strangers.\n* It helps encourage volunteer work and helping others.  Many religions do charity stuff and try to help those in need.\n* It also gives people a sense of hope in the most shittiest of situations.  Like sometimes life can be a real struggle and people do need some sort of faith to keep them going.\n* It provides confidence and stability\n* It establishes a foundation for everyone to stand on\n\nBut then the cons of religion.\n\n* People use it as a reason to excuse their actions, it kinda gets in the way of accountability.  Like if they do something good, its because of whatever religion and if they're doing something bad, they do it in the name of whoever they worship\n* It can cause people to be like blind sheep, following whatever they are told and not be open minded at times.  It also can cause tribalism where it's them vs everyone else.\n* People under religion seem to do things to expect something good in the afterlife.  People should do good things without expecting a reward.\n* People rely on something to fix their problems for them, instead of doing it themselves.  "thoughts and prayers" don't really help people who lost their homes in natural disasters or something.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's my take on religion.  I think it's great in some ways, but when taken too far, it can really do a lot more harm than good.  I prefer to take things into my own hands and make something out of my own efforts.  
1	Sorry not here
1	I’m more or less deist.
1	Me I am an atheist for life 
1	Yes! I'm agnostic, but both my parents are quite religiously Hindus 
1	I was raised that way, but figured out it was bullshit. I'm not exactly atheist but I'm just aware things are bullshit.
1	I've always had trouble wrapping my mind around something as binary as heaven and hell.  I've been agnostic for the majority of my life.  I don't need a bearded man in the sky as a reason to be nice to people and just be an overall good person.  I have more happiness that way
1	Pretty much not religious. 
1	I'm not religious. I feel connection with people and nature and practice meditation to relieve stress.
1	Formerly religious (Roman Catholic) but not anymore. I used to derive humility, gratitude and purpose from “God”. However, these are things that we draw from within and others around us. Haven’t gone to church regularly in years (only go on Christmas and Easter with my grandmother). \n\nThere’s also the wild inconsistencies with religion as a whole; organized religion, religious institutions, systemic issues within the religious order etc that I have a major problem with. Mainly that I think many religious groups prey (pray lmao) on the emotionally vulnerable/those who aren’t as educated (obviously not saying that believers are dumb, but perhaps religion serves as a means to fill a moral void?) AND also take your money in exchange for a theological merit system, where the final prize for a promised afterlife? Yeah not super into that. \n\nTo bring it full circle with the ENFJ type, I think some of us want to not have our own compulsions for altruistic action, or for helping others to seem self motivated. My dad, his mother, and my girlfriend are also ENFJ’s lmao. My grandmother is the only one still actively religious, and she says that she wants to do good because it is her job as a Christian “to be an extension of the lord”. \n\nTLDR My father, girlfriend and I are ENFJ’s and not religious, but my grandmother is because the traits associated with the ENFJ type are usually promoted in the “community outreach” mandates of church groups. \n\nHope that is in anyway useful
1	Agnostic with respect to most religions. Athiest with respect to the Abrahamic religions. They make many factual claims that are demonstrably false, so I know they aren't true. \n\nHowever, if I found a religion I liked and that couldn't be disproven, I might believe in it. I've always been very interested in mythology and spiritual beliefs, but the only religions I have much knowledge about are false and/or have abhorrent moral teachings. Hell is such a severe punishment, that even the worst human couldn't do anything bad enough to deserve it. Eternal torture is an infinite punishment for finite crime, and thusthe punishment will always be far worse than the crime.\n\nAlso, the people who respond to this post will not provide a sufficient sample in all likelihood and if this were a poll, it would suffer from selection bias due to being on reddit and the question mostly attracting the ENFJs particularly interested in this question(ie other non-religious ENFJs). I know this isn't meant to be a poll, and this isn't a critisism of you, but I just don't think you'll really get a good idea of whether ENFJs in general are more relgious or not. 
1	didn't know this wasa thing lol I am religious
1	Absolutely I am not religious. It seems daunting and useless to believe in it. My synapses is I do not know, may not ever know, what life is. I know know my senses and what they pick up. I love tripping in imagination though I remember it’s not real. So imagining god doesn’t work for me.
2	Need help typing my Mom (ENFx)	Hello all! I need some help typing my Mom (I'll ask her later to do the test), I know she must be ENF-X, but I can't figure out if she's ENFP (like me but a healthy and more mature one) or ENFJ. We're both pretty close so I know her character and personality very well, until now the biggest difference I find between us is the fact that she can make a plan and stick to it. Though, I'm not sure... Can you guys help me figure this out? \n\nThx in advance!! :D  
3	Look at cognative functions and what not.
22	I hate being an enfj	The second i got the enfj result, i was sooo hypeed. For the longest, i had been typed as an enfp and while i thought it was a dope type, the enfj seemed to fit me soo well. But problem, recently i've been feeling a bit :( about my type. It just seems so bland. Every other type has cool quirks or unique traits whereas as an enfj, i feel like a cardboard box. Plain enough for others to place things into. Its exhausting being soo diplomatic and accessible. Sometimes, i wonder if the enfjs werent so proactive in terms of making friends, would people be attracted to us. \n\n\n I wonder if any other enfjs feel the sane way. \n\nAND YOOOOO, ITS SO HARD TO FIND OTHER ENFJS 
54	People are attracted to us.  The very being of an ENFJ is being there for others, and that on it's own makes us magnets for people.  You need to check your cognitive functions to get an accurate read on what type you are.  I've met a few ENFJs already and honestly a lot of NF types click with me very well.  I personally feel that as an ENFJ people sorta gravitate to me because I'm able to get them for who they are.  My friends tell me I am able to crack even the most reserved types of people and get them to open up fairly easily.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat makes ENFJs unique?  \n\n* We are easy to talk to\n* we can read people very well\n* we are super strong in empathy\n* We can generally do personality chameleon to fit whatever group we are hanging out with\n* We are thoughtful\n* We are straightforward\n* We can see bullshit from a mile away (the exception would be when we have rose colored glasses)\n* We are generally out making the world a better place\n\nAccept and love yourself.  Rock your flaws and your strengths.
10	I love being an ENFJ! I have superpowers of leading/guiding people and magic intuition about knowing the exact thing to say off the cuff. My husband is an INTP and he may have a cool data science job, but his people skills are rough. He's lost several job opportunities because he looks great on paper and flubs the interviews--whereas, I've gotten job offers for every interview I've ever been to (and because of this high success rate, I only apply to jobs I really like, saving me time and anguish). \n\nMy diplomacy is a hack that allows me to see the good in any person and mobilize people who seem to hate each other. Human emotions/interactions appear to me like the Matrix's code to Neo. When meetings are going nowhere, I energize them. Where people see problems, I point them to solutions. At my best, no one realizes I've changed the entire direction of the conversation.\n\nWe're literally one of the few types that make effective teachers and managers. Without us, the world would be running around working on the wrong problems, doing jobs ill-suited to their skills, and generally fucking things up. Every day, I go to sleep knowing I personally made the world a better place.\n\nWe're rare and special. Soak it up. And you're only a box if you let yourself be. Building healthy boundaries is the #1 skill ENFJs need to master.
8	I'm crushing so hard on an enfj girl right now, I love how easy she is to talk to, how myself I feel I can be, how honest I can talk without fearing of fucking it up, she is so selfless and the cutest little bubble of energy, I never thought I could find someone I could trust that much, love yourself, you are awesome, watch parks and recreations the main character Leslie is definitely an enfj and she is the absolute best, I wish I could meet more enfjs
6	INTP chiming in.\n\nY'all ENFJs are my absolute favorites.  I wish there were more of you!
5	The thing I struggle with the most is being so emotional. I feel like talking about ny emotions and other's emotions is draining, but I just HAVE TO. I also feel like it must irritate other people? Also, I sometimes wish I can feel nothing at all, but when I so I fewl lost. I also feel like when I talk about feelings with other people I am almost always disappointed in the answers I get, since it lacks tue depth I crave. I end up feeling alone as no one underatands what I mean. Especially the people I care about. 
5	I identified with this. \n\nThen I remembered that ENFJs profiles were initially built by other types, and grew from what other people thought of us. What people think of us is not always correct, and misses out certain aspects of us a lot. \n\nJust because *we appear* to be constantly based around servitude, it doesn’t mean that *we are*. We are capable of living for ourselves and reaching for our needs too. I’m fed up with ENFJs on forums playing up the narrative that we must always have other people at centre-focus. That our super-powers are limited to ‘giving’  and ‘being thoughtful’, when in reality, how we use our FE can vary greatly. It’s important to know that we are should, and are capable of looking out for ourselves too.
7	ENFJs might not have any cool super powers like building a robot from scratch such as ISTP, but, our good judgment on people and situations can save us a lot of time from things that don’t deserve us. Also, all the ENFJs (literally 2, we are very rare) and myself are in very happy, and healthy marriages. We make it a point to obtain the good in all our relationships. Don’t be sad OP, be grateful! Being hypersensitive has its perks. And also it’s drawbacks, but that comes with any personality type. We are here for you. 
3	ENTJ here just popping in to say I have a vast appreciation of ENFJs, they’re great! There’s so much about ENFJs that are unique, I love how you all have the ability to bring people together and really make everyone feel important (because they are). You all are true team players and make good leaders and I’ve found that ENFJs make excellent teachers also. \n\nMy mother is an ENFJ, I wouldn’t be the person I am today without her. \n\nKeep being you, you’re great and we need people like you in the world. 
3	https://chat.whatsapp.com/CWcu6DP6qIG9rk9iWmbwPH\n\nIf you would like to meet some enfj folks I would like to invite you to join our Whatsapp chat group. It's a super friendly supportive group of enfjs 🙃
1	it's hard to find time to connect with enfjs even after finding one 😅
1	Being able to make friends and understand what makes almost anyone tick sounds like a superpower to me, and would to most other "types". \n\nI get the flipside though - I am enjoying some important "me time" after weeks and weeks of friends taking me up on my perhaps-too-generous invitation to come visit. I must remember to balance "them time" with "me time" - otherwise you "give" until you've got nothing left...

4	I'm an ENFJ and I grew up seeing my parents being fun and lovey dovey so that makes me hold priority for someone that's physically affectionate. I have experienced relationships in America, South Korea, and Philippines. So far Filipina women win it on affection
3	I’m an ENFJ and I’m big on quality time, affirmations because it makes me feel warm and fuzzy on the inside 🥰. And I love physical touch. 
2	ENFJ. #1 was physical touch and the rest (minus gifts) were all the same 🤷🏻‍♀️
2	ENFJ - #1 words of affirmation.  #2 physical touch.  #3 quality time.  #4 acts of service.  #5 gifts.

2	How do my fellow enfjs go about spotting other enfjs ?	I feel like because of how versatile enfjs are, it always hard to spot them. Ive mistaken quite a few enfps for enfjs and even some isfjs for enfjs. I was wondering how people go about spotting enfjs ? \n\n
2	I don’t know any ENFJs either
1	people aren't like pokemon where you get random encounters and identify their MBTI.  Especially so if you don't know how to type people (I know I can't xD).  My best friend is an ENFJ, and honestly I didn't know until he took the test and we looked into his cognative functions.  The defining difference between ENFPs and ENFJs is that ENFPs tend to look at possibilities and ENFJs are very decisive.  ISFJs I'm not too sure because I don't have any friends like that 
1	The only other ENFJ I know is my adult nephew. 
13	Do any ENFJs out there believe in astrology?	Why or why not?
8	enfj here.\n\nyes, i think i do.\n\ni'm at this really interesting part of my life right now, and lately i've really taken a deep interest in astrology - it's really quite fascinating. digging into it has been incredibly introspective for me and i strongly resonate with my full natal chart - it's MUCH more personal, relatable, and DEEP - so deep - than any "horoscope" i've ever read - which is what gives astrology a bad rep amongst most folk.\n\nsince i've taken an interest in astrology - much like mbti - i feel so in tune with myself, i can empathize and understand myself better, and so my inner work has been extremely intense and very progressive. that's been really important to me.\n\n\~ sun in leo, ascendant in capricorn, moon/mercury/venus in cancer.
11	Nope. Not me. \n\nFirst of all. Astrology was invented when people still believed the world was flat and the universe revolved around the earth. \n\nSecondly, I’m in charge of my own destiny. That’s been obvious to me from a very young age. \n\nThirdly. You can read those horoscopes and find a way to relate it to anyone. \n\nYou could say some of the same things about Briggs Meyer. But at least there’s some legitimate science and study to back all of it up. \n\n
3	No, because horoscopes are always vague and can be read in different ways. I have also seen sites recycle same stuff with other horoscopes. But formost, i would not let the mbti or astrology define me or my life in general because that is straight up nonsense
3	I do not. 
5	Hell yeah I do i do!! 
3	Astrology is BS lol
2	No I don’t play pretend
2	Yeah, it's real. Anyone who doesn't agree is just oriented differently which makes them incapable of understanding it on a realistic level, and probably has not done in depth research before writing it off as bullshit; which is fine, because not everything is for everyone, and basically no one has to accept each other's ideas, but saying something is untrue without in depth study is most likely just ignorant, because most concepts simply have a different way of application which just aren't useful and practical to everyone, such as mathematics and science aren't useful to everyone in their day to day lives, but you don't see me saying those things are completely false -- just not useful for me, which makes it easy to think anyone who wastes their time on such things is a narrow minded fool, among other things, but for them it's just as real and useful as what the next guy thinks. So there is no argument. People should simply let others be without expecting others to conform to their beliefs. Unfortunately most people who don't want to let others be are the ones who aren't open minded to other people's ideas, and think they are correct, which makes the world not a nice place. Honestly everyone should leave each other be and go their own ways, instead of trying to get the world to conform to their beliefs, as if they are the center of the universe, and think they can be correct as a spec of dust in an infinite universe, where most likely other more intelligent life doesn't know or care if that spec of dust even exists or not.  
1	Funny I found this post:\nI am an ENFJ and can totally relate to this personality type. In high school, I was obsessed with astrology and would learn how for was a birth chart and understand the meaning of all the different planets and houses. I was so obsessed that I became the astrologer of my class, whether people believe it or not, I was pretty accurate with my readings. Even my philosophy teacher told me her sun sign ahah\nNowadays, I'm not as obsessed as my INTJ boyfriend finds it quite weird, so I keep it to myself and enjoy it sometimes (it's not a surprise to me that an INJT would not like astrology, it's a pseudo science so nothing logical and scientific to them ahah)\nBut yes, astrology has always been a big passion in my life, as well as hand reading.
28	ENFJ to do list:	‪- vacuum‬\n‪- dishes‬\n‪- remind all ur friends that they’re the best thing to happen to the universe‬\n‪- homework‬
15	I have a daily list of obligations that goes like: \n\nschool\n\nwork \n\ncoffee with a friend who's going through a breakup \n\nhomework\n\ngroceries\n\nmoral support for my roommate \n\n&#x200B;\n\nit's just us ENFJ's ;) \n\n&#x200B;
8	It be like that
3	My actual today list? :P  \n\nDone:  \n-Work, and everything it involves  \n-Check on a friend for news on a new job  \n-Walk with a friend from work on my way home  \n-Send a sunshine message to another friend  \n-Answer in my family group chat  \n-Answer in my sisters group chat  \n-Answer someone for a project we are working on  \n-Go get and try on my new headphones!!  \n-Pet the cats  \n-Send picture of headphones to get news from yet another friend  \n\nNot yet done:  \n-Say hi to my best friend  \n-Tell the friend who told me about the headphones that I received them  \n-Eat  \n-Say welcome to like 10 people to yet another group chat  \n-Relax  \n\nHow did I ever think I was an introvert is beyond me.
3	-Take care of self\n\n-Learn to not worry so much\n\nSo many times I wish my ENFJ wasn't hurt by her own need to care about so many things. 
2	Damn that’s really my life lmao
2	Lemon Water-Coffee-Tea; Sandwich; Work (Get random girl from the bar last night a job; start negotiations between current boss and the client who originally hired me); offer to cover for someone tomorrow; eat eggs; skip another bar with other friends tonight; grocery shop; bomb-ass pasta; weed, lemon water. \n\nTomorrow: make sure no one throws food in the dirty laundry, like last time. 
6	fellow ENFJs in relationships: who said "I love you" first?	just trying to get some perspective from this community. I'm a female ENFJ, he is ENFP. we're going on 8 months strong. \n\nsome background: my first long-term relationship was with an ESTJ. he said he loved me about 5 or 6 months into the relationship.  next long-term was also ENFP. he told me he loved me about 7 months into the relationship. \n\nnow with my current guy, and I know I love him. but I can't say it to him! he is the kindest, most giving person I've ever met. we took a 2-week vacation over the Christmas break and I was scared that I'd scare him with the little things... but he's been so patient with me. I know that the more I spend time with him, my feelings for him just get stronger. but I don't know why I just can't say it. every time I think about it, I get flustered. fear of rejection maybe? it's like I'm too shy to say it, which is the opposite of what ENFJs usually are known for (being upfront). he hasn't said it to me, and that's ok. I can wait. but there's this inner voice in my head that keeps nagging me to just say it, and my mouth won't cooperate. \n\nanyone else (particularly female) going thru this? any advice?
4	This has not been my experience, but I think I know why. I asked my husband out, said I love you first, and asked my husband to marry me. \nHowever, I have bipolar disorder and when i met him I was on the manic end, which means increase confidence and decreased inhibition. If I had been depressed or stable at the time I never ever would have. Sorry I cant be more helpful. 
2	i said i love you first. :3 now he's my fiance
1	I am going through the EXACT SAME THING with my ISTP boyfriend. I'm trying not to rush anything and I have to keep holding it in because I don't want to scare him! I hate this feeling 😞
1	My boyfriend was the first to say I love you. I’ll be honest he said it quite quickly and since it was my first relationship I was hesitant to say it back I guess at the time I was unsure about the relationship and didn’t feel the same way so it took me a while to say it back. 
1	Okay, can I just say that when I dated my ex.. she said that she loved me first. But when we broke up, she accused me of saying it first and told me she wasn’t interested in me to begin with xD is this a pride thing? Or was she telling the truth now that we were broken up
2	Hello Enfjs	Hello Enfjs,\n\nIf you wanna chat with ENTP guy, send me a private message :).\n\nNever have been chatted with ENFJ so suprise me :D\n\nWaiting for ya!\n\n&#x200B;
15	Does anyone else feel just emotionally hurt for no reason?	I've skirted with symptoms of anxiety and depression for a few years. It hasn't been nearly as severe lately, but I've  just been feeling like something will hurt me, emotionally, and I'll carry it around for the rest of the day. \n\nIt's like my skin feels extra sensitive, my chest feels tight, and it's harder to breathe throughout the day.   \n\n\nSometimes, I'll feel like I'm on the verge of shaking/crying all the time.   \nI have no idea if it's an anxiety thing, or an ENFJ thing. Feeling kind of sad and oversensitive.   \n\n\nDoes anyone else feel this way? If so, how do you get over it?
4	I think every emotionally charged person feels this way sometimes. I have had more than my share of days like this. I can remember this happening all the way back in grade school. I would just have days that I cried. I still do. Unfortunately, I can't make tears and that makes it feel like it is much worse. Hang in there. You already know that you get through these days. The joy returns. 
6	I feel this way sometimes when I see that whatever I have done for someone wasn’t appreciated. It makes me feel worthless and unappreciated. But then I just remind myself that a true giver doesn’t expect anything back from others, and the ones that do are merely “traders”. It allows you to care about others in a healthier way. Not saying your situation involves people, this is just my experience.\nI would love to see if I can help more and ask if anything specific is causing you this?
2	In my experience, this only happens with people or when someone tells me that my dreams are "impossible" to achieve and I like a good challenge.\n\nI have felt this way with my introverted feelings only whenever I have done something for someone that is well appreciated, but doesn't feel natural to another person. For me whenever my random acts of kindness, dedication, or time is taken for someone is taken for granted as weakness, I sometimes carry that on for a very long time and don't realize why I'm upset. I know that it's mostly an ENFJ thing when you do something that's so tailored to a person, and sometimes that perceived as in-genuine "chaotic good" behavior and feels weird or our of the ordinary to another person, so there is appreciation but no sense of gratitude.\n\nFreedom to explore, have positive or constructive conversations, doing things you love, staying curious to learn new things from others around you, helping people grow, and no matter what be the best and most honest version of yourself to the fullest. The way to calm more intrusive thoughts and care about people while taking care of yourself.\n\nFor me the statement, "the joy ENFJs take in moving things forward means that there is always a sense of purpose behind their friendships, creating bonds that are not easily shaken" is one I highly resonate with and "at the heart of it, ENFJs need to see how the story ends, to feel and experience the gratitude and appreciation of the people they’ve helped in order to be happy."\n\nThis is just my experience so far in life.
2	The timing that you posted this is perfect because I have been feeling this way a lot recently. I also dance with depression and anxiety and have very intensely for the past several years. I know part of it is my day to day situation that I am stuck in for the time being... but it has definitely left me having days where, for lack of a better explanation, I feel sensitive to the point of feeling almost as if my "emotional skin" is utterly removed and I feel very... raw. I dont know how else to describe it but it gets to the point where I feel like I cant be around anyone for fear that I will get hurt. Most days, I can power through difficult situations, mean people and just general stress. But on days when I feel this raw feeling, I just absolutely cant handle anything and I feel very anxious and depressed. These days arent totally random and usually come from a build up of situations that I feel very helpless and open to attacks in but man are they difficult to power through with my normal level of intensity.
0	I do but I know the reasons. 
5	What are you grateful for today?	Hey ENFJs and everyone else! What are you grateful for today?\n\nIs it an accomplishment? Something that made you happy? Something meaningful?\n\nLet's make the world a little brighter together!
8	I am grateful that I am alive and that I can keep trying. 
3	I'm grateful for good mentors, a loving family, and kick-ass friends.
3	That I met my lost love. Miss her every day but couldn’t be happier that we shared what we did. \nLong night tonight..
1	Waking up to my dog. She’s getting old and having her around is great 
14	Trouble sticking to a career path	Hello fellow ENFJs! I tend to hype myself up and talk myself into different career paths and changing jobs every year. I change hobbies every couple months. As far as goals, I can make and stick to them, but the path is always winding (E.g. weight loss- I've tried several different methods over the past year, and I'm down 30lbs) Does anyone else struggle with this?? How do I combat this professionally? I'm thinking some role where there are new problems to solve and frequent change of scenery and a team to lead. This month, I want to be a training manger in a growing company. It FEELS like a great fit, but so did all the other ones. Any ideas?
9	Personnaly I always need change. Repetition gets boring. Either find a job that offers that or change every few years. I see no problem with changing once in a while if your life situation allows that. 
3	I’m the same way, and I’ve been told to be a professor at a university. Variety of classes in your discipline & you can research whatever you are more interested in at the moment. I’m looking to jump back into wilderness therapy because it’s so diverse, lots of different elements of the outdoors & the human mind at play
2	I joined this sub because im very unhappy with my career choice and need some help finding a new reasonable one. 
2	For sure. I always *feel* like one career is my calling and when I research more about it or actually get onto the academic side to learn about it, I tend to get discouraged. It feels like all my decisions are based on what sounds good and I have an idealized image of it in my mind.\n\nI was in a competitive medical program in my undergrad for over 2 years and by the end of the semester when stuff got real, I did not do well at all. It was all too much to handle and I thought having the ambition to help people would be enough for me but it wasn’t. Since the end of this past summer, I switched into business because I wanted to capitalize on my skills as a strong communicator and thought the field is broad and very much in demand.\n\nI have a focus in marketing and I was interested in advertising and designing those high quality Super Bowl commercials and the whole nine yards. I want to be in market strategy and see it as a way for me to be creative and utilize my communication to be a leader. A couple days ago my mom responded saying “ok that’s good but you don’t know what market strategy is”. I was ready to respond but nothing came out, because she was right. \n\nI started an internship on Wall Street a couple weeks ago and was super pumped but now I’m already over it. Still trying to figure out this all myself and find my true calling
1	The longest I have stayed at a full time job is 2.5 years, and it was Help Desk. Because of that, every day was a bit different, if somewhat repetitive after a while. My current job/company makes it so every day is different enough that it keeps me on my feet.\n\nAs for hobbies, it's usually cycles. I go crazy into one, drop it for a few months, go back, drop it again... and that counts for shows/books/games/creative things...\n\nI'd say working in a startup or for a smaller, newer (less than 15 yo) company has better chances of keeping you in a position where things change often and quickly. Big corporate offices usually have defined systems and any change takes a while to get implemented. But it can mean giving up security and a sense of calm in the office.\n\nPersonally, I find a "human, ever changing" environment more rewarding. 
1	Actually, I can't relate. My interests have always been fairly consistent (writing, English lit) and when I discovered I loved teaching, I never looked back. It's been 8 years since I began and I don't think I'll do anything else, ever.\n\nThat being said, I enjoy variety inside my job. I'm always challenging myself to teach a new topic, develop a new activity, etc. Recently I've taken on more administrative duties and I enjoy the new challenge. \n\nMaybe you just haven't found your calling yet?

3	It describes it really well!\n\nInterestingly, I always thought I was weird for not being able to describe how I felt. It took 28 years before I was able to say "I am angry at myself, and I feel shame and sadness" or even "happiness feels warm in my chest".\n\nI like the difference between Ti and Fi as described in the video. I'll try and take it into account when choosing what skill to use.
1	Love her ❤️
18	Reaction to constant stress	I've been studying my past behaviours and my reaction to stress much more lately, and I realize I can almost predict what will happen in advance now (and sometimes prevent it).\n\nThat's my usual timeline with being constantly stressed:\n\nAt the first sign of stress, I get incredibly anxious. I start doubting myself so I'll look around and talk it out with people. I'll also use coping strategies very easily.\n\nIf the stressers stay or new ones come, I'll start feeling the need to fix things. I'll throw myself deep into "improvement" projects, the more people positively affected, the better it is. I'll almost forget about me, and will think about how things should be better for everyone. I'll start complaining more openly about general issues. I keep on using coping strategies, but it will be harder, since all my time is spent trying to *fix/improve* things.\n\nIf I fail at improving things to a point that satisfies me, which is the case 99% of the time, I'll start getting physically ill. My mental health will be deteriorating but I'll refuse to acknowledge it. I'll start complaining to whomever is listening, but I'll never feel they understand. I'll start acting both very outgoing and retreating in fear, like I can't make up my mind. Coping strategies will become hard to implement.\n\nWhen I become incredibly critical or judgmental of others, I know I'm hitting dangerous territory. I'll be making snap judgments, and then feel shame and guilt, but I can't help it. I will try to protect others from myself as much as I can, and I'll voice that I am unwell so I can get help. And I usually get help at this part, not because I'm afraid for me, but because I don't like how I act towards others.\n\nAnd then, I start isolating. If someone asks me how I am doing, or points out that I look tired, I'll use very short sentences, and gloss over it. Getting out of there requires incredible willpower, and outside help. Unfortunately, that's usually when people realize I look unwell, so in their heads, I'm still early on in my stress response.\n\nTL;DR\n\nI'll start by using a lot of adjectives and long sentences to describe my stress, but ultimately put it aside to help you. The shorter my sentences and the more critical I am of others and myself, the more stressed I am. When I start isolating and distrusting people to the point of barely opening up about my state, I'm in a bad place.\n\nNo matter where I am in the whole process, I'll still smile and laugh, which is both a blessing and a curse.\n\nI'm currently standing very close to the "bad place", but being aware of it helps.\n\nWhat does your stress timeline look like? How do you let people know where you are standing?
5	If I’m very quiet and moving my eyes from places to place, I’m stressed. I sigh deeply and will around, trying to piece my thoughts together in order to come with a plan to combat whatever’s bothering me. \n\nIf I speak in my stress, I’ll speak with very few words like you. With my brain moving quickly, I can’t speak and problem solve at the same time. I have to have a plan of action and then only can I speak normally. This stress originated from things I don’t see coming, usually things academic oriented
2	I relate to this timeline very much. I have been in a very weird situation that has locked me into a place in my life where I have remained in the last stage for several years. I no longer have any energy to go out and be around others in situations other than what is demanded of me. I have become intensely introverted in a place of utter protection from the outside. I am excited to be out of this once again and go back to enjoying life and wanting to be around people. Currently, I will frequently oscillate between fixing broken situations and giving up. A lot of my stress has come from remaining in very, very broken situations that I have had to stay in for several years now. It is starting to come to an end now but it has definitely given me a new perspective on coping and functioning in that last stage... \n\nI also very much related to the gift/curse of being able to laugh and smile through it all. Part of my isolation is how, due to my incredible facade, no one truly knows or understands what I am emotionally going through so I have shut myself off from truly opening up around people. Not a great place to be but there really hasnt been another option. In the past, situations like these have generally hospitalized me. As I've grown and learned how to handle them better, I've avoided the hospital more and more. Never be afraid to take a massive step back and do what makes you happy for a bit. Your gut may tell you otherwise, but you need to put yourself first because generally, no one else will (unless you run into another ENFJ hahaha). Glad you shared this. 
1	The best way to cope with stress myself is to take a deep breath. By that I mean do something you love to do or be with friends and do something fun if you can. Just take a day off and gather yourself if you can. However do not be alone if you are depressed in anyway emotions control us and we can fall into a never ending cycle of beating ourselves up because we internalize our thoughts. Life is a bitch and it’s not always easy so perspective always helped me. For example there are kids starving in Africa in war torn communities. Or North Koreans that have no freedom. Knowing that I’m not the worst one off helps me to reflect if I get knocked off my feet and it helps me realize the things I do have. Hope that things start turning your way!
21	Do you feel like you are there for your friends all the time, but when you need them, they are not there?	Hello fellow ENFJ people. Do you feel like sometimes your friends just don't give a f about you and what is happening in your life?\n\nI recently lost a parent after very tough battle and  I tried to be strong and not let anyone see I am actually a huge mess.\nMy friends were there, sure, they came to the funeral but after few weeks no one even bothered to ask me how am I doing.\n\nNow after few months one friend feels free to call me at 2am to tell me how she almost had a sex with some guy, other one is crying because she can't decide which guy to choose from the 3 they are after her. The other one wants me to go shopping with her because she is moving in with a boyfriend and one of my best guy friends is complaining why he can't study and pass exams because he is still sad since his girlfriend left him 2 years ago.\n\nI love my friends and I am always there for them. I am happy they have happy/interesting life and I want them to be happy, always. \nBut not one of them asked me since all of that happened do I need help, if I want to talk. \nSome of them even say oh I don't want to ask you anything it must be hard. And I just stand there and am like it is hard.\n\nI know it's a hard topic to talk about but recently I feel like they feel free to ask for my help when they need it but never ask me if I need them or their help. Or maybe just to understand that now, maybe I don't want to cheer them up every day. I need them to cheer me up.\n\nIs this normal for our type or is it just my personal problem? 
11	Yes. All the time. I've been thinking a lot about this phenomenon. I think it's part of the curse of being mostly stable. I've been having a really rough time lately, but when I try to talk to my friends about my troubles, I get something along the lines of, "If anyone can handle this, you can."\n\n\n\nThey are used to us being OK.  And maybe it causes too much cognitive dissonance for them to entertain the idea that we are not.  Or maybe they just don't understand how dire it gets for us. \n\nI'm not sure which, but I don't think it's lack of care or love for us. It's just that they don't know what to do when the caretaker needs care. 
3	Not sure if this’ll help, but look at how things usually are. Humans are creatures of habit and therefore (mostly) enjoy it when things are normal. Look at how (for the lack of a better word) messed up you are when one thing happens to you vs. the same happening to them. Look at how you’ve put yourself out there, in relation to how put together, emotional, or how fixated on your loss you’re letting your friends pick up on. Also pay attention to just how well they pick up on things like that.\nLastly, you have my condolences, fellow Redditor. Time really is one of the best ways to stop thinking about losses, it will get good :)
3	Yep definitely. I have 2 friends that I can say I 100% can count on no matter what. I'm trying hard to make more (because of those 2 peoplebut1 is extremely busy with her hands always full but still tries and the other is 3500 miles and 2 timezones away) but so far not much luck. One I thought was going to be great but ends up she mostly contacts me either in crisis mode (men problems) or when she needs to borrow $$ 😑. People are selfish AF sometimes and I honestly find it disheartening.\n\nI wish I had some advice. All I can say is you're not alone. I get tired of always being the go-to person and not having much in return. We aren't giving people because we expect something in return but FFS it'd be nice sometimes!! I'm so sorry for your loss. That absolutely sucks. What about maybe seeing a grief counselor for a little while? Might be nice to have some real support. *Hugs*
2	Yeah pretty much, but i do not want to burden them with my problems anyway so i prefer to suffer alone. Given the fact that they are you friends then i would consider telling them how you feel, i am sure that they would understand, and if they do not understand then you know where you stand in their world.
2	I think the comments above are accurate.  Also wanted to say:  Dude, how ARE you feeling at the moment? Please vent to us if it can be any help to you. You need to off load the grief somewhere, and we are here for you if you need. Xx
1	YEAH.
1	Mine are there for me but in their own way, not in the way I am for them. So it feels lesser but it isn’t. Wishing people to go above and beyond for you is normal but everyone can only do what they’re able. We’re just very much willing and able types to go crazy above
3	Engaged to an ISTP	First of all, WHAT IN THE ACTUAL F**CK have I gotten myself into. It seems like we are the complete opposite. ENFJ are so nurturing and it seems ISTP are just like “meh” lol. I love him and I know he loves me. We’ve had the talk about being sure we’re ready for marriage but at times it seems like I want him to be so happy that at times I outweigh what I can do without. Sometimes he’s quick to make a decision without me yet want to be so affectionate and silly, laughing and all. Those times that make me crazy are when he expresses his feelings, as an ENFJ (ignore that I’m a woman for right now), I support him, give suggestions, he’s always so grateful but then when I need to express myself it seems like I’m being needy or that he “doesn’t know what I want from him”. He supports me vice versa financially, mentally, emotionally but it just seems like we disconnect somewhere. I find myself wanting to make him happy and wanting to be his best friend as well as his life partner as we have both voiced but how can we do this when every blue moon we have this argument that he sees one way (but I see too) and I see something one way (but he can’t see it). I get the logic thinker part is the biggest thing about an ISTP but how are we supposed to build a marriage on this when I feel like I’m too clingy and he’s not enough clingy or considerate to my feelings when it counts the most!?
3	First of all... Breathe.\n\nYou need to understand that there are pros and cons to dating any type! Not everyone can be ENFJ. Not everyone understands emotions as naturally as you do.\n\nI have an INTP best friend (also Ti dominant), and he also only responds to logic. The emotions are processed in isolation, and in short bursts. But you CAN convince them to communicate better, you just need to phrase it in a what that "makes sense" or brings some sort of benefit.\n\nWhatever you do - DO NOT INDULGE IN DUMPING\n\nIf you need help (or his opinion) on a problem, SUMMARISE the situation as much as possible. Forgo the details (ISTP can connect the dots quite well, and are bored by details).\n\nISTPs are not emotional cushions (men in general are not this way, especially if introverted), so a good investment is to spend regular time with a female friend who is an "extroverted" type, maybe once a week.\n\nIf all else fails, yo "can" decide to find another man... But remember that QUALITY men are in general very difficult to find, let alone pin down. Only do this if you are absolutely sure that your man lacks quality!\n\n~IS"F"P, dating an ENFJ\n\nPS: if you are getting married, you might want to subscribe to r/redpillwomen\n\n
3	every ISTP I know and met so far 😞. be patient. not everyone understands emotions the same way. don't ever derail what you value and start with the things you share.
2	I’m dating and ISTJ and I feel the SAME WAY like we are two Opposite and sometimes that clashes hard \nEdit: we are also engaged and I struggle so much with communication 
2	Look up istp /enfj on reddit. There are tons of great posts and comments. \n\nEg. https://www.reddit.com/r/enfj/comments/9zurpm/enfjistp_relationship_advice/?st=JRQYQHQG&sh=434534b4
1	That's because you pretty much are the complete opposite. Mbti doesn't think it's wise to marry your dual, although socionics does. Well maybe not marry, but your dual is there for your growth, and to take away insecurities by experiencing each other and getting comfortable. It's supposed to be a hard relationship for personal growth. It's wise to be with an INFP or ENFP, as an ENFJ, if you want to get married, or just have a good relationship in general. \n\nThis video might be helpful:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/yEh3HY5YNx4
1	I’m an ENFJ and my boyfriend is an ISTP so I feel your struggle. We’ve been together for almost 8 years and fully intend on getting married but I understand that struggle of feeling like I do so much for him (by choice) and need his attention a lot when he is perfectly content to just do his own thing. It took awhile for me to not take it personally and just recognize that we need different things out of the relationship.
55	Based on what I've learned about y'all, this seemed accurate.	
6	Hi! Ive never met someone who I know is definitely an ENFJ, but ive heard you guys are sort of awesome. Anyone want to talk? ENFP here:)	Just an American ENFP guy...I truly have no idea what y'all are like but I want to!
3	Well we sure are. And so are ENFPs! Humans are absolutely fascinating.\n\nI had a conversation with my boss the other day. He was saying how everyone in the team is just so different on so many levels, and how the person I want to bring in is also completely different.\n\nWe exchanged a silly, happy smile. My boss and I get along well.\n\n*People*, love them, hate them. Mostly love them.\n\nIf you had to invent a best friend on the spot and do an activity of your choice with them, what would it be, and why?
2	Oh hey! How's it going? Been to the states a few times and you guys are hella friendly. Where you from?

13	Crushing on enfj girl	Hey guys enfp male here, I just went to have some coffee with and enfj girl and I had such a great time! She couldn't stop playing around with her coffee cup and she asked lots of fun questions like when do I wanna marry and stuff, I think we have a good vibe going and I'm looking forward to going out as a date with her next time! \n\n So yeah guys, any tips and any warnings, also any enfp traits that I should be careful about?\nLove yall
6	My ex was an ENFP. I found that sometimes he didn't stick to his word/wasn't focussed enough and was easily distracted in the relationship. We also were totally conflict adverse and when we argued it  was very  emotional. I  enjoyed the boundless cute affection and warmth though. 
4	I'll just leave this here.  [ENFJs and Relationships](https://www.reddit.com/r/enfj/comments/9le99s/ama_enfjs_and_relationships/)
3	My SO (f) is an ENFP and I (m) am ENFJ. The biggest problems we face are really when I try to avoid conflict and/or judge myself, but those aren't big problems in general since I knew that from before and we both have learned how to deal with it when it happens. We have been together for more than three years and I have never been happier.  As long as you're both having fund and are always open and honest to each other I think you have nothing to worry about. If it fits it will be wonderful, if it doesn't it wasn't meant to be. Good luck and have fun! 
2	Just be yourself, don’t try to change yourself. Be open just do what you were doing.

33	I’m “TOO Positive”	Do your friends ever get mad or annoyed at you for being “too positive” like I see myself as an extremely negative person who’s tryna get out of a depressing hole of anxiety and yet I’m still called out for this... Anyone relate or am I just weird...  Edit: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR BEAUTIFUL UPLIFTING REPLIES <33 
19	"I am too much for some people. They are not my people." \n\nFriend...you're the only one who has to look you in the mirror. Be enough - be the best - for you. 
10	You aren’t alone. Some friends have gotten mad because when they come to me and I give “too much advice and am too positive” and they just would like to sulk in the negative. Honestly it’s a blessing and a curse. Our ability to empathize with people is above all others- but it can get messy sometimes. 
9	People tell me it’s not posible or I must be lying or faking my energy. Haha fuck them maybe some day they’ll learn how to flow with what ever and accept what’s real as it is now and enjoy it fully as it comes!! I can relate to being in very depressed times through out my life as well so it’s funny when people tell me I am a ray of sunshine or some corny shit
5	Yep. Been told that all my life. Too happy. Too positive. Too this, too that.  You know what? Fuck that shit. We are AWESOME. I would much rather be around someone like us, than someone who is extremely negative or unhappy. I’m sure a lot of us are also very empathetic and try to help people who are down. It’s just who we are. \n\nChin up. Wear your HAPPY with Pride!!  We’ve got you!\n💗
5	Mhm I think that's what makes you an unstoppable force ;p\nI've had people tell me I'm not even positive anymore, that I'm at the point of being naïve. But hey, I know what's going on, I really do, but what's the point of sulking about it? I'd rather tell myself, "there has to be a way!" \nSomeone's going to really like that about you, you'll find them one day :)
5	I have been told the same thing by coworkers and friends. Little do they know, day to day I'm actually a pessimist and quite negative. That being said, I don't want to bring others down and my need for everyone to be happy is more important to me, so when I'm around others apart from my SO I smile and joke around. The world can be a depressing place sometimes, sue us for trying to make it a tiny bit brighter. 
5	My friends don’t get mad at me for being too positive but it is a descriptor they use for me. I would say I’m a negative person because I am always in my head and worrying, and anticipating the worst. But when I say that about myself they are surprised and say I am one of the most positive people they know. I find it confusing (and interesting) that how I think I come across to people isn’t how they see me at all.
2	Actually had a pretty rough relationship a few years back that left me feeling like an idiot for having a positive outlook on things. It made me look naive in my friend's eyes, and so for a long time I tried very hard to be more "realistic" so as not to annoy this friend. It turned me skeptical of people having good intentions and good things happening for a long time... Not a good place for an ENFJ. \n\nBut I learned after that: if someone thinks you're naive/annoying for being positive, they can deal with that. Life is too short to be anything but positive, and there are so many more people who are gonna love you for the joy you bring into their day.\n

3	I've often looked at the world with rose-colored glasses. Over the past ten years, I've tempered it, becoming more "T" than "F"
1	Omg I get this soooo much, my best friend says that!!!
