6	Looking for Moderators.	As we all know, this sub is relatively inactive and quiet compared to the other MBTI subs. Throughout my 2ish years as the occasional spam remover, I've seen that many people would like this sub to be more lively. So I'm putting out a call for anyone interested in becoming a mod. \n\nIdeally I'd like to have a few people come aboard to contribute in discussion threads, features, CSS, or whatever else you have to offer in order to help grow our community. \n\nIf anyone is interested shoot me a pm or leave a comment.\n\nAlso if you'd rather not take on the responsibility of being a mod but have some ideas for the sub, comment here and I'll try to implement them.\n\nLet's try to break 1,000 subs!
2	I'm around, not sure what I could contribute though. I suck at CSS.
1	Oh, pick me! :D\n\nI'm really intense, and study Jungian works pretty much every day. In addition, I'm pretty well-versed in evolutionary theory and I have an interest in the philosophy of religion.\n
9	Banner for the Sub	I would love to work more on making this subreddit more aesthetically pleasing. I would love for us to have a banner on this sub! Is anyone interested in making one? If you do, feel free to post them on [moodboard](http://www.gomoodboard.com/boards/CHkep071/share). One of them will be selected and used. \n\nThank you so much and have a great day!
2	Over at INFP we had users submit image ideas to a sticky-post [moodboard](http://www.gomoodboard.com/), then selected the favorite for our banner. 
1	Holy crap, haven't been here in just over a month and we now have a banner and everything! LOVE IT 
1	I need more karma so I can make an INFJ/ESFP post on this thread.
4	ENFP Male Interviewing ESFP Female Andrea Kwan Se-Fi CP/B(S) MF	
1	Who’s Dave...?
1	just wondering how ESFPs would respond to this	[u/throwaway3n1p](https://www.reddit.com/u/throwaway3n1p) and I are currently working on gathering answers for how thought processes work in different MBTI types. This is just out of curiosity, not an attempt to stalk you according to how you think of grave crimes. All replies are appreciated!\n\nIf we count judgments of *moral obligation* out of the equation, \n\nQuestion 1: How is murder logically fine?\n\nQuestion 2: How is murder logically wrong?\n\nNOTE: Feel free to write down whatever thought you have, whether it is emotional or just plain retarded.
2	1. Murder is logically fine if the recipient of death is going to cause more deaths or worse deaths than their own death. It would not be wrong to kill someone if they are harmful to a great many people, aka Hitler, Stalin, and some current politicians I won’t name. Do the ends justify the means?\n\n2. In the same sense, murder is not logically correct because the people deserve to live and though they may have done wrong — we have prison for that sort of thing. Though it does leave you with the question — if someone asks to be killed or will live in suffrage, is murder okay? 
2	Murder is logically fine when you take a step back and note that it’s part of the circle of life. That animals have killed other animals for survival/for fun and that our remains decompose to feed the grass and trees. \n\nKind of like what Mufasa says in the Lion King
1	This question hugely conflicted me. I'm very much against killing, however if put in a scenario of kill or be killed I think my survival instinct would take over. However the question is excluding moral obligation, and purely out of a logical sense.\n\n1) I think murder is logically fine when defending yourself or others from someone from certain death. Logically speaking, you will be removing an evil, malicious person from the gene pool whilst potentially saving multiple lives. \n\n2) I think murder is logically wrong in all scenarios not described in point 1. I can't think of any logical reason murder is fine other than to defend yourself.
1	In my opinion nothing is right or wrong in itself, things only become good or bad inside of a subjective value system
1	1: I don't even believe in capital punishment, as long as we have means to detain dangerous criminals. Look at Ted Bundy, who was an absolute monster, but was useful in profiling serial killers that helped catch others, not only by studying him, but by him sharing his mind about what a person like that looks like, how they think... If instead of executing him, they kept him in a high-security prison, they could have actually made use of him.\n\n2: Without murder being illegal, society would crumble. You need to have a sense of security to self-actualize. Just look at Maslow's pyramid of needs. And without self-actualization, we don't make progress as a civilization. Mind you, we wouldn't be overpopulated, but...
1	1. Murder is never logically fine, if by *fine* you mean something *of high quality*. Is murder logically *right –* as in the proper inverse of (Q2.) *wrong* – and I am to assume by "right," you mean something "morally right" or *ethical,* then I would say: it depends.\n2. Now, how can murder be logically wrong? Or "morally" wrong? It depends. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI should note that I studied philosophy with an emphasis in David Foster Wallace in college, so I'm not so sure if my response above is indicative of "being" an ESFP. If anything, it's indicative of me being a complete cunt.
2	Survey on Personality and Flirting behaviors	 \n\nThe following survey has moderator approval. Hey I am a doctoral Student at a University in the South. I am studying flirtation behaviors, specifically trying to catalog specific flirting behaviors taken from several experimental studies. I was wondering if I could post to this community as it seems relevant to my topic. Thank you in advance for taking the time to take the survey there is an opportunity to win a gift card if the entire survey is completed. You can back out at any time.\n\nHere is the link to the survey\n\n[https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JMQP5PJ](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JMQP5PJ)\n\nThank you again for taking the time
1	Done! FYI there were a lot of repeat questions, and the question “there are rules men and women should follow” is too vague. In context, I can gather what you’re trying to ask but it’s likely you’ll want to dismiss those results from your findings. \n\n\nAlso what’s with the “Choose strongly agree” questions?? Jus curious if it had any purpose or just needed for troubleshooting problems 
14	Why do ESFPs tend to "win" in social situations?	Can anyone explain to me in Jungian terms (or really any terms) why ESFPs tend to be so good at being socially popular? I read once that this type tends to "win" in social situations and I find this to be generally true. \n\nESFPs tend to be stereotyped as being the class clown or like the pop star, but there are other less flashy, notable ESFPs who just know how to work a room. The politicians like Bill Clinton or Chris Christie are two examples. \n\nIs this a function of Extraverted Sensing? Given that they intuitively know what people in a group are looking for, so to speak, some ESFP's I've met seem to have a sort of version of Extraverted Feeling. 
10	I can only speak from personal experience. I feed off of the energy in a room and am pretty aware of the vibe and the roles everyone is playing in any particular crowd. Because I can get caught up in a bad vibe as well as a good one, I gravitate towards whoever has the best energy and then bring people into it ! It pumps me up and inspires me to try to include everyone in that bubble of happiness. lol. \nI also LOVE people. I love getting to know them and the feeling of breaking through social carriers with them. \nI can admit, however, that I won't stay for too long after I feel satisfied with the conversation. \nAlso, being as adventurous as I am, I always have a good story to tell. \n\nI hope that answers some of it. I feel like I ranted a little. \n
4	I would actually disagree with this to an extent. A lot of the people most assume to be ESFP aren't ESFP. The two most common types that are likely to be mistaken for ESFP are ENFJ and ESFJ, both of which have dominant Fe a focus on group harmony, which results in being either more adaptable to fit the group dynamic, or by being more capable of influencing the group dynamic to suit yourself.\n\nI wouldn't say that ESFPs are popular per se. Some are very much so, others not at all. ESFPs value Fi, hence are individualistic, and are only willing do to so much to adapt to the social situation. However, they are an ethical type, and they lead with dominant Se, which enables you to perceive the world through opportunities, being aware of the environment, giving you a heads up to adapting. The popular ones are popular because they are fun and fearless. Also, if they have a more 'cheerful' Enneagram type, paired with dominant or auxiliary social instinct, they will be more likely to be popular than an ESFP Enneagram 6, with a 4 fix, that is sx/sp or sp/sx, which will stick out like a sore thumb, may attract a more cult following, but definitely fails at social.
2	I would say I am too fickle and selfish with attention to be any other type. Although it's exciting and I like to inspire, I also know I'll become disinterested and move on once I get to know them. \nBuuut, im new to this stuff. There's an awesome group chat that might help. It's in WhatsApp. Want me to see if I can send you the link to join ?
2	It's easy for me to tell the moods of everyone around me and I'm confident, which attracts people. Another thing is having the right words to say, which I attribute to Fi and Te, I find it easy to talk to people in their own language so to say. Instead of trying to bring everyone into my own world I use phrases and examples that *they* can understand and relate to. Also the general awareness of my surroundings, I can notice something that's happening that will interest everyone and generally check on people in my group to see that everyone is good
2	I relate to a lot of things about ESFP, but this is definitely not one of them lmao. For me, it’s more **HOLY CRAP A BUNCH OF PEOPLE I WANNA GO TALK TO THEM XDDDD**, then I go and most likely make a fool out of myself, or they laugh, who knows. But I definitely don’t “intuitively read the room,” in fact quite the opposite. I just go off and be myself, and if I get rejected, shiieeeett, if I don’t, noiicceeee. lol \n\nI also suck with social cues, it’s not that I don’t see them, it’s because I feel like “ONE DIRTY LOOK AIN’T GONNA SHUT ME DOWN ECKSDEE” and I keep going. Bites me in the ass a lot tbh but I’m working on that
1	You don’t. 
1	In my experience I genuinely enjoy meeting new people. I'm excited to hear their story and tell them mine. I always welcome new friends and opportunities to be social. I'm also goofy, energetic, and always looking for something fun to do.\n\nI've been told I come off as approachable for this reason.\n\nI tend to make friends (and boyfriends) easily.
4	Jet's MBTI - Cast Podcast	Hey Reddit, my name is jetplane48 (ESTP 7w8 sx/sp) and I am starting up a podcast in relation to MBTI. Fundamentally, the goal of the podcast is to educate the viewers of several Typology systems through a series of one-on-one's with others who are interested in the same topics. I have been conducting interviews for many years (MBTI related) and this is just an extension of that, however, I want to discuss topics that the audience wants me to cover. Naturally, I'll come up with my own material but I would love to explore topics that others have in mind. I am busy with school for the next few months but when I finish, the goal is to eventually be more consistent with these podcast uploads if this turns out to be popular enough. I'm very excited to get this started, and let's see some questions!\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAR20eDTSOg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAR20eDTSOg)\n\n&#x200B;
7	Are you good with money?	There's a stereotype that ESFPs are bad with money and are always impulsively spending it. Personally I'm the opposite of that, people have called me stingy before, I never spend it on things I don't need and always save some. How about you?
4	I was super bad at saving money when I was a child, now that I am more aware of my shortcomings, I think I’ll be a lot better with money in the future!
2	I have been taught to save from a young age to save, and I don't have big weekly expenses so it isn't an issue much yet. I feel like when I move out, my spending habits will become more apparent. I tend to have periods of time where I spend a lot of money over a few days. I mentally feel like 'I shouldn't be doing thissssss.' But that doesn't stop me.
2	I'm by no means the worlds greatest penny pincher, but I use my poor planning to my advantage and always assume I'll over spend (which I rarely do). Plus with inspiration from The Now, I can always entertain myself and friends on a budget. So. In a way. I guess I am pretty okay with money.
1	I'm really good with money only cuz I'm minimalist and do a lot flipping, so I don't hold on to much at all
1	I can be better
1	I'm not good with saving any, but I have learnt to pay my bills before I do the rest. I spend too much on food and experiences. And whenever I try to build a buffer, there is some unexpected extra expense that has to go, so I never save anyway.
1	Not at all...\n\nBut I’m working on it :)
7	ESFP and relationships	Hey, \n\nSo happy I found a community for ESFPs. I'm just wondering if anyone else of you have "problems" with settling down. I know it's not a must but what makes you to settle down with the one and only? I find it extremely hard to find the right person. I hate that I miss the feeling to be in love. I go on dates but blah. ESFPs won't settle and sometimes I feel it's a problem. Sorry for this opening up but jeez, I just feel lonely right now. 
7	I'm also an ESFP and I find that it's not I can't settle down, more I can't find the perfect one. I'll be up front and say I have an image of a perfect girl in mind and though I know a person might never really be like that, I tell myself I don't want to date till I find that person. I'm fully aware that it's a problem on me and not society but I think I'm happy knowing that I'm ok flying solo till the perfect girl in my eyes comes by. 
4	Totally. I read something hilarious somewhere (this sub maybe), that said 'ESFP's don't seek out a partner, they just don't get sick of someone for long enough for it to happen.' Exactly my situation right now. My bf is 5 years older than me and a lot more about settling down, whereas that almost scared me off at points. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think realising that anything meaningful has to begin small is important. Maybe someone can become the perfect person. The best relationships offer growth for the both of you. You learn from each other and can try to make small changes that are big for you partner, and vice versa. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe can't live in denial and think we are going to meet someone perfect, and realistically, we are nobodies perfect person either, because we are not perfect ourselves! We all have flaws, and the idea of the perfect person is only going to stop you from putting yourself out there. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEssentially, if the pros outweigh the cons, and you are both growing, they can become your perfect person, and you need to date a bit for experience to not lose them when you find them!
3	I don’t know if this is an ESFP thing, but I always want what I can’t have. I go for girls way out of my league and when I get one to like me back I don’t like them anymore. I’ve done this so many times and I regret not dating them. \n\nI legit think I’m afraid of commitment. 
3	HELP PLS	Hi ENFP male here been talking to this lovely ESFP girl as of late but I can't express this cauldron of emotions I'm experiencing to her in the articular manner I was before knowing about her personal life. \n\nWe were talking real dirty and then she opened up to me and now I just feel all soft and shit and wanna keep sweet talking her instead cause I feel like I care about her now as a person but obviously this is killing that primal flame between us. \n\nShe's been pretty patient with me for the most part but I really wanna treat her like the naughty little thing she is , it's her kink.\n\nESFP females, what do i do ? pls help me lol, I'm emotionally spazing out and i can't think straight 😂\n\n
7	I really don't know. I don't much care for people who center their behavior around me. It feels constricting. Focus on yourself. Sure, show interest, but I tend to be attracted to men who know their value. Also, I am *definitely* NOT romantic, and I find sweet-talk off-putting. That does not mean that every ESFP is the same, however.\n\nThe way people who were attractive before stop being attractive is by re-centering their world around me, instead of themselves.
6	Definitely along the same vein as u/horrorito!\n\nFemale ESFP here. The men I'm most attracted to are the ones who know what they want and aren't impressionable by me or anyone. Same deal with being almost instantly turned off if a guy puts me on a pedestal and tailors their behavior to make me happy.\n\nI don't know if this applies to all ESFPs but I'm really good at reading when people are insincere or their actions are calculated for some kind of return later - i.e. sex! As soon as that happens, I lose complete interest. If you were attractive to me before then you have no reason to start calculating extra shit! I will definitely get wild and dirty on you. :)\n\nI hope this helps... best of luck!
8	I’m so curious, do any other of you ESFPs have weird dreams? I have had really interesting dreams my whole life and I can usually remember them the next day. My husband is an INTJ and he says he has dreams (he thinks) but can’t remember them. What is dreaming like for you fellow ESFPs?	
2	My dreams are very vivid and based on reality, and all the while I'm aware it's a dreams but I'm separated like in two people; the one in the dream and the one controlling it who also hates myself. So dreams are always stress dreams hahhh But I only have dreams like 2 or 3 times a month and they're barely rememberable
1	I can barely remember my dreams reeeeeee\n\nBut I can only assume they’re about things I think about a lot, I bet I had a lot of typology dreams I forgot oof
1	No, on the contrary my dreams are all based on reality. I don't think it's type related
1	One of my earliest memories is a dream I remember I kept having. Growing up I also had super vivid and colorful dreams, but it also stopped for a while. Then I spent ages trying to lucid dream and when I finally managed my dreams went away again. Now I remember them occasionally, and some nights I know I had a dream but I can’t recall them. \n\nMy SO who is an ISTJ dreams a lot as well, and according to him he only remember snippets of them, sometimes the full dream, but more often just bits and pieces of them.
1	I would have very intense dreams when I take melatonin. It’s actually pretty cool for me and I end up remembering it the next day. Don’t really have the same intensity of dreams if I don’t take melatonin 
1	I also commonly dream of real life people I already know. I don't think they reflect my thoughts but definitely showcase possibilities. I particularly enjoy the unrealistic ones lol. 
1	Your dreams are probably more interesting than your life.  \n\nLove,\nINTP
7	What jobs do you ESFPs LOVE?!	Howdy all - I'm currently going through a career crisis as I'm not enjoying my job at the moment. \n\nI feel like I'm too immature for a lot of responsibility and can't have as much fun as I crave in such a professional environment! I also really struggle with doing anything related to planning or long term thinking which is kind of crucial for my current job. \n\nSO. What are some of the jobs that you ESFPs out there have and absolutely love? Or even what jobs do you not love?
6	I am a nurse and I absolutely LOVE my job! Nursing school was definitely not a picnic because it was hard work over two years. However, the hard work was definitely worth it, I couldn’t see myself doing anything else. I work in an emergency room and I love all the action, it’s like watching a crazy movie all day. I get to interact with lots of people and my fellow coworkers. Quite a few of my nurse friends are also ESFPs so that makes for fun shifts. I recommend nursing to people all the time because there are so many different types of nurses! You could be an elementary school nurse, a flight nurse, a medical floor nurse, a travel nurse, or even a sales nurse who teaches. Literally the opportunities are endless AND you make great money.  There are always shortages of nurses so you always have the chance to job hop if you hate the one you’re in.  A perk for an ESFP is that if you work for the state you’ll get a pension so then you don’t have to do all that long term planning for retirement, it’s win win!
4	Omg I can freaking RELATE.\n\nI am a coder. I sit 9h a day at a desk in a very small office, where my job involved immense focus, lack of social interaction, constant planning, and abstract ideas/concepts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am totally lost career wise once I realised I chose the whole freaking wrong path in life. Still young so I can change, but I am kind of paralyzed by a lack of certainty on anything. Such a shitty feeling!
3	Ugggggh   I hear this.  I went through something similar. It took me until almost my 30's to find a job I was excited about and could stick with.\n\nI felt that all the "real" professional jobs had too much responsibility and were too high level and abstract for my Se brain to be equipped to handle. Waaay over my head.   Or the other end of the job spectrum where it was mundane clerical work which intellectually I could do but my soul would die.  So because of my lack of direction combined with love of people, I kind of defaulted into low paying-barely-above-minimum wage customer service jobs for YEARS.  \n\nI eventually found my way into the airline industry and I love it.  I am still customer service facing but it is faster paced and  incredibly challenging at times but in a hands-on figure out a solution in the moment kind of way which works for me.  It still isn't the most lucrative career but for me the value is in the life experiences it allows me to have.  Yes shift work is hard, but it also means your schedule is completely flexible and you are not locked into a 9-5.  You are feeling bored, need a break or adventure?  Trade your last few shifts this week and head to Mexico for a few days!  No problem.   Once I was there for a few years and was feeling a little stagnant professionally, I moved into a teaching role at the airport as well.  I've always loved teaching and somehow just ended up taking on the role of training  wherever I worked anyway, but being an actual teacher at a elementary or high school felt way too structured and demanding. So it works great for me on all levels right now.\n\nNot to say I will in this industry forever, but for now it checks all my boxes.  You just need to find your version of this!   Challenging in the right ways, hands-on, work with a big team of people by your side and FLEXIBLE!  Work need not be a prison\n\nGood luck on your job search :D
3	I am currently a sales rep, and it's my favorite job I've had in my life. Things change day to day, and I'm able to socialize and talk to people.
3	I don’t have a job yet, but I’d like a job that’s flexible and allows me to talk to people and sit my butt on discord too haha, and have a lot of nice co-workers that I eat chick-fil-a with every Friday and have fun outings with lol!
3	I loved my job as a Park Ranger.\n\nThe problem is, it's not a viable career as a parent and someone whose spouse cannot work.\n\nStill, if I could afford to live on the income, I'd do this job gladly.
2	Why not try bartending? 
2	Don't really have a job yet, but I'm finishing up school for commercial photography! I'm entirely focused on portraiture (big surprise) but haaate having to setup and organize so much stuff for shoots. I actually plan on working in portrait retouching for a bit simply because I need the money and it's much more stable and I also don't have to worry about much discrimination thru my gender transition. I find portrait retouching great because every photo is different, and I'm very involved with at least a face 😂 I want to work more with lifestyle photography and fashion though, I love the more candid nature and reality in it. Product photography makes me want to DIE I'm actually great at it but hate it so much. I want to be talking with someone and creating a photo based on their emotions and what they're acting out. My biggest problem is I just don't do good at organizing and setting things up
2	I hate my office job, not because of the people or the processes, but just because I'm stuck in the office in the first place. What I really wanted to be is a fireman. Or a stunt double. Or a film director. Or, if I knew then what I know now, I'd have invested more in sport as a kid, and would become a sport instructor. Say, gym and snowboard instructor.
2	I strongly disagree with nursing and customer service, function wise it's terrible for an ESFP(if it works for you then by all means continue). Sounds a lot more like careers suitable for SFJs\n\nThe best careers for us would be in business, sales, entertainment, personal instructor jobs, diplomacy, interpreting. Just picture your dream job and put in the work to get it. Easier said that done, but that's pretty much the only right way to do it. Also try not to put too much pressure on yourself about it, just choose what feels right and stick with it
1	I worked in what was basically a factory, packing food trolleys for airplanes. It was extremely repetitive, like how I would describe an office job, there were no customer interactions and we weren’t really allowed to talk too each other much. It drained me and I would frequently cry before work or have anxiety attacks in case my job called. It was an on-call job, so I had to be available to work immediately or the day after. It developed into serious anxiety, especially after an incident at work, so one day I just stopped picking up the phone. \n\nIt took me over a year to finally be somewhat ready to apply for jobs again, so now I am hoping for a cashier job at a grocery store near me, where I can interact with as many people as possible, feel helpful and productive, and most importantly just be happy. \n\nMy “long term” plan/goal is to get an education as a pharmacy technician so I can work at a pharmacy, which honestly sounds like a dream job for me!
1	I agree with those saying nurse and sales rep. Both are reputable jobs that work with strong personalities and confidence. Nursing school was something I tried and realized I didn’t want to clean up poop though so... anyways, I work in the ER as a Medication Reconciliation Tech. I go in, ask about what’s meds they take, type it all in, and I’m done. It’s similar to what a nurse does in the sense that I go into a patients room and talk to them about their medications, but it has none of the negative parts of cleaning up or breaking your back, which is nice. 
1	Sucking dick :3
1	Probably any job that involves talking.
18	...I just want to dance	Ya know when your day is amazing and then the most beautifully upbeat song comes on and you just want to DANCE. Just shake it to the tunes!\n\nWell, I can’t cause I’m on public transport and I don’t want to be booked for being a public nuisance. So... sharing my joy with y’all here. \n\nHave a great day everyone!
3	Pssh... dance away.  Spread the joy!! XD\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGlad you're having a good day, though!  (n\_n
2	This has been me for the last few weeks, dancing and singing everywhere I go. I just met the most awesome guy, I've been on cloud nine.
1	Yeesss! Now I'm dancing!\n\nYou have a crazy good day!
1	For a male teenager who doesn’t know the slightest thing about dancing but wants to love it... how? 😅
1	I boo out on the train all the time. I feel u
1	I love dancing. For someone who never did a class I feel like there's part of me that wishes it was a part of my life.\n\nI feel a bit too afraid at 24 to start 😂

2	Help with ESFP Best Friend	Hey, \n\nI am an INTJ and one of my closest friend is an EXFP ( I think she is an ESFP ) and we do get on pretty well. We do live far from each other ( around halfway across the world ) but I guess our bond is special or used to be. Since a few months she has been different, I noticed a pattern that there is one day everyweek when she will just ignore me ? Like I can spot that she is online elsewhere but will leave me on seen. Happened on Sunday but on Saturday she was like “Love you Chloek07” etc etc, I don’t get this inconsistent behaviour. I do understand she has other friends. She is modestly popular. I have told her if she can’t talk, then she can just let me know. But she never listens. Lately she has been dating a lot as well, it all started around the same time. She started going out more, I am a bit worried right now because there has been this change in her behaviour. She is out on dates every week, which is fine but it’s been a bit sudden. This and the inconsistent behaviour has me a bit worried. Also, she sometimes dodges my questions, I will ask her something and she won’t even reply to me. Just ignore my question. Idk I am a bit worried right now. \n\nEdit : She also has lied to me on a few occasions and I found out about it. A lot of white lies and keeping things from me. 
6	I have an friend who I share this type of relationship with, she is like a sister to me as well. In the past, it sometimes got super overwhelming for me to always have one person fighting for my attention, especially because I make friends easily and just talk to a lot of people in general. I always try to keep everyone I speak to happy, and when I constantly have to make sure that this one friend is always happy, I get tired and grumpy. Instead of yelling at her (because there isn’t anything to yell about) I tended to just ignore her for a bit. It was never maliciously meant, and I always got back to her later.\n\nESFP’s tends to not like being held down, and generally flows from groups to groups. Doesn’t mean you’re less important to her, just means she might enjoy different company once in a while.\n\nAlso try and think about the topics your conversations consists of. If it’s always about the same things, that can also be a reason she sometimes pulls away. 
5	I think you are over thinking. It's a world of constant connectivity and I personally find that I have to be in the right state of mind in order to respond to people. I leave them on "seen" because I can't stand the unread notification or because I absent mindedly open the app or because I have the time to read, but not respond. But mindlessly scrolling through social media doesn't take any effort (sadly) and therefore ends up being a place to go even when I don't have the energy to talk directly to friends. It's sad but it seems to be the norm now. \n\nI think you have two options: \n\n1) Talk to her directly about these issues. If you feel that both of your maturity levels can handle the adult conversation without hurting feelings afterwards\n\n2) Deal with it personally. Live a bit further from your cell phone and from her life, connect with other friends \n\n&#x200B;
2	Are you dating? Because if not she doesnt really owe you anything. I know you are worried and have good Intentions, but its also not usually a good idea to push people when they are showing you they dont want to talk about something. I think the best thing to do is find some dates yourself, let her know you are supportive and dont push back when she dodges questions. \n\nIf that's too much for you maybe just take some time away to sort yourself out. \n\nThe last thing you wanna do is push her away by being too assertive and getting involved further than she wants. You can't protect her or help her recover when she is down if you arent around.
2	EXFP here with high NN and super high SSS.  So what exactly are you "worried" about?  That she has a life? That she spends time doing other things? That she isn't a methodically predictable set of properties?  LOL.  I'm feeling a bit of clingy all over you and as an EXFP girl my general reaction to someone I kinda value but kinda rubs me wrong sometimes, is to just kind of tune out or ignore more often, the more they do the undesirable behaviour.  Clingy is undesirable, btw. Best advice:  just start initiating convos WAY less often.  What's the right amount?  Somewhere around when you achieve 50/50 with how often she initiates.

5	ESFJs?	I'm an ESFJ, and I'm wondering how do ESFPs get along with us? I just met an ESFP (pretty sure anyway) and while y'all are super fun, you stressssss me out with the way you are so spontaneous! Trying to plan a date with this guy is a whirlwind of confusion lol
3	ESFP's are most compatible with SFJ's, due to cognitive synchronicity (opposite functions match like puzzle pieces)
2	I find that ESFJs tend to want to do what is in our interest most, but if an ESFP is into you we want to do what makes you happy. If we really dont want to do it we will voice it, but generally everything will be good. Try to just have fun with it! Disclaimer: This is my opinion atleast.
2	I can get along with ESFJs just fine, but only on a superficial level, like most people say here. Like talking about clothes, food, movies and stuff like that. But when it goes deeper, it will create conflicts. I know this from my experience with my ESFJ mom.
1	I often get along with ESFJs. We share zero valued functions, but we have demo Fe and they have demo Se, so there are ways we can bond. I guess we don't have all that much in common in how we operate, but I like the ESFJs (the healthy ones) around me.
1	I like ESFJ's. I think the most accurate word I can use to describe my relationships with ESFJ's is... Pleasant?\nHaving said that, I don't have many super close ESFJ friends, it tends to run on a more superficial basis. Usually my MO to be tight with someone is through shared experiences. Go out, have an adventure, do ridiculous things that you definitely  regret but would never take back, and now have lifetime of stories together that bond you. Sometimes ESFJs can be a bit traditional or constrained in their behaviour /actions so it's hard to have the big adventures with them. Or they think you're off the wall for what you're doing and they laugh and enjoy but don't really partake.. So there's a bit of a divide. In addition we chat about a lot of stuff but it's generally more superficial (that's also me, I need the Nx's to bring that out in me out in me otherwise i have a tendency for small talk)\n
1	Thanks for the insightful responses guys!!
1	ESFP here, get along with ESFJ in most things.  Food, parties, movies, outdoor fun, going out clubbing, etc. Occasionally they get hung up on some decision or ethics like totally "stuck" on right/wrong instead of perceiving that it really comes down to the final result of how everyone feels from it all, is what makes it right or wrong.  But NOT if you feel bad for no reason you don't deserve to, like getting all upset or jealous or some other feeling that's on you and your bad.
3	Who are some examples of ESFP characters in video games	Hey everyone, like the title says, I’m curious to discover opinions of who are ESFP’s in video games from old to current generations. Joker from Mass Effect 1-3 is a spot on one
2	Carl Johnson from GTA San Andreas(also the SF-UR radio host)
2	Rakan from league of legends?
1	Prompto from FFXV? ESFP or ENFP I would say.\nThen maybe Yusuke from Persona 4?
1	Nathan Drake from Uncharted 
1	The white haired, blue-handed kid from Devil May Cry 4, or so I hear.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA swift check of Google tells me the guy is called Nero.
3	Created a subreddit for SPs	I think there about 20-30 of us SPs who regularly comment on mbti related subs, so I created a new sub for us.  \n\nPlease subscribe to  https://www.reddit.com/r/TheArtisans/ 
1	Niiiiiiice!
2	According to the internet I an ESFJ Are supposed to be #2 in compatibility with you ESFP.	I’ve never met an ESFP so I wanna hear if anyone has met an ESFJ and why or why don’t you like them. Why would we be at the top of the compatibility chart? Why do you think I would like you and why you like my type?
2	According to who? We're not very compatible, both function wise and according to socionics. It's not the worst combination, but it's among the ones you probably shouldn't be actively looking for
1	I haven't met one but sounds like a dream for some, since both types get along really well but the J is gonna keep the P in check hahah I'm more into opposites tho so I don't know if I could date someone as similar as myself
6	An ESFP who only seems to connect with iNtuitives?	I'm an ESFP and all my really good friends have been, and are, intuitives (ENFJx2, ENTJ, INFJ, ENFP,).\nI find while I have lots of sensor friends I enjoy, I don't actually connect as well as the N types.\nDoes any other ESFP find this? 
2	I think it might depend on your upbringing too. I'm an ENFP and I have an ISFP brother, and ISFP mother, and an ESTJ brother. That means I'm really really comfortable around Sensing types even though we still clash sometimes because we're just not the same. I really appreciate the balance that sensors bring to my world and my closest friends are sensors who share my values. My ISFP brother loves hanging out with sensors, but ultimately finds them not interested in talking about the bigger picture, abstract topics he and I love talking about and I can only imagine that the reason why is because I forced him to exercise his Ni for about 25 years. :)
1	There are N types and N types.\n\nESFP uses the following functions - Se Fi Te Ni. As you can see, the last one is an intuitive function. Therefore, they'll relate to Ni users, to some extent. ENFJ, ENTJ, INFJ all use Ni as well. ENFP on the other hand is on the other perceiving axis, and uses Ne and Si.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI find that for a long time, it was hard to find people in my life that use Se and Ni over Ne and Si, so it was frustrating. But I get along with other Se users as well as Ni users.\n\nAnd yes, I also have Ne friends as well.
1	DEEP OCEAN ISFP\n\nPRESS DESU TO GO MORE DEEP
1	Not really. Most of my friends are sensors tho. Any NF friends I had all flipped out on me.
6	Why is everyone on here to quiet?	I'm just curious as to why more ESFP's aren't really talking on here or interacting... \n\nI was excited to join a sub with my personality type and it seems there's not much going on with this forum. What's up guys?? \n
14	Generally, the issue with ESFPs, and Se-doms in general, that they're not the type to sit on the compute all day and chat. They're more the type that is out there in the world, and comments on a 'I have time now' basis. Which can sometimes be often, but sometimes almost never.\n\nESFPs like to exert themselves on the world, and are very much kinesthetic focused, doing shit.
4	We all have awesome ideas but procrastinate to much hahahahaha \n\nOr we are to busy absorbing everything on the internet \n\ntrying to be friends with allllll the other subreddits \nHaha\n\nI get us....
3	What kind of type are you guys attracted to?	Do you have a crush/in a relationship with/has been compatible with any specific mbti's?\n\nShare with the word!
6	I’ve been with two INTJ’s in the past. I don’t know why, but I seem to be naturally attracted to INTJ’s. I’ve had minor crushes on a few as well, even before finding out that their type was that. So it was never a “Hey, you are an INTJ, I like you now”-kind of situation.\n\nHowever, been with an ISTJ for 3 years now and he is great!
3	ISFPs. They just fascinate me and always seem so fun.
2	My fiancé is an INTP/J and I find him to be incredibly attractive in every way. 😄 always have. 
1	I've dated a lot of ISTPs (sexy assholes) and dangerously attracted to ENTPs... :| who knows if I'm compatible with them though cause I've never had a successful relationship with either
1	Unfortunately... ENFPs. Romantically 
1	INFP...still cant get over him after 6mths of breakup\n
12	How do you guys deal with awkward silences?	I find that if that person doesn’t talk back I tend to feel uncomfortable around that person. Do you guys deal with this or is it just me?
10	Depends, I guess. I don't find silences awkward unless someone makes them so. There is huge merit to companionable silence.\n\nI'll just check in once in a while to see if all okay, or if they want to join me in some activity, but if they're good, I don't tend to break it, unless I have something I *want* to say.
7	I try not to talk too much cuz I tend to ramble and have a bit of social anxiety, honestly I've been learning to embrace silence and try to enjoy just the presence of the other person. But yeah no I'd rather there be talking 😂
6	I do too. I realize I go to great lengths to avoid awkward moments. \n\nI feel second-hand awkwardness/embarrassment so strongly from people that it almost gives me a light sense of social anxiety.\n\nTo others, it looks like I have great social skills because there are no awkward moments, but in my head it is taking so much mental power haha.
3	Don't really care about it honestly, I just stay quiet and then start a new conversation or just move on with whatever I was doing \n\nWhat you're describing tho is someone ignoring you, which I definitely can't stand. It's not as much awkward as it's annoying. I just ignore them back the next time they start talking to me and in general stay away from these types of people
3	People not talking back kinda hurts my pride haha. But it’s alright, I also sometimes intentionally lead conversations to deadends when I dont feel like talking so I understand when other people do it. I used to be very self conscious with awkward silences, but I grew to not really care and now they’re just silences. Maybe that makes some people uncomfortable but that’s the price I pay to be comfortable myself.
2	just talk more, talk to someone else or pretend i need to pee. i dont deal with it well haha
2	They never happen, I always fill the silence! 😋
2	In business I have to use a TON of willpower not to fill silence. It’s as unnatural as holding my breath but damn it’s a good strategy.\nSocially, I keep the convo flowing. 
1	There's nothing wrong with peace and quiet.
1	Wait... People actually get hurt when I don't talk?
1	I have absolutely no problem with silence. Some people have told me I male them nervous when I allow the silence. Shrug

7	How many of y'all have mental health issues?	Hi there! I am an ESFP f/16 and I have been struggling mentally for all of my pre-teens and teens. I am bipolar and have anxiety, depression, abandonment issues etc.\n\nI wonder, out of curiosity, do any of you other fellow Entertainers struggle with anything? I mean we have a tendency to be more emotional and put much more effort into pleasing others rather than pleasing yourself, is it just me?
7	Yep!  Depression, ADD and slight anxiety at times since age 11. I’m 24 now and it’s uphill from here, but I still have my manic weeks. 
5	>we have a tendency to be more emotional and put much more effort into pleasing others rather than pleasing yourself\n\nActually quite the opposite.  We have Fi so we're concerned with our own feelings, and we have Fe critic meaning we are critical of other peoples feelings.\n\nI'm 18m ESFP and struggled with deeply depressive feelings, anxiety, and drinking every night.  I spent a lot of time digging as deep into my mind as possible, where all the skeletons lie.  It put me through a lot of pain, but now I'm much better on the other side.  Oh, and LSD helped.\n\nKeep on keeping on.  Meditate, exercise, eat well, and find the right therapist.  I think it also helps to read philosophy and psychology to build your life outlook.
3	Not really, although I did have some anxiety as a teenager and get the blues here and there. Food helps me a lot when I'm a bit depressed, gotta keep the blood sugar at a decent level. Weed helps too if you know how to use it(and a few other drugs), but I don't know if you should do it\n\n>we have a tendency to be more emotional and put much more effort into pleasing others rather than pleasing yourself\n\nI completely disagree
2	ADHD-PI (ADD) here. So yeah, I get stressed super easily, depression comes and goes and so does the anxiety. Got diagnosed four years ago at 26 years old.
3	me! \n\ni have bpd. it's pretty hard. people dont notice it until they get too close because i usually put on a show, but its so easy to melt down one second and then switch back to being entertaining and cheerful the next.\n\ni go to two therapists but most people cant tell and so no one asks. i too empathise with having the desperate need to please others, but through therapy im learning self-love and do things for myself.\n\nstay heads up girl! you'll be right. just remember its ok to not be happy sometimes, and its ok to let urself be happy.
2	I think most people cope with something or other, though not everyone knows the labels of what they struggle with.\n\nFor me, it's ADHD constantly. I tend to struggle with off and on clinical depression. If I don't do enough mental hygiene, I have anxiety and occasional panic attacks. Some of it can be moderated, the rest I just have to deal with. The upside is, it gets easier over time as you learn healthy coping mechanisms.
2	ADHD and some anxiety/CPTSD stuff stemming from a not so good first 18 years of life. I think ADHD plays a part with our F-P functions, as it relates to our emotional deregulation and impulses.
2	I’ve been seeing a psychologist for years and years now, buddy. So, yes, I have my issues 😎
2	Absolutely (m/20). Lots of ugly traits. I've come to terms with it, learning to get rid of them and control yourself is part of growing up, I'm sure. I think the most important part is to keep gaining experience and doing new things you never thought you would do, introduce ALL kind of novelty into your life to show you new ways of doing things and allow your brain to develop new pathways and challenge the old ones, the old ways of thinking, broaden your perspective, keep a conscious mental monologue so that you can develop. Since the beginning of 2018 to today I've changed so much it's amazing, and the thing that kickstarted that change was a completely new group of people with whom I would normally never hang out and "falling in love" so to speak. Then it all was just ups and downs and learning your lessons. Keep growing man, have enough love and respect for yourself to actively go out of your way to experience new things that will allow you to realise all the goods and the bads in you and to finally end up as the best person you can be. Not gonna lie, it's going to be an extremely tough road but happiness man, the feeling of happiness after you realise how much you've changed and how much you love who you are now is worth it all. Always put yourself first, your mental state, that's like #1 mistake, being unable to cope with being you and having to cling on to other's approval and shit etc. to feel good, be it parents, friends, partner, whoever. Caring first and foremost for your own happiness is the only thing that will make people you care about respect you enough to also care about you. You will still have your bad moments but with a proper foundation you are going to pull through anything and always come out on top in the end :))))
2	I was very isolated growing up and really socially deprived, which still gives me some social anxiety. That's hella amplified by gender dysphoria and being trans with low self esteem, and then that opens up a whole new can of depression worms hahah Honestly I think depression and anxiety is more common for us than some others
1	ESFPs in nursing, teaching, childcare etc?	How do you guys feel about this? To me it's a big fat hell no, can't imagine any worse careers for myself than that, but I'm wondering what you guys think\n\nhttps://www.capt.org/using-type/workplace.htm?bhcp=1\n\n"Examples of careers often chosen by ESFPs include teaching (particularly pre-school through grade 12) and coaching, childcare work, clerical and office work, recreational work, food service, nursing, sales, personal services, and religious work/education."\n\n"They are also found much less often in careers that tend to require a more impersonal and analytical approach to people, such as social science or law, or that have very little contact with people, such as research or highly quantitative work (e.g., research, accounting, auditing)."
5	I'm an x-ray tech and before that I had majored in education, specifically math.\n\nI love patient interactions. It's my best 'skill'. In my performance reviews I'm always commended for my patient care and chipper disposition. And I still think about finishing my bachelor's so that I can teach as a clinical instructor at some point. 
3	I'm going into school for child care 😅 It was between that and elementary school education.
2	I'm going to school to be a nurse anesthesiologist in the future
2	We are drawn to more social interactions while also helping people so naturally they cross our minds. Personally, childcare/nursing are not for me, but the social side of working in an office is the highlight of my day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy do those careers seem so bad to you? 
2	It's not what I would go for, but still levels and levels above office work, which is what I'm doing now. That's the death of the soul.\n\nTbh, I have been a lecturer in an education and culture center in the past, having two workshops that I did for schools. It was on a topic that was too difficult for most teachers to talk about competently, so they outsourced to us. Hence, I had a different class every time. I don't know that I'd be able to keep track of one class over time, but this worked for me quite well. I felt confident in what I'm doing, I knew how to engage the students, and how to pass the knowledge to others, and I was center stage, which worked well for me.\n\nIf I should choose a career though, regardless of what is feasible for me right now, I would be a musician, film director, actor, film producer, or work in the stables, riding and teaching horses, and cleaning up stable muck.
6	feeling lonely	how do i deal w feeling lonely?\n\ni feel like if i dont fill up my calender with plans everyday then ive wasted my week. ): what should i do
10	You should learn to embrace the alone time. It's extremely important for your well-being that you do that. If you fear it, do it! Do it, until it's no longer uncomfortable. Use it to read a book. Watch a film. Work out at home. Learn the guitar. Learn how to program. Learn how to do anything that you wished you did, but kept telling yourself you don't have time. Use the time to make journal entries. Introspect. Focus on what is important for you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPeople who fear loneliness too bad choose bad friends, bad partners, and don't have any power in the relationships, because everyone knows they won't walk away from toxicity if they fear loneliness. Empower yourself instead. Learn to see why you have value. To yourself, and to others.\n\nBeing alone is alright. It's got many upsides. But it takes overcoming the fear.
4	Do you feel like being social makes you well-liked? Do you base your self-esteem off of having stuff to do with other people? 
3	I think you've got some good tips from Horrorito, can't really add much to it. \n\nAs others mentioned, don't derive your self worth from the people you're surrounded by. As a high Fi user you have the potential to be emotionally self-sufficient.
1	Play fortnite
5	99% sure I'm an esfp	I just have one question. Is it normal for you to feel introverted in public places? Then extraverted to family and friends? In public it's not to the point where I straight up avoid people, I just prefer being loud and annoying to my friends only, you feel me?
11	Cognitive extroversion isn't social extroversion. You can be an ESFP, and still be quite private, and like your time alone. It's more that your primary focus is to the outside world, and affecting it, as opposed to primary focus on introspection. Outside world does not necessarily mean people. Or conversation.\n\nI am an ESFP, but don't like a lot of social situation, and mostly do the 'extroverted' stuff with people I consider 'my' people.
5	Yee I feel you. It’s called being an Ambivert. A balance between introvert and extrovert. I used to be pretty loud in public places when I was younger but now that I’m older I’m only loud with certain friends or family. \nEvery once in a while I get anti social and don’t want to talk to anyone and lock myself in my room but after like half a day I have to leave to go socialize because I get bored being alone hahaha idk man. 
2	You mean you're reserved in a situation where you don't know anyone? Most people would be "introverted" in that scenario, especially if everyone around you is with someone they know. But I don't really feel introverted in public, I can easily ask people for directions or make small talk(although as a teenager I was more anxious and shy). At the same time I don't actively look for social interactions with strangers and don't really like a lot of group activities that most people enjoy. \n\nBeing loud by yourself in public would be pretty weird lol but with friends I can be obnoxious in both public and private\n\nAnyway, what you're saying sounds pretty ESFP to me
1	I’m ESFP and I tend to do things alone because my friends won’t do all those crazy stuff with me. They are too busy working their asses off.
2	My awesome girlfriend. Lol	Hello everyone. I’m an estp or entp. I’m not sure. My girlfriend is an esfp. She’s a teacher. Definitely an entertainer. Super personable and charismatic. She’s looking to get out of teaching and into another career and I’ve suggested she check out reddit for guidance but she’s very skeptical. Any advice? Heads up I’ll probably be showing her any feedback. Make it real af please! 
1	Anything involving speaking in front of people or being sociable in general. It’s funny she’s a teacher because I’m doing education too. But here are some other things I would consider. I really liked working in sales because I get to talk to people and educate them about a product. Being an event planner works well because it requires tons of social skill behind it. Anything where connections with people is the primary task will be a good bet. Good luck!
1	Are you sure you've typed her correctly? If she's really an ESFP tell her to Fi and Ni the fuck out of that shit lol We all have different interests, so it's hard to give such advice to someone you know so little about. I'd suggest her to not take advice from reddit and to figure it out by herself, to think about the things she likes and things she's good at, preferably compile a list. From there it shouldn't be that difficult. Most importantly, tell her to not worry too much about it, she's gonna figure it out eventually and she can change her line of work later on if she feels like it
1	On a side note, I've seen a couple ESFP teachers on reddit, which is weird to me personally, because I couldn't imagine a worse career for myself. I can see ESFPs being instructors(fitness trainers for example), who work with clients individually, but not in a school with a bunch of smelly, disrespectful children, where you have to make them do things they don't want to on a tight schedule. I despised every aspect of school and didn't learn anything from there, except for social skills(which had nothing to do with the subjects I was taught). I don't like educating large groups of people either, when I find out know-hows to things I'm honestly keeping them to myself and will only reveal them to a select few if I really feel like it. \n\nI think that we're cut out for things like individual sports, entertainment, art, diplomacy, business/salesmanship

3	ESFP girl ghosted me	An ESFP girl lead me on a lot, and then just ghosted me. I do find this totally disrespectful and I cant possibly understand what kind of person would do this?( please don't feel attacked I know most ESFPs aren't like this at all) chances are she is still very immature.I tried not to push it,  waited about a week before trying contact again, didnt work. should I try to contact her in some time, and maybe bluntly state what I think, or just act like nothing has happened and be friendly? or most probably just let her go. \n\nI know I wont get closure, so maybe you guys can help me understand what could have happened and give me your opinions on what she did, and if you have ever done something similar, why you did it? \n\nlet me know if you want any more detail on the situation. love yall
6	Dunno what was going through her mind, but as a male I hate when people try to "play it cool" and would prefer for you to say directly how you feel. Honestly, it doesn't seem like she's interested in a real relationship, so if I were you I'd just probably ask her what's going on and if she doesn't reply then just try to move on\n\nPersonally, I never behave this way. If you're really someone I like and value as a person I wouldn't play you like that and if I don't really care about you then I won't give you any false hopes. I hate being ignored, especially in a situation where you're showing emotional vulnerability
2	But I’d also say it’d be good if you could give more details, maybe your story is different
2	Leading on is a very pregnant statement. What do you mean by that? What was it she said or did?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt can be a lot of things. It could be how you acted. Or it could not. It could be that she was interested, but not enough to go all in, and she got cold feet, which happens. And anxiety. The only reason I haven't ghosted some people is the level of maturity, and being able to put myself in the other person's shoes. Say, there was this really lovely guy last year, that we started something with, and even though he was amazing, I had a lot of baggage at the time (which he knew), and on top of that, I just didn't feel the spark, and for me, that's it. That's not something you can force or develops over time. What happened to me is I had severe anxiety when I thought about how I'd break it to him that I don't want to continue, because he was truly lovely, and nothing was wrong with him, and I didn't have a tangible reason to call it off, and I knew he was really into me, and also got his soul crushed by an ex. I really didn't want to add to that problem. And I didn't want to make him feel any less. So, initially, I just didn't make time to meet up, telling myself that I'll face this head-on, but always deciding that *not now*. However, I'm an adult, and I know that it's worse not to know what's happening, so eventually, I grew a pair, and formulated what's on my mind, and said clearly where I'm at. It was tough. It was really hard for me to say, and definitely hard for him to hear.\n\nOften, ghosting is just the result of anxiety of the person who wants an out, but doesn't have the courage to say so, and doesn't want to 'hurt' the other person. It always ends up hurting more if you're ghosted, but it's the result of a lack of decision, whereas facing it fair and square takes courage and accountability, and that's extremely hard.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIdk how old you are, but just think on it - have you ever been in a relationship, where you got in it, because you were really into that person, and then over time, months or years, you realize, that you just don't love them anymore, and don't want to be with them. But at the same time, don't think they're bad, or have done something wrong, it just fizzled out. Did you sit the partner down as soon as you realized, and told them in the face something along the lines of *it's not you, it's me?* Or did it take you a long long time, sometimes months or years, just telling yourself you'll do it, and then putting it off until some other time, just hoping the person screws up, so you can blame it on them, but they don't?

1	These things happen. People are selfish and assholes. The world isn’t fair, and you won’t be able to make sense of everything. Best to cut your losses, acknowledge what happened, and move on. 
0	Welcome to the club “ghosted by ESFPs” lol
0	Last try to get back with esfp girl	Hey guys, before I ask this, I acknowledge how wrong, stupid, idiot I am by wanting to do what I’m going to to tell you know, but still. Briefly: I can’t forget ESFP girl and move on, and although she once specifically said “I dont wanna be rude but I think you dont get that I dont want to date you” but my brains keeps bringing all the sorts of excuses why she said that. And although I have said slightly bad things to her like “you’re a party girl”, which means that I’m not supposed to continue liking her, but I still do. So anyway, so 2 times I tried to get back with her since we separated and every time I got hurt because of her disrespect (she once came to a party that I invited her and hanged out with another guy all night). So again no matter how stupid this whole thing is, if I wanna do smth the last time, what and how should I do this? I can’t text her because I deleted all her contacts so I don’t have any means of communication, but I have her sister on sc and that’s how I see her pics and miss her. Besides, I might see her at some bar because we live in a small town, there is a high chance for me to meet her. So how should I approach and talk to her if I see her at some bar? The problem is my last text to her was that she’s a party girl and I dont wanna be friends with a party girl lol *facepalm* I know there is no way for comeback 
8	To be honest... just don’t. She has expressed no interest and if you keep pursuing her it will just annoy her. I have a problem with an ex like this (INTP) and he is so annoying I’ve considered a restraining order due to his harassment.\n\nIf you still HAVE to try, just try to be her friend. Maybe if you run into her at a bar, you can ask how she’s doing, what she’s been up to, etc.. but if you pursue her more I guarantee she won’t respond the way you want her to. It’ll only push her away more. By being her friend there’s at least a chance for you to reconcile, get to know each other, and maybe she will develop feelings again. 
9	So, the best thing you can to earn her respect is do exactly as she says, and move on. ESFPs are pretty direct, and mean what they say. If she tells you she doesn't want to be with you, then the reason she says that is because she doesn't want to be with you. The absolute best way to earn a woman's respect is by respecting her personal agency ;)
6	ur creeping me out, leave her alone
6	Leave her alone. If she comes back around it’ll be in her terms. \n\nThe more people push when I tell them no, the more I feel my boundaries are being disrespected and the more distance I will create with them. 
3	Wow this is the first time I hear ESFP getting jealous. And I agree with what you said. I know all ESFPs here think I’m an idiot and creep af, but I understand that I’m wrong in some of the things I said, but it hurts me so bad that I can’t sit without doing anything about it. But at the same I’m planning to go to psychologist, I’m doing my best to get into her position, understand her and let her go.
5	What types have you liked dating the best?	What types have you had the best experience dating?ALSO,  what has your experience been with ENTP whether it was dating or friendship or just interaction.
5	Other ESFPs are not bad, I've had positive experiences with them(us? lol). I'm also into ENTJ girls, but haven't dated one yet. I think INTJs can be good romantic matches for us, as well as other introverts, ISTPs, INFPs, maybe ISFPs(I can see INTP working too)
2	Dating an ENFP. Surprising amount of differences considering just a one letter difference. I love that we're both extroverted though. 
2	I like other Gammas. Haven't dated an ISFP, but ESFP, ENTJ, and INTJ, I've done before. ENTJs tend to be my best friends, and are fun dates, but I find them too bossy and too cold for something where emotions should be involved. ESFP and INTJ were the best combos for me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nENTPs, damn... Usually I start off with being annoyed by everything they do, down to how they breathe. But we make good friends. We can't work together, or rely on each other's perception or activity, that's mutually frustrating, but we can have similar fun, and bounce off jokes off of each other nicely. Good for a back-and-forth. And despite so many ENTPs being major trolls, those I know actually have a really good heart and are really helpful when you need help. 
1	Well my boyfriend of 5 years is an INFJ and although we’re opposites in the way we approach the world we have the same values. This means we help balance each other out a lottt. He gets me to do boring tasks including taking care of money properly and I’m very grateful he does that, I get him out of his shell in social situations! 
3	desperately seeking advice	Desperatly typed this in on my phone, sorry for the bad formatting and any typos. Oh and I know this text contains cringe, I just don't know how to deal with this problem i have with myself.\n\nHi. I know it's a lot of text, but ive tried and tried and i've wanted to run away or give up for so long, but i refuse to do so. literally any help or just a kick in the ass helps and is appreciated. When I'm alone my head feels like its about to freaking burst sometimes and i get so depressed. im desperate to become the fun, outgoing and social person I once was, and my fear is just growing as nothing ever works.(ive had a shot at writing diaries, 1 month of therapy, Ritalin(ADHD medicine, going on vacations, doing old hobbies, exercising, nofap, lol this isn't even something id normally do, im just desperate to get well again)\n\nI miss my old view on life, not overthinking every little thing and becoming angry, being able to perform presentations in school, being able to sort my thoughts into words the way I used to. I know I sound really whiney but really I've been in this pit of working hard for two years now without getting a single step further! everything feels so wrong and i used to view the world as an art, or something beautiful, a gift. i used to have fun and not give a fuck, really. now i just worry, and seek help. and I'm wasting my life as an 18 year old. im useless nowadays and my close friends say I'm stupid as hell.\n\nthe only thing keeping me alive is my computer. i use it to escape and catch myself analysing people I admire so I can share the fun they have and be like them. i do this even though it is so unlike me, im just desperate and want to fake to be someone else while I'm this weak of a person. it makes me sad not to be able to go out and be the man i used to be and it makes me self conscious as heck.
3	Get your hormones checked before taking the step to get an antidepressant! You could have hypothyroidism (make sure to get a doc that really knows about this, preferably someone who lists bioidentical hormone replacement therapy as their specialty- most docs don’t really know much about the thyroid and only put you on t4 once you’re way too far gone) or hypogonadism (low testosterone- this is happening in younger and younger men). Get vitamin d, b12, and folate checked because all of those could play a role as well! 
3	Forsure see a specialist but try to remember the more you look for happiness the harder it might be to find. Take your days one step at a time. Focus on fixing one small goal and eventually expanding to bigger parts of your life. \n\nDon’t give up and good luck. 
3	Im in the same exact boat dude except im 23. I honestly thought i wrote this. I have all these same thoughts. No confidence in myself, always thinking and getting angry, etc. keep your head up because life is about ups and downs. Right now you’re in a down and it will get better.
2	Sounds like depression and or anxiety. Time to see your doctor or psychiatrist for new meds or to up your dose. Good SSRI should do the trick.
2	I also recommend seeing a psych/counsellor. I’ve been seeing one for 3 years now and she’s helped me relax my harsh views on myself and now i’m chill. Come chill with me. 
2	Find something you like and try to do it for a living. Simply try not to worry about anything. Live more in the moment and try to do the things you enjoy. Don't let anyone tell you you're stupid - no matter how intelligent you are or aren't it's not a thing a friend should be saying to you, try to avoid those kinds of people. Don't overthink things - usually they're a lot better than you think they are. Try to use your thoughts for something more productive like coming up with plans for your future and telling yourself that you're doing good
2	Sounds like a rough patch. Don't worry, it does get better, but will require effort on your behalf. I've been there. It really really sucks. Also have ADHD. I also suffer bouts of clinical depression, and occasional anxiety and panic attacks. At 18, you probably don't have enough of these cycles behind you to discover a trend, so I will share mine.\n\nSo, partly, I get depressed because it's in my nature, but winter makes it worse. Other than that, it's usually accompanied by lack of resources and time, so instead of going out there, discovering the world and experiencing it, I get stuck in my head too much, which makes me spiral. That also exacerbates the other issues.\n\nDefinitely see a specialist if you can. Talk about going on antidepressants for a couple months, to see if it helps. It doesn't mean you have to be on them for the rest of your life, but they do help you get out of the emotional whirlwind, take a step back, and look at your life with a more constructive and problem-solving mindset. Then, when your situation changes, and if your doc approves, you can get off them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOutside of therapy and medication, these are things that help me:\n\nGET OUT OF THE HOUSE! Work out. Do sports. I mean it. Get yourself sweaty at least 3-5x a week. It helps regulate hormones that affect your mood and cognition. When I don't work out, my ADHD becomes so unmanageable that I want to shoot myself in the head, and my depression and anxiety get so much worse. Go running, go to the gym, do HIIT at home, go swimming, or take up a team sport that you can do. Anything you can get your hands on. I mean it. This is the single most important thing in my life that helps me stay sane.\n\nDo you have an INTJ or ENTJ friend? Talk to them? They are good with problem-solving on a level you need. They won't get submerged into your emotional problems, and won't react with sympathy, but with solutions. Get someone who can give you tough love.\n\nFind something you can do, even with limited resources, that gives you a sense of purpose, or value, on a smaller scale. Not in a strategic time frame, but with almost immediate results. Do you have a creative streak? Sing. Play the guitar. Draw. Paint. Take up a drama class. Do standup. Whatever. Are you competitive instead? Do things that will get you immediate acknowledgment.
1	maybe im just sucking up to my feelings too much and should leave them alone? HRGJGjdjsss im a mess
1	Also, have you tried different ADHD medication, other than Ritalin? I have it, but haven't used it in almost 4 years, except for exceptions. And had to come back to it, because my ADHD has been acting up. One of the major side effects of Ritalin are anxiety and panic attacks. I've never tried Adderall, it's not FDA approved in my country, but has your doctor tried to switch you to something else?
7	What’s your fashion style?	How would you describe your style? Do you have one? Do you think about it at all? Share pics if you’d like!
10	My fave outfit has got to be my birthday suit. It’s just so comfortable!
6	Heavy metal fashion; jeans, boots, leather jacket and band shirt. Not really an all-seasons thing but I power through. The price of lookin' good. Haha 
5	I match clothes and make sure everything is clean. I like sports brands or designer things, but not the popular stuff. To really look good tho you have to be racked up, so I'm still getting there
4	Basically street punk without boots and with long hair (that's going to change) 
5	Always put together- I think about accessories like necklaces, earrings, watches, and rings a lot, especially the length of the necklace with my top. I like to follow fashion trends and make them as much my own as I can without just going for the next thing. I also just have a feeling when an outfit goes together right. I’m not really sure exactly what it is, I’ve just always had a sense of what works and what doesn’t and I feel uncomfortable leaving the house in a meh outfit. At my job I wear business casual with a lab coat and people always complement me for standing out in a good way with my clothing choices. I really fall into the ESFP fashion loving stereotype 
4	I would usually make my own style based off the trendy clothes. Like I would wear Fila Disruptors with Adidas 3-stripe pants or a pair of ripped jeans, add a denim jacket or a hypebeast style Parkas if it’s cold out. These are my favourite outfits. Oh, and also DUNGAREES omgg they are so awesome! I own a white pair and I wear it a lot! In summer, I would pretty much wear muscle tanks and beach shorts, with either sneakers or my favourite strap sandals from Nomadic State of Mind. \nI’m a guy btw.
4	Shirt and pants, I don’t care about aesthetics or looking flashy. Comfort ftw!
3	I’m late to the party but like this post so I wanted to share! I’m pretty flashy. I love designer shoes, glitter, short skirts, leather, sequins, you name it. I think part of it is because that’s what my friends wear, and it’s grown on me. Many days though, I just wear leggings and graphic tee shirts. 
2	I wear popular designer brands. I also try to match my shoes with my outfit. 
2	I don't have a unified style. Hence often people tell me I'm a chameleon. I dress how I feel like any given day. Mostly for comfort. Those that I'm known to wear often:\n\nSporty\n\nGrunge\n\nPin-up\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also enjoy shock value. Attaching what I had at Christmas.\n\n&#x200B;
2	@cassysamie check my Instagram, there is my style :p\n\nI would say I'm pretty esfp specific

3	Is this an add?
20	Being Shallow (rant)	The stereotype that we are all shallow people with zero inhibitions and care for others, makes me so mad. In person we're  likeable but on the internet (especially myerbriggs forums) we get torn apart and called all types of names. Players, party animals, flakey, all types of things that act as though we're a two dimensional character in some shitty book who lacks inner dialogue and actual feelings.\n\nOf course I don't mean everyone, but do you feel like people think we're "shallow" because we dont wallow constantly on what is worrying and plaguing us? What constitutes someone as deep? Do you have to be someone who constantly talks about how you think life is meaningless, or what happens after death?? Do we have to make every conversation forcefully heavy and uncomfortable?? Maybe instead of spilling all our private and deepest thoughts to everyone, we like to keep it to ourselves!!! and only reveal it to the people we trust the most!!!!!! instead of laying all this shit on everyone else!!\n\nMaybe the reason why we seem so fucking stupid and flighty is because we're torn between not wanting anyone to truly know us, to wanting to be understood and loved!!! maybe we're afraid of being truly known. maybe we're afraid of being hurt. why does everyone reduce us to something so surface level and shallow? \n\nI don't know, this is a stupid rant but it just hurts to think some people think we dont have any actual feelings, thoughts or depth. Because we definitely do. I know it. Sure we enjoy life's physical pleasures but it doesn't mean our heads are filled with sand! just because we dont spew all the things we feel out to everyone, doesn't mean we dont feel.\n\nI'm tired of this stereotype. Like everyone, I want to be loved and understood. Not everyone can give you that though, so of course I'm not going to open up to everyone. I'm going to stay surface level with people who I believe don't connect with me on that level. \n\nsDHFJKDSHF anyways thanks. Rant over. 
5	A lot of people think like that, but honestly who cares? I know myself, so there's no need for the validation of others. If someone thinks I'm stupid then let them think that way. I like to act dumb on purpose to mess with people. \n\nIn reality, a truly smart and "deep" person is not going to look down on someone for not being sophisticated, because any intelligent person(who is older than 15) realizes that it's not wise to go through life trying to complicate everything. The happiest people enjoy simple things and are true to  themselves, while people who always put on an intellectual facade are barely enjoying themselves at all, so who's the dumb one at the end of the day?
4	I'm completely with you. I hate the idea of certain people or types being "deeper" than others. As if it were measurable, and as if it meant they would be overall better or smarter people. \n\n\nI think function orientation describes "attention" more so than it does "skill." So everyone has an intuitive function they can call upon to be "deep," or use to analyze and abstract their world. But they also all have a sensing function to use when dealing with the here and now, and getting things done.\n\n\n\nSome people might pay more attention to their intuitive function, myself included, but they doesn't inherently make them smarter and it has drawbacks in other places, such as less attention for your sensing function. I just think about Si things less than I think about Ne things. I need less of them, they are of less value to me. I believe the same goes for ESFPs and their Ni. \n\n\nEmbrace yourself, man. You have your own strengths and are a fully capable person in your own way. \n\n\n
3	Aww, I don’t think you guys are shallow. I think you guys can be extremely sensitive and kind, clever and honest. I think you guys might be a bit flighty, but there’s nothing wrong with that. The people who think you’re shallow are usually pretentious and close minded and who cares what they think anyway. They often think themselves into circles. \n\n— ENFP
2	Tbh, I think the "party girl/fratbro" was a stereotype that existed before MBTI got involved, but people were basically looking which type to slap that stereotype on, and it fell on you...\n\n> Of course I don't mean everyone, but do you feel like people think we're "shallow" because we dont wallow constantly on what is worrying and plaguing us?\n\nCome now, that's just you stereotyping the other side. The "N" stuff is more about the abstract, etc, than worrying per se.\n\n> What constitutes someone as deep?\n\nPersonally, I would say the time spent thinking about something, refining it to something simple, like Einstein coming up with that E=Mc² that summarize everything. A very novel point of view, one that just clicks, one that fits all the piece of the puzzle, that's depth. \n\nI'm not very receptive to Fi, but hey, seeing from what I saw of ESTPs, you Se-doms have a very simple, yet, very pure/raw way to look at things that is enjoyable too, you just don't express it ? If you say what matters is how true/verifiable a fact is, then you guys should lead\n\nI guess "depth" will always be associated with N, though. But well, when you have as much data as you guys do, isn't building a worldview rather easy ? You've got to concentrate/crystalize it in one point. \n\nTbh, taking the opposite of Se-dom, Ni-dom (INxJ), you get types that way over their heads, but appear confident. That's a mask. Calling them on their BS isn't that hard once you know the odds. \n\nAnyway, in a sense, I kinda consider you guys "deeper" than INxJ because at least, your stuff isn't wanky spiritual BS half the time.\n\n> Do you have to be someone who constantly talks about how you think life is meaningless, or what happens after death??\n\nFunnily, nihilism, at least Nietzsche's version of it, comes to that conclusion that life is meaningless, **and thus, that you should enjoy it.** He's typed as INTJ, and if you look at his idea of the "Ubermensch" or the idea of "will to power", well, it's pretty SeFi actually.\n\nWhat he recommands is to be like you guys. (Maybe because his weakness as an INTJ would be FiSe.)\n\nThe true lesson with this typology stuff is that we all have something other lack and want. \n\n> Maybe the reason why we seem so fucking stupid and flighty is because we're torn between not wanting anyone to truly know us, to wanting to be understood and loved!!! maybe we're afraid of being truly known. maybe we're afraid of being hurt.\n\nThat one goes for everyone I think\n\n> why does everyone reduce us to something so surface level and shallow?\n\nIf you talk about online, it's obviously N types who were bullied by/envious of Se types during highschool, lol. \n\nAs for IRL, are you seen as shallow too ?\n\n\n
1	Yeah, being shallow has nothing to do with your type. Being "deep" to me means that you are thoughtful and you put effort into knowing yourself. All types can be shallow by that definition. I am in touch with the way I experience things, and with my feelings, and there is a lot of depth to be found there. I'm not talking about myself necessarily, but Se and Fi as functions are just as deep as Ni or Ne or whatever else is considered "deep". There is a lot of meaning to be found in Se and Fi, just as much as in "deep" functions, and if you're willing to dive in and explore that meaning, to me you are not a shallow person.
1	200% this. I went to search esfp on all other forums and I wanted to cry :(
1	That's funny cuz I think other types are shallow. They're the ones being superficial by judging you, and they're the ones who are basically frivolus chatter boxes, gossiping about nothing, etc. Then they think you have no depth. Pretty stupid of them.
1	Iv felt that way about the stereotypes behind ENTP. how they are very non committed / sluttish/ always wanting to move on to the newer more exciting thing , "being bored easily with people" and just quickly moving on.. 
1	This speaks to me so much right now! I’m currently experiencing this in life in my surroundings. Lately I’ve been feeling like my friends don’t take me seriously and girls think I’m shallow. \n\nI’m just bubbly, with crazy ideas, and I just want to have a good time ..but I’m turning crazy to think that I have to show I’m not shallow. \n\n
3	When do you wake up?	If nothing is stopping me I'll defo sleep until at least lunch hours(I remember waking up at 5-6 PM for a while lol). I've always made sure my current job won't involve waking up too early, because anything earlier than 8-9 AM is crazy for me. I can't physically go to bed until past midnight, regardless of when I have to wake up. But if I have to wake up early for something exciting I don't mind waking up at like 4 in the morning\n\nHow is your sleeping schedule?
3	I always want to sleep. If I’m stressed, I sleep. Sometimes I’d rather sleep than eat if I’m tired and hungry. Sleep is my best friend lol. 
2	I’m the same way, I can’t sleep earlier than midnight. Right now I’m lucky I work nights so I can sleep in as long as I want. Usually I get out of bed around 11 or 12 though. 
1	I love sleeeeeep!!!!
1	I usually go to sleep around 1am or 2am and wake up around 750am. My dream is to never sleep at all and truly take advantage of the day. I hate wasting my day on sleep. 
1	I eather wake up at 3am or 3 pm. If I get under 8 hours of sleep I'm fine. Over 8 hours of sleep and I'm amazing, but if I get a "reasonable amount of sleep" I feel like crap.
7	As an ESFP what did you feel your parents did or didn't do that helped or hindered you growing up?	I'm an INTP and my son is a 13 year old ESFP. Looking back at childhood it's easy to see what my parents did or didn't do that really hurt or helped me, and I'd love to be able to change anything I'm doing that is really hurting him before he's already grown and it's affected our relationship negatively. Are there things your parents did that stick out in your memory as really affirming, helpful, or made you feel loved, cared for, and seen? Are there things your parents did that made you feel invisible, unwanted, misunderstood, cheated, or confused?\n\nThank you for reading and thank you doubly for any insights you can give!
8	Thank you so much for this post and caring about your son enough to write it.  This in itself makes me think that my advice is probably unwarranted.\n\nESFPs are still defining who we are when we hit out teenage years.  We’re not good at introspection or deep thinking.  Our Te and Ni feel practically nonexistent at this point.  We live very much at the whim of our Se and Fi at the moment.  Which means that we are easy to understand and easy to please.\n\nWe want to indulge our Se.  It can be anything from walking in nature, playing sports, or eating good food.  Ideally, we would like to indulge it with friends.  Make sure you give him a chance to get out, do new things, and meet new people... but don’t force it (as an INTP, I doubt you ever could).  Let him have his freedom to decide what he wants to do.\n\nYou may he surprised at how strong his Fe is, considering it’s an unvalued function.  It’s because we ESFPs need a lot of affirmation and validation, so we pick up and value social cues quite easily.  We’re not as rebellious as our ESTP counterparts... we follow the rules as long as they align with our Fi.  If we see something as unjust or unfair, we will join the rebellion, but if we think things are a little out of hand, we’ll step back and abstain from participating.\n\nWith Fi-aux, we like to go our own way.  We also like to have things our own way.  We can be demanding, controlling, and selfish.  But we are also about the good time and don’t really get off on hurting other people.  We’d prefer to validate rather than tear-down.  But we’re not pushovers.  If you have a complaint about us, state it rationally while validating is in the process.  We may blow up, but we hear your words.  Give us a chance storm away to calm down and we will return to the conversation later after we have thought about what you said.  We’re highly volatile so we explode easily but then we can let something go just as easily.\n\nIf we’ve done something wrong, remember that we are conflict adverse.  If we feel that we’re being attacked, it will trigger our fight or flight response.  We will do/say things that we regret just to get away.  If you see this happening, let us “escape,” cool down, and then come and have a rational conversation with us.  Show us that you understand what we might be feeling.  Validate us.  And then tell us the reasons why you confronted us in the first place.\n\nHope this helps, though this advice is based on my experience as a female ESFP.  Male ESFP mileage may vary. (n_n\n\nGood luck and know that he’s pretty lucky to have an awesome mom like you! 
2	That's a valiant effort, and I'm sure your kid will appreciate it. It's impossible to prevent all trauma, it's just about what trauma, and how much of it, parents inflict. It's part of growing up. However, looking at ESFP needs, and hearing your kid specifically will go a long way to create a nurturing environment.\n\nMy parents are a ENFP mom and INFP dad. They're both rather relaxed, and we had a lot of freedom, which I much appreciate. They gave us a lot of freedom, and instead of giving us strict rules, they gave us ethical guidelines, and accountability. We had a lot of power making our own choices, but were taught to understand the direct consequences, and causality, and to make informed decisions. So, we could decide. And we were accountable. Both our parents wanted us to be capable of critical thought.\n\nFor me, it's mostly things they couldn't affect much. We were in a financially unstable environment, sometimes almost rich, and other times barely affording food, and they were behind on rent. They couldn't afford to give us any pocket money, and I had to start contributing at 15, otherwise we wouldn't make it, financially. That was a lot of stress. Especially as they treated me as adult since I was 12, and I was in on any struggles they had. Financial, emotional, other. I think it contributed a lot to my depression and anxiety.\n\nThe other thing was typology related, so little they could do. Almost all my family are Ne-Si users, while I'm Se-Ni - hence, Si-ignoring. I am focused on immediate opportunities, rather than all possibilities. I always found it a waste of time and frustrating exploring all options. I wanted someone to focus with me on the now, and on a singular road to take, based on my specific needs. I live in the here and now, and am very kinesthetic focused. I would have needed encouragement to take up sports and be competitive, more so than being lead towards an intellectual direction. I'm intelligent, at least according to all measures, but I don't like to stay in the mind and explore options and subjective logic. I want to assert myself on the world and make my way in it, and find success and attention, and admiration. If your kid has a competitive spirit, and likes attention, encourage one, and indulge the other. That's something that broke my heart most.
1	The fact that you think and care about this is already a good start\n\nTo me one of the things that really made me like my mom a lot less growing up was how little respect she showed me(she's definitely a high Fe and Si user). I think that after a certain age you have to treat your kids as equals, instead she would keep trying to boss me around and disregard my opinions up until I was old enough to stand up to adults intellectually(and to understand that most adults are just as confused about life as kids and teenagers). Also another thing(which I'm pretty sure comes from their Fe and my lack thereof) is how they expected me to instinctively figure out some things(like social etiquette or chores), instead of calmly explaining to me why I should or shouldn't do something they'd just expect me to comply and get mad when I stopped to question it, which only made me confused and angry myself. Personally for me the best thing was to figure things out on my own. Even if someone was being patient and respectful while explaining something fairly obvious to me I'd still have to process it by myself to accept it as a truth(which is Fi and Te I'm guessing)\n\nI've always had a good relationship with my parents, but we were always on different pages about most things in life. I think as a parent the best thing you can do is be there to support your child if he needs you, but let him make his own mistakes and learn from them
1	Growing up I've never felt comfortable letting my parents in. I don't share my personal feelings with them. When I was young I felt they invalidated my feelings and it pushed me away even further. Now that I'm older they're trying to reach out but its difficult for me to trust them nonetheless. Be careful when your child is opening up to you. Most times I "test the waters" by alluding to something serious or open up a tiny bit. The reactions to these instances are crucial in deciding if someone is trustworthy or not. So my advice would be to be careful how you react to certain things. Try to keep calm and be careful about what you say. \n\nAt least that's what I think haha I don't study too too deep in mbti. But this is my experience as an ESFP
1	Retook test after a while ENFP to ESFP. Which personality types do you get along with best	Recent lifestyle changes and I agree with the results.  Used to believe I was ENFP for the past 2-3 years but had some friends ask out of the blue about my personality type.  Retook it and ESFP results was surprisingly accurate. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways as title says which types do you get along with best?  Do you guys tend to have a lot of friends?  What do they say about you?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
2	I mostly get along the best with NTJs, ISFPs, ENFPs and ESTPs\n\nIt's very easy for me to blend into a new social setting and I know a bunch of people, but I can't call many of them my true friends. People say that I'm easy to talk to, intelligent(lol it's pretentious to call yourself smart, but that's what I've been told), fun, but also headstrong and pretty secretive
2	I too struggled with identity of my pt but have come to the conclusion after trying ghat I'm esfp :) welcome!! 
1	Best matches for ESFPs are types that appreciate their Se & Fi and who can supply them with Te and Ni. These are NTJs. Other good matches are NFJs (value Se & supply Ni) and STJs (value Fi & supply Te) - [mbti types in relationships with esfps](https://www.personalitycafe.com/esfp-articles/290-love-types-esfp-3.html#post3910962).

1	yeet
21	INFP Opinion of ESFP	 I'm not sure why I have the urge to share this, but I just feel impulsive...forgive me ;) \n\n I only know one ESFP for sure, and only because I forced him to take the Myers Briggs on a long road trip. That person is my dad! :)\n\n If I'm judging ESFPs based off of my dad's personality, I'd like to say that you guys really are awesome people!\n\n My dad is funny, spontaneous, brave, charismatic, loyal, forgetful, kindhearted, and always does what he feels is right. He can have a great conversation with anyone about anything (which I admire greatly, since I'm shit at small-talk.)\n\n My mom is ISTP. They've been together for 21 years and they still love each other. Definitely some communication problems! But they laugh when they both come home with a gallon of milk without knowing the other was buying milk (they've done this hundreds of times over the years and not just with milk.)\n\n My dad loves to go on drives to places he's never been, loves to play pranks, loves the new and exciting, loves a good joke, and loves his family. I love that about my dad. He's really a big sweetheart with a million stories. If someone doesn't like my dad, then I seriously question their judgment....but I might be biased (I'm totally not.) \n\n\n\nTldr: From the daughter of an ESFP, thanks for being you! I'm glad you're out there in the world making life memorable for the ones you're close to. Continue being great and know you're appreciated!
5	Awww... thanks for this!  I usually see comments about how annoying we ESFPs are, so it’s lovely to read something affirming.  Your dad is lucky to have someone who understands and appreciates him for who he is.  (n_n
4	Well thank ya. I am an ESFP and my fiance whom I've been with for just over 5 years now is an INFP. It's definitely an interesting and amazing relationship.
3	With us, it's reversed. I'm the ESFP, and my dad is INFP. He's pretty cool, and creative. Has a talent for explaining things and getting people engaged.
2	I'm an INFP, and I sort of enjoy studying a good friend of mine who is an ESFP. I'm amazed at his ability to instantly relate with anyone. I'm really very envious and I try to pick up some of his behavioral habits.\n\n\nIf all ESFP's are as much fun as this guy, I would love to get to know more of them. I want to know the secret! How do you all do it? \n\nAlso, very refreshing to have someone around to take all of thel pressure off of me when I'm drained or struggling socially.
2	This is a sweet post! 
2	[deleted]
1	LOL screw u u ESFP guys are a bunch of wankers I’m INTJ INTJ gang rise up
1	What birthday gift should i buy for my ESFP friend?	She is a teenage Girl BTW.
6	Take her somewhere. That's what I would like, maybe invite her to a movie, unique city event, concert, get some food etc something she would enjoy or find exciting and pay for her. I don't really like items but I love having a good time if your friend is anything like me she will enjoy receiving an expierence as opposed to a physical gift.
2	I really like earrings that are pretty extra and unique. I'm a guy though :D
1	makeup. i would like weed but im a guy and a stoner
1	We need more information. What are some of her hobbies and interest?
1	Ask him/her. \n\nBut usually gift cards are a perfect gift. Its practical and they can buy whatever they want. 
3	What do you appreciate about relationships? What do you like?	I’m an INFP, and the person I’m seeing is an ESFP. \n\nWe’ve only went out about twice, but I want to make sure that I’m doing things right. I kinda feel like I’m boring her, really. \n\nThe last time we went out we just walked about a mall for 2 hours, is that good? \n\nIs there anything in particular that you guys enjoy doing? I feel like she’s actually kinda hard to talk to and open up.\n\nHelp me out\n\nThank you! 
5	Try a different style activity. Like you said, she sounds bored. Try to give her options that stimulate her more than your trip to the mall. You could ask about her interests and if she has any suggestions of things she may enjoy. Try go-karting, play a sport together, community event like a parade or festival, or go to a bar she’s never been to. Put the attention on her! Good luck :)
2	I know that if I like a guy and I'm interested enough to get into a relationship, I enjoy spending alone time together so that I can get to know him. Not all ESFPs want to be constantly going out, so keep that in mind. Personally, walking around a mall sounds reeeeeally boring especially if you aren't having open and invested conversation. I hate to sound pessimistic, because I'm not trying to be, but if you two don't really click then where was the draw to be in a relationship?
2	Ok (I'm a guy ESFP) but we appreciate spontaneity,a variety of different things because we do get bored easy which is why we seem fun, we just need to constantly entertain ourselves. However ESFPs are chatty but might be hard to open up, if she isn't talking much are you sure she is an ESFP?\n\nBut ESFPs are too spontaneous almost, so what is good for them is order
4	I think my husband is an ESFP	So, I don't know for sure, but he kind of fits the bill for it and I'm trying to gauge the best way to deal with our impending divorce.   \n\n\nI'm an ENTJ woman; I've always been the bread winner, always been the one with high expectations, driven, pushing him to be better, helping him with college, the military (I got him enlisted because it helped me), etc. I'm pretty sure the pushing finally got to a point where he couldn't take it anymore and we both just started losing respect for one another and couldn't communicate anymore due to him always taking everything I said as criticism and it was to the point that I used the same tactic I usually do with discuss of divorce and told him to leave and he finally did. He had enough. He's done.   \n\n\nI didn't realize he was really done though, so within a few days I'm trying to talk to him like we're just fighting per the usual, got us in counseling, we had some fights, and then 17 days after leaving, he was sleeping with someone else. Loyalty is a big deal for ENTJ's so this caused me to flip and go on the extreme aggressive side of things which included some vengeance, upping the ante, and of course none of that helped. But why - you ask - would I even want to bother with someone who is dead set on being done? Because we have kids. And part of what made me flip so hard besides the loyalty is that he wasn't really invested in seeing them during that time because he's too caught up in living in the moment.   \n\n\nWell, that girl lasted from Oct 17th to roughly Nov 11 and the last I heard they saw each other was Nov 26. By Nov 28th, he met a new girl and he's only known her for all of 10 days but things seem to be going well there and he's been staying over there frequently. During this time, he has only seen the kids 6 times (Mainly in Oct) and that's on both of us (I got petty on some stuff and he decided to concede everything to letting a court handle the situation).   \n\n\nI don't know if this is normal behavior for a ESFP type person but I do know he has a habit of basically hopping into a new relationship very fast to get over an old one and has a unique ability to just drop people when he wants. So I'm curious if this behavior fits the mold or if it's a different personality type. He's got great charm, charisma, likes to be the center of attention and is constantly changing his appearance to fit whatever job he's in (currently he's becoming more of a country guy and his new dig is quite country herself).   \n\n\nAnd if he is ESFP - what is the best way for someone with a more aggressive personality type to find common ground? We both currently have an issue with trust, but I need to re-establish at least some basic level of trust in order to work towards co-parenting with him.   \n\n\nWe have a custody hearing on Thursday and until tonight, he and I hadn't spoken or seen each other in a month, but I'm the pushy type so I sought him out. With all the deep diving I've been doing into my own personality type, we were able to have a much needed civil discussion of my expectations that his "living in the moment" doesn't affect our children and that he doesn't let the flings ever take priority over them. He seemed to agree, assured me he could "drop them" if it ever became an issue, but was reserved to admit his habits of going out and partying all the time because he likely feels like it's something I'd jump on and criticize. Which I likely would because he also complains of not having money when he just bought a 2018 car and is funding the attorney since he's the one who filed for divorce.   \n\n\nEither way - I just want to find the best way to move forward and understand him better so that I'm not causing the same waves I did with our previous relationship.   \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n&#x200B;
5	I do not have kids and am not married but I have been dating an ESFP for 8 years. \n\nI’m sorry you guys are going through a rough time. \n\nAs far as personalities go, my ESFP finds self-worth and satisfaction through praise and affection. You mentioned that many times you have pushed him into positions or self improvement but feel that your criticism is hindering your relationship. Perhaps try pointing out the good things he does do, no matter how little they may be. It may be hard for you see the good in him right now but when you look for them and point them out maybe it will get easier over time. My ESFP also positively reacts to truces during fights through a hug or a kiss. Physical affection brings out the best in him. \n\nPersonalities aside, I think trying to push people into self-improvement before they are ready or into a position they do not want for themselves can be harmful for both parties in the relationship. It might give you a false identity of your loved one and lead to your SO not only feeling unfulfilled with themselves but it might cause resentment. \n\nAlso, good step getting into counseling. \n\nI don’t know the relationship you guys have and I don’t understand the difficulties navigating a relationship with children but I hope this helps either way. \n\nGood luck. 
4	You look like someone who appreciates bluntness, so I will be that. ESFP and ENTJ share all cognitive functions, so can often get along great, although, if they spend too much time together, they both get frustrated, so they need their regular downtime.\n\nHonestly, from what you said, I wouldn't comment on loyalty, because you were split before he began anything. He's not necessarily behaving like an ESFP, he's behaving like someone who just got out of prison. You cannot overwhelm people. You have to respect their personal agency. And understand, that ambition isn't the be all end all, and if a person isn't ambitious, as long as they do their part, you cannot forcefeed it to them. It doesn't seem like he had much of a say in anything, because you steamrolled over him. And coming back with petty vendetta, and chasing him down like a harpy does no one any good. It certainly doesn't help him. But let me ask, how does it help you? Calm down. Take an analytical approach. Don't take things so personal. Doesn't sound like the marriage is salvageable, but if you treat him with enough respect, he doesn't sound like he's too bent on any vendetta whatsoever. Talk like adults. Don't make it personal. Take care of yourself.
1	I would like to suggest that going for cognitive behavioural therapy or dialectical behavioural therapy may be your best bet. It will help you, him and your kids.
8	ESFP's, what are your opinions and experiences with INTJ's	Just curious as to what your experiences are. What do you think about the INTJs that you've met?
7	I love INTJs! I married one! Ok, he's a little boring and never plans any surprises for me but I make my own fun with our kiddo (Getting a second one soon!) He needs 4h of "downtime" everyday to "reset", which I think is ridiculous, but he tries hard as a dad, eats my cooking sometimes, and gives me hugs most times I ask.\n\nI will (and have!) left him because post-partum he got stressed and didn't give me enough love or time for 1.5 years and prioritized his job. He's stubborn and didn't listen to me. So I left. \nI would do it again. We lived apart for 6 mo and shared time with kid before I moved back into his place again and things have been great since. We're better as a team.\n\nI like him cause he's smart, good looking, funny, good with tech, and can beat me in video games. He probably likes me cause I'm more fun and pretty. I appreciate that I can be artsy, creative, spontaneous and he'll go with most of my shot calls on fun stuff :) He's introverted so I don't have to do his boring computer stuff. It's a win-win from my perspective.\n\nA lot of what I've said I say the word "most" maybe even "some" of the time. It's because he never lets me make decisions for him. Is that an INTJ thing? It's actually good that way, I know my decisions are spontaneous so he's like my sanity check. Unchecked, and dude, I make some stupid decisions. I need that guy in my life. Don't tell him I told you tho.
5	Well, like a true ESFP I’m a social butterfly so I generally get along with everybody. However, INTJs can be pretty emotionless and arrogant which are quick ways to put you on my nope list. I’m patient enough to withstand being around INTJs but dear god I can’t imagine dating one. I’m sure it goes both ways too though, they probably can’t stand us!  
7	I love INTJs! They are among my favourite types. I look up to them because they can help me aspire my Ni and they are generally very willing to do so. For some reason, I don’t experience the same thing from INFJs. I think Ni Te just works better for me than Ni Fe. \n\nCould be biased though, since I am close to many INTJs. 
3	One of my best friends is an INTJ and I always wonder why he likes me. He hates so many things, many of which I feel like I embody, but for some unspoken reason I made the cut. We can talk for hours about anything and everything and it’s so organic.
2	This is my mum. We do not quite get along but share some humour. There’s a lot of potential for conflict but with adequate self awareness less so. It can be good. 
2	They are pretty dank
2	ESFP and confidence?	I constantly hear about ESTPs and ENTPs confidence. However, I'm wondering if this confidence applies for ESFPs as well
7	I would describe it as “above average”
4	I think all these types are confident in different ways. But this absolutely applies to ESFPs, probably more than to the other 2, because we are confident in ourselves regardless of anything, while ESTPs have to be in a good social space to be confident and ENTPs care a bit less what other people think of them(among these types).
5	Big dick energy up in here man
3	I wouldn’t say I’m confident. Id say I’m more gutsy.
1	Does confidence have to do with MBTI or upbringing/life experience? Can't any MBTI type be confident? 
1	Not related
4	Underrated and obscure ESFP from GTA San Andreas	Hans Oberlander from the SF-UR radio station. I've recently replayed San Andreas and I think that he must be an ESFP. Hilarious character, I think the idea was that most of the time he's doing ecstasy and going through euphoria where he's acting like a house music cult leader and saying that his listeners are bad doggies who are not worthy of the music he's playing, which is then followed by a comedown where he says that he loves his mother and needs to be held. Also SF is in the name of the pirate station he hosts, so that's gotta be something\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N04mX-Zyr1U
1	And CJ the man himself. Trevor too.
9	So ESFP really like INTJ	
6	Yes, where are you? Come find us!
5	For myself, yes. Sometimes, it's a rough start, but tends to go real smooth soon enough. They need a little hand-holding initially when it comes to physical stuff, but I'm cool with that, that's where I'm confident, and they offer the same hand-holding intellectually, so good growth both ways. 10 stars. Would recommend
3	Yes. XD
2	intj best type tbh <3 
2	Not a fan at all, contrary to what the compatibility charts tell me. 
1	Eek not a huge fan. I absolutely adore INTPs though
3	Confused ENFP with a very new ESFP (possible) boyfriend	Been friends with this guy for a while now, things started getting more flirtatious of late, but it could've been purely circumstantial (us being thrown together as two love interests in a recent production, etc)... we obviously like each other but I definitely get vibes that anything that seems too serious too quickly could really overwhelm him... not that I'd be taking any giant leaps like saying I love you this early, or trying to force an exclusive relationship, but it's more just that he seems to avoid any conversation about what his sudden affection meant, and he's got a slew of female friends that he also seems to be flirting with at any given time, although it seems like more of a playful kind of thing than sincere affection?? i don't know this rant is going nowhere point is i'm confused and he's hard to read and idk how to broach the subject of possibly dating/not/what does he want/what are his intentions.. i'm fine with whatever they are, but i'd honestly just like to know. anybody have any advice/experience?
8	[deleted]
1	ESFP here and a huge flirt too. I think it is a big part of our personality, and don't want to feel like being in a relationship will stop us interacting like we always have with people.
1	Am I the only esfp who doesn't flirt, or maybe I am and don't know? 
10	Advice for Dealing with Loneliness?	I recently went through a lot of changes and currently don't have a significant other, family, or many friends.  I'm in the process of a rebuilding from a fresh start, but without many people to spend time with I constantly find myself alone.  When I have to spend a day alone I just get so incredibly sad and bored... no matter how productive I am the day still feels like a waste without anyone to share it with. My hobbies stop entertaining me when it's all I ever have to do. I would really like to figure out how to enjoy my own company and be less dependent on attention from others.\n\nHow do other ESFPs keep themselves from feeling lonely without people around? How did you learn to enjoy your own company?
4	For me, I still have it sometimes, but it's not crippling or stopping me from enjoying life. I got cats to avoid loneliness. Pets that like cuddling really help. I have a hobby, that has people with it, so I establish some lightweight friendships in there. I also exist a lot online. And I still feel somewhat lonely. Not sure what to say. Learn some mindfulness. Explore why you find it so oppressive and anxiety inducing? Are you good at being alone?\n\nGood thing is joining different clubs, or sport teams, or gyms, and building a connection. Try find people in areas you are interested in. Express yourself.
4	I'm not the best example. I have only lived entirely alone in my own apartment for a month of life out of my 33 years. \n\nNow I live in a poly cluster with my husband, his husband, and our children. I love it this way. I am not sure if I really could live all on my own for extended periods of time. The truth is, I wouldn't want to do that. I live for the company of others.\n\nBut do I enjoy time by myself? Yes. My primary alone time is during exercise. Even so, my long runs are often a chance to reconnect with friends, so I only exercise alone sometimes - but this is the time I use to think, ponder, and wonder. Exercise is the best when the physical fades away - I can't even tell I'm running anymore because I'm floating away in my head. It's what I need, because I can't have my head in the clouds at home, so my long run in the mountains is the *perfect* mental vacation.\n\nI'm just glad that I have a big poly family to come home to after my little temporary escape to the mountains.\n\nMy advice is balance - find ways to enjoy your own company that allow you to rebalance and refresh. And there's nothing wrong with seeking out friends, family, and acquaintances for company most of the time.\n\nJust think of Eleanor Roosevelt. She basically became part of her personal doctor's family near the end of her life.\n\nPolyamory suits us ESFPs better than other types, I believe. 
1	Time. \n\nGo out. Gym and coffee shops. If you have a job talk to them. Ask if they know people who enjoy certain activities and ask to meet them or hang out.
1	I used to be worried about that as a teen, but right now I deal with it a lot more easily. I just kinda realized that I don't need to chase people to be happy. Being alone doesn't have to be a big deal. I go through periods of being by myself and then living an active social life, and when I'm by my solo I don't mind it. I really enjoy being around people I like, but I don't constantly need it. Weed also helps if you're into that sort of stuff.\n\nBe more active on the internet would be my only advice, maybe try to rekindle some old relationships in real life too
1	My son is an ESFP. I can see this type of pain in him when he doesn't have enough opportunity to get out with his friends or experience new things. [Meetup.com](https://Meetup.com) is a godsend, for both his development and my sanity. As an INTP I used it to explore my interests and ended up finding some of the greatest friends I've ever had. Friends isn't even the right term, they have become what I consider to be my real family. The beauty is that you don't have to rush into relationships (my pitfall when I used to let myself get so lonely I'd take whatever came along lol) as you can get to know people slowly and organically through the process of performing fun, healthy, inspiring activities together. \n\nI really don't think it's a good idea to try to learn to enjoy your own company for any extended period of time as an ESFP. Your strength, and my son's lie in your transcendent abilities in relational activity and to deny yourself and others of that would just be a type of "little death" that neither you, nor the world, deserve. If there isn't anything that interests you in your area, start your own Meetup!
1	Practice practice practice! I purposely moved out alone this year so i could spend time by myself without needing to rely on hanging out with other people. It gets easier with time (and I’ve actually turned into a little but of a hermit)
5	Unhealthy ESFPs, how do you act?	
19	Constantly spending money, making little lies, and going out drinking like every weekend are my main problems
12	compulsive drinking): exaggerating stories, excessive flirtatious behaviour, inappropriate sexual activity with a guy i probably shouldnt be banging, constant need for validation and attention
5	I think that in the context of mbti "healthy" is a word you have to be careful with, usually people only believe that their subjective beliefs about how things should be are what "healthy" is.\n\nContrary to what others have said, I barely ever lie(in the sense of making up things to make myself look good) and have always been good with my money. To me unhealthy ESFPs are the ones that are caught up in their inferior Ni. It can manifest in becoming existential, paranoid or believing crazy conspiracy theories. Craving attention and having random sex are not really signs of an "unhealthy ESFP"
2	Just a heads up, this forum doesn't have a lot of actively commenting people 
6	I get a ton of symptoms of social anxiety (which go away when I'm at my healthiest), shut myself away from everybody else, becomes super analytical about everything to avoid feelings
3	For me being unhealthy meant lying a lot to escape my responsibilities which led me to becoming really paranoid with everyone, and being completely disgenuine all the time I wasnt alone. I am as naughty with spending money and partying now as a more healthy person than I was when unhealthy. Probably more so actually.
4	What do you think of ISFPs?	
6	i have a crush on one! shes so cool and i love talking to her
3	ISFP is a pretty cool guy. eh have good aesthetic tastes and doesn't afraid of anything
3	ESFPs, how are you different than an average esfp?	
11	Fashion. Every ESFP has a different sense of style.
3	I don't really think there's an "average" ESFP. Eeeeeveryone has something that's different about them. :)
1	My weight 
1	Idk
1	More pessimistic. Could be a result of having an unhappy year tho.
1	MBTI Discord Server!	*x-posted to other MBTI subreddits*\n\nHi gang,\n\nI  just created Discord server called MBTI Penpals for any type of  personality to be able to communicate with others of any type of  personality. Check it out here:\n\n[https://discord.gg/pRRGnTd](https://discord.gg/pRRGnTd)\n\nCome  find more people of your type, or seek for others of compatible (or not  compatible) types! Talk with each other in real-time, either via text  chat or voice chat. Enjoy!
2	How do you motivate yourself to be more active?	Any exclusive tips on how to beat everyone's ass at everything and not be lazy?
4	Force yourself. Sometimes it’s the best solution.
3	I use the moments when I feel optimistic and energized about getting stuff done to accept responsibilities and make promises. I work better with the stick so I put myself into a position where if I dont get the thing done I’m in big trouble.
2	It takes time to make something into a regular habit. \n\nYou'll have to force yourself to go exercise for the first few weeks, but after that, you'll be missing it on the days you don't go.

4	Signs you are definitely not ESFP	Heyo, party people \^\^\n\nI am confused about my type and would like to hear what you, ESFPs, see as signs that one is definitely not ESFP.\n\nI'm excited for what you'll come up with \^\^
18	“Visiting a new country?!? Omg let me get started on a check list and timing schedule ASAP!”
9	If you think first before action 🤔😂😂 jkkkk
9	"I just love structure and routine. It makes me feel safe."
2	I mean there are loads. Being extra conservative, pessimistic, strictly abiding by all the rules.\n\nAs always - look into functions first and foremost and socionics if you feel like you might be an ESFP, but don't really relate to the most common MBTI descriptions
2	Whatsapp Group for Extroverts	Hi Everyone, we have created a whatsapp group for Extroverts. It's a very active group and it's super fun! Everyone is hilarious and very friendly.

1	Personality types and underwear types? (x-post /r/mbti)	Hello there.\n\nI did a bit of research on that topic, but didn't find anything meaningful (searched through google scholar).\n\nI was wondering if I could find correlation (and perhaps causation) from psychological types to the type of underwear worn.\n\nHere's the [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Q0O9FFHmOZKay1ztg9g39iEsP9gjGIYwejsnFrjGZ9Y/edit).\n\nFeel  free to comment on those questions aswell (with your MBTI type  identified) if you want. I figured this sort of survey would be okay  since there was a fetish survey a week ago on [/r/MBTI](https://www.reddit.com/r/MBTI). Hope it's alright!
1	Could I be INFP, ESFP, or neither?	I’m fairly certain that I have Fi, but unsure if it’s dominant or auxiliary. I wrote a description of myself awhile back that was based on how others saw me, traits I saw in myself, and tried to cover different areas in my life. I got mixed results, a lot of ESFP and INFP. I’ve read about both and I can easily see myself as both, but I know I can only possibly be one, and I’m stumped trying to find out. \n\nI’ll make my case for each and try to include my motivations as well.  \n\n**My main reasons for INFP** are the Fi-Si loop: I‘m sentimental and nostalgic about certain events in my past and love sharing them because I’m not ready to let them go, and I’d like to think those around me care as much as I do. I have a lot of photos and remember the specific dates of the events that were emotionally relevant for me, again because I don’t want to forget, I believe that they aren’t truly gone unless you forget about them. I don’t care about my appearance as much, I obviously take care of hygiene but I rarely deviate from my normal clothing style because it’s comfortable, that and because I freaking hate clothes shopping in general haha. I don’t display a lot of your average Se traits, I’m pretty clumsy and uncharismatic, and you could see my cringe-worthy and awkward movements from a mile away if you saw me in real life. I’m not sure if this would be attributed to inferior Te or not, but I’m pretty un-assertive and I don’t like taking the lead for random things just for the sake of taking the lead. It’s not that I dislike the attention, I just hate asserting myself and trying to act as an authority figure. I wouldn’t like being above people, I’d rather be equal and liked than higher and powerful, and plus the added responsibility and pressure is not worth it for me. If it’s something that I’m truly passionate about though, I’m absolutely the first to speak up and let everyone know, whether I not I’d really “take the lead” that depends, but I definitely show a lot of excitement and enthusiasm if something I’m passionate about hits. \n\n**My main reasons for ESFP:** I feel like I’m too trusting and enthusiastic about the company of people to be an INFP. I’ve gotten feedback about being very naïve and open to strangers even as a child. Canceled social plans just cut so deep for me, I can’t even explain the overwhelming disappointment when I’m looking forward to hanging out and then it just gets rescheduled or cancled. I love being with people, especially when they allow me to be who I am and let me show my real self. I love telling stories, making friends, laughing my ass off, and being well known in the community/social life. I feel absolutely furfilled and hyped after a fun social night and I can’t relate to needing to immediately go home and be alone to recharge. Whole I don’t mind my alone time, I usually just use it to watch shows or make memes or something, I rarely ever go deep into my thoughts and get extremely depressed if I do. Life is awesome and I think being existential and over-complicated makes things really depressing and weighed down for no reason. I’ve never really seen myself as intuitive, in fact I’ve even gotten feedback for not thinking about future implications, “you need to look at the big picture,” think about the long-term etc. I sometimes blurt things out without realizing the consequences and doing absolutely retarded things in the moment and then physically cringing at myself as I look back and reflect on it. It looks like a great idea and it looks like the best option at the time, so I’d go ahead and then it just blows up in my face. \n\nBased on my evaluation (and if necessary, my profile shows my previous type me posts), what would you reckon I could be?
2	ESFP
4	Honestly? You talk too much to be an ESFP, I mean that in the nicest way possible! Look at all the other posts on here and how brief and void of analysis they are (maybe that was a little strong). You sound like a great person, my guess would be INFP/ENFP. 
1	Try carefully reading through socionics profiles and seeing which ones you identify with. These are more detailed than MBTI ones which makes it easier to figure out your type.  \n    \n[INFP by Gulenko](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=EII_Profile_by_Gulenko) | [INFP by Stratiyevskaya](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/42490) | [INFP subtypes](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/7432-EII-INFj-Subtypes?p=138200&viewfull=1#post138200)   \n   \n[ESFP by Gulenko](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=SEE_Profile_by_Gulenko) | [ESFP by Stratiyevskaya](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/42477) | [ESFP subtypes](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=SEE_subtypes)    \n
3	All my friends are introverted	I have no idea how it ended up this way but I adopted all of them forcefully. I'm gonna be at their death beds.\n\nWhat's it like to have other extroverted friends? Genuinely don't know 🤷🏻‍♀️
3	We roll together
1	I’d say the biggest thing is we hype each other up, and motivate each other to go out of our way to do things.
5	Do you agree with this description of dominant Se?	I personally think it's mostly a load of bs from a judgemental intuitive lol what are your thoughts?\n\n>Extraverted Sensation Types\n\nExtraverted Sensation is the easiest function to understand as it simply coincides with what we observe in the outer reality, usage of the body, force, where objects are located in life and biological factors as well as observation of societal tradition and ancestry.\n\nThis type's thinking and feeling are mostly guided by the objective reality in general. They are the most ordinary in society and live life by the standardized rules and regulations. Depending on the subtype, one's ethics (Se-Fi) or ideaologies (Se-Ti) may keep them from going overboard as far as hedonism goes.\n\nSe dominants with Se subtypes are more hedonistic and have less developed auxiliary functions. (A few rappers belong to this type. Ted Bundy may have also belonged to this type and of course was an extreme case.)\n\nMost MBTI blogs don't mention the portion of Se that observes and celebrates ancestral history. However, Jung, Von Franz & Van der Hoop have brought this up. It is also a huge piece of information because it is why Ni dominants are said to at times worship ancestral figures or believe they are in "spiritual communication" with archetypes. (Feeling angels watching over them and etc.)\n\nSe doms are very much interested in biological facts and scientific research based on dissection of plants, animals and etc\n\nSe doms were the majority of western civilization during the time of Jung, Von Franz & Van der Hoop.\n\n[ Inferior Ni ] Se types are often good at writing Science Fiction stories or telling ghost stories for fun. The Sci-Fi movies are mostly based in fantasies that manipulate biology because they are aware they are absurd and have no chance of coming true. (As opposed to the Ni dom who is more likely to believe in things such as ghosts & etc.) Paranormal horror films such as The Grudge, Idle Hands, Pet Semetary& Sci-Fi movies such as Jurassic Park, The Fly and Tarantula are great examples of great extraverted sensing creativity in movies. (This isn't to say they are Se types but Se/Ni has been applied.)\n\nThey are the best at knowing how to use force, aggression and the body to reach their goals. This is why they are often said to be amazing athletes.\n\n[ Inferior Ni ] -- During times of stress, they may deviate away from their normal mode of common sense and become paranoid that others are doing things against them\n\n[ Inferior Ni ] -- In stress or considering people they dislike, they made attribute inaccurate intuitions about them\n\n[ Inferior Ni ] -- May suddenly become interested in eastern philosophy , unconventional spirituality or become interested in basic forms of parapsychology such as the "daily horoscope" and such. However, they truly don't understand the concepts of such things and leave that to Ni doms.\n\nOne of the most efficient and happy-go-lucky types out of them all. They can be happy simply being alive and make the most out of the moment.\n\nThey may like a neat and aesthetically pleasing house, dress according to the weather and sometimes like to flex material goods.\n\n[ Unhealthy Se ] -- They may have an intense ego if they are unhealthy and accumulate tons of money. They become flashy, extravagant, shallow, and egotistical. (Some rappers belong to this type.)\n\n[ Unhealthy Se ] -- They may expect special treatment due to status and can be classist. They may set certain standards concerning who's "allowed" to be seen with them or not based on morals or ideas surrounding materialism. (The women from the movie Jawbreaker and Mean Girls are included in this type.)\n\nSometimes Se types confuse themselves with feelers because reflexive emotions are sparked with sensations at times and can be intense. ( A woman may get a sudden intense sensation during sex or a man when seeing a woman he is super attracted to.) However, emotional intensity is mostly caused by perceptive functions instead of evaluative ethics.\n\n>Life Quote: " I'd rather pay attention to things I can prove and live each day as if it were my last. I want to make the most of my life and have no regrets. \n\nhttps://reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/9saeni/misconceptions_about_each_type_warning_long/

1	“Se-dom = conformist”\n\nLooooool. What about Bella Thorne?
23	Normal for ESFPs?	I Feel like ESFPs are seen as social outgoing people, which i am for the most part, but whenever I'm in a social situation where I'm the only one that doesnt know anyone or only know a few people i get really uncomfortable and become really scared to come on too strong or seem weird. Is this normal for you guys?
17	Very normal!\n\nI think ESFP's are better at projecting confidence, and hiding anxiety, but we tend to ease into situations once we are comfortable. \n\nSocial anxiety is normal for everyone to a certain degree actually, I think we just handle it differently from other personalities. 
4	Depends on the situation. For me, whenever I feel comfy, I instantly open up to everyone, even if I don’t really know them.
5	Very normal! I once went to a party not knowing everyone and could see people were gesturing 'whats this guy talking about' 'hes crazy' which definitely got to me (have a case of verbal diarrhoea when I'm in these situations'
4	I feel you. I hold myself back a lot in these situations, especially if when I do try and open up to everyone I get negative feedback. It’s very hit or miss for me though, because sometimes I could be completely comfortable with the people I’m with and just let myself loose and try not to let embarrassment hold me down, but most of the time I’ll end up sitting back with my mouth shut wishing I could speak up but can’t gather the balls to do it. I can absolutely relate to this. 
2	Norm!
1	I literally do this all the time
1	Me all the way
3	Can ESFPs be low energy	So I'm tryna type someone else here and he is everything ESFP except the loud and full of energy stereotype. Is it possible that he is still ESFP?
4	Yeah possible bro
2	Absolutely! You don’t have to fit into 100% of the stereotypes, and certainly don’t let it throw you off track. I think it’s better to look at the motives rather than behaviors, because people can do the same things for different reasons, and going by behaviors can be very contradictory and you’ll never fully be confident in the type if you’re constantly realizing that you’re not completely matching the stereotype. \n\nMaybe find out why he’s low energy? For me, I’m only really cheery and enthusiastic when I’m confident that the people enjoy my presence and I’m allowed to be myself. Otherwise, I won’t match the high-energy persona at all. Especially under stress. \n\nI wouldn’t completely discard ESFP as a possibility. This might sound a little cliche, but maybe ask if he feels energized/furfilled or wants to go spend time alone to recharge after spending time with people? You can be a low-energy extrovert or a high-energy introvert, it isn’t necessarily a causation. 
2	No we are all full of energy all the time. I haven't slept in 18 years. Please send help.
1	Does he smoke weed?
4	University life	How do you guys manage University life, like in terms of academics and social life and other activities?\n\nI just feel that I can’t keep a good balance between the two. It’s so hard to even have a social life if you are focused on studies or vice versa.\n\nAs for academics, Im currently on the failing edge in terms of academics, I don’t know man, maybe I just really don’t like the course of study I’m doing right now. But the thing is, if I quit halfway, how would my parents feel about sending loads of money only to fail after that.\n\nIs university life really hard, like especially for engineering students and shits or maybe it’s just me. I feel like I can’t cram in anything, like it’s so boring.\n\nWhat should I do? It’s been bothering me for ages.
6	Im in the same boat man. College is not a happy place for me, because studying, homework and work consume my life, and it makes me unhappy, because i really had no social life. I told my parents that and they told me to take some time off to think and reflect, so here i am taking the semester off, and I’m feeling way better. I’m not saying drop out, but take a step back at the situation, or a break to recharge.
3	We all must suffer one of two things: the pain of regret, or the pain of discipline. \n\nThis is life, unfortunately. \n\nI did a uni course I had no passion for because it offered a safe career. I put in my hard time during uni, and I’m cruising now. No regrets. 
3	I wonder if it's because it's hard for us to plan ahead and block off time. It's either all in or nothing. I'm actually an ENFP, but I think I know what it's like be S pretty well because a lot of people in my life are S's and I've developed some S tendencies. When I was more N I could block off time better - like I'll study for 30 minutes, socialize for 30, do my laundry, and come back. When I'm more S, I just work until I'm hungry, eat until I'm full, work until I'm bored, go do something, feel guilty about it, and have to get back to work. It's kind of stressful, honestly. My brother (who's an ISFP), suggested that I decide how much I need to get done to feel good about myself, and then decide to do other things. Maybe that will be a good way to keep things balanced. Hope that helps!
1	Can you guys also read my “type me” post and let me know what I should do about this if that helps
4	Have any ESFPs ever cheated in a relationship?	Any personality type is probably capable of cheating under the right circumstances, and ESFPs have a reputation for being the flirtiest type, but I feel like they are relatively unlikely to cheat for a few reasons:\n\n1. They would not stay in a relationship that makes them unhappy enough to cheat. They’re more likely to cut ties first. \n2. They don’t have the patience it would take to try to cover up their infidelity. This would require a lot of strategic maneuvering/planning that they’re not interested in. \n3. Because introverted feeling is such a major part of their being, they wouldn’t be comfortable with the “fakery” that would be infidelity. In other words, they need to be themselves so wholeheartedly that they couldn’t bring themselves to either stay in an unhappy relationship nor sleep with someone else while being in a relationship. \n\nOf course, there’s the possibility that an ESFP’s impulsivity wins out, and they do actually sleep with someone but soon after regret it and realize how much they love the partner they’re with. Has anyone ever been in this situation? Some people need to test boundaries and experience something before they can understand it, and I think ESFPs are definitely that type. \n\nAlso, what about sleeping with an ex? It seems like introverted feeling would stop them there as well. Obviously, you broke up for a reason, and introverted feeling tends to like emotional closure to a point where you wouldn’t have any interest in reopening that door. \n\nAnyone have any experience with any of this?
5	Like the other poster here, I put off dating for ages. It felt futile. Either I get close enough about the person to kind of be forced into monogamy and miss out, or I end up just amusing myself for a bit until it gets too serious.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am in a relationship now, and I addressed the monogamy thing with him and how much I was struggling with it (I was contemplating cheating), but it felt so dishonest and unfair I couldn't premeditate it. So the only times I am considering it is when I could potentially slip up in the moment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInteresting what you said about our need to be ourselves wholeheartedly in our relationships. After having the convo with my bf, I felt instantly 10x better having just spoke about it that the urge went away. I think we hate being told we can't do anything and need to make out own decisions. We need to know we have the freedom to act in a moment, rather than try and figure out some plan about that moment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut no to the ex as well. I think we don't like ambiguity and repeating our mistakes too much to do that most of the time. Unless it was an in-the-moment thing.\n\n&#x200B;
3	That’s why I never dated, I’m personally afraid of that.\nI just prefer fuck-buddies or one night stands, they are soo much better.
1	My boyfriend is an ESFP.\n\nHe has cheated on his previous partners, but not on me. (As far as I know. But I have no reason to believe that he has.)\n\nHis reason for cheating was that he was unhappy, and his relationship was incredibly unstable. He would get drunk and his impulsivity got the best of him.
8	esfp's of reddit, an intp needs your advice.	my brother, an esfp, just had his heart broken by a woman he was deeply in love with. just this weekend he shared with us that he was going to ask her to marry him, and now this happened. i want to do what i can to help him through this, but i'm at a loss of what i can do. he's the only feeler in our family since our dad passed away, as well as the only male. and i know zero about relationships so i can't even give him any helpful advice.\n\nif it was me hurting, i'd want to be left alone to think and process and analyze until i could make sense of what happened and how i feel. but i'm VERY aware that this isn't a method that works for everyone. \n\ni tried distracting him today with a new video game. we had a nice conversation about playstyles, battle preferences, and ranking franchises by the quality of their combat systems. it seemed to cheer him up, if just for a while. i also spent a few hours today texting him star wars memes. he loves those. even managed to find some he hadn't seen yet.\n\nhow am i doing so far? and any advice on what else i can do? i really am at a loss here. \n\nthanks for listening.\n\n-an intp
7	ESFP's will normally want to be alone for the healing process. You may find them declining to leave the house, or join their friends in activities until they are out of their rut.  ESFP's have a natural confidence in themselves, and being spurned by their loved ones can take its toll on their psych. We mostly need time to feel sorry for ourselves, and might actively prevent being cheered up until we do so. \n\nYou can speed this process by giving us an opportunity to feel needed.  Remind  us of our value by asking our opinions on things, asking us to help with something we are good at, and we will be our normal confident self soon enough.   \n\n\nGuys tend to take breakups harder than ladies, and pout for longer about it, so don't expect a dramatic return to form  for at least a week or two. But ESFP's bounce back to full strength faster than others, and we will be looking for something else to admire in no time. 
5	Just wanna say you sound like a very kind person. :)\n\nFrom my experience with break-ups or just hard times in general, being surrounded by friends and family who truly care about me is what ultimately brings me out of what feels like an emotional abyss. I know it's not always natural or comfortable to try comforting someone when you aren't an open feeler, but knowing that someone would even try can mean everything and make all of the difference.\n\nDistractions from thinking about the difficult shit is important. From what you've said, you sound like you know your brother well and you don't need advice from me or anyone on how to comfort him.
3	You're doing great! \n\nWhen I'm down I love spending time with those I care about and even if I'm not up for socializing I always appreciate an invite. 
3	Wow you’re so sweet! \nI would want to just have someone there with me.  After my most recent break up I ended up just bouncing from one friend’s house to another because I really didn’t want to be alone. He might want to talk about it sometimes and he might really not want to other times and both are ok. 
2	Just keep up with what you’re doing, you’re doing great! 
2	exactly what you are doing right now is awesome!\n\ngiving space but letting him know he can talk to you (without constantly repeating that) and distracting him with things he enjoys, will definitely help the grieving process. plus just being with someone he loves and cares about would cheer him up. \n\nit's a process, and he'll make his way out of it. dont worry. you sound lovely!
2	Thoughts on casual sex?	I'd say engaging in casual sex would match our stereotype, but stereotypes aren't often true.\n\nWhat are your morals/thoughts on casual sex?\n\nDo you think its fun and enjoyable, or do you prefer a stable committed relationship?\n\nLet me know!\n\nFYI: I'm torn.
9	I’d honestly rather not, I think sex is very private and should only really be had when you really love someone. The thought of giving it out for free and treating it like just another hobby is rather disgusting. I really don’t like that it’s apart of our stereotype. 
6	I’m not opposed to a quick poke here or there from a stranger
4	I have always been quite relaxed with it. I guess for me its more like casual emotional bonding. Like I love to get deep with someone even if we aren't that close.\n\nI'm a gay man and kinda always experimented/fooled around with friends throughout the years. This year I have got a boyfriend though and I **really** struggled giving up casual intimacy ahha.
5	It is what it is bro. We love casual sex. I did a hooker 2 years ago. Not ashamed.
3	I'd rather not.

11	Can you relate?	After spending a day or two alone without talking to anyone (just watching Netflix or playing video games or whatever) when I get out I feel really down and cloudy and irritable. But after a few hours of spending time with people like after hanging out with friends or going to a gettogether I feel happy and excited and talk more. Do you experience this or it’s just me ?
5	Same, I will want to be lazy and not talk to anyone or go out. When I do that on a Saturday, by 5 pm I feel like shit and want to socialize. After I socialize for a few hours I feel accomplished.
7	Yup that’s me too. There’s only a certain amount of time that I can withstand being alone before I start becoming moody

5	Youtuber C.S. Joseph Concludes That Taylor Swift Is ESFP	
3	no
3	*D A B*
1	Personally, I don't really agree with a lot of this guy's typing and I don't really agree that Taylor Swift is ESFP. So far in my opinion, I think the only typing he's actually done a good job on is Alex Jones but even with Alex Jones, I don't agree with his concluded typing. Generally speaking, conspiracy theories revolve around Ni and so ENFP for Alex Jones doesn't really make sense because of Ne. Alex Jones seems to be in the Ni-Se or Se-Ni Dynamic/Axis to me and I feel he's a J-type so some kind of NJ. I guess I can agree that Alex Jones is on the Fi-Te or Te-Fi Dynamic/Axis which leaves either ENTJ or INTJ and I'm leaning towards INTJ for him.

4	i just ignore the problem, hang with them separately. im not their mother, i wont baby them. they are fully capable of maintaining their own relationships and making their own decisions, getting me involved would be immature and childish. if they make it ur problem, tell them youre not responsible for their own happiness and friendship issues, and that you like them both but you dont want to choose
2	I went through this exact situation in hs. I basically focused onakng the both of them enjoying spending time with me to the point they could get over it. There were a lot of time we'd hangout and they'd only talk to me and there were no group discussions but eventually they grew out of it and get a long real well now. Granted they were friends before and went through a point where they just couldn't stand each other
1	Thanks for the responses guys haha. Currently the hatred isn’t that strong so I’ll ignore the problem for now. But when the going gets tougher, I would probably try to make peace with them, and if that does not resolve, I would retreat.\nCheers people 💙
5	Do you guys prefer travelling alone or with friends?	Because for me I would prefer travelling alone and meet new people rather than to travel with friends and probably get your freedom stripped off for the whole trip. Do you guys feel this way too? Or am I just different here?
4	There’s no way I could travel alone. I would feel adrift and awkward and out of place without other people. I’d rather just go with a group, I don’t know what I’d do on my own. But that’s just me.
1	I like travelling alone, one of my favorite things of my trips are meeting people in my hostel and going for pub crawls. Usually they laugh at me for being drunk, but I don't really care 😂
2	ESFPs?!-How do you usually get into a Relationship?	Please help me out! I want to understand it a bit more since I am trying to be pretty serious with my crush. We've been seeing each other for over a month and I have been letting him have free range because I know that's what he needs! But I know he will continue to keep coming back again and again. \n\nHow do you get into a relationship? Are you usually looking for one? Is it an accident? Do you like a relationship label or is a label unnecessary? Would a label feel constraining? Or would it make you warm and fuzzy inside?\n\nSpill the ESFP Beans Please
12	It’s always an accident\n
7	I'll be doing my usual thing, meet somebody, we talk, we keep talking, we hang out, keep hanging out, realize that we actually really like each other, and once it hits the point where I only like them I let them know and boom! relationship.
4	21/F ESFP. Always a friend first then I usually make it obvious that I wanna have them to myself, usually by getting physical. Then they're mine. :)
1	It comes when you least expect it. Don’t even try to look forward for it.
1	Lol can relate to the comments. Totally on accident. You just don't get sick of seeing someone enough to keep hanging out over and over and over oh shit now i have a partner. :P
1	Honestly accidentally I don't ask for it, it's rare when I seek out a relationship 
2	How do ESFPs deal with death?	I have an ESFP who has been grieving the accidental death of a very close family member for over 6 months. She barely goes to work, can't sleep, confesses that she's always irritated at things that would never bother her before, and you can tell when she's thinking of her loved one because she tears up but then refuses to talk about it. It's almost like she feels embarrassed or ashamed. I think she has a lot of guilt/blame/regret over her last interaction with this person. What she did wasn't ill-intended or even bad, but I think she keeps thinking that if only she had done something differently anyhow, it wouldn't have happened. \n\nShe had a brief period right after the death where she indulged in a lot of drinking and sex. That seems to have abated, but she won't go to therapy or a support group, and she won't go to the doctor and ask for medication. I've suggested some self-care things like exercise and writing but she dismisses those too.\n\nI know the grief process can take years, but I worry that she's not coping well. Then again I'm very different from her, so maybe this isn't as maladaptive as it comes across to me. What do you guys think? How do you deal with grief? And what approach would be most helpful to her under these circumstances? 
3	Not well. It’ll be a process. This will sound silly, but my friend got a puppy and it was adorable and brought it over for me to play with. She subtly asked if I could walk her. And it helped a lot. Maybe try getting her outside where she doesn’t feel like a burden. I get a lot of joy out of making others feel good while doing things that are good for me too. (Being outside, getting some exercise) \n\nSorry if this wasn’t helpful or the help you were lookin for. Just be there for her. Lots of hugs!
5	My now girlfriend (also an ESFP) had a similar experience.  A mutual friend of ours ubruptly/accidentally passed away and she was the one who had been performing CPR on them before they died in hospital a day later.\n\nIt was almost impossible to get any of her true feelings on how she was coping out, ESPECIALLY if she started getting emotional.  If things get too heavy she will completely shutdown, ignore it and/or cry intensely.\n\nShe’s much better now a year later. \nThe thing that got her through in the end was lots of support from friends and family.  As well as introducing as many positive things into her life as possible (e.g. new job, dating, new home etc.). I think for Better or Worse distraction as opposed to discussion seemed to have worked the best, which is very different from myself.\n\n\n\n
3	Also you’re a really good friend :)
2	I’m a ENTJ with an ESFP girlfriend.  I believe simply being there for your friend in the many and various ways speaks volumes to ESFPs.  Saying it is nice but doing things, small or large, says a lot.  Showing them you stand with them during this time will help. She feels deeply and therefor will grieve deeply.  Be there and expect no answers.  (I may be wrong so if any ESFPs want to help me I would appreciate it). 
1	we don't deal with it well. we don't like people seeing us cry even though we get emotional really quickly. We are good at reframing though, meaning if we convince ourselves to look at things a different way, we truly believe it. But it can't be coming from someone else, we have to somewhat discover it ourselves and believe it. I would say give her new experiences that she appreciates so her mind can flex and readjust. 
1	ESFP being a jerk to me	Hello I am an ENFP and I recently made a post wondering what was going down with my ESFP friend's attitude. \nShe's been blunt, rude, quick to lie, ungrateful, and anti-social for the past several days. \nShe's been like this before, but she always apologizes soon after and explains the reason why. It's usually related to anxiety. However, this time it's lasted for almost 5 days. \nThe only times she has been normal are when she's back around her boyfriend. She randomly will be amicable and laughing but only when she's making fun of me. \nShe's always been sort of pretentious, but always kind and complimentary. I know she's going through things with her family lately, and she can't go back home to see her family since they were affected by Hurricane Florence. They're all safe though, and last I heard doing fine. \nIf she ever looks grumpy, or angry, and I ask her what's up, she gets frustrated at me. \nThe other day, I gave her and several others a ride to a film festival 30 minutes away, and she didn't say thank you when the others did, and was a backseat driver the whole way. She was rapping along to her rap music, and I could tell got frustrated when I asked her to change the music because it was distracting. \nMy question is, \nany idea why she's acting like this, and also what's the best way to approach her and tell her that she's hurting me (or if that's a terrible idea), or if you have any idea when she'll stop?\n\nEDIT: We worked it out and figured out that she was just really drained that week, and it was partially due to my sheer energy level. So we reached a compromise of how if she feels drained because of that, that she should tell me because immediate communication is a lot less messy. 
6	First: You’re sure she’s your friend? \n\nAlso how did you come to the conclusion that she’s ESFP?\n\nAnd I don’t really think there’s a magical “ESFP way” to approach her or deal with this, she just sounds like passive-aggressive person and isn’t very interested in having a genuine relationship with you from what I read. It’s really up to you if you want to approach her about it or not but either way it isn’t healthy to cling to people like that.
3	Shes being passive agressive and isnt adding value to the relationship. Best thing is to confront her or drop her. The reality is that she just doesnt seem to give a shit how you feel and there isnt some magical thing you can do to make her care. You either value someone or you dont, and sge doesnt seem to value you.
2	Talk to her about her stank attitude. Come from an approach of understanding her anxiety/reasonable stress, but those factors don't give her the right to treat you like crap. Most people I know who deal with anxiety don't understand how they may be hurting people. If you bring it to their attention it may freak them out a little, but if they're a decent person they'll try to treat you better. \n\n\-and/or-\n\nFind someone who treats you better. \n\n&#x200B;
2	She does not sound like a good friend and you should drop her ungrateful ass. 
1	Confront her
2	Needing Help with an ESFP friend	Hey all!! I am an ENFP, and have a really good ESFP friend. Lately, she’s been acting really distant and just giving off a really sad vibe. She occasionally has these spells, but this has been the longest one so far. It started right after dinner the other night when we had a great conversation with another friend. As soon as we left, she came across like she was almost upset with me even though I did nothing. I asked her about it and she said nothing was wrong. She’s been like this before, but it was when she felt anxious in a crowded environment and she directed her discomfort towards me because she knew I could take it. The difference is that there she immediately apologized afterwards and explained what happened. \nAny tips or just general insight as to what she’s going through?
1	She’s probably just jealous that you had a VERY great convo with ANOTHER FRIEND. I relate to your friend sometimes. I get anxious when I feel that I am going to be replaced by someone else.
1	Maybe something about the conversation made her feel something was lacking in her life?
5	Careers and Creativity	Hey all,\n\nI feel like I am very much an ESFP, and a turbulent one at that.\n\nI started a job this year that kinda sucks. I sit at a desk 8-5 and type out code allllllll day. Sounds like torture for an ESFP - a fact I didn't consider when I was aiming for this industry. \n\nThe job has slowly turned me into a monotonous, pretty unhappy guy. I feel like I have lost my spark that I used to have during the day, and it will only appear on the weekends again now. What makes it worse is I left a good job which had a good balance of social to it to come here (and better $$). I keep beating myself up for it, but also too scared to go find another job impulsively due to how it would screw people over here, and probably not look good by any means. Ontop of that idk what role to even go for (Full Stack Developer atm, definitely not that :P)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI see a lot of ESFP's have a lot of creativity, but I feel like I never quite embraced it growing up, then went to a field that was not too creative either. Did anyone else feel like this? How did you find your creative passion? How did you find a career you enjoyed and didn't have to force yourself to every day, and spend all day counting down the minutes until you leave?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just want to be okay with getting up and going to work or being there, but I spend such a proportion of my day unhappy, its turning me into somebody I don't like.
2	First of all, are you absolutely sure you're an ESFP? Don't go off stereotypes, go through individual functions and analyze your behavior to see if it really fits you. Secondly, being an ESFP does not equal being creative. What are you good at, what did you want to do when you were growing up, why did you get involved in this industry in the first place, what were your motivations? Answer those questions and you'll figure out why you don't like your current job. It's never late to start over, better to waste some time learning something new, rather than constantly trying something you know you don't like. If you don't know what you want or like maybe it's time to do some soul searching and explore new ideas.
1	I have artistic people in my family, which definitely influenced me to do art myself. I also grew up singing karaoke and three-ish years ago I also picked up the ukulele. But these are all just my hobbies!\n\nLast year I worked a job that physically and mentally drained me. I basically worked in a factory, doing the same thing every day (I was packing those serving carts with coffee and tea pots for commercial planes), and the only time I got to interact with anyone was during breaks. It was so exhausting to me. At the moment I really want to work in a grocery store so I get to interact with people all day!
1	My partner is ESFP and a chef. I think that's common for sensory types. He is high energy and has a very keen nose. He likes the busyness and clamour of the kitchen.   \n\n\nCreativity is simply putting your energy into the world in some sense. Figure out what your best output is and follow it. If you haven't figured it out yet, like me, I guess just keep trying? Sorry it's not very helpful but it's all I've ever received as advice.
1	Why did you leave that old job?
1	If you don't want to waste your tech background and coding skills, you might look at related lateral moves that are more client facing and hopefully will give you a little more variety day to day. For example, tech sales, technical writing, forward deployed engineering, tech consulting, etc.
-1	Get a hobby lololol
5	Do you guys get depressed when you lose a hot girl/guy to your best friend in a nightclub?	Like when you guys are competing for his/her attention, and then when your Best Friend gets to hook up with him/her instead, you get grumpy and feel shitty all the way, stressed depressed lol.\nDo you guys relate to this?
6	Is this esfp stereotype satire?
4	This has never happened to me, but that's a pretty shitty thing to have done to you so it makes sense that you'd be depressed. I think that'd make anyone depressed, tbh. :(
4	Eh you dont want a girl who isnt interested in you anyways. Let them be happy, and keep making friends. 
3	You're supposed to hit on different people than your friends are you doofus
2	Yes, especially if I’m used to getting the person I want, just keep your options open and communicate better though!
1	dick move of ur friend lmao. 
5	Have any of you ESFPs confused yourselves as introverted? If so, how did you finally reach the conclusion that you were ESFP?	
13	I had a crappy childhood, so obviously I was home alone and didn't socialize. I was alone most of the time and thought I liked it. Then I did the test and was like "Oh, I actually like socialization and being the centre of attention... I'm just terrified of people because they're horrible."
2	Only when we feel either burned out or in a really bad environment
2	I'm an ESFP but have considered myself ambivert, smoking weed made me more introspective and comfortable being alone, but when I am in social situations my ESFP comes out, also anxiety is big for ESFP's (speaking for myself), when you love the attention but are also anxious a part of staying in is to avoid uncomfortable scenarios that I've imagined 
5	Is this an ESFP thing? Can you relate?	Sometimes I do something embarrassing, feel so damn crushed and made a fool out of that I don’t even want to stand up, but if someone talks to me or I’m notified of a social gathering or a chance to talk to people, I instantly feel better/ have more motivation all of a sudden. This has been happening a lot lately. Can you relate or is it just me?
4	Seems enneagram 6 than ESFP. But I relate to this haha
2	Yeahhhh.. I guess I have some social anxiety cause anytime I do something embarrassing, in my head I'm like, "well I guess I have to give up socializing forever now"... And then I can jump right back into it when someone gives me attention or asks me something. Yeah, now that I think about it, I can definitely relate.
2	yesss !!! so relate. idont understand it either but its like a weird bandaid or boost of energy
1	UUUHHH yeah. This is my life. Want to plan something and get rejected? Absolutely not. Get invited to plans and feel instantly validated? ✔️
3	how do u deal with break ups ?	just curious. going thru 1 myself (2/3 months ago) and was wondering if its similar for yall ? \n\nfor me, the first month was absolute shit. i cried all the time, drank for a week straight and emotionally rebounded with a good friend. the next month, i felt a little calmer + honestly numb but i would randomly start crying with random triggers ? eg. i could easily joke about the break up and stuff but then at some point when someone asked me what happened (plenty of people have asked before but this 1 time) i just started crying for like 3 hours.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nits been 3 months now and im recovering but i was wondering if its normal to feel like thsi ? i feel really numb most of the time and when i c him i dont feel much except for awkwardness but when he crosses my mind , thats when i feel sad ? ?idk\n\nanyways. share ur breakup stories i guess yea !
3	I recently broke up with my gf of 8 months. Best time of my life. It didn’t impact me as hard as yours for some reason even though I really loved her. I always guessed it was because of paranoia and trust issues that it didn’t affect me too much originally. I was depressed for a week then was fine. We had decided to be friends but I couldn’t stand seeing her anymore (ldr) and we cut ties a few days ago. It’s been a stressful week and I’m not sure how I feel in all honesty 
3	Hey!! if whoever you are, you'll be just fine. I promise. I have been cheated on twice. one after a 1.5 year relationship and the other a 5 year. it's tough. like that shit is beat. Buuuut after half a year, I found I love myself and that person doesnt deserve me. It takes one step at a time but if you tell yourself once a day, one day at a time, that you love yourself, you WILL make it through. Stay health, take care of yourself  and love yourself.
2	Oh no... break ups are the worst. I'm so sorry :(\n\nEvery one of mine has been different and it always depends on how strongly I feel about my ex. The worst I've had so far was my first boyfriend and I was 14. I guess I have horrible taste in men cause my other boyfriends through my teens were all douchebags... breaking up with them was never sad. I'm with an amazing guy now (3yrs) and I imagine breaking up with him would absolutely crush me.\n\nis this your first relationship? If not how did you react to your other breakups?
2	How do you study?	Hello fellow esfpsl, idk about y'all but I have a hard time focusing and studying. A college student trying to get the grades in I just force myself to study many many days ahead just so I get enough done in time. Can I get some advice on how to get work done?
6	I remove all distractions, focus on material for 30-40 min, then 15 min rest. I must live through the thing to get it, so I just do it until I get it.\nDon’t try too hard - it makes you rigid. Make studying fun by doing stupid things - playing with words, reading out loud in a dramatic voice or any other stupidity of your choice. Studying in a group helps me too.
1	Study music and plenty of stretch breaks. Also a laptop so I can go to different locations
1	ESFP Cognitive functions and four sides of the mind EXPLAINED	
1	Hmm, I see, the concept of it being like a shotgun of possibilities is interesting. I always thought it was the ability to plan, but rather, it is all the possible plans.
1	Extraverted intuition is not part of the 4 main functions of ESFP's
3	Tell me about your crush	Tell me your experiences about your crush, and how you deal with them
2	i had my last crush shortly after my ex and i broke up. this guy was my ex's best friend, but also my best friend too. break up was about 3 months ago.\n\nmy crush supported me throughout the break up and was really sweet and lovely, and i fell for him real quick. turned out we both like each other, but we both agreed to not do anything bc it'd be disrespectful to my ex and also bc we're better off as just friends.\n\nwe flirt at school and ppl can c the chemistry even tho we try keep it subtle. we giggle a lot and get physical/tickle each other/shove each other around. he makes fun of me and i tease him, and we know a lot about each others lives and interests. i think i know him the best tbh. we text almost everyday and talk all the time at school too.\n\nhe got a girlfriend, and i got involved with a guy (we're now fuckbuddies and i still dunno how i feel about him). \n\nstill my feelings towards my crush are pervasive. i c him everyday and really like him, he's so sweet. he talks abt his gf sometimes, but when we're together we usually just talk about whatever. he told me he still liked me a little, and that made me get major butterflies.\n\ni accidentally made a move on him at a party. i got really drunk (and yes its my responsibility, im accountable) and sat on his lap and kissed his cheek a few times, and told him i still liked him. he was fine with it, it was a little awkward afterwards honestly but things seem back to normal now.\n\nanyways. he still asks me if im ok every few days, and tickles me, and we giggle in class together. and i still look forward to seeing him everyday. i love him so much even just as a friend, and feelings will die down, but im just so happy to have him in my life ! im glad his gf makes him happy and i would never get in the way of that again. \n\nhope i fall in love again soon\n\n\[esfp\]
1	Do ESFP's hate to be chased?	When you are popular, are you sick being chased? And if you act cold, does it mean that you're not interested? 
2	We usually chase people, not people chasing us, we are too outgoing :P
1	Hi .. I have created a subreddit for Music and MBTI	That's the link -> https://www.reddit.com/r/MBTIRadioStation/ <-\n\nPost your playlists and have a blast as always.\n\n
1	Are ESFP's really that common?	Some statistics on MBTI sites make ESFP's seem pretty commonplace, but is that really true tho? I personally can't say that I've met a lot of ESFP's, what about you?
2	like a good 50-75% of people i know irl are suspected ESFx, and a good portion of those r ESFPs
1	Same!!!!!!
1	What do you want in a partner?	How can I tell if an ESFP is into me and invested? What characteristics (physical, mental or emotional) do you people gravitate towards? 
4	Big fat ass and a sense of humor\n\nOther than that I think that optimism is a major thing, I can't imagine going out with someone who's a downer. Confidence is another one. Make the first move and see where it goes from there. Sometimes ESFP's try to downplay the depth of our emotions if we're really into someone, but in general we're not too secretive about who we like
0	Cock ass tits
4	What do you guys think of INFPs??	Just curious, I'm an INFP 😁
5	I usually hit it off well with INFPs in a kindred spirit kind of way and we oftentimes communicate in similar methods. While I like them, most of the INFPs I know make dangerously poor choices because they believe that their idealized world is the real world and the consequences they'll suffer are their idealized ones, not the true consequences. I find them to be great friends, but without personal growth they tend to be a bit of sweet trainwreck.
2	Judging from the MBTI descriptions you sound pretty similar to us, optimism and creativity are definitely some traits I can see ESFP's gravitating to. According to socionics us and you guys are often friends in real life, although our core values and the careers we choose are mostly different and INFP/ESFP couples are rare.
2	I work with a few INFPs and you guys are just so damn nice and likeable :) Everyone needs an INFP friend
1	I love INFPs! I've had one as a partner for 13 years, so there must be something that works between our types :)\n\nI find that you're generally very caring, kind, silly, sweet and full of dreams. I think we complement each other well, and act as a good balance to each others flaws. Make a good friend out of an INFP and you'll both grow as people!
6	Do other ESFPS get along with other ESFPS?	I'm curious if we get along when I see another esfp it's another person but i don't feel like I'm always as popular as them and then just feel sad. My friends and even the esfp like me and we are friends, however I did notice when I was younger I wanted to be popular in my highschool I felt bad and wanted to be like them and was somewhat envious; but idk if that's normal. Maybe any of you guys could help explain?
6	Omg /relate 1000%! I’m so glad I am not the only one. When I see other ESFPs, they’re more popular than me, and I feel like I’m “not ESFP enough.” Thank goodness for this post.
3	I think it has a lot to do with maturity, immature ESFP's in the same setting might start viciously competing for attention, but if you're a bit wiser you'll probably give each other room to shine and not turn it into a competition. The thing about people of the same type as you is that its very easy for you to relate to them and forgive their quirks. At the same time this kind of relationship might not be stimulating enough as you're not evolving your weaker functions, so it all depends on what you're looking for.
2	My most favouritest friends are fellow ExFPs. We're goofy and loud, and always have the most entertaining conversations. Plus, they're great for on the spot improv comedy partners. All that's necessary is for both of us to put ourselves out there when we're in the same room, and sure enough we'll gravitate towards each other.
2	I love them,a lot of friends of mine are ESFPs too\nIt's like we can understand perfectly each other and we have a lot of common interests
2	Not me though, I just get quiet when there’s another one around me
2	I find other ESFPs delightful.
6	ENFP or ESFP?	I thought I was ENFP and am in the ENFP subreddit but someone commented I might be an ESFP because of all the things I want to do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n"Unemployed currently but when I get a job I aspire to save money and buy equipment to start a YouTube channel to showcase my acting and humor and writing. I also want to act, write, and direct film and TV. And write books and comics (and draw comics). And be a comedian. Maybe a talk show host. A singer in a band or solo or both. A detective. A superhero (I legitimately was studying science in college with the aim to get a genetic engineering degree and make me super). Many other things."\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have studied the functions and thought I was ENFP but now reading about ESFP and the differences between ENFP and ESFP I don't know! :O I seem to possess strong parts of both. I have strong Fi and can use Te pretty well too which are common between them but I can't figure out if I lead with Ne or Se. And as for Si or Ne I'm not sure I fully understand them to be honest.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNe:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a basically unlimited imagination. I saw a test once where you had to name 5 or 10 other things you can use a fork for (or a spoon, can't remember). I can name 10 easily. I can name 50, 100.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can think of something random like Godzilla waltzing through a city with a mop, sweeping all the people into the sea, but knowing in the prophecy this would happen dolphins built an underwater shopping mall that he people can shop and walk around in while they wait for Godzilla to die of exhaustion. Then they will rebuild their city in his bones and remember him with a traditional ceremonial needlepoint contest.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can think of a solution to any problem, 10 solutions, more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI love to read fantasy books. Regular literary books set in the "real world" seem boring to me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am always looking for new ways to do things. It sometimes is about efficiency which is very important to me because of Te but I can actually think of so many ways things can be improved or made faster, more efficient, streamlined, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSe:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll my sense are extremely keen. I'm a visual learner and I see something I can understand it instantly, as opposed to trying to read about it. I can always notice details and things no one else can, for example I always see hidden animals that no one even noticed. My ears are very sensitive to any noise and I can't sleep unless I have a fan going to block out any noise that might occur. I am a supertaster and find many things way too bitter to eat, like most vegetables and coffee, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also have always been naturally extremely gifted at any artistic endeavor. I have always been able to draw very well even as a kid and was always the kid everyone wanted to draw pictures for them. I can paint well, sculpt well, do any kind of art well without training. I can see extreme details in art and when creating art.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs you can see I am also very interested in performing arts, acting, singing, comedy, dancing, improv, etc.\n\nI also don't like philosophical conversations like "why are we here? "What is the meaning of happiness?" "What is good and evil?" Something I've been known to say is that philosophy is just mental masturbation. It goes nowhere and has no point. It's asking questions with no answers, just opinions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I'm reading and see a description I can picture it very well, extremely detailed. If someone says something like "chandelier" I can picture the chandelier in extremely detail down to the decorative metal designs. I can picture the ceiling, the windows covered in velvet drapes, the color of them the texture. I can see the whole room and all the details.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs far as focusing on the future and possibilities or the present I don't know. I don't know what I'll be doing in 5 years, 2, or even tomorrow and I like that but I still dream and imagine future careers and scenarios. I do sometimes talk about different ways the world is changing and will change in the near future. I don't often talk about people and what they doing, rumors, etc. but that may be because I have no social life (see other post about having no friends).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm lost here. What am I?
5	ESFP. Storytelling and world building are a part of the Se-Ni axis. Se does are also good at making goals, doing things and solutions tend to be very practical. 
2	head to r/MbtiTypeMe
2	as somebody who is truly 50-50 some days and other days majority one or the other....\n\ni think the easiest way i assess this is if you have all these ideas but how much to completion do you achieve? if you reach 100% more often youre an ESFP, if you reach 20% more often youre ENFP. but i can be completely wrong here haah
1	lol i got enfp 6 months  ago but now i got esfp
7	How do crushes work ???	Hey fellow ESFPs!!\n\nJust wanted some insight on how ur crushes work? I know its a very vague statement but I honestly don't know how to explain it. Do you have tons of little crushes, or fall really hard, or not like anyone? Or do you always like someone?\n\nWhat do u do with ur crush? Do u chase them or prefer them to chase u?? How do u court them???\n\nI feel a bit alone when it comes to crushes bc I feel like no one understands my thought process. Was wondering what goes thru ur heads when u have a crush.
3	Are you positive you are an ESFP? You seem to think a lot /s
10	What a Drag	INTJ here visiting the ESFP thread to see the difference.  Latest look at INTJ topics are all doom, gloom, and "Why do I suck" threads.  Here the big question is "Do we have to be the life of the party?"\n\nInteresting contrast of insecurities!  Just thought I'd mention it.  It's good to get some contrast now and again!
4	I think I (ESFP) just want to have lots of fun and since I'm not afraid of being in the spotlight, I naturally gravitate towards being the "life of the party"? \n\nIMO don't have to be the centre of everything, but it's a lot more fun like that ! All the fun stuff happens around you and thats exactly what I want from a party ! :--) 
2	ESFPs and Depression	I’m in a relationship with an ESFP, and it has been great so far (for a year and a half), up until a few months ago. I took a new job several months after we started dating, and I told her I would only take the job if she moved with me. It wasn’t a dream job, but it was a small step up. The move was hard on both of us. I hated the job when I first started, she was unemployed for 3 months, and when she got a job she hated it. Yet she wouldn’t quit. We don’t have any friends in the new place, and it’s a small town, so it’s been difficult for us to meet people. 5-6 months after the move I noticed some changes in her personality. She was no longer bubbly and enthusiastic. When we first got here and I realized I did not like the job, she was a huge support for me and said I should give it a chance, find the best in it, etc. However, when I noticed her becoming somewhat depressed, she wouldn’t listen to the same advice she gave me. And she refused to quit her job because she didn’t want to seem like a job hopper. I also suggested that she see a therapist, but she said it wasn’t that bad and she didn’t need it. She finally resigned from her job but then has gone home for a little while to “get help” and have some “time and space.” I’m just so confused over her reasoning for doing this the way she did. \n\nAs I see it, our situation here is very simple: she hated her job, and we have no friends here. That’s a very dark place for an ESFP to be. Why didn’t she take my suggestions to quit sooner and look for other jobs? I’ve asked her if she wants to break up, and she says no, but at the same time she won’t let me help her. It’s like there’s a wall around her emotions (fear, insecurity, whatever) that she won’t let me break down. Is this a coping mechanism? Or could she be incredibly hurt from some past experience?\n\nESFPs, please help me understand what is going on inside of her head. What is she hoping to accomplish? I just want to help, but I don’t know how if she won’t let me in. How does an ESFP in distress want to be treated? Should I ignore her, or should I be persistent?
6	She didn't want to hold you back so she decided to make the move with you because that's the condition you set for taking the job. \n\nNow she's having a tough time fitting in and doesn't like her situation. \n\nMaybe she doesn't want to upset you: from her perspective, it might be that you'll think she's flip flopping and being whiny by first agreeing to move with you, then not having a good time. \n\nMaybe she's prideful and stubborn and mad at herself: "I agreed to move with him but this place fucking sucks, but I'll make it work because damnit it was my decision, and if I quit I admit I was wrong." \n\nMaybe she's mad/resentful at you: "I never really wanted to move here. I thought it would end up okay for me, so I only agreed because it would make him happy and fulfilled. I ended up making a sacrifice I didn't forsee making at the time and now I resent him for putting me in a position where I'd be selfish to say no to the move."\n\nBased on how she's behaving toward you, my money is on something like the third.  
2	Are you ambitious/goal oriented or do you mostly just enjoy the moment?	
1	I am ambitious about the things I am passionate about! When that is involved, I make goals. I usually enjoy the moment though. 
3	My woes as an ESFP	Hey everyone! Do any of my fellow ESFPs struggle with getting to know people? Like your personality coming off too strong? I love to entertain people and sometimes I think new people can take it the wrong way or they don’t take me seriously. I’m a people pleaser and I’ve been frustrated recently because I feel that people think I’m weird or immature. Thanks for letting me rant!
7	I feel the same exact way! When I find someone I think of as interesting I want to throw all my energy in impressing them and becoming their friend but it always back fires on me. I feel like I come on too strong and overshare to the point where they feel uncomfortable.
1	Yep, can relate. I can relate to everything you said as well as the comments.
5	Are ESFPs always the life of the party or is that just a sterotype	Because I do like being with people but I don’t throw myself in the spotlight and I’m never the life of the party like ever. Lol\n\n*reads this subreddit’s description*\n\nDoes that make me an isfp or something \n\nBecause that sterotype is spread around literally everywhere, just search esfp on literally everywhere and you’ll see what I mean. It’s ridiculous 
9	Nah I've found that stereotype is rarely true... I'm an ESFP and definitely an extrovert in other ways, but being in the spotlight? No thanks.
5	I definitely like being in the spotlight if that’s what being the life of the party means. I dont really care if people get on board tho, I’ll have my own fun within the party. Sometimes some people will follow but most of the time I’m an outsider at parties. Being the life of the party as in leading the party sounds much more like a Fe thing to me.
2	I don't think so because I don't like parties because too many introverts smoking pot there and I don't like drugs they're lame. But I do love hanging out with friends and talking about my life and what I did! 
1	Well i mean i am not bragging but i have been told i am at parties please don’t take this thinking i am bragging 
2	I created an ESFP playlist!	Give it a follow :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://open.spotify.com/user/yungcharlotte/playlist/6vOzIg8wj3gloXltEdwUsd?si=7VDRvhVDS6CnWlRfghKEuQ](https://open.spotify.com/user/yungcharlotte/playlist/6vOzIg8wj3gloXltEdwUsd?si=7VDRvhVDS6CnWlRfghKEuQ)
1	Yo, this is pretty solid. Thanks! 
1	9/10 not enough rivers Cuomo. Seriously tho this isn't my personality but I just have closed my off to one band one genre and that's Weezer. Idk why but accidentally have become a fan of jet and Locksley along with Lilly allen
3	ESFP much??	* Highly aware of my surroundings, have quick reflexes\n* Love to show off, but never exaggerate or make shit up\n* Set high standards for myself and those around me, hate mediocrity\n* Conflict-averse(might have more to do with my upbringing), but never kiss ass or hesitate to disagree with someone\n* Never been into sports or cared about winning in sports, otherwise pretty competitive\n* To the point, hate people who ramble instead of saying exactly what they mean, see rambling as an intellectual weakness\n* Pretty good at taking (constructive)criticism, don't care about flattering\n* Sentimental about things, not so much about people \n* Very hedonistic and into money\n* Love superficial social interaction, otherwise quite secretive\n* Mostly form opinions on my own, without thinking out loud or needing someone else to bounce ideas off of\n* Wasn’t good at school, hated doing anything related to it. Sucked at math and chemistry, but knew languages better than anyone else\n* Understand languages more intuitively, having a gut feeling for what is suitable for a specific context\n* Been pursuing the same artistic career since 14(in my early 20’s now) and never had second thoughts about picking it\n* Always been creative and into finding alternative ways of combining things\n* Like “fun” art and see most “serious”/“dramatic” art as pretentious and pseudointellectual, especially if its trying to force morals on you\n* Love debating, but like winning debates more than reaching a truth\n* Despite that I've grown tired of debating politics, religion and philosophy, see it as pointless and not satisfying\n* Optimistic\n\nWent from ENTP to ESTP and now I'm wondering if ESFP sounds more like my type lol What do yall think?
3	I don’t like debating at all but besides that you sound very me so yeah
1	Sounds a lot like me aside from the knowing what I want to do in life, career-wise!
1	I can see it with the exception of accepting criticism. Most ESFP’s I know (including myself) want to impress others and can sometimes take criticism harshly. 
1	The first bulletpoint sounds like a copy-and-pastied Se dom trait lol
1	Wow this is so me, except i don't enjoy debating!
1	MBTI & Music Survey (Redesign) - Need respondents!	 I created an initial version of this survey a few days ago, but after receiving feedback and reviewing many of the responses, I restructured it to increase accuracy, depth, and easier data analysis. Even if you've already taken the previously posted survey, please take this new one as well.\n\nThis is a survey searching for correlation between MBTI and musical interests such as genres, instruments, singing, dance, and composition/production. Once I get a descent amount of responses, I will post the results in [r/mbti](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti) (unless r/esfp would like me to post them here as well). I've created individual surveys for each of the 16 personality types, and the one below is SPECIFICALLY for ESFPs.\n\nThe ESFP survey link:\n\n [https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JRX6V2G](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JRX6V2G) \n\n​\n\nIf you are not an ESFP please find the correct link for your type here:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/9a6hbw/mbti\_music\_survey\_redesign\_need\_respondents/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/9a6hbw/mbti_music_survey_redesign_need_respondents/)\n\n​\n\nThanks for your responses! As I said previously, I will post the results and analysis in [r/mbti](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti) once the survey is completed.
1	Done!
1	r/ESFP seems rather dead. I filled in your survey, however. I hope it's not too late.
2	NE in ESFPs.	Haven't found a lot of pages talking about this, so I figured it was high time for me to make one.  \n\n\nSo, recently reevaluating myself after coming off of my SSRIs, I realized the reason I started taking them in the first place; my true and utter hatred of Extraverted Intuition.  \n\n\nNow, while I think Ne CAN be useful, and don't think it is a function that should be wiped off the face of the planet, I find myself shockingly antagonistic whenever I'm having to deal with it. For instance, when I'm hungry, I HATE it when 15-20 minutes are spent talking about ALL the possible places to eat in the area instead of just picking something that sounds tasty and then going; in other words, when Extraverted Intuition is unregulated by any judging function and allowed to run amok.  \n\n\nBeing an action/fantasy/sci-fi writer, I have been extremely envious of those capable of using Ne to generate fresh, new ideas (rather than doing what I do and recycling old ideas and then changing details so that they seem fresh). When I actively TRY to use Extraverted Intuition to generate a 'new idea', it often comes across as half-baked. However, whenever I go through being moody and insecure, my brain just naturally sets off on an unanchored journey through intuition-land; when this happens, I entirely disassociate and start to exhibit symptoms of Borderline personality disorder, jumping to conclusions, panicking, suddenly feeling like my identity and sense of self is being threatened by all the possibilities, what I COULD be.   \n\n\nIn one online source (forgot the link; sorry!), I read that Demonic Ne in ESxPs tends to manifest as "confusing possibilities for realities" or "jumping to conclusions". Many, MANY people over the years have accused me of "jumping to conclusions", and I myself in recent years have noticed I have a tendency to confuse people's "might be" with "is/will be", because with sensing there is often an "is" and an "isn't", and so I don't operate well on ambiguity.  \n\n\nHow about you guys? How does your Demonic Ne manifest?
2	Hey. INFP here. My ESFP cousins best friends are 2 INFPs and an ENFP. And honestly I often get annoyed with the whole question of where to go at because I'm just like "Who cares? Good food is good food. Let's stop wasting an hour choosing which place to go and let's just go somewhere." I also get annoyed with people when they can't choose which movie to watch or something. End up spending so much time tryna find which movie to watch we don't have time to watch it. This is all super annoying. \n\nBut you know what? I find INFJs actually have more of this problem than ENxPs. I think it's an inferior Se that causes it and not Dom Ne. Ne usually doesn't care where they get it from, or they are really set on one specific place for some reason. 
1	Mine manifests when someone either backs me into a corner or uses physical force against me.
1	Interesting! I'm an INFP with an ESFP partner and find our Ne-Se goes together well. His brainstorming tends to be more grounded in reality and mine more random - it's good when I have unrealistic ideas and he can do a reality check on them. We both like sitting and chilling and brainstorming ideas for fun. \n\nThere are times when I can relate to you when I ask what we can eat and he's so easygoing he doesn't have a preference. I feel best when he's being a decisive boss and I just follow him around. :) But I see that as separate to MBTI and more of a relationship dynamic thing.\n\nI can't think of any examples where he jumps to conclusions *scratches head* Usually that's me! I'm the one with demonic Ne 😂
4	ESFPs, how do you act when drunk?	I posted a similar question to my own subreddit a while ago and received a somewhat common response that due to functions switching, drunk INTJ’s act like ESFP’s. \n\nSo that line of thinking (and curiosity) leads me here. \n\nHow do you behave when you’ve had a few drinks?
4	For myself I become more interested in the lives of those around me. I become increasingly more in tune with their emotions and how I can help.
2	Depends how drunk. When reasonably drunk I become more affable, and quite good at being « fake », something I’m really bad at sober. So I hop from convo to convo telling people what they want to hear, which sometimes involves really big lies like being a professional snowboarder or having lived 10 years in Cambodia. They’re not lies I regret afterwards, they’re mostly really fun and the people get really excited listening to me. When I’m very drunk it exacerbates my egocentrism, which makes me even more compulsive, and I lose sight almost completely of others’ feelings. I can be provocative and manipulative. Not in a mean way tho.
2	I hold better conversations when I'm drunk. And I feel more love from others and also feel that people are paying even more attention to me. Also, I laugh ALOT.
1	I become very quiet, I tend to hyper analize all the things I'm going to say and I end up being very shy. 
1	very inappropriate dancing, cuddling with people, crying pretty easily. talking to strangers becomes super easy. also acting out of character i guess, like kissing a random (1x when i was suuuper drunk). otherwise i guess just like a normal party person having fun :--) i dont tend to think much drinking or not so its all just tumbleweeds in my head
2	What are some sure signs that someone is ESFP and not ISFP? Vice versa?	
3	ISFP has this more laid back feel vs ESFP imo. Like while ESFPs are more of the “LETS DO THIS LETS GO LETS TRY THIS NEW EXPERIENCE” feel, ISFPs are more selective when it comes to what they want to do, like a “hmm I think I’ll try this instead” vibe\n\n

2	hi ! curious	hey new redditor here so sorry if i sound rly out of place bhahaa\n\nanyways i was wondering if its normal to have a dramatic personality shift ?? i took the test about 4 years ago and i was an INFP but ive been taking and retaking it for the past year and im defos an ESFP now. \n\ndid this happen to any other ESFP ppl ? bc sometimes i question whether i am really myself or whether im happy or if im not the same person anymore. ive only really started looking at this stuff recently and the impression i'm getting is that people view ESFP as shallow and fake which is kind of upsetting bc i worry about whether i've lost my depth or not... \n\ni've probably changed bc i was really unhappy socially (i had 0 social skills) and just started putting myself more out there. does this also mean that i was originally an ESFP to begin with? how do these things work?\n\neducate me ! :) 
1	The short answer is no. First off I’d like to remind you that the test can be VERY inaccurate. \n\nWhat I find funny is INFP’s and ESFP’s are two very different people. \n\nThere are a couple reasons for the different results... \n\n1.  You are an ESFP but maybe you were lacking social skills because you weren’t confident or had low self esteem so you weren’t as social as you were now and hence got a different answer\n\n2 You are actually an INFP and are just better at socialising now and hence got mistyped\n\n3. You are none of the above and you’ve been mistyped twice \n\nI’d recommended posting something on  r/MBTITypeMe to a second opinion on your type :) 
1	For what it’s worth, when I first found out about mbti I typed myself as an INFP. Right now I’m more or less sure that I am an ESFP, it’s just that back then I was an unhealthy ESFP with a poor understanding of MBTI. I did go through a pretty major shift in the perception I have of myself between then and now.
1	Probably you mistyped in the beginning. Don't worry about questioning whether you are really yourself/happy/same person or not - I can't speak for others but sometimes these thoughts do come to me.\n\n> the impression i'm getting is that people view ESFP as shallow and fake which is kind of upsetting bc i worry about whether i've lost my depth or not... \n\nThat's what people view - it's just a stereotype. Other people can think that ESFPs are shallow/fake/party animals etc but ultimately they aren't ESFPs themselves, who are they to know what we are like internally anyway.\n\nAnyway if you are interested in ESFP and all, you can go read on cognitive functions! 
5	Lmao idk what to write here - I’m just bored	Hello fellow ESFPs how have you guys been? Just curious lol
4	Drunk AF atm. What uphomes
5	Sup I’m also bored lol. Altho I’m mostly frustrated right now cause my dog wont poop

3	Understanding ESFP girlfriend	Hey everyone, I'm an ISFJ and need help understanding my ESFP girlfriend.\n\nWe've been together for 2 months, lately she's seemingly grown distant, stopped calling me with the nickname she gave me, to the point where I felt like she didn't want me to kiss her (so I didn't).\n\nYesterday night she told me she feels that telling me she loves me was too "reckless".\n\nI don't understand. Any help?
10	I had the same experience with an ESFP. I could be wrong but I think they live so much in the moment that they are sensitive to any changes in their feelings and don’t see a relationship in such a linear way. So I imagine, for you, your time with her has been part of forming a history and foundation for your relationship, and you are on a pretty stable timeline of progression. However, for her, she’s likely living it day-to-day and riding the emotional/sensory waves without feeling as invested in a future or progressing things in a certain direction. Once the “honey moon” phase ends, I think ESFPs start questioning and doubting pretty hard.\n\nSo if she’s not in tune with what she REALLY wants, those daily fluctuations in emotions will be difficult for her to understand and make her question the relationship. ESFPs enjoy interacting with people so much that they can easily find value in dating almost anyone it seems but an immature ESFP won’t always know what they really, truly want in someone long-term or what’s good for them. If she’s unsure, she may start fearing that she’s over committed and missing out on other experiences. She is probably aware of how unpredictable her feelings are and she’s afraid of hurting you so she’s backtracking and trying to manage expectations. \n\nThis could be her realizing she’s not really in it anymore and it’s not what she wants. Or, she’s just dealing with all these fears and needs to soul search more to figure out what she really wants. 
4	I’m sorry man but i think that means she doesn’t feel that way about you anymore maybe something happened I don’t know what to say other than that sorry 
2	It sounds like she's having second thoughts about the relationship
1	From the perspective of an ESFP guy who is dating an INFJ, I have often started to wonder if we should really be together anymore. I haven’t been as crazy lately as usual & since we aren’t in school all the hype people gave us for dating finally isn’t there & since I like hype and adventures it all seems to be getting a little dull. Here’s what ESFP’s need to realize, Life will have dull moments. I sadly have to realize that too & I’m sure she is denying that fact because she wants a stimulating experience just I do, however that will not always be the case. Let her know that & that you are here with her for the long haul. If she realizes even through her doubts of not having the hype that you will remain constant in her life, it might work it’s way to her emotions & she’ll realize that it is time to enjoy life even when it’s not as fun as other times. \n\nAllow her to be creative when hanging out with you to help her give y’all a new experience.\n\n1. Go to the fridge & let her know that she has to come up with a dish with ONLY the stuff you can find in there & you’ll help her make it!\n\n2. Make a stop @ 3 different fast food restaurants & pick up one item from each then take her to a park & either race to finish the food fastest or eat it casually & see who can find more blue cars or red cars first!
1	2 months isnt long at all. This has definitely happened to me (I am the one that grows distant after things seemingly are all good). It just dawns on me that the other person is not what I want. It is def getting over the initial honeymoon phase of having someone elses company...usually that'll take me a week or two. Lol. I move on from ppl quickly tho.\n\nTbh she's over it. Be glad you were only together 2 months not 2 years.

1	I'm already there! 
4	Hey can you guys explain how se manifests in esfps like I’m 5? Thanks	
5	Oh for a moment there I thought you really meant you were 5 XD\n\nNevertheless ...\n\nYou are very observant! You will see things and notice things that the adults don't see! Things like incidences on the street, anything out of the ordinary -or if someone suddenly but subtly decided to dress differently one day. You will notice if something is wrong, or different or out of place, and it will give you a kind of sixth sense, much like Sherlock Holme's deductional superpowers. Still, you tend to notice things that specifically interest you -like cars, maybe, if you're into cars. Or fashion, if you're into fashion.\n\nYou have boundless energy. They say it is a stereotype, but it is true. You're capable of doing at least four times as much as the average person, although, at your own discretion, and in your own messy, chaotic way. Things just get done out of the sheer force of your boundless enthusiasm. And if it hasn't been done, it will get done, eventually, after you've done these other ten things that you're excited about. And that other thing that suddenly came up. Because why not.\n\n\-unless you're depressed. Or at home most of the time. In which case you might want to go out there and get some help.\n\nYou tend to be very popular, and simply attract people and followers, without even trying, and just by being yourself. For ESFPs, I think this adage is true -You do you.
3	Can you help me understand you better?	Hey, so my mom, my roommate, my best friend, and my ex-boyfriend are all ESFPs.As you can see, I'm sort of drawn to you guys. And for good reason of course!\n\nI was wondering if someone could try to explain ESFP stackings and how it affects your experiences and decisions in everyday life. Something along those lines.\n\nThanks!\n\nEdit: formatting mistake
6	i'm an infj, engaged to an esfp and i'd love to know the answer as well!
4	Basically we are v observant and we are mostly patient until you really step over the line into something v offensive to us. And well we can plan stuff and all but it’s not a priority bc going w the flow is much easier lol. Also pls don’t go into theory bc it’s boring for my brain (I don’t like to process stuff like that) \n\nYeah that’s about it\n\n
3	But it’s Friday...
2	Throw us a party and tell us we’re pretty. 
3	Music and personality data gathering (5 minute survey)	Hello all, if you are interested, I created a survey regarding Mbti type and music preferences. It's just for fun, but I am curious to see the results. I personally don't expect to see a huge difference between types, but who knows! It'll only take a few minutes, so please check it out.\n\nI will be posting results after all the data has been compiled.\nhttps://goo.gl/forms/wgMY0z9LvWmN0NY23\n\n***Edit: I will be closing the test to do data stuff at 2pm CT on Sunday, August 5. Sorry if you didn't get it a chance to take the test. Look for the results post in a day or two.***
3	Politics	Hi fellow ESFPS just wondering what are y’alls political beliefs? 
8	TBH I don’t really care enough to have an opinion 
4	Seize the means of production for the workers, install a dictatorship of the proletariat, and let the the streets run red with the blood of capitalists.\n\nI would say I lean a little left.
3	Im not a very political person but I believe political diversity + variety in beliefs is important for new perspectives and ideas. \n\nI'm probably in the middle/right leaning bc I dont agree with a lot of viewpoints on the left especially PC culture, but I do respect their opinions bc it comes from a good place in their hearts. I think that u just need to be more practical when it comes to implementing ideas bc stuff in theory often doesnt work irl, eg Socialism. \n\nhowever i know that everyone only wants the best for everyone so I respect everyones opinions as long as it is justifiable ! :) 
5	I'm a Trump supporter. I'm pro economy, I think if people have jobs, and a fair shot at making a living, everything else will flow from that. I am against high taxes like in belgium where they start the first tax bracket at 40%. I'm pro immigration and believe in diversity of sexual orientation, ethnicity, culture, and free exchange of ideas, but closed borders and limited immigration from terror hotbeds and cartel dominated countries. Defensive violence is worth it in the short term to solve certain problems in foreign policy, but not worth risking war with nuclear powered nations. We should all sanction China collectively and hit them with tarrifs. I'm anti political correctness, anti media, anti current education system. I believe in Climate change, its a long term problem we need to fix, I'm supportive of banning straws and not driving to help the environment, but I don't think its the government's job to save the planet, I think that burden's on all of us as individuals. Companies should want to act ethically, not be forced to by regulations that don't work and are sometimes a scam. Pro abortion, women should decide, I'm in favor of more women in power, and not just in times of crisis (see the Glass Cliff). I'm in favor of giving equal opportunities to both genders, and I realize men are favored in many industries, workplace harrassment is a serious problem, and women have it tough.\n\nI'm basically a centrist liberal who can't tolerate Late Night Shows where Trevor Noah grandstands and lectures me, teachers who used to tell me about the gender pay gap myth as if to say if a man and a woman get hired for the same job in America, he will be paid more initially if they are both equal, journalists who write clickbait garbage like Gawker, and its made me upset, so I would rather join the Right and attempt to reform the negative elements and bring them closer to center, than to waste my time with the insane left who scare me with their bullying of Trump supporters.
1	(Cross-post) Temperament and Humor (All over 14 Welcome)	 Hello! I recently posted a survey you might find interesting. It would really help me out if you would participate!\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/SampleSize/comments/92ynz1/academic\_temperament\_and\_humor\_all\_over\_14\_welcome/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SampleSize/comments/92ynz1/academic_temperament_and_humor_all_over_14_welcome/)
1	How do you get an ESFP GF to forgive you?	ENTP HERE.\nIt wasn't really your fault, but she had to blame someone and you were the nearest person in the wrong place and wrong time. I could rationalize with her but she refuses to see me?\n\nWhat's the best way to make an esfp forgive you?\n
6	Funny!  My husband is an ENTP and I am an ESFP.  Open up about your feelings for her, tell her you love her and don't hold back.  We love that.  Entp's can really struggle meeting our emotional needs, but you guys do really fascinate us.  When you open up, it's super sexy.  Esfp's typically forgive really easy if you meet her emotions not her logic.  Do not approach this logically.  Tough, I know!!  Good luck! 
1	Well i can’t help you there because tho i am an ESFP i wouldn’t blame someone who was there at the wrong place and the wrong time
3	Hey, do you ESFPs struggle with this too or am I actually an ISFP?	I love being with people and being invited out to stuff, I’d always choose going out to staying home alone, but yet I’m shy to approach people. Crowds aren’t a problem for some reason, but when I’m like sitting on the bus for example, or in the waiting room, I can’t seem strike up a conversation with anyone. They’re sitting across the room and I’m just like “wow geez this is awkward as shit, I really want to talk to them but I can’t, oh shit they just glanced at me, I need to say something and hope they’re welcoming.” I’m sitting there feeling self conscious, I’d like to talk to them but I can’t find a way to do it, and I’m scared I’m going to be awkward and stuttery about it, I’m pretty sure this is just basic ass social anxiety but Idk I want your thoughts. Is this common for introverts or am I just fucking myself?
1	It's not really common for introverts (INTJ here), but it could be your Fi acting up. Now is it primary or secondary, I'd need more info. I know my Fi friend had the same problem except she didn't wanto to talk to anyone, but felt like she had to because what if they wanna talk but they're too shy? \n\nMy boyfriend is an ESFP and from my knowledge this doesn't happen to him, although he will easily strike up a conversation in an awkward situation (usually saving me). I think it's just anxiety though, but it doesn't sound so bad?
1	I do this all the time. I think I’m getting better at it tho 
1	You might be more isfp??  I don't struggle with initiating convos but I do get exhausted from groups.  You might be like me in that you are almost equal extrovert and introvert??  I'm only 57% extroverted so sometimes my introverted side will be powerful and other times I'm all extrovert.  Hope I'm explaining this right.  I'm too flighty to edit hahahaha
1	Nah you can be an esfp at heart but have social anxiety issues.

5	Holy shit, this is gold. Thank you 
1	This is so cool. And has helped me take action when necessary even when I fear the results of it. Thanks for posting this.
8	“When in an authority position, an esfp considers himself/herself part of the team that gets the job done together, and never power hungry. ESFPs like to make the environment as relaxed and enjoyable as possible.”	Do you agree?
5	Yes \n\n\nA good example is how ESFPs have the ability to empathize with people on a very deep level. With that said, they can make the most of that skill when the person or people they are interacting with are relaxed and level-headed.
1	Currently transitioning into my first legit boss leadership role and finding this very true. I don't bark orders, I want to collaborate and discuss everything. Get my teams views, preferences, and suggest pathways. I want everyone engaged and supporting what we do instead of just doing what I say bc I'm in charge. It's good in terms of I feel like ppl are supporting my style of leadership and like me (I know I know it's not all a popularity contest😋) but I fear when the day comes I gotta play the boss card, will I still have their support? Do they respect me? Or just like me?
3	ESFP Stereotypes	What are some cliches you hear from people about ESFPs? \n\nWe’re deemed as party people who know how to stay wild but most of the ESFPs I know are relatively reserved compared to some of the descriptions I’ve read from other people. I feel like a lot of people (myself included) look down on ESFPs because we’re TOO loose and party too much. 
6	An ESFP sterotype I hear everywhere is “all ESFPs have unlimited energy and they’re always the center of attention in a group setting” blah blah blah. I can be pretty shy at times and sometimes if I’m in a group of people I don’t know sometimes I can’t find really find much to contribute to the conversation. So I wouldn’t say that sterotype is always true.\n\nAs for the wild partying ESFP sterotype that’s even portrayed right in this sub’s header and description, I don’t necessarily agree with that. I don’t mind parties, but they’re not my main goal in life like some tumblr posts make it out to be. I’m never really “the life of the party.” I love being with people, but I don’t crave attention 24/7 and throw myself in the spotlight all the time. 
3	Click this post to take a survey on sexuality comparisons among MB types. The survey's on sex, so it ranges from your views on sex to your preferences/kinks. Totally anonymous, all questions are optional. No essays. Only takes about 15 mins. I'll share the results :)	
3	Too introverted to be ESFP, too extraverted to be ISFP	(And no I’m not ENFP)\n\nAny key traits that will help define the difference? Thx 
7	The difference is just if you value new experiences or your personal values more. ESFPs want Se experiences— new things, interesting things, and to have fun as their top priority in life. ISFPs only want to express themselves and experience new things that are aligned with who they are, what feels right. 
3	No matter your Myers Briggs type, each person is still an individual and will lean more or less towards each side.\n\nI'm a little bit more extroverted, meaning I lean more towards ESFP. But my "E" is weaker than some other people. \n\nYou might be close to 50/50 E/I.
2	my understanding is the the e/i comes from where you receive your energy. Do you generally get energized during social situations?

13	This is how I feel about being alone | Can y’all relate?	I honestly don’t mind it. I’m not going out of my way to be alone, and I’d much rather not be, but if I absolutely have to be alone in my room all day because no one is available or some other circumstance is preventing me from going out, I don’t mind it.\n\nI’m not the kind of person who goes outside to play sports or wanders around the house aimlessly or ‘ADHD-ishly.’ I don’t get restless when I’m alone. I don’t mind just relaxing in bed watching funny vines or interesting YouTube videos. I stay in one spot doing things on my phone or computer and the time just flies right by. If I don’t have any internet or any computer/phone, I will sleep the day away, also killing time because I would get super bored if I had to stay awake the whole day doing nothing in a room. \n\nI have to admit though, as much as I don’t mind being alone for long periods of time, it makes me a bit feel groggy and unaccomplished and sometimes irritable. It’s easy to forget about it when I’m laying around playing fortnite or something, but when I get back out there it’s like “damn I missed so much” and my head feels cloudy. This actually might be unrelated to this topic all together and it’s happening because I’m staying in one place for a long time and I’m just making a foolish mess out of myself, but whatever, I’m just sharing this to see if any ESFPs or any other type for that matter experiences this too. \n\nOn the other hand though, when I’m spending the day with my friends and riding around in the car and doing stuff, I don’t feel cloudy and weighed down like I do when I step out of my room after being alone for a day. I feel much clearer and less like a fat slob. Like I said, probably completely unrelated to mbti but I just felt the need to share this.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?
3	Yes, exactly the same for me. I dont mind entertaining myself at all, but over the course of a day or two I feel off somehow. I'm glad you posted this because I always see people thinking ESFPs can't stand time alone. 
2	This is how I feel 100% of the time. I’d say this definitely has to do with MBTI
2	A bit late to the thread haha, but absolutely, I can relate to everything except that I do get restless if I find myself lazing around too much, and I get an urge to put myself in a different environment, so I usually go for a walk. I definitely appreciate being alone and the serenity in it, but I definitely feel happier and more energized when I've spent time with friends.
1	I can relate to this, but I'm INTJ. Maybe that doesn't have to do with MBTI. If I spend too much time, like max 2 days, outside the comfort of my personal space, I get stressed and I need to stop everything I'm doing and just go home and not talk or see anyone for at least a day.
1	ESFP here. Whether related to mbti or not, I can definitely identify with this. There’s a fine line for me on having alone time. After a certain point (usually a day max), I go from feeling reenergized to feeling isolated and lonely. If I’m in a “mindful” headspace, I can usually sense a weird gut feeling telling me to get out of my apartment ASAP. If there’s no one to hang out with, I’ll take a walk outside and even that alone does wonders!
1	I relate to this especially for feeling unaccomplished. 
3	Thoughts on ENFPs	I'm an ENFP man with a crush on an ESFP woman. I was wondering how you guys see us and if this combo would work 
6	As an ESFP female who has dated a couple ENFP males, I think this combination actually works quite well. Definitely better than expected. Lots of fun and spontaneity.
3	It's a No from me. 
1	I'd say ENFPs probably have good chances with ESFPs. Hope it works out!
1	As a ENFP. In my opinion it depends how open you are to make facts a "priority".  In addition  for them to discuss and accept your pattern recognition abilities, trust in your insights, use them to help make decisions. If they understand your thinking style it could work great. \n\nI can easily get along with ESFPs and enjoy their energy, their ability to "adapt and overcome". Although  too much of raw data without speculating about its "meaning" kinda sucks. Or being looked at as unimportant.\n\nGood luck
1	I'm dating an enfp
6	Can someone please explain the difference between Dom Fi and Aux Fi?	I’m trying to figure out if I’m esfp or isfp.\n\nThank you!
4	Here are my experiences with ESFP and me as Fi dom:\n\nThe ESFP I know is far more likely to have their attention pointed outwards in the world. Their focus is on what's happening, what's around them, what their friends are up to, finding fun things to look at and do. If they go quiet and I ask what they're thinking, often they say they're not thinking about anything at all, kind of like they're naturally meditating.\n\nThis is from an ISFP profile: "they take this time for introspection, assessing their principles". I think this is one area where Fi dom shows itself - more conscious attention is pointed inwards, such as reflecting on values and consciously thinking about them. The mind's eye of an introvert spends more time inwards.\n\nIt's not that the ESFP I know is never reflective because they are, it's just not as much of a part of daily life. They can have lots of busy days with not much time to think and still be really happy. Once they said a good amount of time alone for them to recharge is 1 afternoon a month and I found that amazing! They can be happy spending all day with lots of people and all evening with more people. They have so much social energy. Another thing is that they get really lively and energized in groups of people, the bigger the group the more lively.\n\nBut I really see the Se-dom the most in how much of their focus is outwards most of the time, and how happy it makes them to be that way.
2	INFJ here...	I'm 28 (female) and started dating a 35 (male) ESFP in January.. I have never dated someone so passionate or emotional. He has been sheltered and privileged most of his life... He lived at home and was upset when I met him about his parents divorcing last year when I met him.. He hasnt worked in over 7 years or so.. He was agorophobic for 8 years when he was in his 20's. We fought the first time we met., but more in a way of him asking me questions and testing me in a way. I am recentlty divorced and lived a very diff life than he has.. I've always had two jobs.. my own house.. relied on myself. But even though we are so opposite we had this attraction.. Everything moved very fast and once we realized we liked each other he started staying over every night and now here we are 5 months later and its still going. Sometimes he is brutally honest which I like but I'm still getting used to his personality. He complains about certain things I do or don't do.. I'm not used to affection at all from my previous relationship that it almost feels taboo to me. I love that he is so affectionate but I forget that I need to be more touchy feely with him. What can I do more as an INFJ to make him more happy?
2	Hello there INFJ! \n\nI am actually an ESFP (Male, 20) dating an INFJ (Female, 21) & I have a couple of suggestions for you.  \n\n1. Provide a new experience for them. (Find something exciting or creative to go & then something creative to do once you are there & that will feed into their extroversion & adventurous side. They will also start to attribute that good memory with you. So the more you do that, the more they will associate fun times with you.\n\n2. Give them attention. Whether that’s making eye contact with them or following along with their ramble story, they will feed off of that and the story or themselves will get crazier & crazier. \n\n3. Communicate to them that you enjoy when they show love to you. Regardless of what their love language is, although most ESFP’s are Physical Touch, they will want to show their love language to you. They will want to hug & kiss you. They will want to constantly compliment you & send love letters. They will want to do creative tasks for you that will benefit you. They will want to buy you cheesy cute things. That will all depend on their interests. \n\nIf you need any more suggestions, I can do some more thinking, but off the top of my head that’s what I came to the conclusion. 🚀🤪😊
1	Thank you soooo much!! I will try these things and see if it works. I really appreciate it :)
7	Mbti ESFP vs Socionics ESFP	#**MBTI**\n\nI’m very sure about being ESFP. I relate to most of the descriptions, I made a couple of type me posts [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/8dxs0c/yet_another_type_me_post/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/8hy2xz/type_me_questionnaire/) and got ESFP pretty consistently. I also feel like I line up with the esfp functions (mostly). I know for sure I have fi and inferior ni and the Se description doesn’t sound too off (apart from being physically graceful lmao). I considered ENFP and ISFJ at one point during this confusing mess but they don’t match nearly as much as ESFP does. \n\nHere are some Mbti ESFP descriptions that resonate with me: \n\n> ESFP is definitely a spontaneous, optimistic individual. They love to have fun. If the ESFP has not developed their Thinking side by giving consideration to rational thought processing, they tend to become over-indulgent, and place more importance on immediate sensation and gratification than on their duties and obligations. They may also avoid looking at long-term consequences of their actions.\n\n> The ESFP is a great team player. He or she is not likely to create any problems or fuss, and is likely to create the most fun environment possible for getting the task done.\n\n> Utterly social, ESFPs enjoy the simplest things, and there’s no greater joy for them than just having fun with a good group of friends.\n\n> There’s nothing that makes ESFPs feel quite as unhappy as realizing that they are boxed in by circumstance, unable to join their friends.\n\n> ESFPs sometimes ignore and avoid conflict entirely. They tend to say and do what’s needed to get out of such situations, then move on to something more fun.\n\n> #**Authority and social status are secondary to feeling like they’re an important part of a team that gets the job done.**\n\n> Sounds like a great idea! They don’t even care where they are going, as long as they get to hang out with friends and have a good time.\n\n> ESFPs hold values of sympathy, tactfulness and care toward their peers. ESFPs can appear casual, flexible and easy-going, but when they feel something or someone they value has been slighted, they will stand firm and stubborn.\n\n> Se-doms can be emotionally triggered in a variety of ways, such as: being judged as immature or superficial or incompetent, feeling that others doubt the legitimacy of their talents or achievements, not receiving positive feedback for their work, being criticized when they have put out a lot of effort, spending too much time with overly serious or impractical people, working with inflexible/cynical/uncooperative/incompetent people, being pressured to make long term commitments, being pressured into making decisions that can have a major impact on future developments, feeling as though alternatives or options are being closed off, being forced to work in excessively structured environments, enduring rigid routines or procedural work for long periods, feeling pressured to conform to other people’s rules or schedules, tight deadlines or onerous supervision, feeling a lack of stimulation or variety, feeling disorganized or mentally clouded, feeling unable to solve problems quickly and efficiently, being overwhelmed by too many duties or a heavy workload.\n\n\n\n#**SOCIONICS**\n\nNow that I’m sure I’m not mistyped in mbti, I went on to read some of the socionics descriptions and see what it had to say about ESFPs. \n\nI found a whole ton of crap like \n\n> SEE – ESFp – Napoleon (Leader)\n> The SEE is characterized by the drive to expand his influence, by the desire of authority and glory. In order to realize these goals it is necessary to learn how to control people, by manipulating their weaknesses and avoiding their strengths so as to never be conquered.\n\n>  Se doms tend to use the physical aspect of power to sway others. This includes but is not limited to intimidation, gaslighting, persistence, among others. Some dial up the charm, knowing that a lot of ppl respond to easy going ppl sometimes more drastically than the intimidation route. These are the aw shucks types that seem to always be down to do things with others, hoping their charm will convince others to comply.\n\n> "I - the most powerful man in the world, rookie." \n> It is very self-confident in their own abilities, he believes that can do everything. Often the impression voluntarist: I think it's right, then it should be good for everyone. It produces an impression of a strong man, he seemed to always have enough space around, "like a bull in a china shop." If he is physically strong, that despises "wimps", if the opposite is weak, then all athletes - "redneck". Often good handle money, but these issues are either too conservative or too cocky. Life is perceived through the prism of power "who is who". In order to be heard by them, you need to force yourself to respect in any way. Any weakness of man perceived as a disadvantage, so often they can use it, not seeing anything wrong. Always do something, developing skills. Usually, their strength is visible to the naked eye, but it lacks flexibility, rather it is something monumental and conservative. Always try to be just the first in any case, if this does not work, something very angry. If their strength and ability to question, it should also be a flash of aggression. Potentially - excellent athletes, but a constant re-evaluation of their own forces is fraught with injuries. Preaches the cult of power and skill, confident in their external data. It asserts its exclusivity, uniqueness. He does not consider it necessary to get someone on the approval of this or that act, and the decision is made ​​by a very arrogant. Do not hesitate to use force anywhere. Angry, annoyed, if someone it "contradict" and is externally visible. \n\n> SEE - this is a strong, domineering personality. A girl of seven years creating a lot of problems to parents: she fights with anyone who contradicts her in something. And most importantly, that she wins even in a fight with the boys.\n\n> Even he likes to control people, or rather, it is in the blood. The chief-SEE everything must be subordinated.\n\n> The individual feels at home among people who are actively doing something and interacting with each other directly (visibly), and is able to organize people, move them around as necessary, and guide them in achieving a specific goal. He or she likes obedience and even subservience in others, since it allows him to "make things happen" more effectively.\n\n\n#Geez, what happened?!??\n\nI know if you’re on r/mbti you’ve probably gotten sick and tired of me obsessing over this stuff. But seriously. I can relate to jack squat in socionics but I’ve never been more sure of being ESFP in mbti. \n\nI posted threads similar to this in r/mbti and they concluded that I’m actually an ESFj in socionics. But that’s still confusing, because I thought the p and j were only supposed to switch for introverts?\n\nI came here to see what y’all thought. This is very confusing and I’d appreciate if I could get this clarified. Thank you for taking the time to read this. 
2	I was nodding through the entirety of the MBTI description but couldn’t even get through the socionics. While I certainly relish being a mentor to others, I’ve never gotten off to the feeling of power. I’m actually currently being placed on a pedestal in my new job and while I appreciate the acknowledgment of my abilities it’s making me a bit uncomfortable because I don’t want the tenured employees to resent me. 
2	Socionics actually offers a number of type descriptions, and just like in MBTI some profiles are crap, others are decent. You posted one of the crappiest profiles. If you want to read others that are somewhat decent try [**ESFp by Gulenko**](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=SEE_Profile_by_Gulenko) and [**ESFp by Stratiyevskaya**](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=SEE_by_Stratiyevskaya).

0	I hate ESFP girls!!!!!!!!	I’m writing this and crying about how esfp girl humiliated me today
14	why do you think she's an esfp lol, i just think its unfair that people stereotype esfps as a certain type (popular party girl usually) without knowing them extremely well
12	Also, ya gotta be more specific, idk how to help u when there are literally no details
6	I luv them. Perfect thot material for a quick pump & dump 
6	How did you type her as esfp
5	Your just whining.....\nINFPs are the worst. 😐
3	Oh dear... reconnecting didn’t go well, huh?  What happened?
2	LMAO
12	Do you relate to this?	
3	Yes!
2	Where did you get this description?
1	Uh huh! 
1	100%
0	Yeah sure. Why?
5	Dominant Se	hey all, possible ESFP here! what is dominant Se to you, and how do you experience it?
8	For me, dominant Se manifests itself as being highly in tune with my enivronment. I'm the first one to answer the phone, respond to other noises, etc. I'm very in touch with my senses - auditory, visual, gustatory. People have often complimented me on my style and food/music preferences. I'd like to think that I can quickly choose the best-looking clothes in any store. On the other hand, I suck at long term planning. 
5	This is nothing new but I felt like answering. I'm very aware of what's around me, even not directly around me. I'm a very practical person. When I'm with people who don't use Se very well, it can get frustrating. People who are disorganized, people who don't see details that from my pov are right in front of them, who are slow to react. When it gets really bad I can lose my patience and get snappy and hurtful if I'm not careful. It rarely gets that bad but I've had issues before when I stayed with the same people for a long time, on a trip for example. Hanging out with other Se users is very relaxing in that respect. My brother is a Se user and when we go from point A to point B together for example, we naturally take the shortest or most efficient route. I think my Se makes me very sensitive to discomfort. Mine or others'. And I'll always actively seek the situation where I feel the most comfortable. And most times I'll do that for people around me too. Small things like moving the peanuts bowl back to the center of the table at a party. Or closing a blind if the light is bothering someone. Or when we're like 10 people on a trip, in a crowded city, I'll be constantly checking that no one is lagging behind. It's noticing stuff like that.\n\nThe way things look is very very important to me. My clothes are like an extension of myself so I'll pick them out carefully. If the place where I live doesn't look good to me I'll get depressed, so I'll hang stuff on the walls. I'll put a lot of thought into the furniture and their layout. When I get invited to a flat with blank walls and random furniture thrown around it brings my mood down.
2	MBTI survey results!! - What did the correlations from 1200 answers say?	
3	Do ESFP's not like science fiction?	I read someone that ESFP's don't tend to like sci fi. I'm okay with it but rather passive. I have a bit of trouble with the plot lines/ length of films like Star Wars, just does nothing for me. 
13	I'm not interested in sci-fi in the least. It is the anti-real world. 0 appeal on every level
9	I’m an ESFP and I love sci-fi films and TV but I also don’t think personality types decide a persons movie preferences. That being said I’d choose a nice science documentary over a sci-fi film any day. 
5	I love sci-fi films.
5	I'm an ESFP and I'm a huge sci-fi nerd. Star Trek and Star Wars have had an immense influence on me! Stargate, Eureka, and Killjoys are also shows I really enjoy watching. The list could go on forever, really... I also read sci-fi from time to time.\n
5	Love it
2	My ESFP cousins favourite movie is Terminator, and he loves the Alien franchise and Blade Runner and so on. He loves Sci Fi.
2	I like Doctor Who a lot, but that doesn't feel too much like a sci-fi show. The actually fictional "technology" in it, is done like a joke. Star Wars, Star Trek, and similar shows don't appeal to me.\n\nI loved Black Mirror, though. But that's not actually unrealistic. It shows the negative sides of technology.
1	I can’t really see sci-fi as the future, it’s more a fantasy. I can’t see the connection between what we are and how we would get to this alternate universe. Dystopian worlds are interesting, but I can’t compare it to the here-and-now in terms of interest. Our world is so much more stimulating than the possibilities that the media offers us.
1	How do I start a new thread on this sub? I've been looking so long, but I can't find any link. 
1	Star Wars, for all its spacebattles, is hardly science fiction, tho. It's closer to fantasy/classic myths. \n\nIt's funny how you've trouble even with that one.

3	Academic Survey on Personality	Hello I am a student at University and I am collecting data on Big-5, type indicator, and cluster B personality characteristics. The IRB and the Human consent pages are in included in the link. At the end of data collection I will be giving away amazon gift cards. The information is on the last page. I appreciate anyone willing to take the time. The average response time is around 15 minutes. Thank you again.\n\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/r/T2DWFXG
2	Does it have results?  I just took the test but after the amazon gift card page (I was confused about user id so i didn't enter), another survey popped up.
1	Help me. I’m an ENTJ/INTJ and can’t work well with the ESTP in my office’	
10	Yeah, that seems like an adequate amount of information necessary to help you.
4	Did you maybe post this in the wrong sub? /r/mbti or the ESTP sub might be more successful.
4	Any ESFPs want to penpal (email or snail mail) it up with another ESFP?

1	Which magazines do you subscribe to?	I would love to find some good subscriptions. Which ones speak to you as fellow ESFPs?
4	I don't know if this is just cause I'm under 25, but I haven't even given any thought to magazines... If I ever did, it would be game informer, but even then I don't think it's worth it

2	The Scientific American is good in my opinion
2	Frankie is a great magazine for women that's not shallow and superficial.\n\nI also like Scientific American and also I occasionally indulge in home decor magazines
1	ESFP's are too dumb to be able to read a book. Too busy sleeping around & taking drugs
8	Hey! I’m an ESFP (duh that’s why I’m here) I am so incredibly interested in Myer Briggs personalities and love reading other ESFP’s post, so freaking relatable. I struggle with the fact that I feel like I’m an all rounder. I’m creative but not talented creative to actually study art or music. Sucks.	
7	Ah that's a tough feeling, I see what you mean. A great thing to do is to bring your creativity into other aspects of your life- you have that creative impulse, and you can use that to come at problems from an angle that others wouldn't see. \n\nIt may take some time to develop that side of your creative mind... and it doesn't mean fantastical solutions to everyday things. Just a slightly more open way of looking at a problem, which can make all the difference. \n\nEssentially, I would stop looking at creativity as just for art or music, and start thinking of it as a tool for anything.
3	I’m also very 50/50, Mostly with N/S and P/J. I feel this probably contributes to feeling not entirely made to fit in anywhere. I’m glad to hear you can relate. I work in a retail job that I hate. there’s almost no interaction with people, I just fold clothes all day. I recently started working in a pre-school which I love because I feel rewarded through helping the children, makes me feel great. Thanks for sharing!! And at least us ESFP’s can appreciate each other’s understanding qualities, outside of the workforce :) 
3	YO THIS WAS CRAZY ACCURATE!\n\nProud ESFP here and I enjoy the #relatable posts for us party people! I found that acting and being a stage precence is definitely something ESFPs shine bright in. You should give that a shot! I did and I found my calling! I love to entertain others in every way I can but I always feel like I can't do things correctly and it takes longer for me to understand certain complex topics. Its rare to see ESFPs online, so I appreciate you for posting about yourself and representing the funnest MBTI type everrrr
0	Is this normal for ESFPs???	I am just found out just now that I am an ESFP just now.  My IQ is 72 is this normal for ESFPs I am a girl BTW
18	you are looking for r/shittymbti
9	Even if the test result were accurate, you are just 1 person and you are not representative of everyone on this subreddit. Move on. 
6	I'll give you a simple answer because I think the other commenters might be making fun of you: Intelligence, or the lack of, is not directly connected to any type of personality. It's a person by person measurement.
5	[deleted]
5	That seems really low.  
3	IQ does bias a lot towards Intuition since a lot of what it does is measure pattern recognition.  I would say it's not entirely abnormal, but it's also a really, really bad measure of real intelligence.   \n    \nUnless you had aspirations for joining Mensa (which seems to be a large circle jerk), I wouldn't worry about it.

5	I’m just trying to confirm my type	Does this sound like esfp\n\n- I don’t mind listening to your ideas, but if don’t have any intention of putting them into action I’d rather not waste my time. \n- I focus on the present but occasionally I get nostalgic.\n- I get bored if you try to talk about my future. I try to waste as little time on that stuff as possible. Things don’t stay the same and more often than not you’re going to end up adapting to the changes anyway.\n- I find that the emotions of the people around me influence me a lot. If I’m around someone who’s cussing at their phone or someone else, I feel uncomfortable. If I’m around someone who’s always laughing and talking and making jokes and stuff, I feel encouraged to do the same.\n- I feel awkward when I’m alone and I’d rather be around a lot of people. \n- I find myself needing a lot of affirmation.\n- I find myself focusing on the details in the real world more than details about myself.\n- If it doesn’t have a deadline, it isn’t getting done unless it’s actually important to me.\n- I’d rather spend time having fun and being happy as much as possible than doing chores and dwelling over stuff that doesn’t affect me right now. \n- When I’m cooking, I’d rather have an actual recipe with proportions so I know what the heck I’m doing. \n- I’d rather rely on facts that are confirmed and true than fluffy theories that may or may not be accurate. \n- I don’t care if plans change at the last minute. It happens. It just opens up more options. \n- It’s very important to me to be accepted and liked in my community. \n- I think drama is rather exciting and fun to have in my life. But when it goes too far and starts to screw things up, that’s when I start to get really nervous. If it gets to that point I’ll try to act happy and upbeat and try to make others feel the same way and maybe make the drama less threatening, but if it obviously isn’t helping I’ll just sit there and shake with anxiety. \n- I find that commercials and ads with an emotional appeal have more of an effect on me than ones with a bunch of numbers and percentages. \n- People are always telling me to think before I speak but I never do that. \n- If something is important or significant to me, I’ll remember a lot about it. \n- It makes me feel sooooo awful when for whatever reason I have to stand far away from a group of people. I’d much rather be among them.\n- I hate relying on strict plans because I’ve never seen one work out the way it’s supposed to. *Things change.*\n- If I feel strongly about a subject, I have absolutely no problem expressing my feelings about it. But if it’s likely that it will cause a conflict or a giant argument, I’ll just keep my mouth shut. \n- I can say something with confidence for once: I’m a procrastinator. As I said in my previous post, if it isn’t affecting me or my loved ones right this second, it doesn’t matter. I’ll only do it if I absolutely have to, and most likely I’ll start it the same day it’s due. \n- I can’t take criticism. It comes across to me as an insult and makes me feel like crap. \n- If I’m being disrespectful, I’m not doing it on purpose. I’ll most likely apologize if you bring it to my attention.\n- I love assignments and essays that allow me to express myself. \n- If someone has a suggestion that we are able to act on *right now,* I’m always the first one to jump out of my chair and go. If it’s a suggestion that may or may not happen in the future, I don’t waste any time or energy on it. Because I know from experience that those lovely little “possibilities” and “ideas” never work out if it requires too much planning in advance. \n- If I do something foolish that causes me to be ashamed, I’ll try to distract myself from it with other things. If I’m unable to do that and I’m left alone with my thoughts, I feel like garbage.\n- If I ask someone a question and they don’t answer in .00000000009 seconds I assume they didn’t hear me or they’re ignoring me. \n- I feel like I can go forever without being alone and that would actually be great lol. \n- As much as I want to keep your secret, more times than not I’ll spill the beans without even realizing it. \n- I don’t mind a loud environment. I think it’s really awesome.\n- I’ll tell a complete stranger pretty much everything that’s going on in my life and how I feel about it. I’ve gotten into a ton of trouble because of that. \n- I honestly don’t like being in control or in a leadership position lol. I’d rather let someone else take care of that stuff and I can just go with the flow.\n- If I do end up making a to-do list I’ll never follow through with it. \n- When I’m at a restraunt I tend to order the same thing because I’m comfortable with it. But if someone suggusts something to me, unless there’s a really good reason not to get it, I’ll try it. \n- When I visit someone’s house and it’s cluttered and messy, I actually admire it. It comes across to me as they’re living their life to the fullest instead of gushing over how everything is displayed. As long as you know where everything is, it doesn’t matter at all. Why waste your time on that stuff? It makes no difference. \n
9	"If I ask someone a question and they don’t answer in .00000000009 seconds I assume they didn’t hear me or they’re ignoring me."\nSame
6	I think you’re right. Now you can put the flair on. 
4	"I find that the emotions of the people around me influence me a lot. If I’m around someone who’s cussing at their phone or someone else, I feel uncomfortable. If I’m around someone who’s always laughing and talking and making jokes and stuff, I feel encouraged to do the same."   \nThis screams extraverted feeling. Not likely to be an ESFP, who use Introverted feeling as their second function.
2	Learn about the functions if you didn't already.\n\nSe Fi Te Ni for ESFPs.
1	Tl;dr soz - from an ESFP
2	How to be more like an ESFP?	I'm always down for an adventure but for some reason, it's very hard for me go on one without someone else to take the lead (usually another ESFP).  I have social anxiety, probably from being in the grip of my ni function too much, and it's really hard for me to reach out because im always scared to be rejected in some way.  Any tips to help?  I just went on a cruise, and for whatever reason it was suddenly so easy for me to be like myself and it gave me such a big confidence boost but now that it's over, I don't know if I can hold that mentality for very long since others at my school don't see me that way.  They think I'm shy but I actually just have social anxiety.  
8	Stop focusing on yourself but on others. In all honestly no one thinks that deeply about someone else. They only remember how you made them feel (such as were you interested in them, did you listen by asking questions, did you make a joke here or there) you’d be surprised but the best way to start a convo is simply saying “hey, how are you?” After that you can say something like “what’s the last movie you saw?” If they say they don’t like movies you can say “well what do you like?” \n\nSocializing it’s honestly just taking a personal interest in the other person. 
3	Sense of humour! :) One of the best things I learned from being around an ESFP so much is to laugh at everything! Including my own shyness and the awkward things I do when I feel social anxiety. It's funny and I tell ESFP about it afterwards and they laugh. They laugh at their own social interactions too and make lots of jokes to ease tension. Everything is funny and having fun is the goal of every day, that's what I learned is the ESFP way. :) *dances* 
1	Most ESFPs, in my experience, are pretty sporadic and bounce around from activities, but we can be pretty lazy if we don’t keep busy and we can get into that grip a little when like that. \n\nI personally don’t have social anxiety and from my understanding, that can make things a little difficult socially. You can have a good amount of questions to ask someone. Maybe about their outfit, their top ten favorite movies, talk about the city you’re both in, memes, books you’ve read, places you’ve been, outlooks on life, what makes them passionate... \n\nWhen I’m in the Ni grip, I get like this whether I’m worried about future plans or maybe when I’m in a transition period in my life and life is hectic, I also can be very paranoid, overthink, become cynical, not know how to explain myself/my emotions. Not ideal. \n\nWhenever I do get like this, going outside for a day hike with a close friend I trust, a solo road trip, or even a picnic can do wonders! Exercising by myself always helps me come back to focus on the present, get those endorphins going. \n\nI used to be pretty shy myself and not really know how to explain myself and was always curious to where sometimes I’d cause trouble simply because I was trying to understand something or do it a different way. \n\nJust focusing on living through your actions and how you value situations and setting a standard for yourself that’s proactive to yourself (without stressing yourself to impress others or getting bored with everything) and others. It’s all about just learning as I go, taking opportunities where life takes me (but also having that little bit of deliberation and discernment), taking the time to confide in people who are good for you and appreciate you as an individual, all while staying true to yourself,  owning your shit when you’re wrong, and still being able to see outside of your own box. \n\nAs weird as it may feel while in a grip, really get out there and just slowly refocus yourself. Go to a city you’ve never been to, give yourself a budget, and just explore. You could cook yourself or people you care for a nice meal, draw something even if you don’t think it’s very good, and put on some good dance music and have a ball and remember to just don’t give a fuck while doing it – just feel those vibes!

3	Big 5 Correlations (x-post fro r/INFJ)	Edit*\n\n##[Results Post Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/89k2lv/big_5_correlations_results/)\n\n-------\n\nHey there, ESFPs! I'm a mod over on r/INFJ and we've been doing this experiment to see if we can confirm any Big 5 correlations between MBTI types. So far I've got input from INFJs, INTJs, INTPs, and ENTPs, mostly. I've asked a few other types as well and now I'm coming to you :) I promise to come back with results if I get enough people to participate. Just state your type (it's ok if you're not an ESFP) and your % scores for each Big 5 category, and feel free to add anything else from your results if you want to share. Thanks in advance! (see below for more info)\n\n-------\n\nThere is a lot of talk regarding MBTI vs [the Big 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits) - [is MBTI as valid](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2012/08/02/what-is-the-current-thinking-about-myers-briggs), do they correlate ([1](https://psychology.stackexchange.com/questions/13460/what-correlation-research-has-been-done-on-mbti-vs-big5), [2](https://personalityjunkie.com/09/openness-myers-briggs-mbti-intuition-big-five-iq-correlations/)), etc. I thought a community post would be a good way to see what kind of distribution we have when we compile results. With enough participants, I'll report back the distributions and see what shakes out :)\n\n##[You can take the Big 5 test here](https://www.truity.com/test/big-five-personality-test)\n\n(it's free, the $29 "cost" refers to the cost of their premium report, and you also don't need to create an account to see your results, just click "no thanks")\n\n**Please comment here with your type (let me know your type so we're not mixing results) and the percentages for each Big 5 category.**\n\nBelow is an overview of the Big 5 for those who are unfamiliar.\n\n-----\n\n[*From wikipedia:*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits)\n\n> * **Openness** to experience (inventive/curious vs. consistent/cautious)  \nAppreciation for art, emotion, adventure, unusual ideas, curiosity, and variety of experience. Openness reflects the degree of intellectual curiosity, creativity and a preference for novelty and variety a person has. It is also described as the extent to which a person is imaginative or independent and depicts a personal preference for a variety of activities over a strict routine. High openness can be perceived as unpredictability or lack of focus, and more likely to engage in risky behaviour or drug taking. Also, individuals that have high openness tend to lean towards being artists or writers in regards to being creative and appreciate the significance of the intellectual and artistic pursuits. Moreover, individuals with high openness are said to pursue self-actualization specifically by seeking out intense, euphoric experiences. Conversely, those with low openness seek to gain fulfillment through perseverance and are characterized as pragmatic and data-driven—sometimes even perceived to be dogmatic and closed-minded. Some disagreement remains about how to interpret and contextualize the openness factor.\n\n>* **Conscientiousness** (efficient/organized vs. easy-going/careless)  \nA tendency to be organized and dependable, show self-discipline, act dutifully, aim for achievement, and prefer planned rather than spontaneous behavior. High conscientiousness is often perceived as stubbornness and obsession. Low conscientiousness is associated with flexibility and spontaneity, but can also appear as sloppiness and lack of reliability.\n\n>* **Extraversion** (outgoing/energetic vs. solitary/reserved)  \nEnergy, positive emotions, surgency, assertiveness, sociability and the tendency to seek stimulation in the company of others, and talkativeness. High extraversion is often perceived as attention-seeking, and domineering. Low extraversion causes a reserved, reflective personality, which can be perceived as aloof or self-absorbed. Extroverted people tend to be more dominant in social settings, opposed to introverted people who may act more shy and reserved in this setting.\n\n>* **Agreeableness** (friendly/compassionate vs. challenging/detached)  \nA tendency to be compassionate and cooperative rather than suspicious and antagonistic towards others. It is also a measure of one's trusting and helpful nature, and whether a person is generally well-tempered or not. High agreeableness is often seen as naive or submissive. Low agreeableness personalities are often competitive or challenging people, which can be seen as argumentativeness or untrustworthiness.\n\n>* **Neuroticism** (sensitive/nervous vs. secure/confident)  \nNeuroticism identifies certain people who are more prone to psychological stress. The tendency to experience unpleasant emotions easily, such as anger, anxiety, depression, and vulnerability. Neuroticism also refers to the degree of emotional stability and impulse control and is sometimes referred to by its low pole, "emotional stability". A high stability manifests itself as a stable and calm personality, but can be seen as uninspiring and unconcerned. A low stability expresses as a reactive and excitable personality, often very dynamic individuals, but they can be perceived as unstable or insecure. It has also been researched that individuals with higher levels of tested neuroticism, tend to have worse psychological well being.\n\n[*From a peer-reviewed paper:*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0191886996000335):\n\n>The NEO-PI Agreeableness score was correlated only with the thinking-feeling (T-F) dimension; the NEO-PI Conscientiousness score was correlated with both thinking-feeling and judging-perceiving (J-P) dimension; the NEO-PI Extraversion score was strongly correlated with the extraversion-introversion (E-I) dimensions, while the Neuroticism score from the NEO-PI was not related to any MBTI subscale score. The openness dimension was correlated with all four especially sensing-intuitive.

4	Yes! I can pick up on them quickly if I'm exposed to them. 
4	No I’m terrible. My brain is way better at math 
3	[deleted]
2	I’m a ESFP who is bi-lingual and majored in math. Just got it all huh! 🤓🤪☺️ 
6	How do I avoid hurting my ESFP friends feelings?	I have a good friend who is an ESFP. Before I get into my problem with her, I'll say this. She's kind, she's thoughtful, she's hilarious, she's wonderful as a person and I value her friendship deeply. Our friendship means a lot. She's genuinely special to me and I'm only asking the following questions in order to preserve our friendship. \n\nSo. My problem. I work with her. At the moment, I work a little above her. She is on a team I am responsible for. And, though I love her in informal friendship settings, she is incredibly immature and unprofessional in situations that require professionalism. We're meeting with investors at the moment, as we need funding for this project. She is manic, bordering on panicked in these meetings. It's genuinely embarrassing to be in a meeting with professionals with her- she stresses out in front of them, scrambles for the answers to questions, has no sense of order when presenting our case, scatters notes across the table, interrupts me frequently, despite me being midway through a presentation. \n\nI am also struggling with being technically 'in charge' of her. She is really quite unreliable- she struggles to meet deadlines, and if I ask her for something more than once she takes it personally. If I ask a question to understand what she meant by something in her notes, she takes it personally. She has a specific expression and tone that I know well; it means her feelings are hurt and I may well hear about it later. If I take a moment with someone else on the team, she asks me later why she wasn't included- well, because it wasn't your area and had nothing to do with what you're working on. \n\nI love her, I care about her, but I'm getting very frustrated with her. How do I gently ask her to be professional at work? And how can I help her stop feeling like she has to... I don't know, fix things with me? She's also getting to a point where she can absolutely sense my frustration and as a result is trying extra hard. I really don't like it when she tries so hard, I like it when she's just herself- but lately she's been forcing humour, trying to be funny rather than letting it come naturally as it usually does to her, messaging me twice as much as usual, asking me if we're okay almost every day, and it's driving me a little insane. I just want her to be a little more professional at work and know where the line is. \n\nI don't want to hurt her feelings, but she seems to be so easily offended at times. It's getting to the point where I'm starting to get irritated with her in non-work settings just because her behaviour is reminding me of what she's doing at work. \nI'm sorry if this sounds judgemental, I really do care about her, but I'm getting so exhausted with balancing her and work. 
3	Try positive reinforcement, and when critiquing her, always tell her what she did well first before analyzing what she could do better.
1	Take her out for a beer and be honest with her. We like straight forward. It’s her job aka essential for living.  We can tell when you’re bsing us, may be why she’s irritated with you. Give her an open space to talk, that’s not at work. Make sure you make her feel like you’re on the same team.\n\nAnd yes we do need down time to process our emotions. But we don’t like anyone to know about it.  My boyfriend barely knows it haha. \n\nEdit: make it fun somehow!

8	INTJ humbly begs for advice to become more like an ESFP	As an INTJ I am often severely jealous of the way ESFJs conduct themselves out there in the world! Fame follows them everywhere and charisma oozes from every pore. And every XNTX I know has SECRETLY confided to me that they feel the same envy. \n\nI have a question and a request. The question is: What are your gut reactions when an INTJ (or similar type) walks into the room? Give me your worst! Your honest opinion will be the key to our improvement as INTJs and you will be doing the WORLD a service!\n\nAnd here is the request: I am humbling asking for a piece(s) of advice. I may never reach ESFP imminence but how can I start to become more/look more/act more AWESOME (I can also trade INTJ secrets too). \n\n\n\n
9	INTJs always seem poised and put together and classy...\n\nHonestly, I think the key is realizing that everyone is so self conscious about themselves that they really aren't judging you. Or if they are, you'll be a blip in their memory tomorrow. It's not worth worrying about how others perceive you.
7	Gut reaction: jealous of your attention to detail, your razor-like logic, and ability to maintain composure under stress. I don't think you should really change anything, except perhaps being a little more open to spontaneity here and there. 
6	Maybe relax a little and try to live in the moment.  Open up to people, but not too much, you don't want to be that weirdo that says too much about yourself.  This might be a little hard for you, but you have to be a people person! :)  \nI'm secretly jealous of how logical you guys are.  I'm trying to be more like that, any tips? although I don't like it when in conversation I get pushed to be more logical.  My husband is an INTJ and  that scenario happens too much in my opinion.  When he challenges me to think more logically it pushes me out of my comfort zone and I get anxious and frustrated.. I want my Ti to be higher, but it was the lowest of my cognitive functions hahaha so sad.... 
3	first of all, why would any self respecting INTJ ever want to change. I think that perhaps you're not an INTJ. True INTJs don't really get jealous...
3	Born to be mild vanilla ass mf
2	First of all why would you want to purposely change yourself? 
1	My current best friend is an INTJ and so is my close co worker. I think the things you guys do is amazing. I always have a good time as long as they have a good time. I don't ask for them to be like me, just enjoy yourselves.
1	I actually was an INTJ but in the course of about a year I changed to ESFP (nutcase alert, I'm probably BPD but who gives one). I don't have any advice exactly as to how I did it, but I think a lot of it comes from breakthroughs and changes to habits. I think the best way to find these is to try, and try again, until you feel natural with talking to people. Don't pressure yourself to find topics and jokes but instead take it easy, just spend more of your intellect coming up with practice for socialization. It's not a tactic. It's an art. You become better at it without pushing yourself. Hope this helps. 
1	Surgically replace your brain with a hamster on a wheel. \n\nYou may be thinking "But that's a battery not a brain". Well you're correct all ESFPs need is energy.
6	ESFP BOND WITH THINKERS	Any esfp here who has or had relationships or friendships with the thinkers? Especially ENTJ or ESTJ? And how did it go for you guys? Was there any notable issues that caused conflict ?
6	My fiancé is an INTP, and he sometimes worries too much or gets angry when things don't go the way he planned. His pastimes are researching online about his hobbies, but never really doing anything about them, and he doesn't like to go out with anyone but me
3	Half of my siblings and most of my friends are thinkers. My boyfriend is a thinker. One of my sisters and my dad are ENTJs and there is a noticeable disconnect when trying to communicate on a deep level, but I've been able to connect with my sister through a lot of effort and time together. My dad maybe not as much, but that might change. :D\n\nI adore all of them and they're all open-minded about my sensing and emotion expressiveness. I've noticed that I get along well with INTJs and ISTPs.
4	ESFP female here...Most of the men in my life happen to be either INTJs or INFJs... I'm not sure if that's because from a friendship and romance level I'm always drawn towards people of the opposite sex that balance me out persinality wise, or if I just enjoy the back and forth our conversations always take. They NEVER bore me. Because we approach most topics from very different perspectives, discussions are always lively and I always feel a 'buzz' when we're done.\n\nConflicts can arise when I forget their need for solitude and a 'recharge' period or when they forget my need to socialize. I've also noticed that just as I hate being asked to justify a statement Ive made based on a gut feeling, they hate being questioned on things they've taken the time to study and research.\n\nWith any relationship, regardless of personality type, you just need to be cognizant of other people's feelings on certain things and don't be a general asshole to each other.\n
2	Thank you! How did you make the effort to connect with your ENTJ sister ?

1	I have a major crush on an ENTJ at work, but he wants nothing to do with me :'( 
9	What do you feel when people use metaphors?	As in a conversation or a book.\n\nDo you hate it when people use metaphors?\n\nSuch as,\n\n>If the ESFP is the captain of a ship, sensing is the sail, feeling is the compass, and thinking is the maintenance crew.\n\n>My imagination is like Kinder eggs. You don't know what ideas you'll get, but they are all silly and pointless.
14	Depends on the quality of the metaphor...if it's not very good, I feel as if a fog has descended on the conversation so I need to slow down and spend a few extra seconds interpreting it.
9	Yes :|\n\nEverytime someone uses one, I think, "How is that easier to understand than just saying it directly?"\n\nI don't have many issues understanding them... I just think getting to the point is more efficient and less distracting.
6	I'm an INFJ who uses a lot of metaphors to explain the nebulous cloud of thought in my head to my ESFP husband. He gets annoyed with it sometimes. \n
5	To me they are a lot like Kinder eggs
3	I partially agree with u/chill_monkey ... it depends on the quality of the metaphor, but I feel like they can add a lot to the discussion because there is so much underlying information that can be inferred by the metaphor chosen.\n\nFor example, with your ESFP metaphor - I feel like you see ESFPs in such a positive light.  You succinctly explain the how the functions work together to guide an ESFP’s actions but using the metaphor of a captain and a ship, I feel like you see ESFPs as these free-spirited, curiosity-driven explorers who crave adventure, new lands, and challenges to overcome.  I feel like you are slightly jealous of our ability to charge into unknown waters and perhaps romanticize our adventurous spirits.  Your metaphor is so much more complimentary and meaningful than just generally stating that: ESFPs are fun.\n\nEdit: Then again, I could just be misinterpreting the metaphor all-together.  You may just really like ships.  And not kinder egg toys. XD
1	The second one is accurate at least. Can't deny that. However a large part of me (the lazy side, as it turns out) doesn't want to think about something so pointless when you could just like say the thing (logic decreased: now at 13).
1	I dig 'em. With a shovel. Through the dirt of ambiguity in search of clarity of thought.
1	I love them. Little brain exercises, help me appreciate new perspectives. My bestie is an enfp and they are great with metaphors so I love hearing her take on things. 
3	Careers	What are you guys doing? 
3	I’m a CNA right now. I love my job, I’m never bored and know I’m making a difference in people’s lives. 
5	Software and systems engineer. I love computing 
5	Finance analyst.... for bars,clubs, festivals etc. 
3	I'm an assistant teacher in a 3K preschool class. Constantly moving; just enough structure to know what to do next, yet quite a few days have been "Hey, so we're just going to wing it today!" So there's plenty of chaos to balance the schedule.\nI love it! :)
3	Retail, front end and HR. \n\nMeh, it's a job. I mean, I don't mind it as bad as some people do, and I enjoy the constant interaction.\n\nI'd prefer something else, eventually. 
3	System Engineer working in the space flight industry.  Launching rockets is as exciting as it gets, everyday stuff can get boring and I can definitely forget to do things I should have taken care of months ago, but it's fast pace enough that I'm constantly having to figure out something new which I enjoy.
2	I'm in logistics. \n\nIt's constantly changing, reacting quickly, being able to change course without getting your feathers ruffled, and never letting things get to you. It suits me. 
2	I'm do business development (think sales, marketing, strategy, and product management rolled into one).   It's fun, exciting, and diverse enough that it mostly keeps me from being bored.
2	I'm a freelance screenwriter 
2	I’m a wholesaler in the financial industry and I’ve never felt so at home-my\npersonality is rewarded and I’m literally just being myself
2	I would be a tour guide if it paid (I just love being a snobby annoying yet extroverted prick) but instead I'm stuck with micropreneurialship. Currently working on a social media network that needs no ads and instead borrows computing power to mine cryptocurrencies (I've also developed a way to explain it which will put anyone to sleep. I call it "snorecoin").
1	I'm in marketing design, typically skewing towards scientific or medical content. 
2	How many novels did you read in 2017?	
4	Definitely more than 6. Reading is one of my passions.
2	Nil. I basically only read reddit and instagram, lol
2	Not suprised at the lack of replies. ESFP's be too busy sleepin around & doing drugs 😂
1	About 30?  20 new and 10 re-reads.
0	Half awake and didn't read what subreddit this was from; voted as an INFP and messed up your results. Sorry for the silly mistake. \n\nThe three books were 'Overlord' Vol 1 ( light novel), 'Lord of Opium', and 'What the Hell Did I Just Read'.
8	This sub is so quiet	From a  ESFP who also conveniently forgets to check this sub at all 
7	You'll probably have a better chance to talk to ESFPs on Facebook groups or something.
3	I only like scrolling thru Reddit.  Found I slow down enough to comment only when drunk and bored 😉.
2	Yeah.  Even the ISTP subreddit has more posts than this place.
17	Why does everyone on MBTI sub hate us?	I know it's not everyone but seriously why are we cursed within this community?\n\nI get why our sub is dead, I'm thinking about leaving forever too 
22	Because we're emotionally intelligent, happy-go-lucky, and not autistic or anal retentive. Pretty much the antithesis of the Reddit community, so people have a hard time relating. Add that to the natural urge of destroying what you do not understand 
6	Because we're both sensors and feelers. Try the facebook ESFP group, it's not dead 😊\nPS: I haven't seen ESFP hate posts on fb lately soo... We're evolving. 
6	Can I have more karma guys because I’m going to make an INFJ/ESFP post.
2	What if an ESFP had to fight an INTJ. Who would win? Any other external factors are equal to both contestants. - INFJ
2	awww nope, i like you guys generally.\neven if im an infj and we are not supposed to get along.\nguess it's easier for older and therefore mature (introverted) types to get along with a wider range of different personalities.\n
2	Because a large majority of the MBTI community consists of NTs. Each personality type has biases attached to it on a subconscious level. NTs have trouble figuring this out, because we're not good with our emotions. Although, ENTPs and INTJs are the better of the two when it comes to this.\n\nIt's likely you have biases about INTJs you may be unaware of. If you want, I can inform you on how to temporarily correct them like prescription glasses. And no, I'm not saying you've done anything wrong. Everyone has biases. We just have biases about certain types due to the positioning of our functions and theirs. Basically, the less we experience a person's functions, the function stack listing them in order of significance, the more biased we'll be, hence why a Ti-dom will be more biased about an Fe-dom than any other dom.
1	My dad was an ESFP and was terrible to my family with abuse. I still like your type though. That means a lot coming from an INFP. 
1	I'm married to one of you, so I can't hate. But, I can say I understand you all.
1	Guys help me! I know it’s rude not making this my own post, but I can’t make my own because I don’t have enough Karma, but my ESFP friend’s inferior function (Ni) is going bonkers right now. He’s worrying about that he may get CTE when he’s older because he had 2 minor concussions. Any advice how I can make him feel better from any of your opinions from an ESFP stand point. Him worrying about it is going against the whole ESFP moto of living in the moment and it’s ruining his quality of life and it’s making him go crazy. Any help? I think he’s trying to get reassurance from an Ni dominant like me, but I want more help. I told him worrying about it is worse than having the remote possibility of getting CTE, he agreed to that, but still, just want more advice to help him because CTE has no cure. - INFJ
1	not hated.  You guys are great.   s/INTJ
1	Because everyone on the MBTI sub is under 25 and desperately trying to assure themselves that somehow they're better than other people. This is why they're all types as Ns even though most of them are probably not... also there's a buncha ENTPs and they just hate y'all and everyone else for no reason. Maybe that's true, I'm just talking out my ass though.
3	Do ESFPs read novels?	Sometimes?\n\nIf you do, what books did you like?
4	I like war survival books, historical fiction, or classics. \n\nNot into fantasy, romance, thrillers, or mystery
3	I love reading! I've read something from almost every genre, but I have a soft spot for fantasy and historical fiction. Recent favorites include all of Terry Pratchett's works, mainly Discworld, and Game of Thrones.
3	I love general fiction books with lots of witty compound words and an interesting and intriguing writing style and like, characters with uncommon androgynous names!
2	I’ve read and enjoyed books in many categories and genres! My favorites are sappy romance novels, coming of age stories, mental health related stories, mystery, and murder mysteries. Haven’t read much sci fi though. \nThese days I’m reading a young adult novel that hits close to home culturally called The Book of Unknown Americans by Christina Enriquez. I’m trying to make it a point to actually finish more books though. 
2	I like to read my text books... sounds weird, but it’s helpful for school.
2	Low fantasy books like the Mistborn series.
2	what is book\n\nis it a new hip party drug????
1	Anyone else read the Game of Thrones series so far?  It definitely is my favorite series of books (started them because I was bored at work after season three ended) but it makes me laugh how people obsess over it.  Like it'll get finished or it won't, it has nothing to do with you.  I'd rather be surprised to find out it's coming out soon than worry about when it's coming out.  And I guess that leads me to wonder if you guys idolize other people like some other types do?  I don't think I can feel the attraction to famous people like others do, anyone else feel like "famous" people are typically just normal people you can chill with, that have to deal with fanatics (yea I guess fanatic is the perfect word).  I don't think I could be a fanatic, and this has gone to long, my dog has actually laid down to wait for me to walk her instead of guilty tripping me into walking her, oh shit that's a different thread lol I'm drunk.
1	Constantly...I love using my imagination, and books give me free reign to create a world, so in my head it plays out a lot like an amazing movie.\n\nI read mostly sci-fi, some fiction, some horror, some mystery, a little bit of fantasy.  
4	How can I work well with an ESFP	Hi! Female INTP here.\n\nI’m in need of advice. I’ve been working closely with an ESFP for more than 15 years. Of everyone on our team, she’s the one who I’ve never been able to click with. It makes me sad because I admire her and hate feeling tension around other people.\n\nWe’re a similar age, and met in our mid teens (both early 30s now). \n\nAll I want is to understand how to interact with her. But it seems like every time I see her she shows a new face. Some weeks she’ll seem eager to talk and be friends, other times I feel like I’m being bullied and ignored in favour of the cool kids. Some weeks she’ll be aggressively show-offy; other weeks I can tell her walls have lowered and she wants emotional support or connection.\n\nI am sure that she’s deeply sensitive. She had issues with her weight and looks growing up which she’s overcome but still seem triggering to her. She can get really angry at work superiors, but it’s usually when she feels an injustice. It hurts me to witness that, because it seems like she ignores other people’s feelings and just assumes the worst in their motivations. I wonder if that’s what’s happening between her and me.\n\nThis sounds cocky, but I do wonder sometimes if part of our issue is that she’s jealous. If she feels like we’re getting too equal, it’s like she has to lash out and destroy the equilibrium again.\n\nIn the past she’s been nicest to me when I’ve expressed genuine admiration of her. But she seems to have an internal idea of exactly how much praise she requires, because too much or too little and she’s back to being mistrusting of me.\n\nDo any of you identify with this? How can I find a way of working together that doesn’t feel like I’m being gaslighted half the time? Quitting isn’t an option- it’s our dream job. I don’t care if we’re friends or enemies or have an unspoken agreement to not talk unless our job requires us to.... it’s the not knowing that is hard.  \n\nI’m willing to say what I’ve just written to her... but I just have zero idea if it would help or hurt.\n
6	I don't get along with INTPs, even tho my brother and main coworker are both INTP. \n\nI find them both extremely condescending and state the obvious while also having pretty big superiority complexes. \n\nNeither respond to my social interactions in the way other people would, sometime I think it's intentional but lately I'm starting to think they really just lack the social skill. \n\nI don't feel like they actually listen to what I say, they just listen enough to respond and they don't respond to additional statements of mine. It's like I'm trying to have a discussion while they are just trying to confirm their initial statement and won't budge. \n\nThey never want to talk about the things I want to talk about, so they always dominate the conversation topics. Which is so annoying, there's only so much fantasy bullshit I can talk about. \n\nAlso both are terrible at giving advice. If I ask "what's your opinion? Do you think I should go to Denver or salt lake for vacation?" They would ALWAYS say "do whatever you want, doesn't matter to me, I don't care"\n\nThey are apathetic to a fault, and don't even fake being interested in me, while I constantly have to fake being interested in them to even have civil dialogue. \n\nWhen I do decide to play the part and talk about their interests we get along fine, but it takes its toll over time. \n\nTry going out of your way to show appreciation, a surprise goes a long way, only one time I've been given a surprise gift by my coworker- a bag of snickers. Generosity is one of my strengths so I regularly bring in food for the office or will bring an extra coffee for the INTP coworker, but it's never reciprocated. Usually I chalk it up to the "missing social queues" thing I mentioned earlier. \n\nThis is just my experience hope it gives some insight 
3	No idea. She sounds immature. Sorry wish I could be more helpful. 
3	Sounds like the coworker you are dealing with is a petty, immature version of an ESFP. ESFP's are notorious for not getting along with those who are vastly different than them. You are almost a opposite, but that doesn't completely determine who you will click with. I am an ESFP and I click very well with two particular INTJ's. I think that she is deeply sensitive (as I am) and instead of trying to fix that by learning to love herself, she is trying to fix it by making other feels inferior. ESFP's feel very much, and they can have crazy mood swings, but mature ones have learned to control it. You seem like a very nice and understanding person, but some people you just can never please. I don't know if you can really help her, maybe its only her that can change her attitude. 
2	Wow, you just described the ESFP I worked with.  I had to quit the job, she was also our dept bully.  A few months later, they finally fired her.  She would get extremely jealous and then bully the people who she was jealous of (I was the one she disliked the most, but she basically did it to everyone in our dept and one point or another, he favorite was to try to bully other people into doing her work, I would shove it right back at her and she didn't like that).  She was really bad at her job and the only reason she stuck around so long, was bc she was chummy with our supervisor. Once our supervisor left, there was nobody to cover all of her mistakes anymore and of course the rest of the employees were so ticked off at her behavior and arrogance, they wouldn't help her, so she sunk like a rock.  A trail of documentation was started.  What's interesting is that instead of realizing that she better straighten up, all she did was point the finger at other people.  She was up in HR each week filing complaints about her other coworkers, so then on top of being incompetent, she also became an active trouble maker too and of course nobody liked her.  \n\nI have no advice, but TONS of commiseration.  This esfp single handedly destroyed an entire dept (only one person left out of eight and it's bc that person is only a couple yrs from retirement, this was in a matter of a year and a half, more than half who left stated that the ESFP was the reason why they left, yet they did nothing).  She created a toxic work environment where she felt that everything should be catered to her needs and her feelings.  And no, she was not a supervisor, she was a peer.  It was basically like being in an emotionally abusive relationship, she felt at liberty to lash out and anyone and everyone and if anyone even looked at her funny, she'd report them to HR.
16	God I wish there were more of us on here	it’s weird, we’re hilarious.
10	Same, it's lonely out there constantly trying to justify our type. \n\nLowkey I've been thinking about stopping coming on here just because of how toxic the community is towards us 
16	Maybe most esfps are to busy having fun somewhere that isn't here.
5	All of you ESFPs are awesome, there should be more of you on here. - INFJ
3	Agreed

3	Pino Lella an ESFP?	I've been trying to find more ESFPs in history, Pino Lella, at least as portrayed in "Beneath a Scarlet Sky" fits the bill. \n \n\nHighly recommend for anyone into adventure, survival, or WW2 stories 
2	Emotional manipulation	Would you say we are easily emotionally manipulated? 
8	It depends... I think we can allow ourselves to be manipulated, but I usually know when someone is trying to manipulate me.  I can choose to submit to the manipulation or I can stubbornly refuse to be swayed and cut someone out of my life for attempting it.  I can get resentful of someone trying to manipulate me into doing something that I don't want to do... I may eventually cave but they've only won the battle and I won't stick around enough to let them win the war.\n\nI saw a youtube video about ESFPs that said we're highly individualistic.  We do only what we want to do... we have Fe but it's in our unvalued function stack.  We're not that motivated by peer pressure so for someone to manipulate us, they really need to appeal to our Fi.
3	I'm an INFP and I would say yes. I've seen it many times, especially by INFJs. 
2	Hi
1	Hi guys, I’m an INFJ myself, I have many ESFP friends myself, and I see what you mean by us easily manipulating them, i think it’s more of a dominance thing, I can easily see how to do it With Ni and Fe like second nature, but I avoid doing it because it feels fake and I hate fake people, I see right passed them using the same process as I have the ability to manipulate people and it is sickening to watch. Plus that is just against my morals. Even though Our top stack does not mention we have Fi. We have a very strong function for it, even stronger than Fe, it’s just subconscious. But Enfjs don’t have a strong Fi and so they don’t probably have the morals to stop them from manipulating ESFPs as much as INFJs do. Even though INFJ can be more efficient at it, so don’t piss one off, or you won’t even know you did until it’s too late. (Not saying All Enfjs don’t have the morals too, I’m just saying it’s more likely.) lol I feel like the enemy here. 😂 I subscribed to only my type and this type, because I thought some of my best friends mbti type where very interesting to me, which turned out to be this one (ESFPs) and than I see this, Lmao. I mean sometimes I do manipulate ESFPs when they are teasing me or doing annoying things to me, but that can go for anyone who tries being an ass to me, no matter the type, but otherwise no, I don’t manipulate people.
1	Also I have a random question, so when y’all are pretending that your mad at someone, are you just doing it for fun and to tease them or do you mean it and how can you tell, because my ESFP friends tend to do that by text to me and it makes me sad because I can’t tell if they are offended by me or not and it makes me very stressed and what ever I do, they keep going with that joke until I bring up my anxiety disorder or I will say to them I won’t be your friend anymore as a last resort, because it’s too painful for them to do that to me because I want to be great friends with them and they are really fun and great to be around and bring out this energetic vibe that makes everyone want to be around them. And than they jeopardize a friendship with me with a silly prank and I don’t want to make them think I’m mad at them either because I don’t want them to feel uncomfortable about me being actually mad, because all I want to do is spend a great time with them. Any help since y’all are ESFPs and hopefully more mature than my teen friends. I can see that being a flaw, but I don’t believe that it out-ways all of the positives about them. Sorry for my terrible grammar, I’m just rushing.
2	I only have one question.	Why do guys sleep so religiously? 😂
6	Sleeping is good for you.  It'll put hair on your butt.
3	Just slept for like, 14 hours. Feels amazing. I play hard and I sleep hard.
3	I either sleep 10 hours or zero. 
2	Because I like functioning properly and to my full
2	Sleep is fun. Can't enjoy anything while awake if you haven't had a good sleep.
2	If your tired, and an opportunity comes along that would require you to be alert and awake and grab it. you would kick yourself. Also i don't know about my fellow ESFP's but when I go for something or do something fun its often tiring at the other end and Play hard Sleep hard is good.
2	That's a great goal to have.  Sleep deprivation contributes to a host of health problems--physically, mentally, etc.\n\nIt's a very wise time investment to consider!  On that note, some things are really worth investing in financially:  A great bed suitable for your needs, (comfortable shoes is another biggie). Simply consider the time you'll spend with a product, and the benefits a good product can bring.
7	If Myers Briggs became a battle field who would be our allies and who would be our enemies?	Haha let's pretend it's not already like this 😂😇\n\nI think we'd be with ESTPs and ENTJs because us three are the most capable of getting what we want without sitting around wasting time thinking about it. \n\nEnemies: intps and intjs in my opinion, still on the hating train tbh I will be until they stop bashing Se all the damn time. \n\n
8	I'm so frustrated because nobody in my life will take the tests!!!!!!!!!
4	My last 3 girlfriends have been INTP, I think I'm letting the side down.
1	As an infj esfp is one of my favorite types, most of them are funny as hell...

6	How to get along with Ni doms	The amount of assumptions they make drive me crazy, I've been talking with a few on their threads and their main point is that they feel misunderstood and like ESFPs don't listen well enough. \n\nThis sounds like a load of shit to me. \n\nThe ones I know IRL are frankly just boring people. Talk about nerdy things. Don't really do much. Almost impossible to drag them along for a ride without them wanting to know the plan for every 5 min. \n\nHow do y'all connect with Ni-doms? \n\nWhy do you think they think they're so misunderstood?\n\nI would argue ESFPs are way more misunderstood especially in MBTI. IRL too, people assume we're dumb because we're happy. Or that we don't care about the future because we choose to capitalize in the moment. Or that we don't value our lives because we aren't philosophical. These things have all been false in my experience and the other ESFPs I know. The opposite seems to be true in fact. 
5	lol of my friends use Ni (dom and aux), so I often get jokes about how I’m stupid. But when it comes to figuring out how to do something, they are all lost without me. Just last week, the endless possibilities of how to make ice cream cake baffled them. Silly Ni doms and auxes. Still love you tho.

3	ENTJ here--not sure why you keep spending time with people you think are boring. If someone has interests that are really different from yours, you might just be incompatible as friends.\n\nOn the planning thing, maybe try meeting them halfway? You might not give them a full itinerary of the day, but even something as vague as "around 4 or 5 we'll get dinner" might go along way. Like bullet points.\n\nIn my personal opinion, the reason many immature Ni doms think of themselves as misunderstood is because they think it is other people's responsibility to understand them rather than their responsibility to make themselves understood. They also tend to be paranoid and therefore are often indirect and vague in their communication rather than direct. I think many harbor a secret fantasy where someone (probably an ENFP) finds them sooooo mysterious and alluring that they obsess over figuring the INXJ out.\n\nI say this all as an Ni-aux: Ni sucks. At least it ain't Ne tho. 
15	Ironic that ESFPs get all the attention IRL and none of it in the online MBTI community	
10	Calling all 6 users here on this sub, who would like some attention?
7	May have something to do with having the lowest subscriber rate among personality types , but only a hunch.\n\nGo over to r/INTJ and explode with sweet talk and bubbliness and see if people don't flock toward you like bumblebees in heat!
5	I don’t think any of us can remember to be active on it. 
2	We don't receive attention fast enough on this website.
6	Interesting convo with a group of intjs	I work with three intjs and today one of them said that she wishes she could just move to Spain and figure things out as she goes. I insisted that she should do it, that it's possible and if she really thinks it will make her happy she should just do it. \n\nAfter a good twenty minute conversation/debate the intjs kept trying to tell me I was wrong and that financial security is the smarter priority. I had to just sit back and laugh at how the intjs brought up and agreed that they wish they could do something spontaneously while continuing on with every justification possible as to why spontaneous action isn't warranted. \n\nThey just don't get it I guess  
5	They need an ESFP to volunteer to go *with* them.
3	Maybe they could make a very spontaneous road trip... to the local farmer's market. One step at a time!

6	Hey all you Beautifully Awesome Female ESFPs!!! I love ESFP soooo much!!! What are your feelings on Male INTJs and especially your experiences in relationships with them? I'm guessing they were objectively magnificent, amirite?! 😉👉 😍	Totally Serious
4	Hey, thanks for the love! I was in a brief relationship with an INTJ. Sadly I had to end it due to major incompatibility issues, but don't let this discourage you because I am only 1 person (you need a larger sample size). \n\nHe was very logical; preferred talking about the abstract and philosophical as opposed to concrete matters. We clashed when he played devil's advocate and refused to empathize with me at all. One day I decided that the benefits of the relationship did not outweigh the incessant fighting, so that's why I broke up with him. I'm surprised he didn't leave me first, considering how rational he is. \n
3	Love INTJs but they are my kryptonite... Your Ni draws me in and the need to break down your walls keeps me coming back like a strung-out addict and just about as healthy.\n\nWhat is it about ESFPs that you like?
2	Ended one about a year ago. The chemistry is ridiculous. I think about him once in a while. it was more of a timing thing and beliefs. He was heavy into evolution and I wasn't. it had gotten down to considering marriage. lol I wouldn't budge on my beliefs. but I wish the best for him, couldn't do the friendship thing after haha just ended up back together like a cycle.  that aside it was great and I loved all the other differences. \n\n\n\nThank you for the emoji love! and letting us cuddle you when you really don't want too at first.

I like writing in books because you are not technically supposed to-- but doing it just makes me feel free and like I can just live my life however I want to.\n\nMe, inside: *You just do that. Live your free life.*\n\nESFPs are some of the funnest, cutest human beings in the universe. \n\n\n

4	INTP, was in a relationship with ESFP, AMA.	Hey, I'm a INTP male and recently I was in a relationship with female ESFP. Unfortunately relationship ended, but I enjoyed our time together a lot and got to know a wonderful ESFP individual.\n\nSo, ask me anything :)
3	I'm an INTP with an ESFP girlfriend. We've been together for a bit over a year now. How long were you with your girlfriend? Mine is also going abroad at the end of the month (for five months). I'm a bit worried about how our relationship will be but I guess all I can do is trust her. The only issues we have stem from my mental health (mostly to do with communication). \n\nI think that if you still want to be with her when she gets back, you should contact her. Like you said, ESFP's can change their minds pretty easily, so maybe if you show her that you still want to be with her she will agree.
2	Hello I am INTP also and my partner is ESFP. Can you tell me what part of the relationship didn't work for you? And/Or how you two slit up. \n\nAlso what did you personally think of her as an ESFP? \n\nMine's emotional when it comes to me and she's very mother-like taking care of me and such and I find myself becoming quite childlike around her, any similarities there?

2	Career and life advice for my ESFP friend.	Hi. I'm an INFP. My ESFP friend needs some help for his future. He often tells me he wished he had my ability to look to my future and plan exactly what I want. He doesn't know what he wants. He is an excellent artist and I try to push him to get a career in that but his ISFJ parents, one of whom tried it as an artist and failed are telling him to not go to university and get a job right now. He is actually questioning what he wants to do and I respect his choice but I want it to he his choice. I told him it'd be better to at least try with your talent and not regret a missed opportunity. He personally doesn't  know what to do. So I thought I'd ask you for him. He is awaiting some help from  you guys. What do you think he should do? Should he listen to his ISFJ parents in quickly getting married and getting a job or should he try for his future?
3	I'm a 20 year old ESFP. He needs to do what he wants as an individual. He probably FEELS like he knows what he wants, but is discouraged by the main influencers in his life. Keep encouraging him to listen to his heart and push him to make his own decision. It's probably all he needs.
2	I feel like ESFPs and careers is one of life's great paradoxes. 
2	It’s tough, I went overseas to do volunteer work for 2 years because I didn’t know what I wanted to pursue. I also worked a little bit after high school still trying to figure it out. The real problem is that we feel that we are good at so many things, and excited by all of them that we don’t know what we really want. I’m about to turn 22 and have finally figured it out. When I move back to California, I’ll be pursuing acting. In a way, I’ll be able to do do many jobs, without being stuck to one.

6	Okay, but I think I'm more suited to the entertainer nickname...I mean, I live to entertain other people.
4	I feel like I fit better with the entertainer 
3	Well, just because you don't mean to entertain us doesn't mean you don't anyway. 
2	I'd rather be an opportunist than a [jester](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/spongebob/images/b/b5/Squidley.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130426001027) lol\n\nEdit: included an important visual \n

But I am genuinely interested on a dominant sensors view of spirituality and believing in higher things. I know everyone will have different views but what are some of your guys' view on the subject? Thanks for any replies!
3	LSD 
3	Looking for ESFPs to take my short survey on accomplishments and social media. (Takes no more than 5 minutes) Many thanks from an ENFJ!	
4	A question for Se Dominants	are all of you the bold, daring, rule breaking, sports playing, alpha male jerk kind of personality that the internet makes you all look like? i scored ESFP on the official test 2 out of 3 times and i’m none of those things. i relate to Se for the most part, but not at all to the stereotypes, which is what makes me doubt everything about me being ESFP or even ESTP. 
6	haha definitely not. The stereotypes are idiotic. Sure, there can be *trends* among different types, but ultimately people are individuals. Feel free to ignore stereotypes. I would focus more on the cognitive functions.\n\nYou see, Fi is often a value system. For me, breaking rules would go against my values. I am fairly good at sports, but I don't choose to play them. I am a natural leader, but my other ESFP friend is far from it (much more of a people pleaser). Every ESFP is going to look different from another.
3	What are your favorite video games and why?	For those who play video games, what types of games are you drawn to? Is there a specific genre you gravitate towards? Are there specific attributes in a game that you like? Story? Humor? Action elements? \n\nWhat are your favorite games? Is there anything you like about those games in particular?\n\nAnd, if you feel like it, I would love to know why you like to play video games (or why you don't play video games). 
4	Hi! I play video games sporadically, but regularly. I'm useless in fast paced games & first person shooters, but I love games like Sims, Animal Crossing, Harvest Moon, Stardew Valley. \nI also love point and click games a lot, like The Walking Dead, Life is Strange, Heavy Rain and The Wolf Among Us. I like games where I build toward something or have a goal in mind, and games with a social component and a good story have a fuzzy place in my heart. :) 
3	I am a personal fan of jrps and story games. As mentioned previously, Telltale games are a big hit for me alongside Deponia. I'm also a big League of Legends, Final Fantasy 14, and Persona 5 definitely captured my heart thiis year. I'm not a huge fan of shooters though since I'm not the best at them. Ff9 is my all time favorite and on mobile im in love with sao memory defrag.
1	20/f: Games I play the most are overwatch, crusader kings 2, stardew valley, medieval 2: total war, banished, fallout 4, the sims, skyrim... and others that I play less often but I still enjoy, like game dev tycoon, starbound, you must build a boat, civ 3 or civ 4.\n\nReally, there is no connection between any of them except that I really enjoy the gameplay + rewards system for each. They interest me first with their raw funness, then hook me with objectives/achievements. When executed well, that can exist in FPS, RTS, RPG, TBS, etc. like the games listed above. Story is pretty unimportant to me.
1	I don’t play video games :) unless you count Clash Royale as one
1	Firstly, Shovel Knight, because it's a great game, riddled with puns and has all the greatest things I love about Metroidvania/side-scrolling games wrapped into one singular game. (legit, I've replayed SK at least 5-7 times, a few more in New Game Plus, not to mention all of its DLC)\nI have a knack for JRPGs (ex: classic Final Fantasies (FFV and FFVI are my personal RPG faves) I've been playing Final Fantasy Brave Exvius for a solid year and a half now. \nI'm not a huge fan of FPS's, but Overwatch and Borderlands 2 have been a lot of fun/huge time suck the past year or two for me.
1	Skykrim, red dead, fallout 
1	Resident Evil series, GTA V, Final Fantasy 15, Uncharted, Assassin's Creed
1	I play mainly fps, or 3rd person shooters. Love the fast action. I struggle to play slower games unless with my friends and generally I try and get my friends involved whatever game I am playing and a game will often just die for me if none on my friends want to play it with me. Generally don't play single player games anymore, though I used to when I was younger. Play a lot of board games too and card games with friends.

1	Test With Functions	Hi :) Couple weeks ago I asked for a help with testing one personality test. A lot of people told to use cognitive functions. We did it. Please try test again and comment your result. \n\nIt's Free. No registration required. Congitive functions used. :) \n\nhttps://www.horozo.com/personality-type-test
1	I took this twice with the same answers and got different results lol
2	Need some help :)	Hello, guys :) I'm MBTI fan and trying to help my friend. He own small social network where main feature is Questions Game - people talk to each with pre-prepared questions or use their own questions list. The main idea to filter users and show related members are totally oposite options: 1) compatible members by zodiac sign 2) compatible by personality type. So, he created personality test which contains 32 questions. I want you to ask to take that test and tell is it accurate or not :) \n\nYou don't need to create an account or login to take test, but you can create it if you like the idea and want to try other features :) So, link to test is: \n\nhttps://www.horozo.com/personality-type-test\n\nAny comments, ideas, critics are welcome!
3	To add to it a little bit, I heavily disagree with the portion about which types we would get along with. ESFP's are actually known to get along well this ISTJs (and I can confirm that). Also, my best friend is an ISTP. \n\nI often push back on using mbti type to determine who a person can get along with. Every person is different, and mbti doesn't necessarily take upbringing into account or emotional/mental health, so every person of every type is going to look different. Yes, there are trends showing which types would be less *likely* to get along with other types, but I really think it shouldn't specify "compatibility". Or maybe it should say something like, "most likely to be compatible with..." and "less likely to be compatible with..."\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or if you would like me to elaborate on anything else.\n\nHope I helped! :)
1	I took the test and it put me as ESFP, so it got my type right. I can't make a judgement on its accuracy, seeing as I don't know if it got anyone else's type right, but at least you know it got one person correct :)\n\nI still hesitate every time I take an online test (and most ones I take give me results anywhere from INFP to ENTJ). I wish more tests focused on the cognitive functions instead of only the letters (I-E, N-S, F-T, P-J).\n\nI prefer the longer tests where a person has to actually explain their thought process, but those aren't really possible online (that is, it won't give you immediate results), and it's a lot harder to type them if it's not in person.

1	CONSPIRACY THEORIES & ESFP	Hi, I'm doing a little research on personality types and conspiracy theories and if different personalities are drawn more towards certain conspiracy theories or if its just a completely individual thing to follow certain conspiracy theories. It would be great if you in the ESFP community could respond to me about if you follow any conspiracy theories and if you dont. Thanks!!
5	I subscribe to the theory that our corporate overlords secretly control every aspect of world societies using different forms of government to subscribe to stir up petty bitterness among society so that no one ever realizes that they are uaelessly sucking all the wealth from the world for over priced status symbols.
4	I don't tend to get into conspiracy theories. I don't fully know why. I guess I just don't tend to see the point and I don't believe most of them anyways. It just kind of feels like a waste of my time.
3	I don't have the attention span to go deep into every one I read but I do like reading the overview for them to kill time.
1	I followed them a lot in early college and fell deep down the rabbit hole. About a year into it I realized there is nothing I can do about it so why bother?
1	I like murder cases, missing people theories and other dark ones. 
6	How do you cheer yourself up when you're feeling lonely?	Specifically if meeting up with people at that moment is out of the question
6	I mostly just get extremely lonely I've been lonely now for over a year I mean I have more friends now that I connect with, but I would say I'm more coming out of the inferior grip side of it now.\n\nBut when I do just feel lost and bored I watch YouTube videos although it does no good and I usually stay bored and just wish I was doing the things they were.\n\nI mostly switch through many things in a short amount of time I'll go from YouTube to guitar, to bass, to piano, to reading, to guitar, sing, to listening to music, to playing bass, to playing video games, to watching Netflix.\n\nBasically I do everything that gives me a stimulation but I stop quickly because the stimulation is not the same when I do it with people and into the Ni grip I don't really know what my passions are, well used to but I get 20 times more bored then a healthy ESFPs.\n The only thing I can't do with people around is watch Netflix or YouTube videos I usually can't watch anything with people around depending on my mood but 99% I'm usually too hyper when people's around lol.\n\nBut when I was healthy and alone in my room I'd play guitar for hours or sing or play video games with friends online.
5	I get drunk and play drunken computer games.
2	I don't get lonely all that often these days, but on the days I do get bored and desire to be social, I talk with strangers on tinder. I also adopted a cat :)
2	Video games 
1	go shopping
6	INFP and likes you.	I'm an admirer of you, ESFPs. Since I'm a straight guy, I think ESFP women are great! Okay, bye :)
5	I'm a dude but why so much about ESFP women?
3	Aww thanks~
2	I'm an INFP who loves ESFP too, my boyfriend is one. :) :D 
5	Polar Opposite Question	Howdy!  INTJ here.  What are the sorts of stuff you think I would miss that's blindingly obvious to you?\n\nTrying to expand my view on learning what to look for!  Perception, if you will....
4	The simple easy solutions. \n\nINTJ's over-analyze problems, then peruse their ultimate complicated solution. We will pursue a quick and easy solution with no regard of what will happen. Most of the time, the quick and easy solution worked, and there are no problems.\n\nHere is an example. Say we want to jump over a wall. The INTJ will check to see what is on the other side of the wall before jumping. The ESFP just dives over and figures out what is on the other side of the wall while flying face first into it. Most of the time, there is nothing on the other side.
4	I don't know you personally, so this could be wrong... but a lot of INTJs I know have a problem reading social cues.  \n\nI sent a funny video to a friend of a girl hitting on a Dutch guy and when we were discussing it later, it turned out that he didn't get the punchline.  He thought I sent it to him to show how nice Dutch guys are.  Once I walked him through it, he could understand the humor behind the video but he totally missed it when watching it on his own.
2	Personality and music taste survey -- need some data to back my thesis proposal	hi, anyone you take a quick personality test https://www.truity.com/test/big-five-personality-test <-- (don't need to create an account on the site)\nthen take a survey on your music taste? https://goo.gl/forms/lzqPk8jGD6oYXEy22\nWould be huge. Help me get preliminary validation for my hypothesis, hopefully I can post the results later on.\n\n(I know it's not MTBI ¯\_(ツ)_/¯)
1	I took the survey :)
1	hey i was wondering....?	since you guys have se doesnt that mean meditation comes easily to you guys?,since se is all about being one with the moment?whats your experinces of this?,and does living in the moment make you happier?\n
3	Living in the moment very much makes me happier.  Making long term, well thought out decisions bring me no joy, even when I know I've made a good decision.
2	Meditation is practice and being in the moment of that is just taking it all in as it comes the sounds, the thoughts that's what meditating is. No one is always going to find meditation easy and some days will be harder than the other, meditation is also a play to think not just a place to be in the moment you engage your thoughts instead of ignoring them.\n\nOr you have a bad meditation day you can get comfortable, can't focus, can't get the light feeling it just depends on your day and even if you have a hard time focusing you still meditate.\n\nI'd request headspace, it's an amazing app that can train your mind and your awareness plus many more healthier things!
1	Maybe. I know I meditate, but I never really associated that with Se.
8	ESFP and Social Anxiety	Hi everyone. Just wanted your opinion on something: would you guys think it is possible to be ESFP and have social anxiety. When I'm with the right people (and they are very few) I always feel so energized and I'm so outgoing and all, but whenever I'm other social situations, I have this sudden anxiety kicking in. I want others to invite me and I want to go to social events, but at the same time I dread those situations. This leaves me very torn apart on what I want to do and who I am. Sorry for this rant, but needed somewhere to vent.
9	yes, any type can have clinical social anxiety and this is probably common for any high Fi type. chances are you don't appear as anxious as you are though. 
3	Going through the same thing and it sucks but a bit of mild anxiety medication does the trick for me, if you don't take any I'd suggest it, it won't help tremendously but it'll help enough where my hearts not pounding every time I have to be in public. 
3	I like to think that it is perfectly natural to feel some social anxiety regardless of your type.
2	That's not abnormal, but I think ESFPs might be less likely to seek out help for stuff of that nature without a bit of coaxing. Being independently-minded can be both good and bad. :(\n\nIf the anxiety isn't manageable, I would recommend talking to a professional about your options regarding counseling, medication, lifestyle changes, etc. I know how hard it is to make steps like that, but if it's for your own mental health, it's always worth it!
2	were any of you shy as children?	i read somewhere that sometimes ESFPs can be shy growing up. thoughts?
5	Yeah I was pretty darn shy. Totally not anymore. 
2	Definitely. My parents always called me their shy one. I was always very confident though, just didn't like new people. I'm the exact opposite now. :D
1	I was very shy as a child. I remember being in kindergarten and my teacher telling my mom "glitter4020 is starting to come out of her shell a little!" I had like one maybe two friends when I was young. Painfully shy. 
1	Yeah until about 8th grade
1	Extremely shy and socially awkward until freshman year of college 
5	esfp or isfp?	social yet quiet, need alone time but get restless when alone for too long, hates parties but loves getting together with friends, loves attention yet modest, humorous and always wants to be involved, needs affirmation, friendly yet skeptical, impulsive yet careful, hates loud people yet can be loud, loves making people laugh, only serious when in a bad state of mind\n\nhow would you type with this description?

4	How to deepen friendship with ESFP	**TLDR: What quality makes it easier for you ESFPs to have and maintain a close friendship with someone** \n\nHello. *waves awkwardly* I'm an INFP. I don't belong here, but I seriously need help so whoop here I is. \n\nI've known an ESFP for 3 years now and I adore her more than I've ever loved anyone. She's nothing like the narcissistic, elusive, party-clown stereotype you'd read about on a tumblr description. We were always drawn to each other but were basically strangers. Then over a month ago she broke down crying in an emotional moment and I was the one that held her. I'm still the one that holds her. We've texted every single day since then and haven't broken the streak, plus we volunteer at the same facility so I see her up to three times a week. In the beginning it was quite like the rush of burying deeper in depth, holding your breath in anticipation of what's under the waves. She would text me the second she'd wake up and we'd talk and laugh until she fell asleep. She'd visit me at work and I'd bring her gifts to her work. We clicked on all the things we had in common and were amazed by our differences. She laughed at mah sick memes, would constantly say she loved me. \n\nNow it's just not the same. She still texts me when she wakes up everyday but the conversation fizzles long before the afternoon, and I'm usually the one trying to chase the spark. She doesn't visit me anymore, or care what I think about things, doesn't laugh at my jokes as much, rarely says I love you. I feel annoying and worthless, I fear I'm losing her.\n\n In person, the last time I saw her I held her as she cried again, but that doesn't mean we really click when we talk. Mostly we just vibe. I'm very boring when we're not working on something or listening to her play music. I'm two years older, so maybe she sees me as a\n\nIf you read this, any advice? Thanks!
6	as an esfp i tend to stop giving my attention to people once it becomes tedious to do so, either because the conversations don't flow or they aren't interesting anymore. i can't tell you to become a more interesting person and i'm sure you're interesting in some ways although you say you're boring. \n\n  if there's something you're passionate about that she doesn't know, you could try telling her about it. i love when people talk to me about the things they're passionate about they get a look in their eyes that's so so wonderful. if not, maybe tell her that you miss the time yiu guys would spend together and talk about it with her, why she doesn't spend as much time with you now. 
6	I'm an INTJ with an ESFP best friend of 10 years. I've noticed he likes to collect people for his different moods. If she is always crying with you then you are the shoulder to cry on friend. Next time you get together do something fun to change her perception of you. Might not work, could just confuse her, but worth a shot. Over time you might develop into a multi mood friend. 
3	are you just friends ? seems like she thinks you're into her and trying to minimize the contact to let you know she isn't 
5	Is this a tertiary Te thing?	Do you guys tend to edit your posts multiple times before sending them off because you want them to be understood as clearly as possible?
7	No
4	Yes definitely, I'll even have a well thought out text/post/message entirely written that if I can't decide how it will come across to everyone it's intended for I'll just delete and give up on.  I would guess it's more of or secondary internal whatever because it's more of an internal conflict of how we think people will feel/think/react from said message, but then without the immediate gratification of a response (regardless of the response, we really just prefer personally interaction) don't really think it's the Te function, though know that you've peaked my interest on actually following thru on a response I find myself fixing typos and doing research to remember what I was reading earlier about it and it would make sense that if I'm entent on making a response it will be a good response.  Though after reading these run on sentences after I start losing interest because yea I think your reasoning makes sense so I'll believe you are right with that.  Anyway I think I was going to say something about the only way things get posted is if we get too bored to grammar/spell check ourselves, because come on I'm typing on a phone, and if auto correct doesn't fix it right I'm sorry it's easy to figure out the intended word most of the time (at least for us).  So yea I'm not sure how to answer because typing and proof reading does not feel like it helps with my external thinking at all, it just confuses me because I don't understand why you have to write in a different form than you would just talk to someone.  Ugh technical writing sucks.
2	Hardly. Most of the time whatever I type is my intent. No reason to 'cut twice'.
1	Not usually
1	On something I don't care about but if I'm passionate about it then I'll definitely do this.
6	ESFPs and selfies	Not gonna lie y'all take a ton of selfies. Is there a reason for this? I just don't get it. I mean if you're looking good sure but these people who post just a random resting face pic on instagram? I have no problem with it cuz ESFPs are usually hot but please explain. It can't just be vanity because I'm easily as vain.
9	I take a lot of selfies but I rarely post them online unless I'm drunk or exceptionally cute. \n\n\nI just like to know how my face looks 🙄😬
4	Cause I take priiiiiiide in my physical appearance, and it needs to be shared with the world. Durh. Lololol
6	I would never take selfie that doesn't include friends, or some activity I'm enjoying in the background; that I wish other people were enjoying with me.  While we do always take pride in how we look, I would say most of us don't like presenting ourselves as better than others so selfies only feel comfortable amongst closer friends. I know personally I feel self-conscious about presenting myself in anyway thru selfies/sensitive meme subjects on a large platform, because I have no way analyze people's true reactions and it drives me crazy not knowing what some people will think even though I don't care what people think.  At that point trying to guess how i will be perceived, by everyone I intended to see that picture, thru that picture becomes too burdensome to even decide on a selfie pose without getting bored(though if someone has figured out how to take pictures of yourself that you like, let me know, because I do find myself starting to want to post lots of things to social media (mainly to connect with friends  that aren't near me I miss  but forget about) but then having the whole perception thoughts, I'm off topic, oops).  Personally attention thru social media feels too fake and doesn't provide the necessary human interaction/contact I crave (rather be complemented in person so I know it's genuine) so personally I get bored with the idea of taking a selfie.  Although I will say if an ESFP does take lots of selfies they are probably all fantastic because if we do share something we expect everyone we shared it with to like it.  Sorry that response got long, but had thoughts coming from all angles all day on this one and actually drank enough this evening to not get bored with a long winded response that I know probably doesn't make any sense, because nothing ever makes complete sense so just enjoy what you've got working for ya 😉.  
2	I despise selfies unless it's a really special moment that I want to capture with my friends. I get tired of seeing everyone that I am friends with on social media posting pictures of themselves, and giving me long speeches about why they should love themselves. They should practice loving themselves without likes. Plus, 75% of selfies have people making the dumbest faces. I swear, some people look possessed. It used to be fun to play the "what is this person thinking or experiencing" game based off of their facial expression, but now it's just stupid.
2	I rarely take selfies. That's because cameras can sometimes lie; there were times when I took a selfie and somehow I look fatter or skinnier on the picture than I actually am. Or my face can sometimes look oilier or drier than it actually is. I really hate that. 
2	Normally they are group selfies. And if they are just me then I very rarely post them. 
1	I dont take any unless its with others
1	I rarely take selfies. I just don't really see the point. I will be in other people's selfies, but I honestly don't care enough to take them on my own phone.
1	I only share selfies when they're funny or stupid. I only send "I'm bored" selfies to my best friend. Either asking for her attention or fishing for compliments haha
9	How often do you masturbate per week?	
4	What do you guys tyink of INTJ's?	Hi, INTJ here. My best friend is an ESFP but she isn't interested in personality types or listening to me when I talk about mbti so, I was wondering what you guys think about us.
10	INTJ's always have this weird vibe. Idk how to explain it better but it does make me feel drawn to them. What I've found with one INTJ I know is that they say things that go against my Fi which really irritates me BUT I find myself coming back to them because I feel that they do offer interesting insights. I don't know if I could ever be in a relationship with an INTJ because they seem kinda uptight (sorry) but I do think they'd be a good friend. 
6	My husband is an INTJ and I'm an ESFP. 
3	I think they're amazing.
3	My best friend/cousin is a INTJ. I really enjoy how analytical and organised he is. Its a refreshing view from my own.
3	Overall, I genuinely like INTJs. They're pretty quirky (in a good way), intense, genuine, and low-maintenance.   \nThat being said I get incredibly frustrated when they get into a 'my way or the highway' mentality. \nAdditionally most of the INTJs I know could live to at least try to invest/initiate more into our friendship. But that's bleeding into my personal life.
1	Like as friends or more than friends?
1	I don't know if I could ever be in a relationship with an INTJ because they seem kinda uptight = same here,  but there're some less uptight so you can actually date them, which i did and it was fun.  but it's also too hard, so never again lol
1	A bit late, and also not an ESFP, but they *are* your dual partner which theoretically means you're the ideal match for each other.
4	ESFP after a 2 year relationship	So. Dated girl. Intp. \nShit I learnt about myself. \nI need to go outside more. As a kid I did this all the time. \nI don't need romance, I need friendship. I thought going into all this that romance and stuff from Rom coms was legit. Found out that I just need a great time with a mate. \nI don't like not having options. I love to do what I want when I want how I want. It's all rather spontaneous. \nI value others opinions very highly. \nI love meeting new people. Especially if they are fun and out going. I always gravitated towards introverts but having been with one extroverts are fantastic\nSingle and mingling. \nFun loud and possibly funny times ahead xD
4	New Flares for r/ESFP	Hey everyone! About 6 months ago, I added flares to this subreddit. I never gave any formal announcement about it at the time, but I thought I should still let you all know (better late than never!). Feel free to update yours so people can know your type.\n\nThanks! Have a great day!
3	Flairs* btdubs. Thanks though! 
2	At some point can we have a banner. Its gotta be tottaly amazing and funky and awesome though. Might have to make a submissions post / ideas post
9	ESFP type in depth description by Stratiyevskaya (Socionics SEE "Caesar")	
3	How do you start a conversation?	I love talking about stupid and deep stuff!\n\nThe only problem is that I have no fucking clue what to say to catch people's attention with a question.\n\nCould you please give me some examples of what to ask to someone you don't know?
5	I honestly am in the same boat as you. I completely suck at small talk. Although, a good friendship I had started by me going up to them and saying, "Hi, nice to meet you. I'm terrible at small talk and have no idea what to say." We then bonded over or mutual hatred of small talk and started a genuine friendship. \n\nEither that, or I just ask someone how their life is going. If they give the generic "fine" sort of answer, I ask what makes it fine and stuff like that (and then gauge if they actually are wanting to talk more about it). I ask a lot of "why" questions and "what makes it that way" and "in what way" sort of questions and then just sort of go from there. I don't know if that answers your question, but I've found doing stuff like that to be very helpful when you already have a basic relationship started with another person and are just looking for ways to get deeper with them.\n\nDoes this answer your question or was this not quite what you were looking for?
3	I usually talk about something stupid like "how's the weather today" but depending on what they said, I'm usually able to carry the conversation and it will drift off to something else that is totally unrelated to the weather.\n\nOr I'll say something that I've been thinking about recently eg I'll lament about being unable to watch Dunkirk because I didn't have time, but I really want to watch it because the soundtrack is excellent and the topic about movies will probably start...provided the person I'm talking to responds to me of course.\n\nESFP here btw
2	I find something unique or fascinating about that person and then go from there. Usually you can find something if the person is worth talking to, why talk at all then if you cant?
2	Interestingly, I'm the contrary. \n\nHere's what I do - say something kind weird.\n\nI open convos with chats about parking tickets, calzones, etc and put a Seinfeld-esque spin on it.
8	Article about Se	Hey everyone! If you're looking for a great article about the Neuroscience of Se, then please check out this article (recommended to me by /u/daelyte ) \n\nhttp://www.geekpsychology.com/neuroscience-of-the-berserker/\n\nHave a great day, everyone!
1	Thoughts on racism?	Independiently of what happened in Charolettesville, what do you think about ethnical segregation/racism?\n\nDo you support it? If so, what are your reasons to support it?
8	This is 100% one of the most fruitless things you could ask this subreddit. 
4	It's all bad and I don't support it
5	ESFP here.\n\nI definitely do not support racism or racial segregation.  With racism, there is an implication that one race is superior.  I find that this line of thinking is highly illogical and ethically unjustifiable.\n\nLet me be clear that I've seen racism from all races, not just from Caucasians of European descent.  There is an us vs. them mentality that dehumanizes people.  As an ESFP, I know that every person is a unique individual.  I do not want to judge based on the color of someone's skin or where they were born.  I will judge on people's actions and beliefs, though.  And if you are unable to look beyond the color line, then I do not want you in my life.\n\nESFP's have pretty strong ethics due to our Fi-aux.  I think you would find it hard to find an ESFP here who supports racism.
2	I don't like it. 
1	...are you trying to find some correlation between mbti type and racists attitudes? 
1	Who cares, can't we all just get along?
1	I am absolutely against it. Racism goes against virtually every one of my values (especially my values about being yourself and being accepted for being yourself).
1	I feel like I can fall into making instaneous judements based off stereotypes that I can be overexposed to, but I'm quick to realize where these judgments come from.  I also rely on the fact that I rarely have bad experiences with any person regardless of race once becoming aquainted with them.  But we definitely all are also understanding and accepting of everyone, unless you some you manage to irreparablely offend one us somehow, which can happen but takes a lot to do.
3	Confrontation	I fucking hate confrontation so much. I wish I could get better at communication when uncomfortable events happen. I would rather keep the peace and hold back rather than having it blow up in my face. I don't know, I feel like it makes me kinda fake?! I'll just ignore what's bothering me for the sake of not having to bother with drama. \n\nHow do I work on this?! 
2	Head over to ENFP and share. Our sub is extremely active. Chances are you'll probably get some useful feedback, we love to analyze everything. Haha hope you find something helpful. (:
2	A combination of practice and mindfulness, generally. It helps to practice on smaller things, like if your friend group is bickering over something relatively inconsequential. And on the other hand it can be helpful to just generally be mindful of when you're avoiding something that needs to be dealt with, and either actually deal with it, or at least make yourself aware of your own behavior so you can better address it next time. 
2	I actually see it as a good thing.. I don’t have to waste my time confronting someone who doesn’t matter, as long as I can keep doing my thing
2	Life is too short to hold back. Yesterday, a librarian chided me for not standing in the right spot in line, even though nobody was behind me. I told him that I'll be using the automated checkout from now on because those robots provide better customer service than he does. \n\nNow, I could have responded with even more sting if I put more thought into it. But it felt really good just to be able to retaliate and defend myself. I'd rather have it "blow up in my face" than look like a victim in front of others. Don't fear confrontation; expect it whereever you go and embrace it. I'm also an ESFP, by the way.
2	I let most things slide unless it was something really big and absolutely not acceptable. In which case i'll straight up ask "what the fuck was that about?" If it was a work situation, i'd be like "let's discuss our ways of working"
1	I don't mind trying to get a rise out of people, but it definitely freaks me out if I accidentally push it to far into a unintended confrontation.  Its weird because I tend to feel offended they got mad and me and just make it worse intentionally, but then feel really bad about having upset/angered someone.  I also tend to feel whatever the other party feels (or I guess I feel like they feel which is probably not always right) but yea confrontation sucks because it's just a whirlwind of quick emotions that you aren't sure what to make of as soon as it's over.  I really appreciate the personality types the re cognize the need to apologize even when both parties may be in the wrong, because if you walk away angry I'll probably be quietly angry with you about that argument for a while unless the confrontation is recognized as just that a momentary thing and that there was no harm no foul, then things are very easily forgiven.
1	if i hate someone or something - just give me a reason and i will explode into your face or well will confront you right away. Tho i don't like to be the one bringing things up but sometimes you have to because there's no one else to help you out 
4	Hello Motherfuckers! It is I, An ENTP! I'm here to party and collect data.	I'm researching how the different MBTI types like to be asked out/approached romantically for an article, and would like (semi) serious answers. So, if someone was interested in you, whether it be a friend or a stranger in a bar, how would you appreciate someone asking you out in a romantic fashion?\n\nThank you!\n
5	Reading the titles you wrote for the threads in other subreddits is all sorts of hilarious. 
4	I don't like to be asked out on the spot by someone I don't know well. I would rather have a relationship form organically from a friendship. I am not against having said person ask me out in a romantic way though. If I didn't know them well, I would be flattered, but would likely decline (or maybe go on one date and see where it goes. It's hard to say what I would do. I tend to live in the moment.)
3	I don't appreciate getting asked out in a romantic fashion. I like hanging out... casually.. then things usually develop from there. 
3	INTJ here. I would like the female to do all the leg work so I don't have to risk my feelings or reputation. \n\nESFP women I assume you know how to PM me. 
2	Classy and on the DL. 
2	ESFP dude and I have a really hard time asking anyone out, a constant struggle because I have a constant fear of rejection (almost even more with people I like that I know like me) but I'm starting to think it may be because of that dominant function thing and I'm scared of missing out on another opportunity.  I know that I think about it sometimes there is almost an instant thought of you know I don't want to date this person because I really like them but I don't think I can marry them, but if I start dating them it's going to be very hard to end it without hurting their feelings and literally start over thinking timelines in the extreme distant future that whenever i do actually have time to self reflect on make absolutely no sense.  So to answer the question personally the best relationships have been ones with instant connections where I'm approached and feel appreciated without feeling like I've been my overly extroverted self yet.  Which is weird but we may be a love at first sight type personally since we work well with multiple, but I think I'm attracted instantly to chicks with my same personally type, but tend to build stronger feelings towards more intorverted types I get to know well.  Though nothing tends to last due to whatever it is that tends to scare me even though I really desire the companionship.
1	just come and talk to me, make friends with me first and maybe we can have drinks soon again , i need to trust you that you're interested in me as in person and not just for a one night stand
2	Chasing an ESFP?	She seems pretty cool... But how to get her interest and keep it?\n\nENFP male here, would appreciate anything you guys have :-)
4	Be able to carry a conversation. The last handful of dates/guys I've hung out with have been SO. BORING. I don't want to be the person putting all the effort in with starting a conversation. Or starting a topic, saying one sentence about that topic, then moving to another unrelated topic. Is being able to hold a conversation really that f'in difficult these days??? Dating is abysmal.
4	Just talk to her and find out what she's interested in. Also, ESFPs usually love to flirt a lot, so don't worry about being too forward. :)
2	Come up with new activities, new places for you and her to try for every date. Keep it spontaneous!
1	oh god, enfp better don't do it, you will suffer both
4	How do you feel about INFJs?	I'm an INFJ and my closest friends have always been ESFPs. I think ESFPs are adorable and I really admire their strong Se because they notice details I overlook. I also love their Fi because it makes them so independent. ESFPs have this cute, innocent charm that draws me in.
3	Best friend is an INFJ. I love her, but sometimes she can annoy the hell out of me.\n\nI've been asking her to hang out for a while, and she turned me down due to a school project. Fine, no problem at all. But yesterday, when she found out that I was spending time by myself (just jogging, doing errands, etc.) when I could have been with her, she gave me shit for it. I pointed out her hypocrisy, and I only refrained from lashing out due to our friendship. \n\nShe also got nervous because a guy she was dating stopped texting her with the same frequency as in the beginning of the relationship. Lol, maybe that dude has a life outside of talking to you? \n\nHowever with all that said, her strengths do compliment mine. She's excellent at reading people and their motives, not just on the superficial level of snap judgments. She's also optimistic about others and always sees the best in them, whereas I allow the negative aspects to eclipse the positive ones. Sometimes I almost wish I could be as empathetic as she is, but then I would have trouble letting go of the toxic people in my life. \n
2	ESFPs and INFJ are very similar but in my experience, the INFJ judging can cause problems in the relationship. I have an INFJ friend who becomes quite irrational when criticized for simple things and that can be grating to an ESFP who likes everything to be pleasant. We give criticism and we take it calmly and INFJ are more likely to make a scene. \n\nMaking a scene is an ESFP pet peeve. \n\nThey are a boon to have when working with them on a team because of their advocacy, and they will defend their friends valiantly which is respectable but they are a bit too high strung to hang out with all the time when you are an EFSP who likes to go with the flow. \n\nLike ESFPs they are good creators if they can keep up their motivation. 
1	Best friend is ESFP. mmmm they are the best. They're loyal friends that always stay by your side.\n\n"I really admire their strong Se because they notice details I overlook" \nDefinitely, one time when we were heading to the movie theater, my ESFP friend found a movie ticket on the ground and managed to exchange it for a free ticket. I didn't even notice it on the ground.\n
2	Why are ESFPs so popular.	Why
15	The functions conveniently come together to result in an adaptable, generally pleasant social presence most of the time. 
7	We are friendly and outgoing. People feel comfortable around us.
6	Why not
2	we're the nicest people on the planet! 
2	we are honest and it's easy to read us which means people trust us 
1	I think we're one of the most considerate of others. We read body language well and we're feelers. So.... 
1	ESFPs have the most right brained personality. They have a constant flow of social energy, and are always able to engage with people. Most of the other MBTI personalities are jealous of at least one of their many qualities. \n\nBenefits of being a (healthy) ESFP- \n- Ability to smoke massive amounts of weed and still feel fine\n- Always able to tune into the moment\n- Not prone to anxiety\n- Popular in all social settings\n- Ability to be automatically respected by others \n- Always knows self \n- Ability to connect with God quicker than all other personality types. Often times simply by looking up at the stars and thinking, listening to music, etc. 
13	Any clingy ESFPs out there?	I'm a 25F ESFP and I'm clingy af. I hate this trait about myself and I wish I could care less. When I hit it off with a person they infiltrate my mind and I want to spend all my time with them. Unfortunately it seems the other person rarely feels the same, or perhaps I'm scaring them away. I think I am constantly so desperate for attention when I receive it from the opposite sex a switch turns on in my brain and I think they're interested and I just want to snapchat them all day and talk to them all day and wonder why they want to do things with other people????\n\nCrazy I know. Any advice how to break this crappy trait of mine? How do I care less and think of other things besides someone who will probably ghost me in a couple days?
6	[deleted]
6	To echo delrey, I think a lot of this comes from a lack of confidence in yourself and your own value. You cling to other people like life rafts because the scraps of validation they give you make you feel good about yourself. And unfortunately this kind of desperate clinginess scares people off because when it's bad it's invasive and toxic to them. \n\nYou should spend these next few years figuring yourself out as an independent person. Form opinions, find hobbies, think about what you value and don't value, your strengths and weaknesses. Be happy being yourself and you won't need to keep people around to only feel okay. You'll  keep people around because you choose to- because they complement your life and personality, not fill in for it.   
2	you weren't by chance r/raisedbynarcissists?
1	Yes! Finally a post about this! I don't have much to add but just want to put my agreement out there lol!
1	What are your best friends like, and what do you like most about them?	
3	[deleted]
2	It's very hard to define best friend for us.
1	I'm not asking about their personality type though. At the end of the day, that doesn't tell me much about a person. 
1	But all my best friends I met in high school, went to college with most of and all of us party.  I love hanging out / being friends with people I know love being friends with me.  If I can't tell how you feel about me or you constantly do things I quietly find offensive I'll look for a way to distance myself.
1	My best friends are the few I keep in touch with by text or by phone. And the ones I make plans for, to visit them, or like taking a trip together. The rest of my friends it feels like a chore to text them, and I only visit them if by chance I happen to travel to where they're at. Example, I plan a visit to see my best friend in another city, and because I'm in that city, I'll message all the friends I have there in advance so I can hang out with them a bit.\n\nSo I guess, my best friends are the ones who are still my friends when we're apart ?\n\nI have three best friends and I'm not great at typing but I believe two of them are ISFPs. We can talk about meaningful personal stuff, or meaningful philosophical stuff, but we can also just hang out and say the word "dude" or "cuz" or "gurl" to eachother for 10 minutes straight. Or start doing military salutes to eachother in the middle of sentences for no reason, and these things just happen. And our time hanging out is always very chill, like listening to music and watching videos together or just being in the same room and doing different things and being like "hey come see that thing it's really cool", unless we get drunk and then we act cuhrazy ! But I am always the cuhraziest. And we just get along really well, there's rarely anyone getting upset.\n\nMy third best friend is I believe an ENTP. And oh boy it's very different with him. We argue all the time, about everything. But it's very stimulating so I like hanging out with him. I mean everytime we talk about something serious, like politics, films, art, society, whatever, we end up disagreeing and fighting. And sometimes we just get really upset and it happened a couple times that we stopped talking to each other for a couple months. But when we are acting silly, he's a great match for me. He's better than me in new social settings and especially in these settings he is very silly and is very irreverent, like talking about the giant turd he just pooped to people he just met, so he's kind of like a catalyst between me and other people at parties and stuff like that. When we get wicked drunk together it gets pretty groovy and stupid. I tend to take the initiative more when it's just us two getting wicked drunk.
6	Lost and confused ESFP with strict family... What do I do now?	It seems i've been trying to force myself into conventional jobs like doctor, lawyer, engineer because of my strict upbringing and traditional parents, an its always made me feel sick. I always dread thinking about a 9-5 career and often exaggerate that id rather die.  But having recently discovered that Im an ESFP i wonder, what jobs should I be looking at? I feel guilty not pursuing something academic (respectable), but then I feel miserable when im there. Im also already in college and have changed my major about 3 times... any advice would be appreciated. Im just trying to make sense of my life. Also I used to be very into art and music but had to stop because of university, and now i cant find the motivation to pick it all back up, partly because my skills have gone to shit :/
4	Perhaps you could take a break from college to gain a better sense of direction? I tried out a wide variety of jobs before I was able to figure out my long-term career. As an ESFP, I'm assuming you might be people-centric so maybe healthcare (don't have to confine yourself into being a doctor here), HR, and psychology (you could do art therapy?) are potential options. Idk, just throwing ideas at you
2	As a doctor, lawyer or engineer, you'd find your peers to be more or less soul crushing. They are the cold robots of this world. Maybe a little less so for medicine, but yeah, no, not for an ESFP. You're right. Try these links. Take the Big Five Personality Test too. Search for the US Dept of Labor Career Outlook Handbook. Do. not. drop. out. of. school. But I agree something in healthcare could be a satisfying fit with excellent job prospects. (ie: therapist of some sort) The problem in creative fields is stiff competition for jobs and you'd have to be willing to move periodically. \n\nhttp://personalitypage.com/html/ESFP_car.html\n\nhttps://www.123test.com/career-test/
2	Whatever career you pick, don't forget that it is not your life. As long as you have a life outside of work, it doesn't matter what job you have. Every-time I am working, I always know I have stuff after it to look forward to, which wouldn't be possible if it wasn't for the security that work provided me.\n\nAlso, just start doing art. Stop giving yourself so much pressure. No one says you can't be shit at it and still have fun.
1	I was the same and am just now finding out after having worked as an Aerospace Engineer for 5 years 😅.  If you are realizing it know you will always be miserable, but my job provides me enough flexibility/stability/status to suite my lifestyle.  You are naturally good with people so your loved around the office and you can be the center of attention, but it helps I'm around a young work force that's not particularly strict.  Also I was raised by two J types so I've become very adaptable around the type of person I interact with regularly at work, but do really struggle with motivation towards the monotonous tasks that I tend to let build.  I love my job though and am glad I got to where I am (thanks to those J types providing me that external motivation my whole life), but you couldn't pay me to put myself through 4 years of Aerospace Engineering again even having already have done it🤔.
2	How would you best explain and describe your type (ESFP) to a person who knows nothing about Myers-Briggs?	No need to be technical.  I just want to know how you perceive yourselves and others specific to this type.  What do you notice that resonates with the ESFP personality type? Instead of “traits or characteristics” that are so often used within the Myers-Briggs terminology, I would like to hear examples, stories, and/or perspectives you can offer.  I plan on posting this question in each Myers-Briggs specific subreddit to help foster understanding and create insight through first person experiences and perceptions. 
5	I'm a doer, and not a thinker. People like me, and I like people. 
6	Our thoughts are deeper than most, because we only think about things that matter. \nWe love people, because people are more important than most of the other nonsense that goes on in the world. \nWe treat others with great respect, because they are people, and they deserve it. \nWe like to do things, many things, and we may be hard to keep up with, or uncomfortable if you like doing nothing.\nWe are usually very positive.\nWe may affirm you, ALOT.
1	I need gift advice!	I need advice for what to buy a 15-16 year old (girl) esfp for her birthday
2	Something she will have fun with and use. For me a good frisbee, a board game/card game. (I would recommend Batman fluxx) esfp's love to be doing things with people. 
1	I hate receiving gifts. But yes, something we can do with others. Maybe a ticket to a theme park for them and a friend? 
1	Skip the gift. I like the amusement park idea.\n
3	How to develop Ni?	
7	Hang out with INTJs.
4	Keep asking yourself "what if?" for several subjects, and don't be afraid to come up with absurd scenarios
5	ESFP description by Victor Gulenko (Socionics SEE "Caesar")	
5	ESFP feeling very ISFP	While I always come up with an ESFP, and it makes a lot of sense to me, I struggle with introversion when I become sad or self-critical.  How do you guys combat that? Without throwing yourself into a social situation and ending up even less satisfied.
3	Hi! I have depression and I've been seeing a psych about it. It's about mentally PUSHING yourself out of those moods. I've also been reading about the 5 second rule, and whenever you feel yourself starting to get OVERLY sad or OVERLY critical, to count 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 and snap yourself out of it.\n\nThat being said, it's normal to feel sad, or self-critical to an extent. Where it becomes debilitating or you spiral into a mental pit is when it's not okay
8	Friend Group Role	Now we all know ESFP's are the performer or the entertainer. Does this ring true in your friend group? What's your role and what do you bring to your friend group?
9	I'm always the butt of everyone's jokes, and I also wear the least clothes most often.
7	I'm always the one to plan get togethers and I always run into someone else I know while we are out and they join us. I talk to everyone and make jokes constantly. Gotta make sure everyone is having a fun time. 
7	Definitely true. I'm always embarrassing myself to make people laugh. I'm always the one that's always very "interesting/special" and I always start the inside jokes within the friend group. It brings some life to the group.
1	I'm actually one of TWO entertainers in my friend group. We don't butt heads though, because we each have our niche. He is the goofy and corny entertainer, I'm the sarcastic and edgy entertainer. \n\n\nAlthough, I haven't the slightest clue as to what his MBTI is. It's possible that he is an ESFP too, but we are different sub-types. I haven't gotten into sub-types much yet, because I'm sort of a newbie. 
5	ENFP looking for advice about the ESFP I'm hooking up with (Might as well get to the point.)	So I met my colleague when I started my new job about a year ago. We became friends quickly, although we took longer to become close friends. I'm ENFP, he's ESFP. Basically we started hooking up together really gradually - probably a bad idea because we work together, but it seems to suit us. He always told me he doesn't want a relationship, and I've never tried to change his mind on this. But recently, he's been ignoring me a little bit and acting withdrawn, as if our friendship doesn't matter to him, when it's always seemed to matter hugely in the past. He's always been really private, so I know there's no point asking him to explain what's going on. But basically, I don't understand why it is he doesn't want a relationship when we get on so well as friends as well as, y'know, the other stuff. Also, why the brush-off? Am I just too needy? Wondering if I should just break it off... Jeez. I wasn't expecting to get upset over all this, but well, I actually kind of am. Any advice or potential explanations very welcome.  
7	He's just not that into you. Sorry, I know it's hard
5	I dip and dive into and out of close friendships, sometimes with almost no reason at all. Normally my focus has changed or someone was interesting and I wanted to be part of something interesting. If care about a friend though i wont ever leave ill just have periods of downtime. Basically he might come back and things will resume or they might not. As always though, be interesting and look interesting.\nAlso some decent comments from other ppl as well here and there are a lot more post like yours so go read them on here. 
3	My guess: He's probably trying to distance himself and you from each other, since it sounds like you've had the "do we want to be in a relationship?" talk in the past and his takeaway was "no." And now that you're showing signs of wanting to push it further, even though you guys had a discussion on it already, he's withdrawing from you because it makes him uncomfortable. \n\nSide note, just because you're good as friends and you're good as hookup buddies does not necessarily mean you're going to be good in a stable long term relationship. 
1	Sounds like he's over it. I know those feels suck...but if ever someone just wants to hook up and doesn't really give af about a relationship or wants to hide it from everyone....just run the other way. By him distancing himself he has already broken it off with you.\n\nNo matter how many times I told myself in the past "Sure we can be FWB! That'll work!" i always get attached and sad when I'm the one getting "broken up" with or distanced or whatever you wanna call it. My advice is delete him from your phone and say F it basically. Do not give him another chance. He will prolly come back around to you if no one else is giving him attention or he hasn't gotten any in a while....but that's all he wants. Doesn't give af about your feelings and he's already prolly found someone else.\n\nHarsh reality I've had to deal with time and time again. I have learned my lesson this time, but it took many years and many mistakes.
1	[Academic] Perceptions of Self and Intimacy (20-35yo)	Hey there, hope you don't mind me attempting to pick your brains for a minute - I got good participation levels from other MBTI groups so I thought I'd extend it to all groups and try to get a more representative sample. FYI - the study is not collecting personality type information.\n\nMy dissertation for my masters in psychology is looking into one possible explanation for avoidance behaviours in forming intimate relationships. If you are 20-35yo and keen to contribute to my study then you can do so by following the link below. Any questions give me a shout, also I'm happy to discuss and hear your thoughts on the subject off the record if you want! It should't take too long but you're free to stop at any point anyway. It may cause some emotional distress as it involves some self evaluation so if you experience any discomfort and would like some guidance please get in touch.\n\nI will leave the survey open until the end of this week.\n\nCheers! \nhttps://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/F3BXHWN

3	What is Anger to you?	Kinda a weird thing to ask, I guess, but I wanted to see what like minded people's responses would be!\n\nAnger, more often than not, is marked down with negative societal connotations. It's seen as irrational, unnecessary and generally a bit shit. \n\nI have always used anger as a focus point. Making the connotations a bit more muddy, for me - as in they're not wholly negative. Anything that made me feel unsure or insecure - anxiousness, indecision, confusion, uncertainty - I've funnelled into anger, as in the past I wasn't quite equipped with the mental patience to properly deal with those separate emotions individually.\n\nNow this doesn't mean that every time I felt these things, I would break out in a blind fury and release the beast within. It's actually the opposite. I used it to focus myself. I used anger to motivate myself and spur myself into action to eradicate the source these feelings. \n\nHell, I even used it get through my high school exams.\n\nI definitely am not the only person in the world who feels that anger isn't a wholly negative emotion - that you can manipulate that vigour to benefit yourself. \n\nBrings me to ask, what is anger to you? How do you experience anger? \n\nBig love <3
3	Anger is not a negative emotion, always.. It's when you're coming off a place of defence when it becomes negative and obssesive.\n\nBut anger in general is there to motivate us to reach our point better, it's the manifestation of your passion into words, tones, etc..\n\nFor me, anger is something I havn't let myself express at all around anyone but my mother.. You gotta let it out though.\n\n

3	How do you impress an ESFP?	Is it clothes? I already dress to impress
10	Be pleasing in all manners of aesthetics because they will first notice all sensory details about you, and then carry yourself in a way that makes it seem you hold the secrets of the universe in your mind. (I'm joking, but I'm not.)
6	Show that u are fun, and u like having fun.
2	Be willing to hear his/her endless ramblings, and act accordingly\n\nBoom, best friends forever
1	offer us opportunities to go on adventures, have fun and do (depends) daring, reckless and unconventional things. we like excitement, and if there's one thing we can't resist, it's someone who can keep us on our toes. (i'm an esfp) bonus points for great banter and an open mind.
7	ESFP - 3d Model	
1	This seems more entp/enfp/entj rather than esfp.\n\nEntp looking on and bathing in the crowd's attention or Enfp singing and affecting the audience with feels. Entj raising arms as if acting as, "Right? Agree with me!" while leading a motivational speech or business panel.\n\nEsfp wouldn't be positioned so stiffly and should bend towards the mic rather than the audience, if singing. This is because Esfps are more sensing oriented and tend to be more focus on the action rather than the reactions.\n\nIf talking casually the structure should be more expressive and causally laidback and arms more widespread, body lending backwards.\n\ntl;dr My feedback is that the model isn't passionate enough and the only thing that really makes it esfp is the microphone. 
3	Help me improve my relationship with my ESFP mom?	I am an INFP but my mom types ESFP.  I really want to improve my relationship with her because we clash constantly and it's exhausting.  She is very highly-strung, gets angry easily and lashes out verbally and physically.  Then she'll turn around and expect me to give her a big hug and listen to her tell me all about her day, which frankly I'm not interested in after I've just been screamed at.  I just don't know how to handle it.  We disagree on anything and everything - my career choices, my social life, religious and political issues.  Even when I want to agree with her she presents her arguments in such a harsh and unbalanced way that I resent her for it.  How can we reconcile our personality differences?
7	I hope someone on here can help you out. These issues don't sound particularly related to her MBTI type to me though. She sounds like a bit of a narcissist, although I could be way off base. If you think it's possibly the case, I know there is a sub for kids with narcissistic parents. Again, I hope I'm wrong and someone can help you out through an ESFP lens!  
5	Wow that sounds complex. If i were you I'd get her in a good mood just tell her what you think. Say you want to preserve a good healthy relationship and you feel that the way you are being treated is unfair. Acknowledge that she does apologize but it keeps happening so you want to help. I think if you say it in a caring way and under the idea of preserving the relationship it should go pretty well. 
1	i'm an esfp - i don't have any infp family members but my ex is an infp. as an esfp, i kind of think that while her temper seems volatile, she probably doesn't mean harm. esfps have Fi which is supposed to help us take care of others' feelings well and serve them but in the case of an unhealthy esfp they make them callous to others' feelings, stubborn, prone to outbursts and self-centred. your mom sounds like she's an unhealthy esfp - perhaps she's under a lot of stress? or that could be narcissism, which can be caused by unresolved childhood trauma. \nas for her 'immediately expecting you to hug her', i think it might be caused by her inner struggle/manipulative tendencies. esfps (especially female esfps) are rather intimidated by displays of anger, particularly when they are from those who we percieve as 'nice people', or shall i say, 'harmless people'. my infp ex used to be really easygoing and chill all the time (most of the infps i know give me that vibe) so when he got mad he'd scare me. i'd automatically panic and act like a child that needs comfort, kind of because we just want the scariness to go away. so i guess i could be that. or if she's being manipulative, then it could be her attempting to elicit a positive reaction so you'll be more likely to bend to her requests/confuse you/emotionally abuse you so you feel guilty for something that isn't your fault. sorry for such a long rant lol\n!TL;DR could be an unhealthy esfp, narcissism, her natural esfp tendencies or her being manipulative.
4	Your best friend.	This is sorta for me sorta for a friend.\nI'm an ESFP and he's and INTJ l. One of my very best friends.\nWhat type is your best mate or mates? \nMy INTJ is going back to college to study psychology and I sorta just wanted to find out who other ESFPs hang out with. 
2	My closest friends: ESFJ; ENFP\n\nMy oldest friends: ENTP; ENFP; ISFJ\n\nMy go-to-to-do-dumb-shit-with friends: ESTP; INTP
2	My three closest friends are an INFJ, an ENFJ, and an ENFP I'm interested in.
1	My oldest friend is an ISTP (also my boyfriend). My two best friends of the past few years are both male INTJ's and they're both grad students. Pretty sure the vast majority of my good friends throughout my life have been IxTx.
1	INTJ and ENTPs have meshed well with me, along with a few diplomat types. I think sentinels are slightly more likely to get frustrated with me. Really patient sentinels are aight.
1	2 INFPS. Which I connected to very easily, they also developed my Fi a LOT. and also Ne.\n\nINTJ, Took me a long time to figure out how to even approach a conversation with, but when I understood how to, I also started to really accept him.\n\n
1	Closest and best friend I've ever had is ENFP.
6	How do you find ESFP different from ENFP?	I've been reading about both types, and often they seem so very similar. I do understand the difference between N and S, but I was wondering how you guys see the differences between the two types? Most of what I've been reading is from ENFP perspective, so I'm quite curious...!
9	I'm an ESFP and my sister is an ENFP. We're very close and hold very similar values. I have 6 siblings (we're all very close) and she's the one I relate to the most. There are very few ways that we AREN'T alike, but I'll see if I can't list a few:\n\n1) She is much better at participating in the NT conversations/debates that we get involved in. She thrives in that atmosphere. I can get just as involved but it can be exhausting and I need an Ni break, even if I'm enjoying the conversation.\n\n2) We have opposite decision weaknesses. I tend to jump into things relying on my spontaneity and/or adaptibility. Even though I'm good at it, it has certainly bitten me in the ass a few times. On the other hand, my sister is very hesitant/cautious and overthinks things, sometimes to the point of missing good opportunities.\n\n3) I'm a bottom-line kinda girl. I like it when things are succinct and final. She's more likely to tip-toe around ideas to find every possible variable before moving forward. Both of these can be useful or harmful, depending on the situation.\n\nThese are the main differences that I experience with my ENFP sister. I'm sure these differences change with each individual person and relationship, but I hope this helped in some way. :)\n\n
5	This turned out to be a long post. At any rate, I hope that it's helpful.\n\nI had a "friend" once who was quite possibly the world's shittiest ENFP. This is not the standard for the type, but IMO extreme examples are the best for "compare-and-contrast" style questions, so here we go.\n\nENFPs seem to spend most of their lives "in the air" about things. I REALLY like this metaphor for them; it's a very potent description. By that, i mean that it describes who they are on A LOT of different levels (with as few abstractions as possible). \n\nThe flipside to being in the air is that ENFPs are particularly prone to becoming ungrounded. In particularily bad cases (involving either severe stress and/or mental health problems), the ENFP can become so ungrounded that they become trapped "in the grip" of their Inferior-Si. \n\nOne frequent manifestation of this (that I was subjected to firsthand) is a strong (and hypocritical) preoccupation with *boundaries.* Everything with her was either about "tearing down these [oppressive] walls" or the importance of protected "safe spaces". [All the while ignoring the fact that tearing down walls *implies that she is an invader,* and having a "protected" space fundamentally requires... *walls!* Still drives me mental thinking about it.]\n\nAnyway, the problem (from the ESFP perspective) is that ENFPs never consider what actually *makes* the metaphor (*e.g.* "the wall") so potent. They just lob the phrase around like it's a hand-grenade. Which essentially makes an ENFP "in the grip" just look like a shitty, knock-off version of an ESFP. **We pretty much only look the same if one of us is being shitty.**\n\nPotency (and specifically power) are perceived through the domain of Extraverted Sensing. This is true for all types, with ESxPs being the most naturally gifted. The types least able to process Se-information are the xNxPs (with INxPs at the absolute bottom). For ENFPs, Se is their "role function." This position is all about "should-ofs" and is prone towards narcissistic injuries (even in the best of us). Meaning that it's also what we're most likely to project onto other people when we're feeling inadequate within ourselves.\n\nThe Si-gripped ENFP is childish when it comes to Se. In comparison to Si-doms (who default to ignoring Se-data, but can wield it appropriately when necessary) the Si-gripped ENFP will refuse to accept any Se-data, except for what fits into two categories: *"proof that I'm good"* and *"proof that you're bad!"*\n\nSo the "truth" (especially concerning the role of power) is only considered as valid as the Si-gripped ENFP can weaponize it. Which is complete shit when they start projecting that mentality onto *other* people. Inferior-Si screams "I am a victim!"  (potentially for years at a time) and the ENFP explodes at just about anyone who "wrongs" them (the only prerequisite is knowing they'll get away with it.)\n\nMy ENFP shit-tier former friend acted exactly like you'd expect a shit-tier ESFP to act: like a manipulative, histrionic scumbag. She'd openly talk about how using sex to manipulate people made her feel powerful. And that's just the tip of the iceberg, she was a genuine monster.\n\nWhat I learned is that shit-tier ENFPs tend to see walls only in terms of "something that *creates outsiders.*" It's narcisstic, shallow, and insanely hypocritical. They like to identify themselves as the "most unique" (which complete gibberish; you can't rank most "one of a kind" to least "one of a kind"... it's just one of a kind. That's all there is.) Being afflicted with such a painful "uniqueness" makes them feel as though they are perpetual "outsiders." And they are willing to screw people over in exchange for the opportunity to "tear down walls." It can be on the societal or between individuals (where the "walls" are appropriate emotional boundaries.) In either case, ENFPs at their worst are much more socially destructive than ESFPs (even at their worst).\n\nIn the case of my former friend, it seemed that whenever she wasn't trying to let the cold air in, she was letting the hot air out. In any case, shit-tier ENFPs like to mess with people's houses and call it justified.
4	I'd like to think I'm more stable(?) than the average ENFP. A little more organized, more pragmatic etc. ENFPs are usually type cast as the manic pixie dream girls, and I don't think that would be an accurate way of describing me. I'm not really the "head in the clouds" person.  I'm less of a dreamer and more of a doer. 
5	Many of my closest friends are ESFPs/ENFPs and almost every single girlfriend of mine has been one of the two. Interestingly I have spent the past weeks thinking about exactly this!\n\nTo me they look on the surface similar. Very outgoing, bubbly, fun, charming, great conversationalists. They keep things lighthearted, casual, enjoyable. They are extremely caring and kind to others. Fantastic friends, always lifting everyone's spirits around them. \n\nI think the difference is exactly what you would expect with the difference in their primary function, Se vs Ne. ESFPs live entirely in the present moment, do not like theoretical discussions, do not like to listen to worries, elaborate plans about the future, go into deep conversations about emotions, highly intellectual/theoretical topics like politics, spirituality, etc. (sure some can do this, but to a much lesser degree). ENFPs on the other hand live in their dreams, and for every thousand possibilities they dream up, they only take action on a couple of them. They love to delve into those deep, heady, emotional, spiritual conversations. If you go into a discussion on your worries, fears, or problems, they will be more likely to provide sympathy and understanding.\n\nThis is my experience. Both unbelievably great types that I have had wonderful experiences with! 
3	I think a lot of ENFP's are mistyped ESFP's with issues for wanting to be considered out of the box thinkers. A trait that social media (read: Fucking Linkedin) has promoted to be absolutely wanted.\n\nAny Fi user who's not so particularly good with working around with Fi has the tendency to feel victimized. I think. And, with Ne being slightly less valued than Se in an infant (I've heard the phrase: "Idea's are nice but you have to put them in to action!" Quite a lot) I can see why most ENFP's have bigger feeling of being misunderstood than the ESFP. \n\nOfcourse, this is highly speculative and has no facts to back it up. Merely a hypothesis.\n\nHaving said that. The main difference is between the Ne/Se and Si/Ni difference. Inferior Si for ENFP's cause them to dwell endlessly on the past, which due to the fact that a lot of us have a tendency to feel misunderstood, isn't a particularly good thing to dwell on.\n\nNi inferior means that the realm of Abstract concepts isn't something you feel comfortable with and would love the day-to-day physical sensations more.\n\nThe ENFP's Ne takes large leaps in data in order to construct an "understanding" of things around them. This can lead to people perceiving them as disorganised. \n\nThe ESFP Interacts with the environment in a more linear and physical way. Going more on the joy of the sensations rather than the joy of what it could all mean. This may mean that the ESFP comes across as more leveled and down to earth.\n\nBoth like to play and have fuckloads of fun, but the differences are remarkably easy to see. I'm ENFP, I'm part of an ENFP facebook group which to me seems like a load of misstyped ESFP's who are in their early years. Anyway, ENFP and ESFP go along great on the fun and experience part and completely missmatch on Intuitive Talk vs Sensing Talk (I think)\n\nKisses and stuff;)
2	I think one of the main reasons why ENFPs and ESFPs appear so similar on the internet is because most people creating/discussing MBTI content are xNTPs, Ni-doms, and xNFPs. Not to bag on any of these types, but none of these types are all that proficient/knowledgeable when it comes to Se unless their family members or close friends were Se-doms. So they all kind of just lump the ExFPs together as a whimsical/loud/emotional/laid-back person. Which is true for the first layer, and that's about it.\n\nAt a very base level ENFPs are concerned about ideals and ESFPs are concerned about actions. An ENFP protagonist will let a villian monologue, an ESFP protagonist is just gonna punch them.\n\nHonestly, despite how many times I've seen that ENFPs are the most introverted extroverts, I'd have to disagree. ENFPs (if surrounded by other ENFPs (which is actually terrifying, don't let anyone tell you different)) can go on for days without their introversion kicking in. It's not until they're finally alone do they feel how exhausted they are. Then they hide away for a month to continue socializing for a week straight and then have to hide away, etc. Basically they're only "introverts" because they can't pace themselves when it comes to other people. \nESFPs are a lot more of a slow burn extroversion. They can go for days, but need days to recharge. Not socializing as much as the ENFP, but also not needing as much time to recharge. \n\nENFPs have very little survival instinct. Like, I've met so many ENFPs who accidentally pull an all-nighter or don't eat for 19 hours accidentally or just don't take care of themselves. It's not because they're stuck in a loop of self-hatred, they just don't do it. (How??????)\nESFPs tend to take conscious risks for their own reasons. If they're pulling an all-nighter it's a conscience decision to do so.\n\nENFPs can be incredibly manipulative. Whether intentionally manipulative or accidentally manipulative they still have a long-standing trend in my life to use people to get their own way.\nESFPs tend to be more direct and confrontational. I'm not a very confrontational person, but when I have a biff I will eventually approach the person. I've known ENFPs who've tried to get Susie to talk to Jacob to talk to Eric to talk to Hannah to talk to Elijah about the why do they hate them. Instead of just going to Elijah and asking why they hate them.\n\nENFPs try to be edgy. They tend to idolize certain characters in media and model themselves after that, and I've come across several who just adopt edgy mannerisms overnight because they watched a show where edgy mcedgelord was edgy. But these mannerisms never really stick for more than a month.\nESFPs are more edgy. They really don't try, but when you stick to the beat of your own drum and actually stick to it you come off as more edgy.\n\nENFPs are significantly more idealistic than ESFPs.\n\nENFPs bring a lot of the ideas to the table, whereas ESFPs are more concerned with finding their own most efficient method.\n\nESFPs tend to be more rude than ENFPs.\n\nPersonally, I think ENFPs like being around ESFPs more than ESFPs like being around ENFPs. Because ESFPs can tell when a situation is starting to spiral out of control or getting too chaotic, ENFPs have a much harder time 'reading the room' and end up letting things get too out of hand.\nEither that, ENFPs hang back too long and don't capitalize on a plethora of great opportunities.\n\nThere's rarely a middle ground with ENFPs. ESFPs roll with the punches and end up in the weirdest situations.
1	I think that the difference can be summed up as "ENFP's control their emotions, while ESFP's let their emotions control them".\n\n\nBoth types prefer feelings over logic, but ENFP's are typically more emotionally adept and are better at reading people. That's not to rip on ESFP's however (and I am one), but ESFP's rely more on charm, wits, and spontaneity. We kinda wing it. 
-6	No, not similar AT ALL.  ESFP are such shallow thinkers.  I find them extremly frustrating to talk to, they do NOT want to talk about anything deeply, especially if it is a technical or academic topic.  ENFPs are able to do this.  I also find ESFPs to be more impulsive, more hyper, more shallow, only thinking about the present moment and less considerate of other people in general that they look like jerks... they are out for themselves.  I married an ENFP, I can't stand ESFPs, that N is such a big difference.  The similarities are that both tend to be scatter brained, but the ENFP *can* focus IF they are deeply interested... the ESFP can't, they are just all over the place, like an adult that never grew up.
8	Frustrated at being used for sex	21, Female, ESFP. I have a super flirty and open personality. Don't get me wrong, I love being playful and sometimes even talking dirty to people I'm close with. But other times I REALLY just want to be respected! I want to vent, share my feelings, or talk about something I'm excited about! It just infuriates me because people can't separate those feelings! I can't be playful, flirty, or be me without people judging me and treating me like a blowup doll they can use whenever!\n\nDo any of you share this experience? If so, how do you lovely people handle it? I don't really know what to do so I try either avoiding the people or changing the subject. It gets annoying though!
7	Talk to them about it. 
8	If one person is treating you like a blow-up doll, then that person might be a jerk. \nIf multiple people are treating you like a blow-up doll, then you're probably advertising yourself to them as a blow-up doll. \n\nHere's my advice: there's no such thing as innocent dirty talk. It's a coy invitation to the guy to "play his cards right." After that, you might as well not even bother trying to talk about yourself. He's just watching your lips move.\n\nSecond tip: if you're into a guy (or just boning), DO NOT EVER use him for venting!   You're risking instantly losing his respect, with no benefits. He'll still smash you, but then you instantly become (to him) the girl who has sex with men who don't respect her. It's a catch 22, but an easily avoided one.\n\nThis stuff might sound overly harsh, but honestly I wish I had someone explain this stuff to me when I was younger. Good luck.\n\n
3	Ditch those people. And make new friends. And stay clear or those types of subjects and only have those type of convos with people you do what to be with in that way. 
2	One of my friends has the same issue. She's naturally super duper flirty and open with most people, which unfortunately comes across as "oh she wants to smash" a lot of the time. As far as I can tell, for her the main thing is to be self aware of how she's coming across especially when she's not into it, and also to preemptively set boundaries and cut things off before they get out of hand. \n\nNo personal experience with your issue here myself unfortunately. I'm a dude so it's much less of problem on this side. 
2	Oh my god you're PERFECT\n\n
5	Best words to support/encourage you?	When you're feeling trapped, stressed, confused, down-trod... what would be the best thing to hear from a friend?\n\nWhat works for me won't work for you guys (Fe-Ni vs Se-Fi) and it's too hard to guess what you'll connect best to.\n\nEg. I like being told that everything will work out and it'll be ok, and reminded that I'm doing the best I can. \n\nI have tried;\n\nYou're doing a fantastic job!\n\nYou got this!\n\nPatience m'dear! It'll all work out\n\nOne step at a time
5	I can only speak from personal experience as I am a female ESFP: \n\nBeing understood means more than just encouragement.\n\n1) I know how you feel. Take some time to relax.\n\n2) Wow, that's rough. You'll get through this.\n\n3) I can see how much this matters to you. You're handling it well.\n\nI would find these very encouraging and uplifting. Hugs can be very effective if you have that kinda relationship. Keep in mind that even though ESFP's are extroverts, a lot of our stress comes from dealing with our Ni, which means we'll need time alone to truly recover.\n\nAgain, this may vary for each individual. Hope this helps you in some way. :)
4	Being "in the grip"	Have any of you guys ever experienced being in the grip? I think I have been experiencing it for a while now.\n\nI've always been content with life until after graduating, where I feel like I should have big goals and ambitions. Problem is that I am too anxious to move forward from here - every goal or vision I come up with seems extremely dreary. \n\nFor the first 20 years of my life, I just enjoyed life. Now, I am extremely serious about everything.
3	I don't understand what being "in the grip" means, but what you're describing is just part of growing up.\n\nEveryone has to figure out what they want to accomplish with their life after high school and it's very rare to automatically know what that is. The hardest part is actually taking the first few steps toward your goal. Whether that means going to college, moving out, saving money, or any other long-term commitment (which is where a lot of ESFP's just *struggle*).\n\nOne thing you can be sure of: when you DO finally figure out what you want to do, you'll experience no shortage of passion for it. :)\n
2	What is your Favourite activities to do? [Asking Other SP's]	List your MBTI type and your favorite activities to do.\nI'll list mine. Having as it comes adventures (sneaking into places etc), Learning about things I like (The Bible, Charisma, NLP, hypnosis, different sorts of skills ect), Weightlifting, Skateboarding, baseball, running around, Minecraft <3, Talking with a friend or two, Chess and other strategic games, Eating good food, Learning about health things, Reddit, Funny videos and documentaries about things in my scope of interests. Also airsoft and being a libertarian.\n\n\nEdit: we SP's need a convention or a meet up to get to know each other. We are so much fun and adventurous!
1	I'm ESFP and I love doing NEW things. Anything I haven't done before like a new restaurant, new activity or new bar. My steady hobbies include going out, lifting weights, hiking, beach, concerts. I just love constantly being on an adventure and meeting new people. For some background info, I just moved to LA and I am a Scorpio. 
3	What music do you like?	What are your favorite bands, genres, songs, albums, etc?\n\nAlso, I would love to hear why you like that music. (Or if you would rather just list music, that's fine too)\n\nI personally love Fall Out Boy (I actually was in the top 1% of fans on Spotify last year, so that's cool, I guess), Marianas Trench, and Panic! At The Disco. I like these bands because I can relate to the lyrics. It also feels like they are singing what they really feel/think, instead of just what the general population may want to hear (that sort of music is fine too, but I wouldn't consider it to be my favorite). I like a lot of these bands older stuff (I prefer less autotune). I also really like music with a drum beat, preferably more on the rock side.
1	I listen to trashy rap, metal, rap, rock, pop, sad songs, and some sort of techno genres
2	Small, cozy yet active Discord community looking for more! • r/mbti	
4	How can we make this sub more active?	I don't think it's a secret that this sub is not the most *ahem* active mbti sub on reddit. \n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions of what we can do to make it more active?\n\nAny suggestions are welcome (regardless of type). Thanks!
5	More parties! :-)
5	Activity generates activity. That's a simple enough concept to work on. If you want people to talk more on this sub, make threads that generate talk. \n
4	The subreddit is pretty serious, where all the jokes at?!
3	A discord! Looks like there are 824 people subscribed, maybe half to two/thirds are ESFPs. Once you build it they will come.
1	Compared to other types, ESFP's don't seem curious enough.  Plus they're unfocused, easily bored and everything.  Try picking people's attention maybe that will work.
3	ESFP's Data Needed for Spreadsheet!	I'm making a spreadsheet to see if there's any connection between MBTI and Gardner Multiple Intelligences. More ESFP data is needed to balance out the set.\n\nhttp://www.literacynet.org/mi/assessment/findyourstrengths.html \nIf you could take this test and comment your results that would be a huge help!\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hYz6JjtkL2ZCS6MtisP1AacC2GI5Ep-FDT87vIemDCg/edit?usp=sharing \nHere is the spreadsheet for those who are interested. Right now its mostly populated with users from discord servers, so when I enter your data I'm going to put r_(username)\n\nMake sure to comment all 8 scores your get!\n\nThanks for listening!

2	Not sure how much I agree with this. There's no way spatial is only a 3 for me. I am often VERY spatially aware of things.

2	Come chat about Personality Typology	Hey everyone! I'm from a Discord server focused around personality typology, emphasis on MBTI but with lots of talk about Jungian theory, socionics, and enneagram as well. We're over a year old, have a nice bot that does things for us like channel and role management, and would like to open the gates to newcomers so we can all have fun. What makes us different than most other Discord servers is that we're more focused on actual discussion and conversation with minimal shitposting (we keep that in the #nsfw channel). With that in mind, please join if you want to discuss Jungian theory, get people to try to figure out your type, want to debate the merits of Socionics vs MBTI, discuss the deeper meaning of your Enneagram, or just want to have a good talk.\n\nSee you there (:\n\nhttps://discord.gg/6xE4qMt\nEdit: If that link expires, use this one: https://discord.gg/ct8BRps
3	Thoughts on romantic relationships or friendships with INFJs?	Recently discussed over in /r/infj. Interested to hear thoughts from all you wonderful ESFPs here!
3	I have a good friend that is an INFJ. It's sometimes hard to keep the conversation going because he's a lot different than me in that respect (he's usually way more serious than I am). But really, he's a great guy and has a great personality. We share some good laughs and we admire each-other for the things that we do not have in common. ;-)\n
2	No thanks. At least romantically. I need a bit more stimulation than the INFJs are ever willing to offer. \n\nAs friends, they're fine. Nice, helpful people. 
1	I'm an ESFP, wife of 8 years (been together 13) is an INFJ.\n\nI am, as expected, the fun-loving, socializer that has some fairly massive circles of friends and acquaintances. I love knowing the what and how about a lot of things.  My thought processes make a lot of intuitive leaps, and i'm a lot more observant of my environment.\n\nShe is, more of a considerate intellectual, that can come across as extroverted if she's comfortable in the setting.  She has a smaller circle of very close friends but may not see them frequently.  She loves knowing the Why about people's motivations. Her though processes are very logical and methodical, and she is a lot more observant of the nuances of people's behavior/responses.\n\nShe brings a depth of consideration and tends to plan things out.  I bring the fun and spontaneity.\n\nThe great? \n\nWe can laugh our asses, have deeeep conversations about people and politics, go on adventures of the exploratory type/and occasionally the experiential type.\n\nThe challenges? \n\n1) She would probe more thoroughly and deeply than I'd comfortably considered before.  Caused a lot of unfortunate defensiveness on my side at the beginning but I've gotten better at processing my internals.\n\n2) I require a lot more social interactions to maintain a happy outlook.  She didn't understand why she wasn't enough and took a long time for her to understand it was about her or us.\n\n3) we handle extroverted activities and introverted activities differently.  \n\nFor me, extroverted activities are fun and recharge my batteries and I will literally be the last man standing at an event.  For her, extroverted events are fun, but cost energy, and she just needs to duck out for a little down time before continuing.\n\nFor her, introverted activities are great for giving things their proper consideration and she can sit there for hours doing the thing that has her laser attention focused on it.  For me, I caan sit there for hours too but too much will feel stifling, so I'll wander off to do something more sensory.\n\n4) i deal in one-liners, she deals in paragraphs.\nMe: Oh here's an interesting thing, BAM. Ok back to the action.\nHer: Oh here's an interesting thing, let me count the ways. First there's this thing, Second there's this other thing, Third, fourth, etc.\n\nThese are the things off the top of my head, but basically my point is, it can work, but it takes possibly more and a different kind of effort than you (the ESFP) has ever dealt with. \n\nTL;DR: It can work amazingly well if you can celebrate and embrace your differences rather than focusing on why you don't have more similarities.\n
1	We promised we'd share the survey results, well here they are.	A while back, [we asked folks in this community to take a survey](https://www.reddit.com/r/ESFP/comments/5y4s6a/mod_approved_make_your_voice_heard_tired_of_phone/) and you all were kind enough to help us out. This post is a high level summary of the results of that survey.\n\n(Note: for this summary, we will be using the term "[extravert](https://www.mrexcel.com/forum/excel-questions/808744-exporting-chart-via-visual-basic-applications-sometimes-gives-empty-file.html)" as used in clinical analysis initiated by Carl Jung instead of the popularized spelling, "extrovert." )\n\n# Introduction\n\nThe Movers & Makers company is engaged in ongoing research about introverts, extraverts, age, occupation, and communication preferences. The original hypothesis was that introverts, or individuals in introvert-friendly occupations such as STEM, were more adverse to having a phone call disrupt their time, with some exceptions. In contrast, extraverts, or individuals in extravert-friendly occupations, were more open to phone calls. Our formal interviews showed this hypothesis to be incorrect and revealed a trend based more on age and occupation than temperament.\n\nAs an informal triangulation of our data, The Movers & Makers research team decided to conduct surveys on popular social media and internet forums. The research has not yet concluded, but "Phase 1" of these informal surveys are complete and we'd like to share the results of these surveys. The results of this informal survey coincided with our formal research and also contradicted the original hypothesis. This summary is not an analysis of our hypothesis, our formal research, or of the informal research. This summary is only a brief overview of the informal survey results.\n\n# Summary\n\nIn addition to essential demographic questions, the questions of the survey took the form of "I work for a company that has never done business with you and I'd like to introduce myself." The possible answers included, "Call your phone number," "Send you an email," "Send you an SMS," "Send you an MMS," and "Send you an IM." We also asked two, somewhat open-ended questions that emphasized the positive and negative consequences of the communication preferences.\n\n## Overall Preferences\n\nOur initial observations, which initiated our research, were that there are some people that don't like to be called on the phone and would prefer to be contacted by other means. This survey supported the observation with less than a third of respondents preferring  a phone call (31.3%) over alternative methods. Email was the preferred method by half of the respondents (49.6%).\n\n[Overall Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/UmRoBq3)\n\nGranted, the spectrum of scenarios may have been biased toward phone-call-aversion, so this is not an absolute reflection of preferences, but merely a summary of the preferences reflected in this survey. \n\n### Introvert-Extravert Preferences\n\nBreaking down the data between introverts and extraverts yielded an insignificant difference between the two temperaments. Introverts preferred a phone call in 30.61% of responses. Extraverts preferred a phone call in 31.41% of responses. This is a difference of only 0.8% and is much smaller than we anticipated.\n\n[Introvert Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/p7S4Djk)\n\n[Extravert Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/9eww0um)\n\nThe similarities between introvert and extravert coincide with our formal research and are also reflected in the breakdown of most of each questions that follow.\n\n#### Ambivert Preferences\n\nWhile "ambivert" is not a part of some personality/temperament models, many contemporary research make allowances for ambiverts. In our case, we are including the term because people that identify as ambiverts seem themselves as distinct from both extraverts and introverts and they may have a distinct profile. However, the number of respondents describing themselves as Ambiverts is too small to comprehensively study and we recommend a more in-depth study of ambiverts and communication preferences.  Still, as a note of interest, we'll include the results here, though we caution against drawing any conclusions. Ambiverts responded with a preference for email at 54.6% and phone calls at 19.2%.\n\n[Ambivert Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/5CHYPha)\n\n### Male-Female Preferences\n\nOur original hypothesis did not account for sex or gender. We allowed for the selection of "sex" in the survey to satisfy any curiosity of biological temperament selection. As we suspected, there isn't a large or significant difference in correlation of sex to communication preferences as borne out in our formal research and reflected in these survey results.\n\n[Male Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/VeC5EeV)\n\nOverall, male respondents selected a preference for a phone call in 34% of responses with females selecting phone calls in only 28.6% of responses. Email was the preferred response for both males and females in 49.3% and 49.7% of responses respectively.\n\n[Female Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/Npq6ZeS)\n\n#### Gender and Non-traditional Genders\n\nWe specifically did not include the word "gender" in this survey because the study of gender is outside of the scope of our current research. We allowed for the answers of "Prefer not to say," and "Other" with an open field to promote the completion of the survey, but this survey is not equipped to tackle gender. Even with this allowance, only 0.1% of respondents answered with a non-traditional sex. Of that 0.1%, some of the respondents showed open hostility to the survey in their comments, indicating that this answer was not truly reflective of the respondent. The answers from these respondents were removed from our analyzed results.\n\nThat does not mean, however, that we do not value research regarding gender. We believe that the identification of gender and that correlation to communication preference might be quite significant. It is simply that we have not begun to tackle the question at this time. We would openly welcome input or recommendations from anyone with knowledge or expertise in this area.\n\n### Generational Preferences\n\nThe first of two areas with distinctive responses is the difference in generation. The age groups that we call "Millennials" are the least resistant to phone calls, with 31.6% of responses, and yet 48.4% of the Millennial responses prefer email. Millennials were also more open to "alternative" communication methods such as IM, SMS, etc. with about 20% of the responses in total.\n\n[Millennial Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/fJBFPKj)\n\nThe age groups that we call "Generation X," or "Gen X," are slightly more resistant to phone calls with only 29.1% of responses preferring a phone call and 57.3% preferring email.\n\n[Gen X Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/mAotSZr)\n\nThe age groups that we call "Baby Boomers," or just "Boomers" are the most resistant to phone calls with only 23.6% of responses preferring a phone call and 72.7% preferring email. Boomers were the most resistant to "alternative" communication methods with only 3.6% of responses for SMS and zero responses for the other methods.\n\n[Boomer Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/U7Yng1Z)\n\n### Occupational Preferences\n\nThe second of two areas with distinctive responses is the difference in occupation, or, occupational "wings" as we call them. These wings are simply divided into occupations that are [STEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics)-related and non-STEM-related. The survey results reinforced our formal research and part of our hypothesis that respondents in STEM-related fields are more resistant to phone calls than their non-STEM peers. Respondents in STEM-related fields responded with 23.5% of responses preferring phone calls and 57.4% preferring email.  \n\n[STEM-Related Occupation Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/QnwxZOc)\n\nResponses in non-STEM-related occupations were more receptive to phone calls, but only with 34.2% of the responses and 46.7% preferring email.\n\n[non-STEM-Related Occupation Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/LMluzrF)\n\n## Scenario Preferences\n\nWe asked respondents to imagine a range of hypothetical scenarios and how they'd prefer to be contacted in those scenarios. The scenarios spanned a variety of business-oriented communications that fall onto a spectrum what we term "cold to hot" in order indicate the amount of familiarity the two parties have already established. We also asked about preferences in various degrees of urgency and responsibility.\n\nIt is probably unsurprising that the more distant and less urgent relationships are the most resistant to phone calls and the nearest and more urgent relationships are the most receptive to phone calls. In the "coldest" scenario, *I work for a company that has never done business with you and I'd like to introduce myself*, responses were predictably low on preferring a phone call with only 8% of responses and 85% preferring email. In this scenario, the differences between introvert and extravert were negligible, but the differences in generation were in-line with the overall responses. STEM and non-STEM responses were also in agreement with the overall responses.\n\n[Cold Business Introduction Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/65J1a3r)\n\nAlso, predictably, the "hottest" scenario, *I have an emergency (business emergency, not life or death)*, included 74.6% of responses favoring a phone call and 5.9% preferring email. As an interesting note, in this scenario, more respondents preferred SMS to email with 13.7% of the responses.\n\n[Emergency Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/IOxd25R)\n\nThe scenarios that emphasized cool or hot combined with responsibility, however, were a little surprising. For the scenario, *I'm a customer with a question (it's your responsibility to answer customer questions),* the responses were similar to the warm business responses. 19% of responses preferred a phone call for customer questions and 72.2% of responses preferred email.\n\n[Cool Customer Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/2FOARrW)\n\nThe scenario, *I'm a customer with a problem (it's your responsibility to handle customer problems),* showed a surprising 61% preferring email and only 31.2% preferring a phone call.\n\n[Hot Customer Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/FbwgWnW)\n\n## Consequences\n\nWe were also interested in understanding what impact these preferences have on the communication recipient. We set up a pair of questions in the survey to give respondents a chance to demonstrate the perceived consequences, both positive and negative. The negative consequences include, "I mostly roll with it--no big deal" (16.8%), "I find it irritating and frustrating" (24.3%), and "The interruption negatively affects my work" (16.5%), as well as, "I may decide not to reply or continue communication" (17.8%). The most damaging consequences would be "I lose some respect for the person contacting me" (7.3%), and "I may block that person, or mark their contact as 'spam' or 'junk'" (6.5%).\n\n[Negative Consequences Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/RbL1A2Q)\n\nConversely, when the respondents' preferences were respected, there were positive consequences, including, "It helps me manage my schedule" (14.3%), "I feel I'm more productive and efficient" (13.9%), "I believe I can dedicate the proper amount of attention to the communication" (21.5%), "I'm less irritated" (20%), and "It reduces my anxiety" (18.8%).\n\n[Positive Consequences Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/laUXrVA)\n\n# Conclusion\n\nOur initial observations were that most people don't like receiving phone calls. Perhaps it's no mystery that the manner in which communication technology evolved puts the telephone front-and-center to business communication. However, our ongoing research shows that most people find phone calls to be disruptive and intrusive. Using the phone as a primary source of communication could be damaging to business relationships and to the overall economic health of our collective society. \n\nLooking at this research, we can see why "cold calling" feels ineffective and like "a waste of time" to many people. "Cold emails" are more likely to be effective and seem to have a lower downside. In fields like recruiting, it may be damaging for the hiring side of the relationship to initiate contact with a phone call. \n\nYes, the research is ongoing, but it seems relatively clear that the phone should not be the first point of contact in any scenario, unless we know for certain that the recipient would prefer a phone call or we know for certain that the purpose of the contact is an emergency (the definition of "emergency" is somewhat subjective and needs to be judiciously applied). In business scenarios, the least risky option for contacting anyone is to use email and the most risky is to use alternative methods like MMS, or even IM. But, phone calls seem equally risky by the same standards considering that email seemed to dominate the responses.\n\nAs an illustration of the resistance to phone calls, this is a comment from the survey, "I hate phone calls, almost unconditionally.  Texting or e-mails are always preferable unless it's really an emergency." And, another comment, "I do not generally like speaking on the phone because it's a purely auditory activity, and I am a visual person... I like time to process what's going on and formulate a response, otherwise I feel flustered and anxious." These and several other comments are reflective of the overall tone of this survey. There were no equivalent comments showing resistance to email. \n\nOur research currently only analyzes the state of things as they are, not *why* things are as they are. For example, why are Boomers more resistant to phone calls than Millennials? Why are STEM-related occupations more resistant to phone calls than non-STEM-related fields? Why are extraverts as equally resistant to phone calls as introverts? What is the significance of gender in communication preference? How might this study be different if we focused on personal scenarios instead of business scenarios?\n\nAll of these questions push us to recommend further research in this area. We know that we are continuing to research this area, but our small contribution covers only a fraction of needed research.\n\nWe will begin "Phase 2" of this research soon. If you're interested in participating, keep a watch on our blog for updates. This topic will remain a topic of interest for The Movers & Makers Company and our research is ongoing. If you are interested in this research or our other research, please [contact us](mailto:researchers@moversandmakers.xyz); but, please refrain from calling us on the phone, it's so disruptive.\n\nYou can find a copy of this article over on [Medium](https://medium.com/@michaelallenwilliamson/phone-call-or-email-or-informal-survey-results-a4d07e6c392a) if you'd like to read the article with the chart images in-line.
5	Where can I find real life ESFPs?	Growing up, I saw a lot of music videos with what I assume are ESFPs, and the way the walk, the way they talk, it's got me madly in love. Whenever I find an ESFP in fiction or that one girl who might be an ESFP I get a small crush, but she's already in a relationship. So, ESFPs on the internet, please tell me the places you go through in life.\n\nAs an INTP I can say that you can find me either borrowing books in the library, either borrowing books about some science or fantasy; or you can find me wherever my friends take me. Yes, I get that I don't do these things every week, but I don't really do much aside from working out, going to school, and going home to be on the internet. The biggest chance you've got of catching me would be at my gym or at school.
8	ESFPs are pretty much everywhere but as with any type, there is a huge variation in terms of how they present themselves to the world. Your idealistic view of them might not work in reality for every ESFP you encounter so you may not know. When you've met one right away.\n\nThey're everywhere though, just go outside lol. 
2	my deskmate is ESFP and he's so fcking annoying but he's still better than an ESFJ or something 
3	hii esfp here. to be honest the esfps presented in the media are usually idealised versions of us or at least our actions are romanticised to the extent that makes our portrayals are unrealistic. \nbut i do agree that there are some places that most esfps enjoy visiting - so i assume that means you might have a higher chance of bumping into one there. places like amusement parks, concerts, raves, festivals, bars, clubs, casinos etc.\nhope that helped!! x good luck
2	My wife is an ESFP.  I think there are a lot out there but unlike INFPs like myself they really couldn't give a flying leap about MBTI, Grave's Dynamic Spiral or and of this shtuff... unless of course it is token gesture, their way of showing interest in their xNFx counterpart. 
8	Mads Mikkelsen Quotes	For those of you who don't know, he's an ESFP, and I am somewhat glad because, despite only ever seeing him in one short film, I fucking love the guy.\n\n"I don't have a goal; I don't have an ambition. My ambition has always been the project I am on... "\n\n"why don't you just make this project your favorite project in the world? Then the next one. Then all of a sudden everything has been worthwhile."\n\n"I am one of these guys who will buy the bicycle that is red. It might be a crap one, but if it looks good I will buy it."\n\nMore at: http://www.celebritytypes.com/quotes/mads-mikkelsen.php
3	I absolutely loved Mads in Hannibal. To me, he came off as a super INTJ character in that show, and it's so funny to watch him out of character in interviews because he is *so damn bubbly and giddy* and nothing at all like many of the characters I've seen him play.
2	He's a pretty good actor! Awesome! Thanks for the info!
2	Question for your lovely minds	Do you guys ever just need to take a break from people, haha?\n\nI'm a VERY extroverted ESFP but even I find I need to take a day or two away from people.\n\nIt's not even like I'm stressed or anything, it's like the constant demand and expectation DRAINS me.\n\nDo you guys ever get like this? If so, what usually causes it? \n♡
4	Yep. We're still human. Everyone needs some alone time to recharge. I think extroversion is more about what entertains us. And making people laugh or talking to people stimulates us more that when we are alone. So that constant stimulation would drain anyone. Do you feel bad that you need alone time away from people? I know, I do. Friends text me constantly to hang out and I find that draining too. 
4	It's normal. In fact, if it wasn't for my retreats, I wouldn't be able to spend time on some of my hobbies and interests!
1	I completely understand. I am a more reserved ESFP (or in other words, people I am not super close to overwhelm me a lot).\n\nIn terms of what you're saying, I honestly think the cause is the fact that we are humans. We only have so much energy we can exert before needing to recharge. 
1	ENFP Male trying to date ESFP Female	So the title says it all. A little while ago this girl who I use to be really close with for over a year maybe two and almost dated that whole time just recently "found me". We use to be great friends and whatever else we were until I messed it up and blew her off for some other girl. So over the years I tried to reconnect and it didn't work out she wouldn't have it all, hating me basically. But recently she decided to find me, ended up looking me up and creating profiles on a few social media sites just to find my profile. Now were talking again and she says she has a BF who she says has been just using her for sex and it doesn't look too good for them. They seem to be almost done.\n\nNow down to the MBTI part. I've tested every time as an ENFP and  I told her about this recently and she took the test and found out she's an ESFP. We get along amazingly and I haven't really found much a problem yet, communication isn't as difficult as some have said it would be between these two types but I'd like to know if it's just me trying hard to make it work, and if there is anything else I can do? I read that ESFPs like for their feelings to be validated and since then I've made sure I've told her feelings are right and should be expressed. I also learned that Intuitive conversations might get a little stale but it hasn't been a problem so far with her, she seems to listen really well and find my intuitive conversation pieces interesting. Like how I talk about medicinal plants alot with a passion, she doesn't seem to mind. So am I doing this right or am I making a mistake? We seem to have alot in common and she is a great person. If I have to I wouldn't mind sacrificing some of my more Ne thoughts but I'd like to know if I'm starting off on the right foot. She even just asked me if I would use her if we ever decided to date again, almost like shes priming me for it. I'm not trying to get too excited though. Also I don't want to put all my eggs in one basket by relying on the MBTI too much, because "individuals still are" but it has helped me understand the way some think around me.\n\nTL;DR I an ENFP male might date an ESFP female. Any questions comments or concerns?
3	My sister is an ESFP and I'm an ENFP. We get along really well. I'm also married to an ISFP. As ENFP just remember that there will be times when intuitive discussions will bore her. Just like detailed discussion of how her day went might bore you. Remember also that she most likely will have a need to get out of the house (or apt or whatever) and do something instead of just talking all day. I think you guys will do great. Good luck :) 
2	> Also I don't want to put all my eggs in one basket by relying on the MBTI too much\n\nThen stop right here. No amount of trying to analyse your relationship and engineer the situation will equal just pursuing the human connection in earnest. A test can give you four letters (which should then probably be subjected to doubt anyway, given the fallibility of tests); if you've known her as a friend and romantically then you already know her far better than the MBTI ever will.
7	Depressed ESFP	My sister is a 16-year old ESFP with strong depression and few friends. She spends a lot of her time (I'm talking an average of about 5 hours a day) at home watching TV shows she watched as a kid and on her phone on Instagram. She doesn't have many friends and she's a big rules and saftey person and doesn't drink or do drugs or anything, so she feels alienated because of that. She's a tiny bit chubby and has a hard time motivating herself to exercise or leave the house in general, and she has extremely low self esteem that she takes out by avoiding talking or thinking about her problems.\n\nI'm a male INFP and I genuinely don't feel like I understand her or know how to communicate with her well. Whenever we talk she just talks at me for like 20 minutes straight about random things that people did or what some person commented on some Facebook post and the trends they're following and all this stuff. I try to listen to humour her but all of that stuff seems so superficial to me and l think she can tell but would never want to talk to me about that and can't slow down to have an actual back and forth conversation anyhow. I don't know what to do, any ESFPs that have been through anything similar might be able to suggest things that would help them if they were depressed?\n\ntl;dr\nmy sister is a depressed ESFP and I'm looking for an ESFP perspective on what would make her feel better\n\nThanks guys, any help would be appreciated, I'm really worried about her
4	Honestly you both sound young and you're in over your head for how bad her depression sounds. Encourage her to talk to your parents and seek professional help. 
5	Hi - INFP myself but my wife is an ESFP.  Honestly that doesn't sound like an ESFP, especially the preoccupation on in the face of entertainment or fun.  I honestly might question her honestly when she took that test. \n\nThat being said ESFPs as near as I can tell need to experience SENSORIAL input.  I would look at what might be causing the disconnect.  Is there some type of moral dogma or belief system coming into play?  You briefly mentioned not using Alcohol or Drugs, is this based on a belief system or religion?  If that is the case you may need to find people with similar morals where she can be herself to find self-actualization. \n\nIf I was just trying to get over her the hump I would kind of search out areas or activities that might get her out for sensory stimulation to make her feel alive and if she won't hang with friends because of Moral beliefs system then it might be up to you (It feels it is always up to us INFPs) to intervene and get her to a place where her senses feel alive.  \n\nSo if she has alienated herself, you might tell your you need to or want to go do something but get bored on your own (If she'll believe that of an INFP) take her on a road-trip to see and hear or experience new or different sights and sounds. If she voices insecurities like, "I' over weight, I don't want anybody to see me swimming" - something I have heard before, Acknowledge in the sincere INFP politeness... "Oh don't worry about us, nobody will know us there, plus nobody even care anyway and I doubt wanyone will even see us."  Exact phrases I have used to encourage my wife and mother of 5 kids to come sit in the jacuzzi.  Do something like that as a test.  If that sensory stimulation appears to help then be creative and try to find a place or group where she is both accepted and her morals are not threatened but the fast paced sensorial input exists. Also be aware also according the the popular "car-model" you might get outbursts from the "Effective Child" which can be quite terse.  Probably the more you can focus on the sensory learning the better. \n\nHowever if there is true ongoing depression I would highly suggest trying to get her real help.  Now in my wife's situation he absolutely would refuse that.  However, I did find supplementation with typical mental and stress support supplements quite effective.  I'm not saying exactly what to do but in my case it seems that St John's Wort, Vit B Complex and other natural mood enhancers seem to help.\n\nOh and on a good day I would have her retake that test. :-)\n
3	ESFP/ENFP here depending on the day.\n\nI was extremely depressed throughout my adolescent and teenage years. She doesn't sound reckless, so it won't be the perfect cocktail for a completely tumultuous existence, but these years, developmentally, are extremely important for females. You're being a good brother by worrying about her.\n\nIdeally, it would be great to get her off of her telephone and into the real world, where she can form some real connections with her peers, but I know that's hard to do and not the status quo for your standard 16 year old. Has she considered joining clubs at school? What if you took her for a yoga class? I would say try immersing her in activities that she may hold an interest in, and try spending time with her outside of the house. I wish I had had that at my age. Good luck. xo
1	now i can't speak for other esfps, but here's what happens to me: while i am perfectly capable of launching into an in depth conversation on intellectual topics like classic literature or biology, whipping out stats and terminology like a geek (no offense!) isn't my preferred method of socialising. i tend to prefer to talk about stupid, superficial little things and act hyperactive, because that's what i think people want to talk about, and i don't want to seem like a bore. also it's kind of... more fun??? i don't know how to explain. so that might be why she seems shallow. my point is, we're not as shallow as we seem.\ni'm clinically depressed (i'm on zoloft) and i've found that social interaction (especially understanding) and a little sympathy can be really helpful. i'm not saying that you should cling to her 24/7; but maybe you could try talking to her more, guiding her towards deeper topics ie. her inner thoughts and feelings and making an effort to understand and listen? also introduce her to something stimulating but not physically exhausting, like a no-phone car ride with pretty views, or camping outdoors?
3	INFP broke ESFP's heart... what now?	 I am an INFP who dated an ESFP for about 7 years, and recently ended the relationship. As an idealist I hoped for years that the subtle red flags could be overcome with time and hard work. Things did continue to get better and better for us. We weren't fighting, and generally got along as best friends would. But recently I felt like we reached our peak and I still wanted more... He did everything he could have, and I love him very much but I have realized I am just not IN love with him. He was totally shocked and heartbroken by the breakup, so now he wants a detailed explanation of reasons I feel this way, and why I am not in love with him as I once was... but I am too afraid to hurt his feelings and selfesteem... He told me he needed answers for his sanity, so I tried to as lovingly and tactfully as possible explain some of my motives, but he still can't wrap his head around it. Is it best to keep the details of why I want more to myself or will it actually help him to move on  by telling him what was unfulfilling for me? I am so afraid to hurt him more than I already have but I want to help him cope with this as much as possible. Is this a "he thinks he wants to know but he really won't feel better after finding out" scenario? I can't imagine explaining to someone I care so deeply for that there are traits and perspectives they possess that make me feel they are not the person I would be happiest with... like yes you made me happy, but I felt like I could be happier with someone else. What to do?  
9	I've been in this situation and I've pushed the person to explain it to me.  Often it was things I was already insecure about.  It definitely hurt a lot but I asked and wanted to know. Have you considered he can't wrap his head about cause it's truly an insufficient answer?  That you can't imagine wanting to know is just another expression of how wholly different you are as people.\n\nAnd frankly, sometimes it's good to just hear things. Once something is out there, it's just like. 'Oh, that's it?'\nOne time I was really bent out of shape from this guy ghosting me after being quite affectionate. It really bothered me. Like a year or so later he gave me an explanation: "I didn't like how you kept choking on my cock. It ruined the blowjobs for me" and I was like what, that? That's it? That's what made you throw away the thing we had?  After all the cuddling, falling asleep together, nice times.. That? It was infuriating.\n\nWhile I doubt your problem with this guy is blowjobs my point is that the moment he said that it allowed me to reevaluate everything. Hearing what someone didn't appreciate about you, hearing what they want, and contrasting it against what you brought to the relationship... it's very good for healing. It would be good to give him that opportunity instead of keeping him in the dark through what is frankly partially and probably a self protecting need to not be the 'bad guy' in his eyes\n\n
3	> He told me he needed answers for his sanity\n\nThis is probably the truth. I'd definitely like to know what I did wrong to be able to move on. It'll hurt, but he'll for sure get over it. It's like ripping off a rotten bandaid. 
2	Tell him.
2	I honestly think the best course of action would be to tell him the truth. While I've never been in the same situation, I am almost certain I would behave the same way as him if I was. I think it will be far harder for him to move on if he is not given these details. \n\n>I can't imagine explaining to someone I care so deeply for that there are traits and perspectives they possess that make me feel they are not the person I would be happiest with\n\nYou see, knowing these things would be helpful for him to move on. If he truly cares about you, then at the end of the day he will want you to be happy. If he can know that you will be happier with someone else, it will likely allow him to let you go. Sure, it will still be hard, but I think it would be best to just be honest with him. I know I would have an exceptionally hard time letting go of someone if they broke things off and did not give reasoning that I viewed as sufficient. If he can know what areas he struggles in, it may help him in the long run or just simply in any future relationships. He can know ahead of time what areas he may need to work on or what things he may need to try and work through. \n\nI apologize if this answer was sort of all over the place. I was trying to write out my thoughts, but I've been having trouble finding the best way to word everything. Please let me know if you have any questions about anything I said, because I know I communicated it all in a fairly scattered manner.
3	Am I ESFJ or ESFP?	Hey there. Not the first time I come across 16 personalities. My boyfriend shared a link, so I was reading about, doing tests, and here I came to ask which type I am. Everything seems to match me, except J/P part. I made the test twice in English and once in my native language. English got me J, native P. I tend to be very OCD, very anxious, feeling like I have to adjust to someone. Rules and rules and rules. But from the other side, I don't like to judge or be judged (sometimes I don't care but sometimes it destroys me by feeling guilty), I want to be free, I want to explore, enjoy my life and do many crazy things. I hate being forced. Does OCD make me J for now, or is it something I try to run away from as P? Before I tried to cure OCD by being more OCD, lately I try to stop my perfectionism before my life blows away like sand. I am also not creative at all, many times I want to just do some activity, but I will stay bored. Sorry if it's chaotic.
6	Feeling like you have to adjust to others indicates Fe. Rules rules rules indicates Si. Not being creative indicates lower functioning Se/Ne. Out of the two you presented, I'm going to say you sound like ESFJ. Definitely not ESFP. As the other person here said, do some more research. These two are very different at their core.
2	Wow. That's a lot of thoughts. For most of the description, I could see it going either way. I suggest that u do some research into cognitive functions and figure out what fits u more if u haven't already. The P and the J make all the difference. An ESFP is Se, Fi, Te, Ni. And ESFJ is Fe, Si, Ne, Ti. As u can see, there is no overlap at all with the functions, so some research should really clear this up :)
1	It looks like I can be anything, maybe only F seems permanent in my answers. I made one test with ESFJ result, second test with ESFP, third was INFJ. But all of them show that I am almost in the middle with each letter pair. And a few descriptions of types I read so far seem to match. Am I crazy? :D 
1	You definitely sound more like ESFJ. I rarely find ESFPs that are especially rules and structure oriented (rules and high structure and scheduling can feel oppressive to me at times). I love being thrown into new situations and love the exhilaration of it all. What you're saying sounds far more like Si (ESFJs auxiliary function). As someone else said in a different comment, ESFPs and ESFJs do not share any of the same cognitive functions. 
7	ESFP, anxiety and paranoia? Or is it impossible?	As a kid I've always been ridiculously excitable and I loved spending time with friends. When I was 12ish I would do stuff like dance at my aunts wedding disco thing, as well as I danced as a dare from my mom in a resort restaurant, fully knowing that I was being cheesy.\nThough I've been weirdly paranoid and socially anxious over the past few years as I'm 16 now and struggling with my social life and my GCSEs.\n\nOne characteristic that I have for sure, is that I'm quite into girls. :)   
3	I don't think it's impossible for an ESFP to have anxiety. Just because you're extroverted doesn't mean you can't be anxious in social situations. With sensing, feeling, and perceiving, I see those as linked to paying attention to what's going with people and situations, which could make you overthink things based on what you see and lead to anxiety/paranoia. 
3	Don't forget about that inferior Ni. That can make u paranoid when it goes wrong. I also suffer with a bit of social anxiety. I've been considering getting therapy for it, but I find that if I engage myself in the community, the anxiety goes away. The trick for me is finding ways to apply myself to ur community, and usually, I come out of my shell. 
1	Yep, I struggle with it. Try working out more often.
1	I'm an ESFP and I can completely relate with you. When I was younger I was the person always goofing around for others entertainment. As I've gotten older, I'm 25, I've become overly concerned with making sure people like me. It went past the point of people enjoying my presence while watching me to wanting everyone to like me. This gets exhausting because you cannot please everyone. Maybe you can relate to this?
1	clinically depressed & socially anxious esfp here!! it's confusing at best and a fuckin hell of a mess at worst but it's 100% possible.

3	Mixed signals and Help	Hi I'm a INTP (90/75/65/80%) and I've liked an ESFP (was ESFP most likely still is) girl for over a year now. And WOW the mixed signals you people send a rediculos amount of mixed signals! Please stop! And help me disect this! \n\nSo like I said I started liking her a year ago during a school trip, and through out this trip we got the "you would b such a cute couple" at LEAST 3 times a day,from different people(one being her close friends and one being her family member) and ended up getting pretty close the last thing she said to me on this trip was "hey don't think I'm going to stop bugging you once we get home". \n\nOnce the trip ended we kept talking, when we met in the halls and in class since she's in a grade ahead of me we only had one class a week together (this year one class a day) and basicly we stayed in touch and I even heard whispers from some of her closest friends that she liked me. Anyway after a while I don't even know what happend well I kinda do I think.... But we just stopped talking and it was almost like she was avoiding me. Like I would be walking down the hall she would be walking my direction see me and would full on pivot and walk away... \n\nThings have started to get better again (took long enough) but now when we see eachother she starts smiling and saying hello. But the only time she ever has a full on deep conversation with me now is if she's not with her friends and I'm not with mine, ya I get she might not want to talk to me when I'm in a conversation with a group of my friends... But befor she would always talk to me when she was with her friends, well not always but very often.\n\nAnyway like I said we have a class together this semester and she totally acknowledges I'm there... I've even caught her staring/ glancing at me a couple of times. But I don't get what the heck is going on!! I'm fairly positive she dosent like me anymore (not even positive she liked me in the first place, she's way out of my league) infact, never mind that's a story for another day. \n\nI just need help knowing what to do I'm super scared and I don't know what to say or do(INTP). I don't even know how to explain it like seriously I don't know what to type out! Help me please!
5	If anything we're very much not about mixed signals. If she was into you before, she's not into you anymore. She'll want to spend time with you, be around you, and most importantly actually talk to you if she was still interested in being friends and/or more. Rule of thumb is if you do something bad enough to get consciously and purposefully cut off by an ESFP, you're done until they decide they've forgiven you and are ready to restart things.  
6	Sorry couldn't get past the "you people" comment in the first paragraph.  Now I don't care about your problem.
3	Sounds like you took too long
9	A short video summary of the ESFP personality type	Hey guys,\nI create short video summaries for each type as a side project and just finished the ESFP and thought I'd let you know :)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/KNLwStK3ANE\n\nEnjoy! :)\n
2	Are ESFPs known to lie? (INTP here)	And I mean that kind of bragging when you're 14 years old and you're like "OH BOY I WAS AT A PARTY LAST NIGHT AND WE DRANK SO MUCH AND SMOKED SO MUCH WEED AND FUCKED BITCHES AND THIS AND THIS AND THIS HAPPENED" and you pretty much know it's 100% bullshit.\n\nIf so, how do I make them stop? 
9	ESFP here! I'll sometimes stretch the truth if I'm trying to tell a joke & im not getting the reaction I want. But I wouldn't straight out lie to someone's face without a base of truth? If that distinction makes sense.
7	I'm an INTP male and dated an ESFP for 2 years. She never lied about things that affected our relationship, but she did lie. About bizarre pointless things that I could obviously easily find out about. \n\nMy straight talking bluntly honest nature tempered it, and we had a great relationship. It ended amicably over irreconcilable differences, but we remain friends and it was the best relationship I've ever had in my life. 
2	ESTP/ESFP lie quite a lot. 
1	No! From what I understand, We despise lying. \n\nCould just be that person. That would annoy the crap outta me!
2	Personalities V Favorite Color	I posted this in /r/mbti already but no ESFPs have responded so I thought I'd post it here as well. I don't want to leave you all out of the results:\n https://www.esurveycreator.com/s/c49fbd7
2	I saw your survey when you posted it before, but felt like finding a hex code that matched my favorite color was wayyy too much effort for an online survey. I don't think it's very ESFP-friendly, no offense :p
1	Looking for ESFPs to join our server.	
5	What personality types are you guys typically romantically attracted to?	Asked this is in the /r/mbti group, but, I wanna know what my fellow ESFPs go for! \n\nFor me, I've got a major thing for xSTPs and xNTPs! Love their sort of cut-throat, insensitive front but how gentle, kind and generous they can be (or at least all the xSTPs and xNTPs that I've met hahaha).
4	All the types! 9 down and 7 to go!
3	ENFPs. It's the only thing that consistently catches my eye
2	I'm an INTP and have a fondness for ESFPs. \n\nThe best relationship I've ever had was with an ESFP so I'm basing it on that. She just understood and accepted my nature, and was so attentive and affectionate towards me, like I've never had before. \n\nI think I could be with an ESFP forever, but I'd need other outlets for talking about things I don't think ESFPs are too interested in. Like philosophy and the deeper meaning of things. At least the ESFP I dated wouldn't even go down such avenues of discussion, and those are the only areas of discussion I find any true meaning in.
1	ISFJ
1	6! I knew i was missing one. Two I'm very close too. 
4	What kind of people do you like being around?	
12	Anyone really. As long as they're themselves and honest. I can relate to anyone. \n\nMy best friend is an INFP. We're very opposite. But I love her to bits. 
3	I love everyone, but the people that I "click" with are S's and P's, especially if they're both. I find it difficult to get along with people who are strongly opinionated without any open-mindedness. \n\nSeems ISTP's are a big weakness for me. I've dated 2 of them and had crushes on a few as well.
3	pretty much anyone. 
2	Pretty much anyone, too. Yay for typical ESFPs approachableness!\n\nBut I always click with xSTPs immediately - like, always ESTPs for sure.\n\nI generally also get on very well with xNFPs and xNTPs. \n\nOne of my good friends is also ENTJ, although she scares me a little sometimes, haha. \n\nAlso, despite our "approachableness", does anyone get kinda bored of small talk?
3	My best friend is an ENFJ. I find that I gravitate to N types. I enjoy having deep conversations, and my Infp, Intj, and Enfj roomates are good at starting those.
1	I hang out with a INTJ most if thr time, and quite a bit of INFPs. My favorite though is an INTP.
1	What school rules would you break?	
12	1. Talked too much in class\n2. Habitually tardy\n
3	Most of them. Never was suspended though.
2	I got busted for drinking at a football game 
2	tardy all the time. as student body president I would always make up excuses to postpone tests. also used being student body president to miss entire classes so I could go smoke weed with friends
1	Disrupting class with laughter. Sass, talking, and sleeping.
3	Helping ESFP feel comfortable away from home	Hello, ISTP here.  \nMy girlfriend of 1.2 years is ESFP.\n\nShe moved away from home for study and feels like she doesn't belong. As a result she is a lot more reserved.\nShe has expressed that this is undesirable. \n\nShe moved here about 4 years ago. She has about 4 close friends, another ~20 normal friends, and a million more acquaintances. Her only family is 1 cousin who she doesn't get along with too well.    \n\nI have been doing my best to try and make her happy here; we go out regularly, and spend time both by ourselves and with other friends. She also sees her friends, without me, regularly.  \n\nShe said that she misses high school, where she was constantly surrounded by close friends and classmates.\n\nShe's been here 4 years and still can't wait for the holidays so she can go back home. Which is fine, but she's not really comfortable here (she's still able to enjoy herself, though).\n\nIt's also been difficult for her to leave behind her family and friends. She misses them a lot.\n\nHas any ESFP here been in a similar situation? What helped you out?  \nAny pointers and advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks.
3	Patience. Make sure you're making her feel secure. Go with her next time she goes to see family. Show how you fit in and that you're also part of that home feeling. Are you very affectionate? Are her friends easy to confide in? We're very private people. And for us to feel at home is very important. 4 years is a long time to feel out of your comfort zone. Exercise together. Cuddle a lot. \n\nWe're strange, I feel. It's like a switch with us. We will be completely unsure and then suddenly bam we decide to change something drastically. Keep trying! 
1	Survey time, MBTI and mistyping	Hello there ESFPs, I got [a little survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdbMCVJtxW8_DDlIwATOuzmT4FqovO3xILsj9m24uxWx1LvIA/viewform?c=0&w=1) for everyone to fill out. I'm curious to see which types most likely mistype as what other types, and so far I've only gotten answer from the ESFPs. If you would all be so nice to fill it out that would be awesome, I'll post the "results" on /r/mbti as soon as I feel like I've gotten enough answers if anyone is curious. Enjoy.
6	Hi ESFPs, how serious/silly do you think you are?	Context, any further thoughts are appreciated. Serious as in being calmer, determined, steady, and silly being fun loving, spontaneous, maybe joking around a lot.\n\nIf you can explain the when's of when you are in either mood, I'd love to hear it, too!
9	If I'm around people that I know fairly well, and the group is at ease I can find myself being kind of silly. The more fun the people I'm with are having the more comfortable I feel, so I can kind of be loose. \nIf there's tension within the group, or I don't know the people I'll usually be in a more serious mood because I worry a lot about offending people, or making someone uncomfortable.
4	I work at a restaurant with a few ESFPs. These guys are all about banter and pushing each other playfully. From time to time the pissing contests might get heated, but they never go beyond the day. \n\nThe ESFPs I work with are heavily into music and try to live life according to what they think is good for them, even if they have to fight several temptations along the way (one of them sleeps around a lot, but wants to find a soulmate. The other is about to hit his first sober year and is in sober living). \n\nThe former's laughter is infectious and people mock him for it but everyone loves him. Tall, handsome, funny musician waiter who's good at helping people stay positive and lighthearted during shifts by utilizing his flirtatious sense of humor. Even with guys he's a tease which is great because it eases competitive tension. \n\nThe latter is action-oriented busser who gets shit done and leaves everyone else in his position in the dust. A bit confrontational but that's due to his life upbringing. Deep down he's pretty sentimental and likes to help people stay positive by engaging them with playful aggressive banter. Hardly ever gets mad and responds energetically to challenges and physical activity. We've butted heads a few times but he really brings me out, and the back of the restaurant is usually brought to life with volleys of comebacks after comebacks when we work together. Good shit. \n\nYeah you ESFPs are pretty silly. The flavors can definitely vary.
1	It's kind of strange, I'm the most serious person I know, yet my sense of humor is also the silliest out of everyone I know. Can't really explain it. I like crude, childlike, raunchy, slapstick kind of humor. Will laugh when someone farts, will tease people when they're uptight. Yet i have the deepest conversations and am constantly disappointed by people.
7	Love languages	Im curious if anyone on here had taken the 5 love languages test, or read the book. I think maybe their might be a link between the Myers Briggs test and love languages. Mine are as follows. Quality time, physical touch, acts of service, words of affirmation, gifts. Do you guys match up or am i way off?
4	Mine are the same as yours!
4	ENFP here stalking your sub. Mine are: Words of affirmation, touch, quality time, acts of service & gifts. In that order:)
3	Touch, Gifts, Words, Time, Acts. For some reason, gifts is consistently the least popular love language and I can't understand why.
2	Ha! Mine are also the same! Not a huge fan of gifts but I can value them if I think of the place they came from. If I could quality time and physically touch would be equal lol
2	Touch, words of affirmation, acts of service, quality time, gifts.\nI agree that there is some sort of correlation between MBTI, and the stacking of love languages of love languages.
1	Mine are the same too! Super interesting that there seems to be a relation to Meyers Briggs. 
1	Same
13	Cutting people off	So esfps are known for easily cutting off people who they've fallen out with, who they've argued with or in some other way annoyed them. \n\nIf you've done this/imagine doing it, what would it take for you to reconsider letting them back into your life?  \n\nIm an infp, I would like the esfp to listen to me and realise the falling out was a mistake and I won't bring them anymore grief. But at the moment they won't reply to my messages where I am explaining myself/apologising a lot.  \n\nIs this out of my control completely and all I can do is wait for them to decide if they want to? Or is there something I could say or do that an esfp would appreciate and be more inclined to listen/forgive. \n\nThanks 
8	We tend to be quite forgiving. Just be clear that u are sorry about the falling out, then give them some time and space. I know that I personally can't hold grudges for beans, and if I have time to cool down, I can forgive pretty much anything pretty fast. If it's just a falling out, I don't think there will be too much of an issue.  When we leave people, it's usually because we have been physically separated, and I can't interact with them. Since we are very in the moment and focused on what is around us to engage in, it's the distance that causes us to loose interest in friends. As long as u are in a position where u have the opportunity to regularly interact with the ESFP, I would think that it's unlikely that the ESFP will move on. Just wait on this one. If in a week nothing has happened, I would try to just casually say hello (preferably in person) as if nothing happened. Let them know that ur willing to move on. If the safe atmosphere is created, u have a good chance of getting it repaired. Once it's been smoothed over a bit and the air has cleared, if it's important to u, u can discuss the issue. If ur fine with just letting it be and neither of u are bothered by it, then u can just let it slip away into the past. 
4	Whoops, old-ass post. Eh, I doubt you'll still find this useful, but if it helps someone else who comes across it in the archive, why not.\n\nSo, here it is. \n\n#HOW TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH AN ESFP\n\n**Source: I am an ESFP and also I struggled with mental illness for years**\n\nYeah, I can confirm that I've ditched people and dropped off the face of the internet just so that I never have to worry about them again. I'll usually feel weird about it for a bit, but the longer I go without contact, the easier it is to move on. This is both a good and bad thing.\n\nWhen I become distant to my loved ones, it always means the same thing: I don't feel like the things I say matter. I am an Se, an External Sensor. If I don't see concrete signs that my words and actions mean anything to the other person, I will not believe that I matter, no matter how much I want to believe it. So, I will withdraw, and focus on other things. When I am at my most healthy, I can make myself believe that things are actually fine by looking *really* deep down (This is our 4th, final function: Ni, Internal Intuition), but this still isn't the ideal environment for me.\n\n**When reconciling with an ESFP, lay out your apology very clearly and concisely.** Use kind, affirmative language if you can, but being blunt about it is something we can appreciate, too. Varies from ESFP to ESFP. Is there any way that you can express concern non-verbally? Words are important, especially if you don't have access to in-person conversation, where body language is king. \n\n**Long-distance relationships are fundamentally terrible for ESFPs.** So, if this was the state of your relationship, the odds are already against you. I'm sorry if this is the case, and if it is, your best chances for making it work are *being in the same physical location*.\n\nTry not to prioritize WHY you did it when you apologize, that's the tertiary part of the conversation. They're an ESFP, ESFPs love honesty and sincerity, **the ESFP will accept your internal reasons for WHY as long as you show them the WHERE, WHEN, and HOW.**\n\nNobody has ever given a simple, clean, and conscientious apology to me. I would be elated if I got one, honestly.\n\n**To make it work with an ESFP, you have to boil down the requirements of a relationship to their essentials, and then express those clearly.** Abstract expressions of love don't work well with Se types, and the void has to be made up for with something else. \n\n##Unintentional mind games are a great way to drive us *literally insane.*\n\nI once dated an INTJ guy. \n\nHe was bad at reaffirming affection in conversation, and if I couldn't see him in person often, our relationship could get shaky. How did we make up the difference? Well, he tried by giving me lots of gifts (I appreciated it even if I didn't completely understand the logic behind it), and I tried by initiating *tons* of sex and cuddle sessions. He was into it, so all was well. Both interactions would lead into better conversation. But, note that he *never* initiated sex. Not even once. \n\nBecause, to his specific INTJ brain, physical displays of affection were not prioritized as a way of strengthening the relationship, and frank expression of feelings had to be personally prompted by me. I was attracted to his intensity, but it was not a very compatible kind of intensity. I was fine with this when we could be in the same location, and believe me, I loved him *a lot*, but it fell apart when we had to go long-distance. This is one way an INTJ+ESFP relationship can develop and end.\n\n**If I saw that the other person's main motivation for apologizing was "I want this relationship back" instead of "I feel bad for hurting their feelings", it would be bittersweet for me, at best.**\n\nAt worst, I'd be offended and I would want to talk to them even less. This is why words are so important, and tone/body language just as much.\n\nI've matured emotionally over the years and I no longer cut people off as much, but I still am willing to do it should the situation be right. \n\nIf it was a sum misunderstanding that came over miscommunication, your ESFP will still feel weird about it for months, maybe years to come. Basically, if you both felt terrible about it, honesty is the best way to heal it. **ESFPs aren't vindictive unless you force their hand.**\n\nHowever, if you were a genuine asshole who didn't consider your ESFP's feelings and pushed too far, it's very easy for your ESFP to let go, even if their intuitive core is telling them that they don't want to. \n\n**Talking about my abstract feelings is hard, trying to put them in a form that other people will understand is excruciatingly hard.** I am sure that an Ne could explain everything I am saying in 1/10 of the text required, but they would have to rely on other people to fill in the gaps.\n\nThis doesn't work with an Se. When I want to talk about my feelings, I will deliberate on absolutely everything, I will leave no emotional stone unturned, because trying to convert a heart into a head is pretty fucking difficult.\n\n**This multiplies if I am trying to explain my feelings to a Ne/Ni.** Yes, like you, OP. If I can't do this when talking, I'd rather not talk at all. In situations of emotional sincerity, there is little more that pisses me off than other people assuming they know how I'm thinking/feeling, and *getting it wrong.*\n\n##Lashing out at an insecure ESFP is devastating to them, and it can put them in a place where they can only see in Black and White.\n\nPersonal experience, my guy. It's hard to forget the things that cut deep.\n\nIf your ESFP has resolved to cut you off, give it some time. I mean it. They'll move on and the painful memory will grow more distant to them as they focus on new things. Try to re-establish friendship after you've moved on a bit, too. Try to do it when it doesn't hurt as much.\n\nOkay, here's another personal anecdote. Even after I repaired a past relationship of mine, I still haven't been able to close the wound of one particularly nasty conversation from years ago. I never brought up how this argument still hurts me, even though we're still close friends. I wish I could, but it's the only sort of thing I can bring up in person, not over text. \n\nSee, he's an ENTP.\n\nENTPs have a similar problem when it comes to text-to-text conversation. Also, the opposite of sensitivity, because blunt criticism in the name of improvement is more valuable than making sure we are on the same emotional page. This bothers me and makes me withdraw *when there is nothing to make up for the discrepancy.*\n\nWell, right now, it doesn't bother me. Why not?\n\nHis pool of concepts to immediately draw upon is much more nuanced than mine, and he's a hell of a force to be reckoned with in an argument. But, I am much better at expanding upon emotions than he is, and I can relate to people in a way that is productive for us both, but only if they let me. I, the ESFP, can amplify creativity in people, and he appreciates this, but it's a cerebral chain of reactions that works best if we're both in the same place. If I tried to analyze it, this post would become twice as long.\n\nMaking it work requires extensive, conscientious conversation, and nothing else will do. This prerequisite can be mitigated if I get to casually spend time with him *in-person*, but I don't have access to that. So, to make our long-distance relationship functional, we constantly debate each other over text. It's not ideal, the both of us would rather be able to spend time together in person, but it works.\n\nDo you see how I had to resort to subtly changing my style of language even when merely describing the problem? This is a fundamental difference between me and him that forces a change of communication to make it work. This is one way an ENTP+ESFP relationship can be put to the test.\n\n**I need the other party to understand that NOW is the time for talking about THIS specific thing, not THAT one, and especially not *THAT* thing that seems to be the correct topic from your perspective, but actually isn't.** I reiterate, if you make an Se feel as though they can't get through to you, they'll bounce.\n\nThis is what it means to be an Se, someone who lives in the present. It's 100% or 0%. I understand you completely on a level that is almost transcendent, or I don't fuckin' get it at all, come back later with a thesaurus.\n\nSo, if you ever find yourself talking with your ESFP again, be sincere and listen to what they're saying. ESFPs have a lot of love inside them that they always want to express, and if they loved you, you still have those things that made them love you. But, we're sensitive, in both the good and bad ways. We can smell anger and fear, and even if we can't explain quite why a situation feels wrong, we can't ignore our gut feelings. That pesky 4th function Ni.\n\nSo, be frank and honest. It's just a matter of patience and sincerity. \n\n##**Also, what those guys said. Hugs. Hugs are ESFP cocaine.**
2	How could I forget hugs. :O hugs are magic. Definitely use them if ur ESFP doesn't have something against hugs (we usually don't, but I'm not going to speak for everybody).
2	Greetings fellow ESFP's! What do you like to do in your spare time?	I'm a 20 year old female ESFP and I spend the majority of my spare time playing video games, calling/texting friends, reading, and organizing family get-togethers. Oddly enough, I find that I don't go out much for my type!\n\nWhat about you? :)
5	Play video games, read, text friends, go drinking, hang out with friends, go to bars with friends, go out to eat with friends, Netflix, hike! All the things!
5	28/m here. I'm very similar, despite being an ESFP I'm incredibly introverted in many ways. \n\nI'll take a night in playing video games over a night out. Happy to spend time chatting on Discord or over Teamspeak with my friends. I'm very creative and am a drummer in a band too, which takes up a lot of my spare time if I'm not at home or at work!
2	[deleted]
2	Funnily enough, I pretty much never organise anything. I sit at home and netflix & chill, or clean. A lot of the times my friends come over to hang or for board games, and we usually go out for dinner a lot. We also do hikes, and runs. But I pretty much chill back cause I know something usually happens every day :)
6	Relationship problems	How to proceed when an esfp suddenly becomes withdrawn and uncommunicative?  It seems they don't want to resolve any issues and would rather not talk than deal with problems. \nAttempts at trying to talk just come across to them as harassing and overwhelming and causes them to become even more withdrawn. 
10	One of the big things about most ESFP types is attention to "vibe"/tone/atmosphere whatever. The emotional messaging itself is as important as the rational message, so when you're dealing with someone who's withdrawing you're going to have to do some coaxing and reassuring to make sure your SO understands you're coming from a place of mutual cooperation and not angrily attacking them. 
1	It's really hard not to get very serious about somebody if I am going to be in a relationship. Therefore I am very hesitant to get into a relationship because I know the weight behind it.
2	have you had any bad experiences with INFJs?	
3	Yes
2	No see, entps have a monopoly on them so it doesn't matter what you do.
1	Not yet ;)
3	Topics to talk with an ESFP about	What are some of your favorite topics?  I'm an INTP looking for some answers.  I have a friend that I really like but we are pretty much the opposite, I need help.
8	Hobbies. I'm a doer and prefer hands on stuff. I have political and social opinions and am willing to talk about them in detail, but damn is it refreshing when someone wants to tell me something interesting they've been up to.\n\nI'll think about government corruption myself. When I'm with others I'd rather discuss good hiking trails or what you're looking to get out of the new camera you just bought. 
4	Anything. We're pretty versatile. Just ask them what they're interest in and we love hearing what your interested in and why.  
4	ESFP, unless under great stress, usually have Zero trouble talking about anything. We(ESFP) love to talk, sometime to the point of nausea.  
3	What were you like as a teenager?	What crazy/badass things did you do as a teenager?
2	Nothing particularly crazy or badass. I was obsessed with being creative and hanging out with friends. I joined just about every artsy club in the school (photography, theatre, etc) sometimes having a leadership position. I loved being surrounded by people every day and having friends all over the school! I guess the riskiest things I did were: cutting class to smoke with friends, and sneaking out or lying about my whereabouts - I tried to make it out to any party/event/trip that I could. I really miss those times honestly!
1	I was a well behaved teenager. My friends and I would indulge in alcohol and weed once in a while, but I was never a problem for my parents. 
1	I worried my mother sick with all the random and mostly toxic boyfriends I would bring home or sneak out with. I flew across the country, knowing my parents didn't approve, to lose my virginity to a long distance boyfriend. I moved out of my parents' at 18 (step-dad issues), went to college and had a pretty good GPA, worked my ass off trying to pay bills, but I was all the happier for the freedom to do whatever the hell I wanted.\n\nI'm only just 20 so this is all very recent, but I definitely took a lot of risks. Some of them paid off, some fucked me over.
4	How does our Fi affect us?	I've recently been typed as an ESFP, to my surprise. I've always considered myself to be a strong Fe-user, and me having Fi as my second function just feels very strange. I feel like I always pay attention to the mood of a group, and then make decisions based on that. I can explain in further detail if it's necessary, but I don't want to make this post too long. \n\nIn short, my question is: in what ways does our Fi affect us? How can we notice that we're using it in our everyday lives? I would appreciate some examples from ESFPs to see if I can relate to anything. Right now, I don't really feel connected to my Fi. 
6	That sounds like healthy Se and Fi. You use Se to read your surrounding and Fi to act appropriately. To determine your values and then use them in a balanced way to make a positive surroundings with people or anything really. 
3	**Auxiliary: Introverted Feeling (Fi)**\n\n"The image is one thing and the human being is another. It's very hard to live up to an image--I'll put it that way."\n--Elvis Presley, ESFP\n\nAs with all EP types, auxiliary Ji (in this case Fi) imbues the ESFP's character with a sense of personal purpose and integrity, with a conscientious concern for the well-being of others, and a sense of purpose and identity amidst the chaos of constant change and exploration. Most at home in the heat of the moment, young ESFPs may have difficulty slowing down and soul-searching long enough to show any meaningful degree of self-reflection or evaluation. When they do, they almost invariably describe a sense of heartfelt empathy with the needs and feelings of others. Development of Fi allows the ESFP's natural ability to adjust to the expectations of his audiences to be uplifted and stabilized by a personalized vision and unique understanding of the universal needs of all living creatures, spanning the physical, spiritual, and emotional. ESFPs who command Fi will know where they're coming from, where they're going, and why--the personalized ethical, spiritual, and aesthetic vision granted by the auxiliary function will remind dominant Se of the real purpose of its endless search for new experiences: personal growth and development.\n\nIt's easy to see how many ESFPs become involved in creative pursuits--and that's not limited to just the arts. Any method by which they can involve themselves directly in the creation of something that reflects the reality around them, and interacts with and affects their perceptions and the perceptions of others, will likely be viewed in a positive light. The key is finding a personalized representation (Fi) of real events occurring in real life, affecting real people in tangible ways (Se). In art, ESFPs find both an immediately stimulating sensory impression and a hint of the weightier and more important personal values by which they will eventually learn to navigate their own sense of virtue and self-evaluation. Fi should ideally lead ESFPs to hold themselves up to the light of the truth, to keep themselves grounded by an unerring sense of private moral rectitude and widespread good will toward life in general: ESFPs will tend to treat most people as good friends until given an explicit reason not to, and it's difficult for most to resist their upbeat attitudes and straightforward, earnest openness.\n\nIf developed poorly, it can be difficult for the ESFP to harness Fi in a genuinely empathetic way. He may neglect concern for the emotional and spiritual needs of others in favor of ensuring that he fills his own quota for new experiential input: more than one ESFP has justified his constant (and potentially excessive) need for high stimulation as a simple expression of his individuality, insisting that others respect his right to behave as he pleases or risk threatening his self-experience. This can and does cause a variety of arguments with the ESFP's close friends and family: Where does my right to individual freedom end, and my obligation to the needs of others begin? While it is true that ESFPs must continue engaging themselves with new experiences in order to feel fulfilled, too much emphasis on dominant Se with not enough on auxiliary Fi can result in crude, directionless hedonism. With so much new information of so many different varieties constantly entering the cognitive sphere, ESFPs (much like all EP types) must be cognizant of taking time out to analyze their experiences in depth (via Fi) in order to grant coherent meaning or value to any of them. Left to its own devices, dominant Se will explore to the ends of the Earth, but never retain the importance of the many life lessons it happens upon in the process.\n\nWhen balanced properly, Fi should provide the ESFP with a sense of personal vision and deeper understanding of her mission and purpose in life. Although her externalized creations often seek to represent physical reality in her own subjective terms, they never quite match the internalized sense of aesthetic and spiritual perfection that Fi leads her to continue seeking throughout her entire life. The more Fi is able to provide subjective ideals for Se to translate into tangible representations of the ESFP's identity, the more it will strike him that he must reflect and further and refine his own sense of self, his own idea of value and hierarchy of priorities. Fi provides, above all, a personalized counterweight to Se's constant attention to the outward expectations of whoever the ESFP may find himself "performing" for nearly every day of his life.\n\n[Source](http://www.typologycentral.com/forums/myers-briggs-type-profiles/68502-esfp-jungian-cognitive-function-analysis-simulatedworld.html)
1	ENFP here, using Fi as Auxillary as well. For me exploration is the main perceptive value, which is slightly different. However, I also pay keen attention to my surroundings and use Fi to judge how everyone feels individually. \n\nSounds like healthy Fi
1	I'm not even sure. I always find myself being more aware of the people around me - how they're acting, the tone of voice they're using, body language etc - which can help me come to a conclusion on whether or not they're having, primarily, a good time and gaining something positive from this experience. \nI always describe it as emotionally manipulating but also being emotionally manipulated at the same time.\nAnyone else feel like this?
3	What Do You Do For A Living?	
1	Borderline ENFP/ESFP here. I'm not teacher and I love every minute of it.
1	Photography. Love it!
1	Sales
1	Sales 
4	What do you think of INFPs?	The title says it all.
5	I love them! So cute and cozy and intellectual. Somehow I've managed to find a lot of INFP friends. We hang out and drink and talk about literature and pop culture and feelings. Literally the best people, except that they never accept my invitations to go out and do things. Then I get pissed at them
5	Cracks me up! I just discovered the "personality" subreddits and just came here because my wife discovered she's ESFP. I'm INFP. We've always joked, but at the same time marveled at how we compliment each other while at the same time being almost polar opposites on a lot of things that one of us hate while the other one thrives on it. She "zones out" on soap operas and Facebook games while I search non fiction facts and research stuff.\n\n  She hates current events, history, etc, and has to ask me or the kids which spelling of any word such as 'where were, we're', etc. Meanwhile she can glance at a bill or receipt and spot an error in a second. I told her when we met that we would be great parents, because our likes and dislikes would cancel each other and our kids had a chance of being normal. And for the most part it's true, our kids are great, and I always remind them to thank their mother because thanks to her someone in their hereditary line had a chromosome left to pass on - I had a good time in the 60's. And as far as conversation with others goes, thank God there's someone else to do that who's good at it and enjoys it. Ironically my dad was a dynamite salesman who thrived on conversation with others. \n\n Also, about us INFP's building walls. Yes we do, but I think we're about to make Mexico pay for them 
5	Y'all drive me nuts. Love them to death though. I always feel like there's something you guys are holding back, like there's a wall that'll never go down. It gets frustrating. I use to be bothered by 3 months cave time. But now I get it. It's just something that you need to live. 
9	What's the most accurate ESFP description you've come across?	I'm an INFJ, but I'm 99% sure my good friend is an ESFP. If I were to send him a description, which one might he be the most receptive to?
6	I kind of like the description on [16personalities](https://www.16personalities.com/esfp-personality)\n\nIt's long, but it's in sections and divided by context, which makes it easier to read (most people just read the summary). Some fun visuals too. Not everyone likes 16personalities, but I'm an ESFP and I found it to be very helpful. :)

1	Likes sports, physical activities. Strong capacity for love and empathy. Likes to have fun. Loyal
3	A slightly shy ESFP known as PeterDraws offers the world almost impossibly awesome and inspiring visual and auditory pleasures on his drawing (and talking) YouTube channel... Here's a recent video to introduce you to his work: ",swooping & swirling inkwash & drawing,"	
1	S's: Have you ever cheated?	I'm [ENTP] part of the Intuitive Integration [INTJ, INFJ, ENTP, ENFP] page on Facebook. Recently, someone posted, asking if anyone has ever cheated. I was wondering whether the answers would changed, based on someone's N or S function. She here are the questions that were asked:\nDid you ever cheat on your partner? If yes, how does it feel the moment you actually let someone start to undress you? Update: Guilt / no guilt? Can you actually really completely enjoy it?
4	No
3	Idk that this counts. But I have kissed someone else while unofficially dating (didn't have the boyfriend/girlfriend talk) someone else. I was drinking and it was fun but I got a huge rush of guilt and told them about it.  That's pretty much the closest I've gotten to cheating. 
2	In my experience, ENFP are loyal to a fault until you give them a reason not to be. 
2	ESFP here, and my partner is INTJ. We have been together almost 25 years.  I'm deeply ashamed about this, but early in our marriage (20 years ago this year) I did cheat on him.  For about six months, I participated in an emotional affair with a coworker who lived in another country.  During a week-long business trip, the affair became physical. We had a total of three physical encounters that week.\nPrior to the trip, I felt zero guilt about what I was doing.  I felt that I was being deliberately "starved" of any physical and emotional attention as punishment for my shortcomings in my relationship. This was in fact, true.  My husband did not feel like I was being the kind of wife he thought I should be, and therefore did not want to indulge my need for his attention or affection.  And although I did not set out to cheat, or seek out this other person, when it became clear he had feelings for me I felt completely entitled to the attention and basked in it.\nDuring the encounters, however, it was different.  I tried, but I just could not let go and enjoy what we were doing. \nFor many years afterwards, I battled intense guilt and depression over what I had done, including a suicide attempt.  I finally disclosed everything to my husband a little over three years ago.  
2	Esfps vs entps	Public debating.  Who  comes out on top.  Entp has  logic and sharp mind vs Esfp has emotional effect and  charisma .  
2	Depends. I used to date an ENTP and I'm ESFP - our debates got super heated and interesting. It was a fun but exhausting dynamic.
2	Any romantic relationship regrets?	I know you guys are supposed to be good at moving on after ending a relationship. Do you ever look back regretting ending it because you think you ended it too soon or could've had more patience to make it work out or wish you committed when you had the chance?...My younger Brother (esfp) Who hated to be alone, commited suicide because he thought he'd be alone forever (he had friends). All his friends moved on and started families. He had a few relationships that ended because he wouldn't commit. One in particular was a girl that he was seeing for 2 years. She ended it because he wasn't able or didn't want to give her a definant hope for the future (commitment).  I believe he love her more than anybody and she loved him. Eventually She moved one and so did he but he always talked about her. When he moved on to the next lady, it also ended after 2 years. Same exact reason as the other girl. By this time ALL his friends were married and had families. Because of this, he ended his life he was so afraid to be alone. So my question is: Do you ever look back on your life and think. "I had (the one) and I wish I didn't let her go. I should have committed"......? I'm just curious. I'm not blame throwing on anybody. I'm trying to understand.
1	I am so sorry. It sounds like he had a lot of internal struggles.\n\nI don't know that I can give you the insight you are looking for. I do move on quite a bit. But there are those "what ifs" and "what would of happened" thoughts once in a while. If I would have continued. But I also know there is a reason it ended. I do believe that one day. There will be a person that, will make me want to fully commit. Even though those relationships ended they still mean a lot to me. It just wasn't right for me. Self reflection is always a good thing. \n\n I'm so sorry for your loss.
2	What is the most important thing in your life?	Sorry for another survey-post ;) Take it or leave it. The most important thing in my life is my spirituality.
2	The most important thing in my life is my close friends.  I have a very broad friend group and I like hanging out with  individual people but at the end of the day I always come back to my very tight circle.
2	The most important part in my life is constantly challenging myself and being happy. I love being stimulated all the time, preferably very busy with things going on all around me. \n\nMy biggest fear in life is living a what we in Sweden call a "Svensson-life" - Svensson being a very common surname. Essentially, getting married, having two children, living in a nice little house with maybe a dog or a cat, working office jobs, you get the drill. I always crave adventure and new challenges, I rarely keep a job for more than six months, and I make sure to keep company with like minded people who will keep me entertained. My biggest dream in life is to see the world - I'm going backpacking through Thailand at the beginning of 2017 so that's a start :) \n\nI'm an 18 year old girl, for the record.
2	What is for you the greatest invention of the 20th century?	"Various opinion polls have shown that the greatest invention of the twentieth century the invention of the pill, because people can love when they pleased, because women no longer fear that they will become pregnant. Wonder tablet have brought sexual and indirectly, economic independence, so they can compete for better jobs and no longer fainted when they saw a mouse - were no longer dependent on male stereotypes about women. Thanks to contraception have entered into a contractual relationship. The emancipation of women is actually a paradox of imparting a freedom because women requires more and more responsibilities and duties. What they once represented as a great social achievement and privilege today they are experiencing as a form of oppression." (Europeana: A Brief History of the Twentieth Century by Patrik Ouredník)\n\n\nA price of freedom? "Glorious" capitalism; crazy feminism! (What do you think?)
3	Computers and related inventions. They drastically increased the possibilities for the speed and scale of human activity as we know it. 
2	I don't even know what could be on the same level as the Pill - it's the only possible answer to this question imo.

3	Infj female with questions for esfp males	Is it possible for you all to maintain a relationship long term without flirting outside of the relationship? Is it?! Infj female married to esfp male. Considering divorce. Sick of the flirting cycle. Each time is the last time, i can see he means it, he believes himself when he's saying it. Except the last time never is the last time. Is the urge too compelling? Is it uncontrollable? Esfp's are generally flirty and impulsive then add to that testosterone and i don't know how to handle my life anymore man. 
5	But I like to flirt and it happens innocently and naturally. I don't act on it when im in a couple. I wont kiss another woman or be adventurous. I just like talking to her. Its just how i express myself and live happy.
2	Hey you, I happened to stumble on you again because I've been visiting this thread to see how ESFPs think lol. I know you're looking for ESFP perspective here, but I just wanted to butt in where I'm not wanted because my first long term relationship ended as a result of this type of situation. I don't know what type he was (although I do really want to know).\n\nBasically he was a self-described huge flirt, which I couldn't tolerate. When I would confront him with specific instances that were unacceptable he downplayed them like they were nothing and convinced me I was overreacting. He constantly described me as a giant weight around his shoulders (healthy relationship, right?). This went on for ~5 years, only 2 of which were good ones. When we finally broke up it was because I had become such a jealous wreck that I broke my own moral code and logged into his facebook. I found that he had been emotionally cheating on me to a much LARGER extent than I previously knew. He had been chatting on facebook with a girl we met at a group event in college. He was telling her he liked her, wanted to give her valentine's day gifts, etc. Swore up and down they had no physical contact. After we broke up, several of our close friends came to me with stories about instances where he had hit on them. Really unhelpful and traumatic, but that's what happened. \n\nSince then I've learned to trust my gut in relationships - by that I mean standing by my interpretation of the situation as a valid perspective, even though I can easily understand someone else's feelings on the matter. Our Introverted intuition can connect dots without us understanding how, so trusting ourselves is key. If he's committed to you, he's got to give some ground to make you feel happy and safe. You're not being unreasonable in the situations you've described in the comments. \n\nESFP I described on the other thread, who is dating a good friend is also super animated, friendly, chatty, and could come off as subtly flirting with everyone, I think. But from what I understand gives our friend no reason to be concerned with fidelity. There are lines. Draw the ones that suit you and your relationship and stick to them.
1	There's no problem with flirting. People like me and I like them. I wouldn't agree to stop
1	You're not gonna like this comment. But have you considered looking deeper into why it bothers you? Because I don't just give the title of boyfriend (let alone husband) to everyone. That means I view you above all. It's not flirting to me. It's being friendly and playful. Just like you enjoy learning new different things constantly, that's what people are for us. You read science books or take a class to learn something (example sorry for stereotyping) That's what people are for us. So At the end of the day or the year or century or whatever. You're the one I want.

2	Looks high?	Are you ever told that you look high? When you're not?
3	Everyone thinks I'm on drugs. Apparently being happy and enjoying life is dependent on drug use :p
3	Happens more than I like but yeah, often. 
2	No?
1	That I'm either drinking or high. It use to annoy me but now I just figure happiness is just super foreign to them! And do my thang
1	Yep! \n\nAlmost everyone in my life thinks that I'm on drugs and I haven't touched any drugs besides caffeine and alcohol, ever.
1	No, but yesterday an acquaintance assumed I would know where to get weed. I don't smoke but I think he just assumed I did because I party a lot :/
6	Flirting with everyone vs. actually interested in someone	How much flirting do you do, and how do you handle it when people take you more seriously than you intended?\n\n
9	I always come across as flirty, despite rarely intending to. \n\nI think it's just my bubbly nature in general tbh
6	I only flirt with people I like. If they take it seriously then that's a good thing.
4	I have a habit of semi-flirting with pretty much everyone, male and female. I have had more people than I can count take that as actual interest. My problem is that even when they ask me out and I politely refuse, I don't stop flirting. It's instinctual. :(\n\nI've caused some problems and lost many friends this way. Luckily it's getting better as I get older.
2	A lot of people would consider it 'flirting', but I just consider my personal interactions with other people as 'friendly'. I suppose it's just my way of making everyone I meet comfortable in a conversation. \n\nWhen people start to take me more seriously, I usually try to drive the conversation back to the fun and casual state. But if the person intended to have a serious conversation, I can flip a switch that casts aside the frequent jokes and sarcasm that makes me an ESFP
1	I've been accused of flirting, but I've tried maybe only once when I was buzzed.
1	How can someone tell if your crushing on them?	How can someone tell if you are crushing on them? In person and through texts. Are there any spacific ways/body language or texting styles/habits to know for sure?
5	Speaking as an ESFP and someone who knows ESFP's, we're natural flirts, so it's often very difficult to determine whether we're actually crushing or just flirting for fun.\n\nThe only thing I would look for is extra attention and initiation of conversation. Despite being very social, ESFP's don't often show their true emotions and tend to keep their deepest feelings to themselves. Unless they are coaxed. :)
3	I guess it depends on a lot of different factors. Not all ESFP's are the same in every area. I personally wouldn't go on a date unless I'm confident that it's worth a shot. If I don't believe that I'm a good fit for someone then I wouldn't bother dating as I hate to disappoint dating partners later on.\n\nSo I guess the only way to see is ask them out and see from there.
2	Uh for me it's pretty obvious. I keep talking to them. Smiling a lot I guess.

5	MBTI videogame preferences	I was wondering if anyone had any ideas on how to map videogame preferences to mbti types. specifically using the eight Jungian cognitive functions.
3	I like the Sims and fighting games
1	I thought about this a while back. But idk that functions would have anything to do with likes or dislikes. I play halo pretty frequently and the list of other types that like it just as much as me vary. But then again we all get together to play chess too. 
1	An ESFP at my work plays mostly FPS, like Wolfenstein: The New Order. He also said that a few years ago he was addicted to WoW. Quite funny considering he is 50+ years old.
1	I'll play any game as long as I'm mic'd up with some friends. \n\nWhen Skyrim came out my roommates gave me shit because I didn't follow any storyline and only wanted to beat the game. I guess when it comes to video games, I just want to finish the campaign as quick as possible without knowing what the story actually is. 
1	There's a good articla about that, give it a read\nhttp://blog.gametree.me/personality-says-gamer/
1	You could start with a survey and see if there are any connections there.\n\nPersonally, I like immersive games like Skyrim or really silly little phone management games. Maybe I'm not a typical ESFP but I have no interest at all in multi-player games
2	Does this happen to anyone else?	Hello fellow ESFP fam. I find that people tend to avoid me because they think I'm judging them, when really I'm just being shy. I don't like this, and want to change it. Has this happened to anyone else? If so, did you do anything to change it? If so what was it and how well did it work? (If it helps for context, I'm a 19 year old male at college)
3	Are you sure that's why they avoid you? I can't really think of any instance of me avoiding anyone because I thought they were judging me. 
2	Can you share an example?? 
1	Did someone tell you that's why they were avoiding you? I know that when I'm feeling shy I can get kind of dark and sarcastic and I think that pushes people away and could make them avoid me. I've never been told I'm judgmental though...
1	How do you know that's why they avoid you? I'm shy. I think you're shy because you're self-conscious and this is the reason you come up with. The solution would seem to be just talking more. If people think you're judging them then maybe reveal something about yourself that they might judge you for and see how they react to level the playing field. I doubt that's the case though. If you're shy people might just find it awkward to make conversation with you.
4	ESFP females, how do you view INTJ females?	I do not know any other female INTJs personally, so I can't readily observe how they get on with fellow females. It seems the majority of females I encounter are ESFP so I was curious. Be honest!
3	I had a female supervisor (retail) who was  INTJ .It was not a successful relationship. I also married an INTJ male.It was not a successful relationship. 
3	I have a few INTJ friends and I absolutely love them. At first it was rocky. They were constantly trying to figure me out and from what I know now. They thought I didn't like them. There's nothing to read between the lines, when I'm being nice, there is zero motive other then I like people.  I do have a hard time with how unaffectionate they were at first. I greet everyone I meet with a hug. It's just who I am. But the conversation is great. Very open. All I want is honesty and that's what they give me. So it's great!\n\nThey do offended me at times but I try really hard to communicate that I was offended and why. Not easy for me, but I'm working not avoiding communication. I'm not sure if that's an ESFP thing or a me thing \n\nAlso, how do you get along with them? 
2	I think INTJs and I get along great.\n\nFound that many are my best friends.\n\nThen again, I can't be certain if that is their type or not. At least a few of my friends seem very sceptical about Myers-Briggs types in general. 
1	Lets seee...is ESFP better suited to me than ENFP?	Title.\n\nIve taken the Myerrs Briggs test 3 times. The first was more or less a year ago. The second was about a month ago. The 3rd was this morning. All 3 times, I have gotten the ENFP-T personality type. However, after spending on some time on /r/ENFP, Ive found that I feel differently than them. They seem a lot more carefree than I do, to put it as plainly as possible. I would point out more specific examples but the point is...\n\nI was recommend to check this type and I feel, according to the 16personalities website, that ESFP fits me just as well. Like, both descriptions resonate with me but this board seems to have more like minded people, despite the very little amount of discussion.\n\nLittle bit about me:\nI love making jokes. Ive done stand-up exactly once and I did very well, IMHO. Ever since I saw Jay Leno on the tonight show in 3rd grade, Ive wanted to be a comedian. It is also a lot of peoples go-to compliment about me.\n\nI have 2 groups of friends, both large. The two groups dont get along though, so they split. I feel like I get along with everyone at my high school. I have at least one friend in every clique and there are very few people that truely get on my nerves. \n\nI enjoy company of others. I like being alone too, but long weekends alone get me really bored. Im usually the first to text because Im very talkative and want to stay close and start discussions.\n\nAnyway. Thats all. I dont know if I have my true type nailed down quite yet but I think this is a good place to ask. Thanks dudes!
3	You're using concrete examples. You must be a sensor.
2	So I've recently gone through like a week of classes at my university about the Meyers-Briggs stuff amongst other personality factors. One of the psychology professors mentioned that everyone kind of has a base personality. For me, it's ENFP. When I was in high school, I think I resonated well with INTJ due to some things, but when you go through certain changes in life, your personality can change, albeit briefly. For example, I have found that when I go through depression (like actual depression, not the classic ENFP down-cycle), I become more of an NT instead of NF and am very quick to be judgmental and whatnot. So I hope that helps. I mean I'm not a psych student or anything, but yeah. 
1	That's a hard one. Do you day dream often? You seem pretty practical. Have you tried a cognitive function test? 
1	Well, what are ya??
3	Small talk	What do you guys think of it? Do you think it's a nice way to get to know people? Or is it as useless as the commercials before YouTube videos, and you wish we could just skip to deeper conversations?\n\nI've asked this in all the mbti sub-reddits (is that what it's called?) Someone posted an article about it in the INTP group, if you want to read it, but you don't have to, just want to know what you think. -curious intp\n\nAlso I don't know how to define small talk, but I think it's safe to include social graces, work/school, and weather (I apologize if you are a weather nerd or something and actually find it very intriguing to talk about)
6	I like to use small talk as a way to feel out the other person. Just because you're not talking about deep things doesn't mean what someone says doesn't tell you a lot about them. \n\nIt's very useful to use small talk to gauge how people will react to certain topics, and how to best engage or avoid said topics in a conversation with them, for example. Or if someone is super positive all the time, vs someone who's super sarcastic, vs someone who's super negative, etc. \n\nSmall talk is a low risk way to figure out how someone operates socially, at least on a surface level, which is super useful to know. \n\nI think it's important to make the distinction between forced pleasantries versus small talk where you (or preferably both parties) are actively trying to learn more about each other to build comfort and rapport with your conversation partner. The former is what a lot of people really hate IMO. 
3	People like to shit on small talk but you have to start with small talk. Imagine someone comes up to you and asks you ..I dunno, whatever deep question, right off the bat. Aren't you a little thrown off? Most people would find you pretty weird and probably not associate with you unless they're weird too.\n\nIt's just a risk not starting with small talk. It's like a cue you don't have social skills. Or you'd have to be pretty skilled/charming to pull it off anyway.
2	For me, small talk never really happens, when I talk to someone, I dive deep, intentionally, if I'm making insignificant time with small talk I feel like I'm wasting time, i like to get right I there and find them deep secrets, wait wait, let me rephrase, any time spent talking to someone is never insignificant, I love talking to anyone and everyone I can, it's like a hunger I can never get full of. While I think small talk has its place, no one ever really has to have small talk as long as both ends are willing to contribute to a conversation. 
1	I don't feel like any talk is invaluable. I'm not one for saying "the weather is nice today" I'm more so get right into they're likes and dislikes. Ask questions, I have a three question start and that gives me a feel for their personality. And then I'll start joking around a lot. And keep it light hearted, depending on how much I like them. 
4	I would like you to participate in my MBTI relationship survey.	I would like to get more ESFPs to participate in MBTI relationship statistics, because as of now, there are only 2 ESFPs, whereas other types have crossed the 100 limit right now. \n\n[Here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/19k9UrDFdQtci5-kRNeykkR3J4iw7c1A2y0zqirHQtoI) is the form.\n\nI really appreciate your help. And if you are really interested in statistics, [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yFpUbw92VH_BGrVf-FMngyCdtERYVvvGOEL_T58kw9Q/edit#gid=641219863) is the sheet, (Check out other Tabs. It's also always updated.) It's currently unfinished, so pardon any bugs. And it's better to copy it to your google drive and edit INFP Tab from "INFP" in cell A3, to "ESFP" if you want to see your statistics. ESFP Tab is somewhat less finished due to Google Sheets bugs.
3	[INTJ] Crush on an ESFP	I have decided to ask my friend out who is an ESFP. Any advice on how I should ask her out or ways to deepen the relationship?

2	Grab and kiss. Works every time!
1	up front and to the point would throw me off my guard, which I would like I think
1	How can I have a good relationship with my ESFP mother?	Hi all, I [INFP] and my mom [ESFP] have been going through a massive rough patch.  She took the test a while back and it was accurate to a T so I'm pretty sure I know what I'm dealing with here.  She is very controlling and expresses her anger both verbally and physically, while I tend to retreat until I have cooled down enough to forgive her, and so the cycle continues.  What I don't get is why she is so closed off to me emotionally - she has a cohort of close friends who know far more about her than I could ever hope to, and yet she demands to know everything about me.  Sorry to bring to light all these negative traits but i'm wondering if any ESFPs can help me understand what makes my mom tick and how we can resolve disputes properly.  Much obliged :)
5	My experience as an ESFP is that I have very close to emotions all the time, but that it burns out very quickly. Us senser-feelers know very well how to read people and make them tick, which is why we can get quite mean when we're pissed even if the initial anger doesn't last for long. \n\nEmotional closed off-ness usually comes for me personally when I feel the other person having a "superior" attitude to them, usually I don't connect well with N's for example, as they always seem to find me shallow etc for being an S. \n\nI don't know your mother but that's just my own experiences. Good luck! x
3	Idk if this will help.. But I'll try. Do you pry? I know for myself I have to willingly give knowledge, you can't just ask for it. My deep feelings and thoughts are pretty private. Have you been up front with her about wanting to have that kind of relationship? \n\nSome of my experiences with some people, when we have a misunderstanding. They tend to throw things in my face. Like some kind of twisted, game of who's the worst person. I don't partake. But I don't like it either. I can be sensitive but I prefer upfront. I can reason with myself, that you have no ill will. \n\nAlso, it was hard for me at first to understand how INFPs work. Try to explain yourself more but also remember we're very practical. If you can't, try to be honest, upfront and reasonable. And tell her how you feel. And maybe even ask her what you can do to make things run smoother. \n\nShe sounds dysfunctional though. 
2	ESFP mother here. I can't relate to her behaviour at all. Maybe she's just a shitty person.(sorry...)
1	Enegram & Big 5 Are Not Popular Because There's Nothing Much To Read About Them In Comparison To MBTI?	Why are "Enegram" & "Big 5" test not as popular as MBTI?\n\nI think it may be because there is a lot to read about your personality type online after taking a MBTI test but nothing much after taking the "Enegram" or "Big 5" test.\n\nWhat do you think?

1	Why are rock and heavy metal lumped together?
2	I feel like I am the most introverted ESFP out there	Like here's the thing. I appear to be introverted to many people but once they start talking to me, within 2 minutes they know I am extroverted. Here's the thing, I do like being out of the house BUT I need my alone time...if I am out for like a good 12 hours or so, I need alone time. \n\nHow ESFPs are described, they are known to be the most extroverted but do I feel this way? Hell no. I do make friends and get along with people for the most part BUT I get a little drained if I am around too many people at a party. \n\nDo any of you relate to this?
5	Just chill out. You're over thinking it. Look more into functions and instead of comparing yourself to stereotypical esfp behavior. The way esfp is written in mbti is really shallow and over emphasis the party boy. It's also one of the types with the least written about it.\n \nYou also say a lot of stuff with no awareness to how it sounds. You're introverted cause you need to recharge after being out for 12 hours? Really bro? Some people cannot have lunch with another person without having a recharge. You'll get more perspective about yourself as you live, get older. Not by asking endless questions about this stuff \n Look more into socionics. But, really, chill out with these threads. It's like you're having a crisis
3	you could be an ambrivert. but it really depends on how you recharge yourself. for example: I may sleep 3 hours one night, work all day the next day, go home feeling exhausted, receive a text from some friends inviting me to the bars or whatnot and while i'm driving to meet them, I feel some super burst of energy. vis versa, an introvert could sleep 3 hours, work all day, go home feeling exhausted, open a book and feeling completely energized by what they are reading. \n\nfeeling drained around too many people at a party is normal for any type; there are too many of them to have possible conversations with, you may feel uncomfortable with the way you dressed or the person who brought you there, or you might just want to party with a familiar group of people.\n\njust because we are ESFP's, it doesn't mean we should always feel totally comfortable in any social gathering at any point or time. 
2	Yea I'm the same way. I don't talk to most people but once we get a convo going I'm very outgoing. I need to be out and among people every day at least though.\n\nI think ESFJ is most extroverted. Possibly ESTP. Because of their Fe. Ne doms are quite extroverted as well. I don't know if I get drained at a party, it's more like I just want to go home and do my own stuff after a while.
1	Yeah. Don't worry too much about it :) I have a huge preference to extroversion and there are entire weeks where the thought of lots of people sounds way too tiring. Keep in mind, being tired it perfectly natural, so there is no need to look to far into that 
1	Like an ENFP, you got that auxiliary introverted feeling. Maybe you need alone time for emotional processing.  \n\nAlso, I had an ESFP boyfriend (which was apparently a bad idea), and though he seemed to have a greater appetite for going out to many different places, I was definitely chattier, to the point of exhausting him, though I think he was actually more conventionally extroverted.
1	"Extroverted" just means objective- Michael pierce.\nSo being a "Objective Sensory" dominant doesn't equate to not being shy or not overly outgoing. You do have FI aux, I estimate that's receiving a lot of attention.
2	Personality Mega-Group	We only have one token ESFP and want more of you lovely bunch. ;) Last year we made an ENFP GroupMe which expanded to include other types. It's been a fairly large and sustainable community, so today we decided to add some more people for some new friends and perspectives. [Come say hey!](https://app.groupme.com/join_group/24516498/cfr71v)
1	I'm in!
3	Did you feel like an outsider growing up?	
2	I did. Everyone thought I was really weird because I was way too hyper (when I say everyone, I mean everyone. My class size was 15 in middle school). They got quite vocal about it, and made me feel terrible for being that way. I'm still "way to hyper" to this day, but now that I'm in college, my high energy levels (meaning that when I get excited, I'll run around in circles) seem to be the thing that my friends admire the most about me :p. Lol. They make 19 sound old 
1	In what way?
1	To this day,  people ask me where the he'll do I get the energy from. I am the happiest when I'm with my mates, although I have very few,  very good friends.  
4	How are friendships and relationships between an ESFP and an INFP?	Just as the question. Tell me your experiences if you have any. It's just that I found that there is this girl who is an INFP in my class. 
3	Are you an esfp or enfp today?
3	I do like them a lot. But I can't spend to much time with them. They're idealism becomes overwhelming. I try not to be so straight forward and filter myself. Because I tend to hurt their feeling. And usually it's a miscommunication. The ones I know... Are extremely messy and don't have the best hygiene. I have super sensitive sense of smell... I guess I can't really say all infps are that way.. I just don't know many
3	I just got out of a 2 year relationship with an INFP. In the beginning they will make you feel like king of the world and you will meet their idealistic sense of who you should be. However down the road ESFPs are Carpe Diem, where as INFPs prefer to live in the past or the prospective. It's like living in two different worlds. You will want to go ride a Ferris wheel and they will want to stop and stare at the sky and talk about how if it rained more in Africa, less people would starve to death. Either you will shut her down and she will feel minimized, or she will shut you down and you will feel trapped and restless. Wouldn't recommend.
2	Also, to answer, they (infps) can be kinda hurtful in how they'll totally pull away to recharge or whatever. I find that really annoying. When someone doesn't acknowledge me for days, I assume it's cause they are bored and have moved on.  They'll pull that crap and place the impetus on you to reconnect with them. 
2	In my experience ESFPs look down on INFPs. They find them too soft.
2	one of my best friends is an INFP. he actually introduced me to the MBTI. We lived together for two years in college (3 years ago). Him and I were able to feed off of each others desires to stay in for the night or go out and party. we are perfect wingmans for each other and he would become much of an ENFP when we went out wherein I would become much of a ISFP when we would stay in watching anime or playing zelda.

1	Hard. I have a few INFP friends and we just don't mesh. One goes thru phases where he'll call me in the middle of the night for like a few weeks or so and just Ne all over the phone about stuff I don't care about. Another one is super depressive and drains my energy. Another one I only see on facebook and posts all manner of clinicla depression-related stuff. I deleted facebook so that's not a problem anymore. And another one who might be ENFP but claims INFP, well she's just psycho. So.

2	I love how worked up the top commenter in that thread got. Man...
2	INFJ here looking for ESFP perspective.	My mother-in-law is an ESFP and I have a really hard time connecting to her. To put it nicely we quite frankly drive each other nuts. I mean since we're family we do make an effort towards each other but we can't live together or things get a bit heated. \n\nMy disconnects with her is that she can't talk about things too deeply, she's very limited in that area. It drives me crazy how spontaneous she is, I'm very much a planner so when I go on big trips with her I just want to rip out my hair because hardly anything is planned. Lastly, she cannot stand sad things, she has to have constant happiness all the time. The only movies she'll watch is fluffy comedies. While I like a lot of meaning and yes, sadness in my media. \n\nThere are of course other things but this is just naming a few. So my questions to you guys are:\n\nWhat do I need to know to understated her better?\n\nHow do you guys feel about INFJ's? Maybe there are things about me that drive her crazy that I'm not seeing.
4	You need to communicate. The INFJs in my life express every sad emotion and feel sooo deeply.  We love people, so if we know what makes you happy we will try to make you happy in that way, but you have to understand your way of thinking is foreign to us. For us sadness is a waste of such a short life. The world is cruel enough. We're very practical, so just be straight with us. And please don't force things on us. \n\nBottom line, speak up! Share your perspective. And give her time to give 50/50. Also, you can't be everyone's best friend. It's just not possible. Don't force it, notice your differences and compromise. \n\nIdk if this is every ESFP but I prefer to share my deep or sad thoughts with a super close friend or not at all. I don't feel the need to express it to everyone. No one needs extra on their plate.  I also prefer to do things rather than talk about them. That's the fun in that?? 
3	Big fun Reddit MBTI survey	**Edit: I have closed the survey.** Basic preliminary data is available here: [link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfWpyBCtgq81S03KJZYVzn5tVVhUgbTcJ6lqUhDFb78EQQEtA/viewanalytics?usp=form_confirm)\n\nHi all. I'm interested in seeing what correlations exist between certain types and various random things, so I've created a big survey. Its a little bit long, it will probably take 10-30 min depending how fast you are at filling out surveys. I tried to mix fun questions with serious questions and so topics include pop culture, politics, art, lifestyle, etc.\n\nI also posted this in /r/mbti, but I'd like some more varied responses (INxx types really like filling out surveys) The survey is at [this link to google forms](https://goo.gl/forms/fHSemrg0ey1EYfK63)\n\nIt is completely anonymous, handled by google forms. After you take it it will let you see the raw results, please don't spoil these results for others. Once I have enough responses, I will perform a statistical analysis on the results and share them on /r/mbti.\n\nIf you know anyone else interested in MBTI, feel free to share the survey, but please only fill it out once yourself.\n\n**Please don't spoil** the survey questions for others, particularly the trivia questions, I want to see what types have knowledge/interest of certain things.\n\n*I'd like to know (without spoilers), what you thought of the survey and what additional questions you would have included. So please let me know.*
1	So are you able to see the type by type answers? Otherwise the results of this look rather pointless
6	ESFP's views on INTP's	I saw on r/INTP that ESFP's and INTP's don't get along. I've been been reading through this subreddit and I can see why an INTP would feel maybe uncomfortable around ESFP's, but I was wondering how ESFP's feel.
5	I would agree with r/INTP on this one. But I do find INTPs super interesting! I'm very familiar with the type(and with Ti-doms in general; lots of them are my relatives, friends' SOs, coworkers, previous classmates or neighbors etc...), and I can safely say *none* of them are more than people I simply tolerate. And the feeling is definitely mutual. I still find them super interesting, but you know those people you meet and you can just tell you won't get along? \n\nTo name some things:\n\n- I feel like they look down on others easily. It's weird. I do my best to not judge people and to be respectful of other's lifestyles. INTPs in my experience don't do the same. I've seen multiple INTPs write people off as vapid and stupid because of the music they listen to, or the shows they watch, or the way they dress. "Only shallow people use Snapchat" and "Oh, your friend watches Keeping Up With The Kardashians? Well she did seem kind of stupid." are real things I've heard INTPs say. \n\n- And they tend to come off as condescending, which I'm totally not a fan of. My coworkers do this all the time, where everyone would be having a conversation and it turns slightly more difficult to follow or a big word is used. The two INTPs will stop talking, pick some random person in the crowd(who I guess looks stupid; and who didn't ask for an explanation) and dumb it down for them. There is one INTP who is really smart, and lots of times he has to dumb down the conversation for me. He can be really nice about it. The other one is definitely on the same level as me, so it really pisses me off that he thinks he has stop and explain what "precocious" means for me. \n\n- I feel like out measures of success are very different. It's interesting. I consider myself way more successful at life than most of the IXTPs I meet, but still, I think Ti-doms "pity" me. I care a lot about my looks and I like being around people and feeding off of them way more than doing any introspective activities. I like a lot of really trashy reality TV shows (not the kardashians, they're too "first-world" for me lol think "flavor of love"-trashy), I'm not interested in science, and I trust people with degrees more than people who don't have them 7 times out of 10. That is probably a nightmare for most INTPs. *Who would want that lifestyle?*. But I'm content with who I am, and I don't want everyone to be like me. We don't really get each other, and thats fine! I'm glad we are so different, it adds color to the world. :D
3	Really?? I have quite a few INTP friends. We get along just fine. They're always fun and have interesting things to talk about. I personally love INTPs. I couldn't see myself being in a relationship with one though. But that's because I party with both my INTP friends and it always ends up really crazy. And you would think I would be the one to set no limits... This is not the case. I do feel like they like to compete a lot. I'm not a huge fan of competing. But it doesn't bother me. Just not something I'd want in a SO. \n\nI'm curious why you would say we would make them uncomfortable. What's your take on us? 
2	I had a good friend in high school who was an intj. I feel like I did make her uncomfortable at first with how much I jumped around and ran in circles, but eventually, she introduced me to mbti, and saw my differences as an ESFP, and something about that made her feel a lot more comfortable around me. Now, we occasionally have random theoretical discussions and talk about certain machines that she likes, and we get along great. While I can see that there may be some initial differences, I find that a type as flexible as the ESFP can get along with intps just fine (as well as any other type for that matter).
2	INTPs are cool. ESFPs get along with everyone unless the person has no chill though. You guys have Ne and Fe which makes it easy to keep up the conversation.
1	I don't dislike ESFP, it's actually the opposite. Although I could feel uncomfortable because of the **huge** difference of energy usage. I'm here thinking all the time about stuffs and get lost into it while you guys use your energy at being awesome and hilarious. You're in the now, I wish I was but I'm not most of the time. And this can make me feel like i'm boring as hell in comparison.\n\nThat being said, INTPs don't share one brain like a beehive. You may have seen one or two bitching around, but they don't represent the whole. 
1	i used to have a friend in highschool,he was ESFP. To this day, funniest person i have ever met, always dancing, making the funniest jokes, only time he was serious was in a rugby game, it was actually funny to watch him be serious. we used to get along well when it was just me and him talking, always interesting to talk to, and would tell me things about people and explain situations i had trouble understanding socially. INTP here. i always felt that the one thing he didn't like about me was that my sense of humor was more looking down on people and condescension and all the INTP stuff
1	I'm INTP, and have been living with an ESFP for 10 years now. I admire her outgoing nature (which i'm incapable of) and i think she admires my calm reflective nature.
2	How to win an ESFP back	I'm an INFP and last year I feel deeply in love with an ESFP and I haven't stopped loving him since. In the beginning I took an instant liking to him, which is unusual for me as it takes me a while to warm up to people. But with him I realised he was something quite special and I didn't want to let him go.\n\nIt was at first quite difficult because I'd never felt this way about someone before and I kept pestering him to see him again and I got really obsessed and I would just end up sending him huge texts about my feelings. It just pushed him further away and so I stopped trying to force things to happen and left him alone. \n\nThen half a year later, the opportunity came up for me to meet him again. I decided to change my attitude and try doing things his way, namely, not thinking too much about what things meant and just enjoying the moment. And it worked so well, we became so close to eachother. We worked well together, we would help eachother with our work and we kind of complemented eachother. It was so beautiful and I know that he thought it was too, which felt like quite an accomplishment for me because he always has this strong facade and it felt like an honour to find the sensitive part that was underneath. When he told me I was beautiful it was such a proud moment. Often several weeks would go by between us meeting oneanother but each time we met we would become closer than ever. We were even going to go on a trip to Berlin together.\n\nThen it changed suddenly when I told him something that I didn't realise he would get upset about. I won't go into detail about it because I feel guilty enough but the essence of the problem was that I was incredibly naive and he ended up feeling hurt and feeling that he couldn't trust me again.\n\nI thought this was the end but after a month of hearing nothing from him he told me he was ready to forgive me because he knew I never meant to hurt him. He said he didn't think he was going to be able to trust me again but that he missed me and thought about me a lot. However, he also said that he thought that we could never be more than friends. I guess he's completely within his rights to say so and I should feel lucky that he even forgave me, let alone want to be friends with me.\n\nBut the problem is that I love him so much and I want more. And I know that we work well together and so I know I can make him happy. So for the first time since I told him about the hurtful thing, he said he wants to meet me again because he misses me. I don't know what to do because I've never spent time with him simply as friends before. I somehow want to show him when I see him next that I'm worth more than that but I'm not sure how...

2	Don't come on too strong. He's cautious of u now because of ur history, so u want to appeal to him as a friend. As an ESFP, I find myself drawn towards people who like to have fun, so if u meet with him with the goal of hanging out and having fun, things will go well, and he will most likely start trusting u again in no time. The main thing u need to keep in mind is that if u come on too strong, he will run. Don't let him know u love to that extent, because at this point, he will feel trapped and will retreat, and he will be less likely to return. Hang out with him a few times and see where that goes. I know he said he only wants to be friends, but keep in mind it's possible he was just saying that as a defense mechanism to protect himself from further harm, and with a proper approach, he could change his mind. It could also be how he really feels, and no matter how much u hang out, that may not change. If u want to be around him, u have to accept that there is a strong possibility that his stand point may never change. One of my favorite definitions of love is, "doing the best thing for somebody else over doing what u want for urself," and it may turn out the best thing for him is to respect his wish to stay friends. At the very least, just hang out, be his friend, and relax and have fun :) I guarantee u he will enjoy himself.
2	Don't come on strong. Just be a fun friend for now, let him come to you. He had to process and work things out in his own head. 
1	You're in for a world of hurt if you continue to see him "as friends" when you clearly are still in love with him. Your story is very similar to my relationship with my ESFP ex (sort of ex, we were friends with benefits bc he couldn't give me a more serious commitment, and I tried everything too, from being the 'cool girl' to being the most awesome friend (with benefits) I could be in hopes he would see my worth and 'upgrade' the relationship). \n\nTake it from me, this is going to be a moth to flame relationship and the only thing that worked for me was to quit him cold turkey. Being in my ESFP ex's presence was like an ex smoker being in front of a cigarette. You may confuse that for true love, but it's not. It's passion but it's not true love. \n\nNow I'm with an ISTJ and he is steady and reliable and loving in the ways the ESFP couldn't be to me. Sure, it's not an intensely passionate relationship, but I feel loved as I deserve to be loved. Not saying ESFP/INFP couples don't have happy lasting relationships but it doesn't sound like your particular guy will be that ESFP *based on what he himself has said*. Sensors are literal and it's always best to just listen to them and take what they say at face value.

3	Is Dave Franco an ESFP?	
2	He looks a bit like C. Ronaldo. 
2	I'd say ESTP
1	He seems like it. He's a cutie though, whatever he is. 
6	Hey ESFPs, I have a short questionnaire here about the correlation between personality type and music preference and I'd love to get some more ESFP responses, check it out! Thanks!	
1	How would you describe yourself?	Personality wise, character wise, beliefs, values, dreams etc
2	My personality is a bit of a tricky thing since I have a personality disorder. Other than that I'm a faithful person that isn't exactly religious.\n I can have high expectations or imagination for certain things I dream about. I know I want my own practice as a social worker but that's my dream only because it's the most logical step for me. \nAnother dream of mine is to move away from my abusive mother, how ever that may just be a high expectation since I'm disabled but living in an expensive city. I can be pessimistic. I am usually really loving and generous with my affection. I think I'm progressive for the most part in my other ideals but some parts of me are very traditional.\nI like to do things by the book only because I don't want to fuck up. I'll follow directions if they work instead of trying to forge my own path. \nSome times I get worried by not trying to experience pleasure to the best of my abilities all the time. I'm scared if wasting my time to be happy so I look for any chance to indulge. I don't want to go through life missing out on gun that I could be having you know?

1	How to be more like an ESFP?	How to be more like an ESFP?   How to use more extraverted sensing?  How to focus on using the five senses?
4	You can't be what your not dude. We aren't the way we are by choice, we just are.\n\n\nThat's like asking a fish how to be more wet
2	This confuses me. 
1	Why??

4	What is a good hobby for Esfp?	I am not an esfp myself. I am an intp. But my wife is an esfp. We are living a bit far away now as well for a short time. She has a lots n lots of free time and the attention she needs from me is impossible since I work now,  but I do try hard. But I have noticed,  when she has something to do,  she doesn't seek for attention like the whole day. \n\nSo what are all your hobbies?  Some suggestions would be nice. Also if you guys have by chance intp partners let me know how your relationship works out in situation such as these?
5	I'm an esfp and I'm super artsy. Photography, painting, DIY projects. I don't know if she's artsy but maybe something like that's an option? Taking pottery or cake decorating classes? Joining a book club if she likes to read? I'm also an animal lover so volunteering at a shelter etc.

1	Playing an instrument.
9	We have a pretty bad rep	Was talking to my boyfriend last night (ENTP) and he was talking about how he never thought he would see himself with an ESFP based on how much shit he had talked about them in past. \n\nWho else has had this experience/ what's the worst stereotype you've heard about ESFP?\n\nDefinitely wasn't offended and I almost like that people will often think I'm vapid/ childish before actually getting to know me because of my MBTI- in fact I love taking them by surprise. A lot of NTs and particularly NTJs are fun to test this out on!!
4	Flighty. I hate that. I'm sorry but some people drag things out when they're miserable and would rather do something else or be with someone else. At least we're real about it! \n\nI agree with you. And I see this as a good thing. If someone takes enough time to get to know those parts of me. I greatly respect them. Everyone else is just a fun party. But it can bug me in work settings. Some people can be rude. \n\nWe're not stupid, we just prefer to smell the roses not talk about what type they are or what they're called or what other flowered they're related too. There's a time and place for everything. 
5	Anyone who bases their relationships off MBTI is the last person I'd want to be with anyway. All the stereotypes are the same. All irresponsible alcoholics.
3	I mean, I like ESFPs honestly. I have a cousin-in-law who's one and we get along swimmingly. I think the ESFP/ENTP relationship requires two well developed people to make it work, but when it does, it's a blast.\n\nOh, am an ENTP, to make sure to point it out.
3	HEY what's up I'm also an ENTP with a ESFP girlfriend and I believed all the stereotypes. Well my girlfriend sort of does look like a stereotypical party girl and that made me laugh it matches soo well with the stereotype. Outgoing she matches that stereotype, she matches the needing attention stereotype. The worst stereotype i've heard was that ESFP's move on and like everyone as a romantic partner, this made me nervous, but then I realized she and a lot of ESFP's are more loyal than that.
1	Reading posts where people are using really inaccurate type theory to talk trash about [ESFPs being stupid...](http://66.media.tumblr.com/ee60b14e9ed99e315ca39dc8b3e8ff90/tumblr_ntxhghVZLq1qa4l1ko6_1280.gif)\n\n
1	I'm an INTP but I seem to get along fine with ESFP's, even though the two are supposed to be conflict personalities.
4	How do psychedelics affect you?	
3	Depends on which one it is! Also depend on the kind of person you are. I believe if you are a good person, with a good heart looking to get something good out of it, you will have a great trip. If the opposite is true I think you are much more inclined to have a bad experience. 
2	For me, anything that causes you to go into that introverted deep contemplation zone is kinda uncomfortable. Would recommend you make sure you both feel really connected as she's doing it, put something funny on, keep things light at first. 
1	Depending on what it is. Probably the same reaction she has to liquor. \n\nFor myself, 1 of 3 things happen. I get hyper, I get deep or I get sleepy. All to the extreme. I hear I'm pretty fun to be around when his happens. But it all depends on the person too. \n\nAnd I definitely get more touchy feely. Which I already am, but I don't hold back. 
1	I recently stopped smoking weed because of my Se dominance. I hate psychedelics because of how easy it is for our Se to kick in and bounce off our Fi. I used to love smoking bowls and tripping but since graduating college its become much more of a burden accepting reality and future that I would not recommend psychedilics
1	Bad. I don't like hallucinating.
7	ESFPs, Do you feel..	like xNFx overwhelm you? Majority of my friends are iNutives. And I find myself getting constantly overwhelmed lately. I have a few Sensor friends but they all live quite a drive away. They never want to do anything adventurous or new or even go out and I feel like I'm slowly dying. Even my workmates. ALL intuitives. I feel like they have very strong feelings. I don't always understand it. I am sensitive, I will admit. But get over things and move on quickly and I can typically reason with myself as to why I'm being to sensitive. But all they want to do is talk about things but never do them. \n\nSide note. I recently moved to this area about a year ago.
2	Can you make new friends? Go join a club, or go to the gym? Download tinder?
2	Yes.
1	Easy to find SFs at places like running clubs, ultimate frisbee, I imagine a fair amount of LARPers, DnD groups. My solution if I'm feeling in a rut with my NF friends (I'm around a lot of them as I'm an actor with a lot of writer/director/etc friends) is get out. My outlet is running and I'm pretty serious about it. It's nice getting a sort of visceral reaction/feeling every day.
1	i fEeEeEeEl you oh gosh, i wish there was like some sort of 'be social community'...honestly i do feel like tinder is often the best bet
5	ESFP Friendships. Let go or hold on?	I'm an INTJ male with a ESFP female friend.\nI've noticed recently that there has been a lack of conversation and general get together.\nI understand ESFPs normally need new experiences to keep interests. As an INTJ, I have trouble with this. \nI've considered just letting her go for a bit.\nWould that help maintain the friendship or would that disconnect us completely?
6	In my experience ESFP usually desires some sort of immediacy, whether it's physical, digital, etc. \n\nI think if you leave her alone for a bit, you'll just drop off her radar honestly. We stay busy with whatever's in the near future.
4	I agree with the other person, let her go and she will probably stay gone. We stay in the moment and unless you're like a BFF we'll probably move on. If you ever wanna reconnect in the future it's kind of 50/50 whether she'll be down for it. Some people I stop talking to and then reconnect months or years later but occasionally I get mad at people for losing contact and never talk to them again.
2	ESFP here. If I love someone be it friend or more than a friend, they will always be apart of my life. I'm okay with doing the same things over and over with them because it's what they like doing, and I care about them, and if you're truly friends they will also do new experience with you as well. You can't just say, "well I'm an ESFP and this is how I work, if you don't work this way our friendship won't last." That's just ignorance and a lack of care for loved ones. A friend is a friend regardless of there personality type, there is always give and take on both sides of a friendship. If you want to stay connected, make it known to your friend, and if they are a true friend they will stay connected with you. Hope this helps!!
1	ESFP here. I have a problem with keeping "new" friends because some of them just fade. I'm active on OKCupid and most of the time, the date fades into a friendship and fades further into nothingness because there is nothing new to keep me interested.
1	ESFPs need bright shiny objects to play with. Give her a novel experience, or expose her to something clever enough to keep her interest. If you go away, the relationship goes away. 
1	If the girl likes you as a friend or whatever they won't forget you , that's what happened with my ESFP gf, I'm an ENTP
3	[ENTJ] ESFP crush, help ?	Hello ESFP, I'm an ENTJ having a crush on an ESFP and I need your insights.\n\nWe've been talking for like 2 months, went on a date once, I think we really have the spark. I like her so much, shes beautiful ,energetic, fun, unpredictable, It's been years since I like someone so much.\n\nSo I'm posting this to ask few things:\n\n-Is there any best way to tell her that I love her? ( were not official yet )\n\n-How can an ENTJ like me make like her happy? \n\n-Your opinion and experience on ENTJxESFP relationship? Will it workout? Advantages and Disadvantages? Long-term problems?\n\n-Do you ESFPs even dig ENTJs? Your thoughts on ENTJ partners?
4	Hey I'm not too familiar with MBTI stuff but if I'm not wrong ESFPs are known for being fickle in a sense. They'll find something that's interesting, and spend lots of time with it until all the interesting is gone, then Move on. It's kinda what happened between me and my ex I was the esfp and kinda didn't feel if after a while. Maybe it's just me but just a. Word of caution. Good luck! 
4	I am an ENTJ(M) dating a ESFP(F). I am proposing this year. I believe it is the best and worst relationship at the same time. It is the best because as an ENTJ, you like to improve yourself through a structured logical approach. Also, in terms of raw fun, ESFP's are the most fun. "Fun" being defined how Hollywood would describe it. In a relationship or a marriage, you are a team, my team now has more P, S, and F. We can be more detailed, more emotional and more carefree. However, as I want to be more balanced, it is very hard to accept what that means. They will talk about every single detail. A story that should take 1 minute takes hours. It also upsets them if you rush it or doze off. You will definitely gain patience.\n\nI agree with the advise on here about saying you love her. Depending on the age, it could feel like there is no were else to go, making the relationship more fun. Remember, most P's like to live in the moment, not the future.\n\nYou will make her happy by two main things. (Personality perspective only). Make sure she can be social. They won't want to be controlled in social environments. However, you can also set boundaries (not rules!). Second, have patience with their details. They want to share their feelings on situations and friends and they want to share them in detail. Always be interested. It is tough sometimes. \n\nESFP's value the "fun" and ENTJ can bring with their E. They also admire the structure. However, ESFP's prefer direction not dictation. Give an ESFP freedom in a structured way. An ESFP can view pieces of the relationship controlling. Always ask them to communicate if there are areas that feel that way. If there are, work on them. ESFP's love and hate the controlling aspect, so you need to use their F to make them feel free and safe in the relationship. Its not if they are free and safe, its if they feel free and safe.\n\nA bunch of thoughts.
3	My best friend is an entj (10 years) and I absolutely love her! We're travel buddies! I always say if I could find a dude like her, I might consider settling down lol\n\nKeep things fun! And always do new things. We like people who open up, not tooooo much though. We love affection. So be touchy feely. Don't be too bossy or controlling. That grows old for me. Mention how much fun you have with her. I think it can work. Watch her body language. It'll tell you everything. Just be yourself though, we love differences in personality and I find entjs to be super interesting! But that might just be me haha!\n\nI wouldn't use the L word just yet... I would mention how much you like her though. \n\nI do have a hard time with intuitives because don't get me wrong, I love how you see so many different ways things can be done. But sometimes things just are, and just let them be. Or when they try to "read between the lines" makes me a little crazy. We're very straightforward, most of what we say is exactly what we meant. I'm not very passive aggressive. I can't speak for wall. Anyways I hope that helps. 
1	I agree definitely don't tell her you love her just yet. Not unless you guys are like crazy for each other. Keep her happy by doing fun stuff together and being enthusiastic. We like fun people who are optimistic. I personally never had a good ENTJ relationship but they were probably just shitty ENTJs. It has a good chance of working out just as long as you aren't too controlling. Personally I don't like ENTJs but as I said the ones I've met have been particularly jerky.
1	I'm dating an ENTP, NT and SF can be a really interesting combo!!!!! There are moments where he applies logic to social situations and thinks about stuff in a way more...I guess technical manner and we get a bit clashy- but I think it's good to balance each other out. You may find typical P stuff (not being so well planned out, not attacking things in such a well-judged/ rationalised manner) a little bit tiring at times but again, it'll be a balance.\n\nSometimes it's really nice to have someone that grounds me with different functions like that.\n\nI wouldn't use love straight away because we're quite intense with feelings...but then again, as I say, we're pretty intense with feelings...if you're feeling mad love chances are she's probably feeling it too BUT as general advice wait a little bit. \n\nYou can make ESFP happy by paying attention to their emotions, what drives them, doing sweet things that you think will make her feel the warm and fuzzies. Well at least that's my experience with it :) 
3	random survey! all types welcome especially ESxP	
2	"After all this time?"\n\nCome on man. That's so Tumblr. 
2	This is a weird survey...
3	Do you ever feel like you don't need people?	If everyone just vanished today would you be fine with it? Could you keep yourself busy or would you go crazy?\n\nI don't get lonely and am always busy watching,reading or listening to something that I never get bored.\n\nIn my relationships my significant others have complained that I don't give them "enough" \n\nI'm wondering if my feeling of not needing people is affecting me from being a good partner. Or maybe I just haven't found the right person.
6	From what I've read and feel. When we like people we WANT them in our life, Not need them. I think that's lovely, to be wanted. Take a step back and figure out if you really don't give them enough time or they're just not being reasonable. I feel as if because we give so much, its always expected. I always feel selfish saying this but we need to help ourselves too.\n\nI do love company, but I also have no problem keeping myself busy. If I feel down, lonely or stressed. I get up and do something about it. That's kind of our thing, As esfps. We're the masters of making ourselves and others feel good. And with a genuine heart! Toot Toot. 
5	I can totally relate to these ideas.. Personally, I feel like the  'not needing people outlook' is sort of like a coping mechanism. I spend a lot of time with people but I also spend a lot of time alone. Because of my lifestyle and such, I do not feel extremely confident in many of my relationships. However I do find confidence in myself. I don't really ever seeing it being the other way around.. I just find a lot of success in the mindset of setting my standards low with people. I choose not to expect anything of others. Lately I've just been trying to live for myself, and I have been enjoying it.\n\nHopefully this makes some sort of sense to you.
4	I get depressed if I don't have a conversation with a SINGLE person (i like) in a day.
2	If I'm flying solo I usually hit basic familiarity/proficiency with my hobbies pretty quickly and burn out on them just as quickly after that unfortunately. People are much more interesting and varied, so having others around to do things with means it's never quite the same the next time around. \n\nSo no, I don't think I could stand being with just myself. 
1	I would go crazy. I always question if I'm an introvert since I spend so much time by myself but truth is it's not by choice. If I actually didn't talk to anyone I would literally go insane. You sure you're an extrovert?\n\nAs for relationships I can relate, I never give much o myself either, I think I just don't care enough about anyone to fully latch onto them. Or there's just not much of me to give. Not really sure what it is. I just have been on my own so long I guess relationships aren't a big deal to me.
5	[ENTJ] ESFP girl likes me. How do I progress?	I'm an ENTJ and let's assume this ESFP girl likes me. I'm very sure it's not just normal ESFP liking everything and everyone. I have never really had an ESFP have the hots for me, so I'm wondering how do I show that I'm interested?\n\ninb4 mocking my Fi
3	Talk to her? Just get her attention and ask her to do something fun with you. We are pretty straightforward.
3	INTP girl here. I have a ESFP sister. An older sister. Don't do it bro . They're really annoying. It's not just sibling rivalry. \nBut on the bright side for you esfp's like anything good looking. (they're not all that shallow) just don't be too cocky or obsessive. That's all. \nYou know what. What am I doing? You're putting your life in danger. Don't do it. The mushiness .ugh. And they always think they're right. Even when they're clearly wrong.\nBut you can talk to them about anything. Really. \nAlso small talk is cheap\n\nFind some common ground. Have a real conversation\n\nMaybe I am not the best person to give advice on this but those last two sentences gave good advice. But don't say I didn't warn you bro
2	we love talking so ask her about her passions and let it *rolllllllllllllll* baby
1	Talk to, maybe even just tell her. Works for me!
1	Probably too late, but this explains my relationship of 3 years. Just ask them to a meal. ESFPs love fun. If you are fun and yourself, it will be a great time. Try and be spontaneous and random during the meal. Don't bring all your ENTJ structure and planning. While it will come out, as in all ENTJ discussions, keep the fun and excitement going. ESFPs are the most fun. They are also a ton of work.
2	Used to be an INTP now I'm an ESFP, any idea how this could have happened?	When I was younger I always scored as an INTP, but now I score more as an ESFP.\n\nAny insights into this?\n\nAlso hi!\n\nThink this explains it quite well:\n\nhttps://www.quora.com/Can-a-persons-Myers-Briggs-personality-type-change
6	You most likely mistyped on one of these occasions. 
3	That's a hard one. They say to take the test when you're at your most content and answer completely honest. When I'm under stress the result is totally different. 
2	Keep in mind that the tests can make mistakes. Also do more than one. And check the cognitive functions. Also keep in mind mbti represents core personality not too much of external factors. \nEg. J vs P\nI'm INTP naturally. But like J's I like my workspace organised and what not . Seems like the opposite of p but as we mature things can come into balance\nAlso I've become more extroverted in some aspects and as for f . Some times a test even put me as F and it's usually fifty fifty. But that's only because of my religious background family and other factors like that. But exploring cognitive functions clears it up.\n\nThere are other factors like social anxiety that might cause even n extrovert to score as an introvert. Also many of us unwittingly delude ourselves in different ways as we any the questions results vastly vary\nEdit: also after reading through many sources mbti tests usually talk about external factors affecting results and in certain reflections they might mention certain behaviours that resemble other types .\nBut mbti type does not change. \nI have 2 esfp sisters and my mom is esfp. All really different, my mom even acts like me . So I deal with alot of grey area
1	How old are you and how old were you when taking these tests
1	Yes,i think i know, i was married and was an intj as scored by my college professor. My needs for love and acceptance were being meet, so i could be introverted and judgemental of others with no repercussions. \nNow that I've been single for a while, I've had to alter my personality, because i don't want to die alone. :) \nI changed my behaviors to match my situation. Since the test is based on behaviors it stands to reason that if you have any emotional intelligence your rating would change based on your situation. 
1	You don't change that much... even if let's say you change... did you have major trauma or something? Maybe you started acting your shadow side which appeared like INTPs I'll have to look up ESFP's shadow function stack for that though... ESFP's are chilled out, don't cares... INTP are stressed out, thinkers... that's huge... The point being if you now identify with ESFP it's fine if you don't feel like it you may be another type... just a suggestion... if you are biased towards some type don't be... all the types have pros and cons and they are all special "snowflakes" :-P
1	only at 15 and above do people start using their auxiliary functions. You could've been an ISTP with INTP tendencies at first.\n\nDepression, stress and trauma also mess around with functions so you could've then became ESTP from ISTP\n\nfrom T to F, it's hard to say but ESTPs and ESFPs are actually really similar outwardly. The test could've easily mistaken the two due to a lack of development in both.
1	I dunno man mine keeps changing too.
1	depression?
6	How do you stay invested in a relationship?	I have a disgusting track record...everyone lasts a few months. I haven't ever done any sort of intentional cheating but I've definitely thought about it a few times in past/ sent suggestive text messages/ cuddled a little too much. I just get so bored. \n\nI was dating the apparent love of my life and a day before he messed it all up by saying something really horrible- I remember sitting with him in the kitchen baking cookies suddenly thinking 'I'm really bored of this person' even thought I was so devastated after the break up. It's getting kind of concerning, and I feel as if no one is ever going to cut it.\n\nThose of you in long term relationships- what are the key things you've found that has made it work? What things do you look for in partners? \n\nThat being said I've recently started seeing an ENTP and it looks pretty promising BUT I worry about the impending months and what's to come. 
6	I've never been in a relationship but I have been in several semi relationships, but I've never committed to any of them. If I found someone else I'd either drop them or just see them on the side. I dunno if it's an ESFP thing but I think we have a tendency to not commit. We aren't good at stability and being with the same person very long. I know I get tired of everyone eventually, as soon as I find any pattern in their behavior I start to resent it, it's like everyone is too mundane or something. Maybe I idealize people too much.\n\nI think if it ever did work it'd have to be with someone who has qualities I wish I had in myself. That way there's room to grow. Also personality wise I go best with other ESFPs. ENTPs all get on my nerves eventually.
4	[deleted]
3	I think this is something we learn with time. We don't always need amusement. You need to meet that person, who when you don't talk or are doing routine. You are totally ok with that. I am not ready to commit. maybe...in 5 years? Still curious what it would be like to be with my ideal. ISFJ OR ISTJ. Where do you find male ISFJs and ISTJs (perferably a little easy on the eyes)?? lol\n\nAlso, I love ENTPs.
3	I had this problem too, especially when I was in high school. My track record is also disgustingly long and I can't count the amount of boyfriends I've gone through on both of my hands. I have been with my INTP boyfriend for almost a year and a half now, though. I am not sure what it is about him, but I haven't wanted a single other person since I met him. I think that we are always learning more and more about each other since we are such different people, and the constant new experiences make it hard for me to get bored of him. As cliche as it sounds, maybe you just have to give it time until the right person for you comes around :) I really do think there's someone for everybody!
2	Long term relationships are so easy for me, always have been. Something in me craves being a little loving housewife.
2	I don't doubt it. Looks like I'll be goin back to school!
2	Damn I'd ask the same question. I can't stay with anyone for very long. I love the game with girls but when it comes to commitment I am lame. Why is it that some of us ESFPs cannot maintain an invested relationship
0	do any other esfp's like this? and where can i find more?!!!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IcE4czyt1Q&feature=youtu.be
2	What?...
1	The workout? looks like crossfit!
1	we do that rope workout in football.
1	ESFP-INTJ relationship?	I am an INTJ female and I have liked an ESFP male for a year now. I somewhat recently found out that he liked me at one point but a friend of mine sabotaged the relationship(we are no longer friends) and convinced him not to date be because she liked him. I thought things were going to pick back up in April because we started talking again and went on a "date" (he didnt pay for me but we were alone and it felt like a date so?). I honestly thought he liked me but now i dont know. I seem him around other girls and he seems to be flirting with them and although he does go out of his way to talk to me I have no idea if its just because we are friends and those are the only feelings he has for me or if he likes me. I hear people say he's talking to this girl or likes this girl (i can think of 3 right off the top of my head and there are probably more). I want to get him alone and directly tell him my feelings and find out how he feels but i dont want to lose his friendship or look like an idiot for thinking he likes me. I have no idea how he would respond to my directness. He is graduating soon so i feel like i have to act quickly if i want anything to come of this. Part of me doesnt even care if feelings arent reciprocated, i just want to stop imagining what a relationship could be and get over it. Any ideas on what i should do? is just telling him my feelings a bad idea? Does it sound like to you he could like me? i feel like a child asking all of this but i dont know who else to turn to
4	Just talk to him. You need to be direct with him. No one will think you look like an idiot, and if he's graduating you're going to see him a lot less in the future anyway. It doesn't really sound like there's anything there but if he thinks you're cute and he goes out of his way to talk to you then your frankness may ignite something in him. 
3	ESFPs like to play the field if they aren't tied down. He probably doesn't know if you're that interested so he's keeping his options open. Definitely tell him how you feel or nothing's gonna change. You have a good attitude about it so there is nothing to lose, if he doesn't like you the same way then at least you tried.\n\nAs far as not knowing if he's interested. I've found most Se guys can go either way with girls, they can be friends with them or hook up.
2	Esfp here. I love intj's, you guys will naturally work out if you both put in equal effort. :) \nHope this helps. 
1	Talk to him. I love intjs. I can talk to them about anything and we have a understanding. He probably has no idea you're interested. We read body language. And sometimes for some people a lot of their reactions look the same (mad, sad, hungry, constipated) so just say something :) 
1	I'm an ESFP male and tried it with an INTJ female and it did not click for us. But I have read that our types are well together! I'd say pursue it. 
1	My advise is to try as hard as you can to make it work. [According to this chart,](http://falconnl.github.io/TypeSquare/) your types are ideal for each other.
2	What ESFPs do you relate to?	I know there's a lot of outlandish ESFPs in the media like Miley Cyrus and Nicki Minaj but which ones do you actually relate to and why? Ones that people might not realize are ESFP maybe?
2	Justin Bieber because I keep changing up my hair style.
2	I've always thought of myself as the white Denzel Washington. \n(An esfp of course)
2	Giancomo Casanova. Enough said.
2	leonardo dicaprio! I love making people feel at ease or happy but I'm also super sexy
1	I don't actually keep up with famous people all that much. If I had to choose one though, I would probably pick Clinton. I could definitely see myself as becoming one of the most powerful people in the world. Then solely being know for saying "I did not have sexual relations with that woman" with the straightest face. People would still just say I was lying because " I lie".
6	ESFPs, how do you destress?	Hey /r/ESFP , How do you guys relax and blow off steam?\n\n\n \n\n\nMy wife is an ESFP and she doesn't seem to know how to do it. I'm convinced the stress is affecting her health.\n\n\n\n<3
5	Usually by hanging out with other people. I get antsy when I'm cooped up with myself, especially with nothing particularly fulfilling to do. \n\nMy current hobby is riding bikes though- usually I do it solo out of convenience (it's a bitch and a half trying to get a bunch of cyclists to meet and ride bikes together) because of my schedule, but riding with others is more fun too. 
5	Really mind-numbing stuff; sitcoms, long cuddles, sleep ins, massages. I liked yoga too but only when there was someone talking about the poses/ meditations. I find it really hard to just sit and think 'inwards' without freaking out so meditating on my own has never really worked out.
3	Hobbies.\n\nPowerlifting, guitar, astronomy, hiking, gaming. Whatever I can do to take my mind off the stress.
3	Hang out with people, take her on spontaneous adventures, tequila tastings are fun!\n\nAlso... Make sure to do something active. Yoga class or something. Doing something healthy always helps
2	Yeah hobbies basically stuff I can lose myself in. Easy stuff like TV/movies or stuff that takes work like drawing. Or exercise. And of course other people if that's an option. Basically everything everyone already said
1	speedcubing and music
4	Book recommendations?	I want to buy a book to give to my graduating ESFP students, but I have a hard time figuring out what, exactly, appeals to them.\n\nI asked one of them what her favorite books were and she mentioned The Kite Runner and The Fantastic Mr. Fox.  So it seems like she likes realistic stories about relationships between people (or, you know, animals haha).\n\nThe other ESFP is a male who's really into basketball/sports and has told me he wants to learn more about business and communicating with people.\n\nAny books along these lines that you guys really enjoyed?
3	The Alchemist is written by an ISFP and is pretty universally liked. It's not like the books you mentioned but it's great for graduating students.
4	What TV shows are you into?	I've been watching the Voice but I need some new shows to get into. What do the other ESFPs in here like
5	Better Call Saul, The Walking Dead, House of Cards, Daredevil. I'm very particular about the shows I like. 
2	Mad Men definitely - The characters are so *real*. I actually used this show to sharpen my understanding of MBTI, because the characters are so brilliant and *internally consistent*. It really stands apart from other TV shows in this manner.\n\n[Also: the sets, the costumes, and the GLAMOUR. Intensely visually appealing. And the props are totally authentic.]
2	I love the office, just got into HIMYM, but I always love Rick and Morty, Adventure Time, Broad City, Workaholics, Last Week Tonight, and Game of Thrones of course
1	Sherlock, Family Guy, The Office. \n\nHonestly, I prefer movies though. 
1	To change the face of human psychology completely…	\n\nPsychic mediumship and telepathy is expressed throughout pop culture. What this means is that other human beings are expressing their observations about reality through art. Art is a powerful medium which can heighten awareness in other individuals very quickly. Artists take their own life experiences and inner realities and display them for the public to see. Awareness of ESP is expressed over and over and over again in the artistic world. It's time to own up to the truth and be real: we are all psychic. Telepathy is real, and it should be used well (with kindness). We are all psychic mediums, and when we believe in ourselves, we can connect with the spirit world directly telepathically. We don't need religions, other psychics, or authority figures to tell us what reality is. We have our own observations, and when we open our minds to new information, more confirming experiences about the truth of reality. There is no death. There is a difference between being extremely confident in our observations and expressing this confidence to other people, and being authoritative. Think for yourself. Question authority. Do the right thing.\n\n\nMARIAH CAREY "Emotions"\nYou've got me feeling emotions / \nDeeper than I've ever dreamed of / \nYou've got me feeling emotions / \nHigher than the heavens above / \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrJEFrth27Q\n\n\nTHE BEACH BOYS "Good Vibrations"\nI'm pickin' up good vibrations / \nShe's giving me excitations / \nGotta keep those lovin' good vibrations / \nA happenin' with her / \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eab_beh07HU\n\n\nPEARL JAM "Even Flow"\nEven flow / \nThoughts arrive like butterflies / \nOh he don't know / \nSo he chases them away / \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdIX36A8lMQ\n\n\n311 "Electricity"\nThe same force that flows through every circuit / \nThe juice that's spent everytime you work it / \nEvery life form is based on this simplicity / \nThe soul that you have is electricity / \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1WyhqhGXHE\n\n\n311 "Large In The Margin"\nLarge in the margin / \nmy drama unfolds behind closed doors / \nTrying too hard to reach a higher plane / \nThere's no way to avoid listening / \nyou'll always end up listening / \nhere's hoping the voices aren't too unkind / \nhere's hoping the voices are benign / \nit's easier when you hear it / \nthere's no reason to fear it / \nit's you  / \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VXQcVkvoe8\n\n\n311 "The Continuous Life"\nMy radio emits a signal form / \nA loud noise the kind of which I've never heard before / \nI scan the dial for more stations but all I get / \nIs an eerie feelin' I'm not dreaming' this is the real dealin / \nThere's nothin like this trance I'm caught in a daze / \n'cause I'm finally out of my body the blue lights are ablaze / \nYeah I'm really amazed and feelin' so light that's right / \nLift off and I'm into the sky / \nAs if a hologram were created to shift my consciousness / \nChanged again and I'm flung in the rift / \nI want to be free I want to do right / \nI move through the portal to be purified / \nIt's not ambiguous it be continuous / \nIt's all about us it's for real my man / \nThe continuous life there is no end / \nMovin' through life movin' through death / \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irsNx9_rxbk\n\n\nTOOL "Schism"\nI know the pieces fit 'cause I watched them fall away / \nDisintegrating as it goes testing our communication / \nI know the pieces fit 'cause I watched them tumble down / \nNo fault, none to blame it doesn't mean I don't desire to / \nPoint the finger, blame the other, watch the temple topple over / \nTo bring the pieces back together, rediscover communication / \nI've done the math enough to know the dangers of our second guessing  / \nDoomed to crumble unless we grow, and strengthen our communication / \nI know the pieces fit / \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhjG47gtMCo\n\n\nTOOL "Lateralus"\nOver thinking, over analyzing separates the body from the mind / \nWithering my intuition, missing opportunities and I must / \nFeed my will to feel my moment drawing way outside the lines / \nI'm reaching up and reaching out / \nI'm reaching for the random or whatever will bewilder me / \nAnd following our will and wind we may just go where no one's been / \nWe'll ride the spiral to the end and may just go where no one's been / \nSpiral out, keep going... / \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awYc9xvqnv0\n\n\nCROSSES (Chino Moreno from the Deftones) "Telepathy"\nBefore your entrance wave / \nBefore we play this game / \nI like to feel you break from inside / \nYou’re gold and pink inside / \nAnd it’s showing through your stare / \nIt’s frozen us in time from inside / \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQve6XA4zcI\n\n\nStanley Kubrick's THE SHINING\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZup24gsS8M\n\n\nSTAR WARS Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back - Luke talks to Obi-Wan\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsY71TFWSSs\n\n\nTHE ORB  "O.O.B.E."\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kY9NkGbBRs\n\n------------------------------\n\n“Childhood's End”  Arthur C.

2	TLDR. AGAIN. 
1	What the fuck
10	Hi Emma	Sorry, some ESFP I know said they wished people posted here more, so I did......
4	Hi Josh
1	XD
1	Hi grandma. 
7	Does any one else get distracted real easily/zone out a lot?	Becoming a sort of problem at work now, haha. So is it just me? D:
1	I'm probably not a great example. I have *severe* ADHD. Primarily inattentive, too. So when I'm off my meds, it feels as if I'm just *not* there at all.
1	I definitely do
1	Yeah I always need to be entertained.
1	My recommendation is to find a hands on job. I get distracted a lot when I work but I've always been a hard worker. So with a job that basically overwhelms me with responsibility, it definitely helps. If you do get distracted just try to have more fun with it or just focus on being the best one there
1	Yup :/ I hate it.. Sometimes they're talking and I really want to listen.. But I just can't. Unless it's serious.
1	Sometimes I'll be standing at my register (pretty boring part time job for a student) and as someone walks away I'll say 'hey how are you today' instead of 'have a nice day'...I zone out so much.
1	yes
3	How do you guys feel about INFJs	Me having an ESFP mother I feel like I have a pretty strong grasp of what she thinks about me. But I'm curious what other ESFPs think about INFJs.
1	ESFP here. \nBest friend is an INFJ but an unhealthy one and has turned into a huge manipulative asshat. \n\nBut healthy INFJ's can be amazing!
1	We get along at first and then they get big ideas, and they lose my friendship. They get demoted to acquaintance.
1	Well, I'm marrying one, so there's that.\n\nShe's OK.
1	We don't have much in common. They are too introverted for me usually. I've had bad experiences with the few I've known.
1	My sister is an INFJ. Sometimes it's difficult to relate to her/ how she sees things but we both like nonsensical humour and I'm happy with that :) She's learnt to interpret my love over the years and same with me to her. \n\nI feel like she's very subtle and sweet and I'm very out there and loud. I have to be a bit delicate with her and she's often very quiet which makes it hard to bond sometimes but we love each other and that's the short and long of it. \n\nObviously family relationships are going to be very different- I've known some people I'd predict were INFJs in past and I wasn't a huge instant fan of them. But I feel like family love pretty much transcends personality types mostly.
1	ESFP here. My fiance is an INFJ. We've been together for over 8 years and are finally getting married this September!\n\nHe's extremely stubborn (thinks he's always right-- which unfortunately he is lol) and can come off a bit rude (empathy isn't his strong suit). \nHowever, with his stubbornness comes his drive. I don't know ANYONE as hardworking as him. When he puts his mind to something, he gives it his all. Extremely goal oriented. \nHe's very straight to the point-- tell it like it is, whether you like it or not. Sometimes that comes off as rude, but there's nothing fake about him. \n\nI wouldn't trade him for anyone else in the world. We're truly opposites, and I think that makes our relationship exciting. \n\nTLDR: I love INFJs! :)\n
4	I want to turn/revert to being an ESFP	So for the longest time I thought I was an introverted intuitive. I was painfully shy and awkward in high school and so I spent more time in books and video games. However, recently since I've been in college I started noticing something different about myself. I actually appreciate life more when I'm around other people and that I actually hate reading and analyzing intellectual stuff, it's all rather absurd, but I'd rather just be "doing stuff". You know, just stop thinking and just go for it! Working out, eating, going to different parts of town, trying out new clubs. \n\nSo I was wondering, I was born rather outgoing. I loved to sing, dance, call for attention and act out. I was totally hands on guy and I loved the simple things. I've always been rather quirky and ridiculous, loud-mouthed and boisterous. However, I think I turned shy for a long period of time and I didn't have many friends so for years I thought I was introverted. But you know what, even during those years, I think there were times when I unleashed my inner energy and it felt right!\n\nSo now I feel like I'm coming home and being more comfortable in being my true MBTI, an ESFP rather than the INFJ I thought that I was. But I'm still not sure whether I'm just imagining all this in my head or I'm trying to emulate ESFP behavior when I'm really INFJ because I do plan ahead A LOT, and I'm constantly thinking about the future and my future plans. But also, I'm happier when I'm just in the flow just doing things. I don't know, what do you guys think?\n\nAnd how can I be more comfortable in who I am and start being outgoing and hands on and really channel my burning energy inside? 
1	Hello! Fellow ESFP here! A couple of things for ya.\n\n1- Have you taken the test? If not take it, if so, take it again at least once and get back to me. \n\n2- is it more important for you to know, or to understand? \n(yes this will help determine)
1	You sound like an extrovert. It's about preferences and you prefer being extroverted. INFJ is one of the biggest mistypes on here. Don't think ESFPs don't plan ahead, we have to sometimes otherwise our lives would be in shambles. But take the test again and see what you get.\n\nAs for being comfortable you just have to do it. Just talk to people. It gets easier as you get older and stop caring what people think.
1	There's nothing wrong with planning ahead. A balanced person will have a balanced way of using their different functions! Planning ahead is important. I do it. But I can't do it constantly or I get really stressed out. Make sure to take the text when you're completely comfortable and content. :)
5	How to date a ESFP? (As an ISTJ)	Hey all! Great reading all the posts here and on the ISTJ page. Just getting into the dating game and would love to hear your perspective. Obviously MBI says that our fire & ice combo is a good fit and have seen some good examples in these subs. But I haven't been able to find any posts regarding how an ISTJ has made the first move. How should people, like yours truly, differentiate ourselves from our more lively and boisterous peers?\n\nA couple of posts I've seen here have said something along the lines of: "I love shy/introverted girls" but have not seen the case where being an ISTJ male has worked out. But if it did, did you initiate? Or did he? \n\nThanks guys!  \n
4	I gotta be honest I don't buy this combo works as well as it "should". I've found ISTJs to be either too uh, boring...or well, know it all assholes. But this doesn't mean you are of course. I just don't have much in common with an ISTJ personality wise. Personally I go for people who are...well they're usually other ESFPs to be honest. Everyone has different taste though. It just depends on the individual ESFP. Treat us like anyone else, get to know us but don't be all clingy and text us all hours of the day, and don't pry too much cuz we can be kind of private with our inner lives/feelings.
1	I've been with an ISTJ male before and it went pretty well, I started it though we were both mutually into it and such, but it was a long distance relationship due to meeting online and such. We did actually get to meet in person, but that caused me to end it off as I'd rather the relationship be closer than only getting to meet each year once. \n\nBut as far as relationships with ISTJs, I think it could go pretty smoothly, as long as both sides keep up with communication and the ESFP doesn't take criticism to heart.\n\nI hope this helps!
1	I'm talking to an ISTJ at the moment and we've been on a few dates. We met through online dating, I initiated the convo and after talking for a fair bit I gave him my number. Our dates have been good, we get along really well. \n\nSince our first date we've both been initiating other plans.\n\nThe only thing that annoys me is that he comes off as arrogant or I'm not sure if that's just him being playful. It just doesn't suit him. 
5	Hey guys. Nice to meet you	Recently found out I was an ESFP, and I'm suprised but sorta not at the lack of threads XD but if anyone wants to talk or something, I'm here. So hello~
2	Hi. ESFPs are pretty inactive, but welcome!
2	Yeah, surprised but sorta not sounds about right for this subreddit. 
2	Yeah we aren't very active here but feel free to post stuff and we will eventually respond
2	I'm pretty sure you guys are all on Pinterest instead of Reddit 
20	My type description of ESFPs!	Hi guys; I've been asked to start a series of type descriptions on another site and I thought you guys might find the one I did for ESFP to be interesting. :) I based my description mostly on my understanding of functions, but tried to make the description as general and broad as possible so that beginners could get a lot out of it as well. Please let me know what you think, what rings true to you and what you would add or change! Thanks guys <3\n\n(also a special note - Intuitive bias is *real* in the Jungian community.  Being an intuitive myself - I'm ENFJ - I cannot guarantee that every interpretation I have of Sensing is accurate, but I tried my absolute damnedest to describe your Se with as much nuance and love as a I could.  I hope I did you justice.)\n\n***\n\n**ESFP**\n\nESFPs at their best are perceptive individuals who follow their own path.  They are keenly aware of their surroundings and are able to quickly identify and appropriately react to novel stimuli.  They jump on opportunities to participate actively in the world, readily absorbing new experiences and approaching each situation with a receptive attitude.  They do not miss much, either, and will often notice changes or interesting details before others do.  That said, they do not tolerate boredom or tedium well, and will often attempt to find other ways to entertain themselves.  Their primary interest is in seeking out all that life has to offer, and exploring a multitude of adventures in search of mindfulness and self-expression.\n\nESFPs believe that they will be best able to find harmony in their lives if they stay true to their desires and beliefs and react authentically and honestly to the positions they find themselves in. They will not accept the fact that a particular behavior is ‘good’ or ‘important’ just because others tell them that it is so, but rather, they do what feels right to them in the moment, searching for evidence to justify and verify their natural inclinations. In this way, they can develop a pattern of morality and personal belief that is independent from that of their peer group or society at large.  They are skilled at perceiving and reacting to the true nature of the scenario at hand and not simply doing what is expected of them. It is important, however, for ESFPs to reflect on the objective facts and information they can obtain from society when they make decisions or interpretations, as the way they personally feel about a situation does not always paint the full picture. ESFPs who allow themselves to explore objective data without making personal value judgments too quickly will discover, with pleasure, that doing so refines their ability to accurately interpret present circumstances and allows them to develop a quicker and more authentic reaction to the experiences they undergo.\n\nA young or immature ESFP will not attempt to evaluate the consequences of their actions before they commit to them, and will often find that their efforts did not turn out as they had anticipated.  They also may be skeptical of claims that people, the natural world, or events can be accurately theorized about, interpreted, or predicted.  They will resist attempts to analyze or define themselves, which can leave them vulnerable to the whims of shifting external circumstance.\n\nHowever, as the ESFP grows and matures, they will begin to find a balance between being immersed in the events of the present moment and developing global theories in order to understand the implications of those events.  They will become more skilled at anticipating the consequences of their actions, making decisions based on not only what is seen and interpreted in the moment, but also taking into consideration that which is unseen and unknown.  They will find themselves becoming more skilled at noticing patterns and developing an intuition about people and occurrences, using all of the present evidence they so keenly perceive to check and verify these hunches, and in doing so will further develop their ability to react appropriately to novel conditions.  That said, ESFPs will always be more flexible and observant than most other types, quick to respond and jump into interesting and exciting ventures, and rarely allowing their beliefs or expectations to cloud their awareness of what is really going on.\n\nMature ESFPs are often very good at seeing things from other people’s perspectives and sensing how they are feeling or responding to the circumstances at hand, but they often do not find much pleasure or gratification in engaging with this ability unless it’s in service of some larger goal or in order to help someone they care about.  Because they are so focused on drinking in every facet of their present situation, they resist the task of noticing patterns and forming conclusions based on how things have worked out in the past for them.  However, when they are sufficiently motivated, they are very skilled at doing so, and those who allow themselves to practice this skill will discover it to be very useful when they find themselves stuck in a rut or seeking guidance for an important decision.\n\nESFPs do not enjoy evaluating facts and arguments for internal consistency and are prone to making careless errors in reasoning.  They will often prefer to delegate this task to someone they trust to do it better.  That said, they are capable of doing it - begrudgingly - when no help is available.  ESFPs find it very difficult to conceive of every available outcome, idea, or possibility that could spring from the present moment in time, and cannot help but believe that things “are what they are” and have the internal sense that the world is unlikely to change much.  They also have relatively modest expectations for the results of their decisions and generally do not feel that individual choices are of dire importance.  Although they may, with much determination, be capable of success in leading and directing grand, ambitious projects, it is not where they thrive.  They prefer to explore the world actively and spontaneously, reacting in the moment, doing what seems right, and letting the chips fall where they may.\n\nTo summarize, ESFPs are perceptive and genuine individuals who seek to discover as much as they can about the world around them and themselves.  They do so by actively participating in as many experiences as possible and by being true to themselves and their own beliefs.  When they balance these capabilities and desires with an eye on objective facts as well as their internal sense of what seems likely to happen and be meaningful, they can make astounding discoveries and impressions in the world, leading others to open their eyes to a new sensation of awareness and realizations that they had never grasped before.
2	This is awesome! Very in depth. I've also heard we are one of the most generous types which I think has some truth to it, I like spending my time and money on/with other people more than myself. Nice to see a positive description of us that isn't all about being the life of the party which not all of us are.
7	Functions	**Dominant Se (ESXP)**: Experiences are the stuff of life. I want to go snowboarding! Skydiving! Drive a racecar! Give me an adrenaline rush, and I’m fabulous. Okay, what’s up? I saw your eye twitch. That means you’re upset, but about what? Oh, I can leap in there and do this, no problem! See? It’s easy! You need a part time lion tamer? I’m sure I can learn it in no time. Okay, so here are the sixteen awesome things we can do in this theme park. Which one first? Look, you do that, I can hold this, and keep track of the kids, and check my Blackberry, and call Gary back all at the same time. You know, someone could make a lot of money if they—oh, what the heck, I’ll just do it. While you were standing there gaping, I saved the kid from the bus. I want to try that out; I think my body can take it, and it’ll be fun to find out. I’m going to say this, and see what people do…\n\n**Auxiliary Fi (EXFP)**: I am happiest when staying true to what I believe and what I want for my life. I know what I want, what beliefs and ideals motivate me, and how I feel about something. This is good, and that is bad. I know you’re only pretending, because I can see right through you. How does this new belief measure up against my life, my goals, and my core values? I believe no one should enforce morality; it should be a conscious choice we make. I care very much about you. I am loyal to you. I have great enthusiasm and many feelings toward you, but I show it through actions rather than words. You don’t have to say anything for me to be able to connect to and understand your meaning. I am okay with silent affection.\n\n**Tertiary Te (EXFP)**: Look, I organized all my movies by alphabetical order or time period! My socks are sorted by colors or fabrics. I enjoy having things organized, but have to focus to set up the system. I know this isn’t working right, and I want to fix it. I suspect this project will take me another couple of hours, but I’m going to give myself extra time just in case. Look, either you can prove aliens exist or you can’t, and if you can’t, they probably don’t exist. Let’s talk about this idea to see if it’s even possible, on a factual level. This is why I made my decision. I want to have a plan and follow through with it, but sometimes I forget what time it is or what the steps in the plan were. I probably shouldn’t improvise answers as much.\n\n**Inferior Ni (ESXP)**: Though I care more about what’s happening in my life right now, I want to have a good future. I haven’t forgotten my dreams, and I’ll figure out how to make them a reality one of these days. I like thinking about my future life and, although it’s hard, I can learn to put aside immediate experiences if I know the long-term goal is worth the wait! I feel optimistic about the future, and sometimes out of the blue, know how to do something that I have never tried doing before. I’m not sure how, but I knew that person would do that.\n\nSource: http://funkymbtifiction.tumblr.com/cognitivefunctions
2	FunkyMBTI is run by an idiot who doesn't even know her own type. This is stupid
1	This is really cool; thanks for sharing. "You need a part time lion tamer? I’m sure I can learn it in no time."
6	ENFJ who recently started seeing an ESFP	Hey everyone! I started seeing an ESFP that really identifies with the type and am having trouble figuring out what exactly he's looking for. I thought we communicated to each other that we were both interested in companionship (although I would be interested in exploring other options as well), but he acts very "couple-y" when we are together. He also referred to the first time we met as a "first date," which has thrown me off because it seems to contradict the companionship we both discussed beforehand. Any insight would be greatly appreciated!\n
1	[deleted]
1	He's into you if he referred to it as a date. I as an ESFP have trouble with my uh, well I call him my fake boyfriend cuz I can't even get a read on him. He's an ESFP. Some of us are so in the moment we kinda forget about you unless you're around. But he sounds like he's trying to couple for sure.\n\nAs far as being an ENFJ I really like ENFJs, usually. I think we make a good pair.
5	INTJ seeking ESFP for Skype chat to test duality	According to socionics, INTJ/ESFP is the perfect cognitive match, known as "duality". I wish to test this theory by chatting with an ESFP. The biggest problem with dual relationships is that they're difficult to start. Message me or reply to this thread if you're an ESFP and you'd like to chat. Thanks!
2	ESFP here. Love INTJ's, always a type I get along with very well. 
1	ESFP as well. When you say match, do you mean intimacy or friendship wise?
1	Guess I need to find me one of those, the search begins
4	Did any ESFP'S grow up with Apraxia or any serious motor problems growing up?	I grew up slow, now I am smarter than like a little bit more than 60 percent of my class.
1	Anyone else?
1	No but I have Lyme disease
3	Telegram superchat for all types:)	We have a telegram chat group available for all MBTI types to interact with each other, where intellectual discussions, questions, ideas, debates, etc. are encouraged. So far we have around 50 members, including INTPs, INTJs, ENFPs, ENTPs, INFPs, INFJs, ISFJs, and ESFPs and would like to get a few more people to join in.\n\n\nHere is the link to join: http://bit.do/mbti-chat Please note that you should have a telegram account (https://telegram.org/) before you can join. It's a free application that you can download onto your phone, PC, etc., and you need a phone number to set up an account.\n\n\nThere are also separate NF chat (for relating people at emotional level,supports...)and NT chat (for more serious and intellectual convos)available to provide options.If you are interested please pm your usernames since we want to keep them private.
4	[Master Personality Typology Survey] I'm conducting a survey to analyze correlations between popular personality typologies, and I need a lot more ESFPs in it!	
1	I took it but in technically half isfp as well 
3	Had a falling out with a really close friend and we haven't talked in a couple of years. Are you guys ever interested in reconnecting to old friends after a friendship ends?	What made me think of trying to be friends with her again is her showing up as a suggested friend on Facebook. Apparently she has unblocked me. Haha
1	No harm in throwing her a friend request and getting in touch to see how she's doing.
1	Why happened for her to block you in the first place?\n\nI had falling out with my high school best friend. We caught up a few times but things were never the same. But then again I caught up with another friend from high school, and it was like we never stopped talking.
3	ESFP having problem with INTP brother. Please help? Description below	I am 16 and my brother and I get along really well, the problem is he's always on Xbox and has been more anti social since last month. We almost always have stuff to talk about but lately we have nothing to talk about. He's always making excuses not to go to the gym or hang out with me. I'm really patient but this is pissing me off.!
3	INTPs don't like to leave the house. 
2	I'm an INTP so maybe I can help you out. I can only speak for myself and I'm not sure how much of this is actually resulting from my MBTI type.\n\nWe need private "recharging" time before we can go out and do social things again, its rarely a good idea to forcibly interrupt this - we appreciate autonomy.\n\nWe also enjoy engaging our imagination. Se means you ESFPs want to get out there and seize the day, we on the other hand enjoy exploring too, but different things, like ideas and concepts. Videogames often explore ideas so we can very easily lose ourselves in them. These wont be found at the gym, and in the physical world - we don't have too much patience for stuff like this, they bore us and seem mundane and superficial.\n\nAn idea for something an INTP and ESFP could bond over: improv comedy classes?\n\nIt could engage with our Ne, and our quirky/eccentric side comes out, which is the side of the INTPs that ESFPs tend to enjoy the most. Don't expect him to immediately like the idea though, and don't force it upon him - but explain that everyone going into it is equally awkward and shit at it.\n\nMaybe try and engage his Fe by explaining that you miss him and want to do more stuff with him.
1	Well maybe he is an XNTP he gets his energy off of other people. I am not your typical ESFP either.
1	He doesn't want to hang out with you. And you don't want to play Xbox. Just deal with it and hang out with someone else.

2	Company assigning employees to teams based on their personality?	Back when i was in college and as part of their recruitment process, I took a personality test before getting an offer letter from a company. There was no result or description of my personality after the test completed - the results were just sent to the company \n\nAnyhow, now I have reasons to believe that the company divides it's employees into teams based on the test results. \n\n(i)There were two sides to the office - one was a lot smaller than the other, I was in the smaller side. \n\n(ii)Now that I look back, 100% of the interns on the smaller side were introverts - that number is about 70-80% for other employees. \n\n(iii) R&D department was on the smaller side along with two other teams and Susan Cain has mentioned t in her book hat companies fill their R&D departments with introverts. \n\n(iv) All the events (eg. Fun Friday) were organized on the bigger side - it was optional for everyone - but since we were in the other side, it was easier for us to concentrate on our work.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this?
2	it works. sounds like good office placement to me.
9	Any ESFPs worried worried about being annoying	Recently I have become more self aware, and more self conscious if my behavior. And I keep finding myself wishing I hadn't said something or another. I am constantly worried about annoying my peers by talking too much. Does anyone else experience this?
4	Pretty much all the time. Most of my friends are intjs and i admire their mysterious allure.
3	Annoying by talking too much?  But that's part of our charm. Especially since we're super entertaining.  Right?
3	I get self conscious that I talk about myself too much when I am just trying to relate @_@
2	I know I am annoying to a lot of people, but I don't really care enough to do anything about it.
2	Ya, but you just gotta be your best most positive self and do your best!  One thing to remember is that people don't remember what was talked about or who said what. People just remember if a night was generally fun or not. If one comment falls short, there is always time to make up for it, don't worry about it.  worrying causes hesitation which is no good. 
1	I am careful to not talk too much.
6	A message from an ENFP	I fucking love being around you guys. I've been told that I'm just a great ball of sunshine and charisma. But y'all just always seem to be so invested in the moment and I semi-envy that. I can always tell when I'm in the room with one of y'all, and I always look forward to sharing the spotlight with you and then just watching you do your thing. Keep being your loud selves!!! I fucking love y'all, and some advice for you less mature ESFPs: don't give a shit what anyone thinks about you and quit hesitating because everyone else is just waiting to hear your shitty jokes/stories/nonsense cause they don't have any. 
2	I lived with an ENFP for a few years and I absolutely love being with you guys too man
2	The emotional support and drive is strong in this one. LOVE IT! :D
1	I'm an ExFP and I love you both, ENFP and ESFP <3
1	Had a very good friend who was an ESFP but we had a falling out. This makes me miss her.
1	Kyea 
1	My best friend is an ESFP :) 
1	Do opposites (ESFP/INTJ) attract? (x-post /r/INTJ)	Would an INTJ man be compatible for LTR/marriage with an ESFP woman? I'm a single guy and I'm trying a new approach for 2016...
2	Not an expert in MBTI so I can't speak to that much, but I'm an INTJ female dating and ESFP male. We both refer to our relationship as "the best relationship ever." We've been together for over two years, and although it's been a lot of work--especially learning to effectively communicate feelings, needs, desires, disappointments, etc.--over those two years to make it work, I really do think it's a great relationship. Might not be right for everyone, but it's certainly working for me.
1	Depends on the people involved. There's nothing saying any pair will never work. I personally would have a hard time with INTJ, then again I don't know many. The INTJ would have to adapt to the ESFP or it wouldn't work. Don't expect vice versa.
1	In socionics it's seen as the ideal relationship. High amount of understanding due to having same functions. Low amount of Se of the INTJ is compensated by high Se from the ESFP and vice-versa for Ni.
1	My best friend is an INTJ who acts like an ENFP. It was like fireworks when we met. We are so alike I can't exaggerate thate enough. We're both odd and quirky. We are great only had one big argument. She accused me of something I did and didn't accept my apology though. I am 16 and so is she. she is 3w9. I am 8w9.
1	I'm an INTJ male who's been married to a ESFx for almost 22 years. It's been up and down for both of us, but I wouldn't have had it any other way. We complement each other; I keep her grounded and she encourages me to step out of my comfort zone. Any long-term relationship requires work and sacrifice, but it can work beautifully.
1	I'm an ESFP female who recently started seeing an INTJ male. It's too soon to say if a LTR would work but I've never connected with someone so well. 
1	I'm an INTJ. One of my best friends, if not the best, is an ESFP. Sure, some habits of his can irk me a little but I don't remember the last time we've had a major argument in the last 15 years of knowing him.
1	From what I've seen around they mesh great. 
1	I've been in a LTR (4yrs) with INTJ (I'm ESFP). It has been the best relationship that I have ever been in but.... also the hardest. Its a constant roller-coaster of emotions. We always have the same argument ( the same for the past 4 yrs) I don't pay enough attention ( true)..... ESFP, tend to be scatter, needy and clingy for affection but you will always have space to gather your thoughts, some one to listen to you say the same thing in 4 different ways and still smile and someone that is going too have your back in any situation.. Oh I forgot, we are impulsive and indecisive and even thou we try its hard to change our ways.\n\nLastly be content and nice about the fact that we will never see the world as you do. we are not your pet projects to fix but that does not mean that there will be no growth as the relationship evolves.
1	I am an ESFP female dating an INTJ male. I have been dating him for over a year and a half and things are like most people have been saying very up and down. We are completely opposite. We compliment each other well because we are on opposite sides of the spectrum, but when it comes to communicating feelings and emotions sometimes it gets a little shakey. I'm the type who tends to hold in my emotions till they all come out. And in general I'm way more emotional. Sometimes he sees me as too clingy. And I see him as too emotionally unavailable. However, conversations and time spent together are so natural..which is unlike any relationship I've had before. I think it just depends on the couple and if they are willing to sort through the differences and try to find a way to make it work. I personally feel that even if there's a bit of a rollercoaster ride to it, it's very rewarding, and he's my best friend. 
0	In theory - no.\nAs mbti states, you and your partner should be almost opposite: everything but J/P. People with "almost opposite" types can form a relationship of duality (http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/content.php/17-Duality-Descriptions-Meged-Ovcharov).\nComplete opposites, on the other hand, most likely would be confronting each other.\n\nBut that's theory.\n\nFor further information check out complete relationship chart: http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/content.php/174-Socionics-Intertype-Relations-Chart.
3	Hey guys what does your handwriting look like?	"Wait a minute, this doesn't belong here!"\nOn the contrary, yes it does! I'm conducting an experiment to see if there is any correlation between the types and their handwritings. They say that handwriting is one of the keys to your personality since your brain controls your hand right?\nAnyways, I would really appreciate some samples! Thanks! Don't forget to mention your type (if you are a person lurking on another type's sub of course!)
3	Alright well here's some chicken scratch list I made after visiting /r/nootropics... http://m.imgur.com/s4PhTPi
1	No sample but I write in capitals so it's legible. 
1	Sorry for the poor lighting. Here's some random notes from class last semester. \n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/qHxe4\n\nI've heard I've got doctor-level handwriting. A shame about that GPA...
1	Really distinct loopy clean nost messy and kind of big. I have amazing cursive. 8w9 girl
1	I'm a double major in Business and European History and the history department requires exceptional writing. I suppose I have some samples since I'm constantly writing. PM me and I will send you some.
1	Heya! This might as well be really bad but here is my writing. http://imgur.com/BX8Z2j1
2	Best ways to meet ESFP	Hi there!\nLong story short: personally, I adore ESFPs and would love to know more of them (not in a creepy way :) ). So I'm looking for your advice about places and occasions where they are more likely to be met. Any information might be helpful: what is your (or your ESFP friend's) hobby, where you like to hang out, etc.\n\nI guess, every fellow INTP like me would be thankful for this information :)
5	Anywhere cool where people gather. Bars, casinos, college, tennis courts, the parking lot... Honestly I can't think of a place I don't run into us, we are everywhere. Just go outside
2	I met my ESFP husband by doing a show at my college, and he was the master carpenter. Most of the ESFPs I have met have come from my area's theater scene, doing either acting or tech work. So, you might have some luck in that arena, too. If you're willing to learn how to run a lightboard or paint a set, you can probably get involved in helping at your local college or community theaters. Competent techies are always in high demand.
2	A karaoke bar is a good place to start. We are The Entertainers by definition. Somewhere where we can have people with all eyes on us :)
2	seriously dude?! you can find us on trees of north woods ,we live there cause our favorite fruit on that trees. wtf with people all i see here is about dating ,how? where? who? are you hopeless that far ,go out find a random girl ,it's not about personality test result it's about your capabilities and what you have.  
1	I lived with an INTP for 3 years. It's easy to meet us but for INTPs it might be challenging unless your friend dragged you out to a bar or party. If an INTP wants to meet an ESFP you would need to go out with friends to some social function 
2	Birthday gift for an ESFP?	My favorite ESFP is having a surprise birthday party in a few weeks.  I already got her a gift for her birthday (a deck of Exploding Kittens card game) but saw her early so gave it to her for Xmas.  I told her it was for both Xmas and Birthday, since I'm poor can't afford much.  But wanted to surprise her with another gift because it is a surprise party and her 40th.  What inexpensive item or ticket or whatever could I give her for her b-day?  I'm INFJ, if that matters.
3	It's winter in this hemisphere so I'll assume you're from here, you could get her a cute beanie or knit one if you have time and can do that. Personally I like getting gifts that say the person knows me well, like memorabilia from my favorite TV show or a gift card to my favorite store or something.
5	ESFP's, how would you react?	I have two questions, actually. It'd be great if you could give your opinion on them. \n\n1. If an ESFP responds to the question "are you straight?" with "as far as I know," how should I interpret this?\n\n2. How would you respond to a friend confessing to have feelings for you when you don't reciprocate? Would you be able to remain being friends with them? \n\nIf it makes any difference, the ESFP in question is a girl and I (INTJ) am too. We're in college. \n\n
2	Male ESFP here.  I answer #1 the exact same way and I'm in a loving relationship with the woman I am going to marry. \nIt doesn't mean much, we just like to give people vague answers.
2	Female especially,would answer #1 the same.  Have kept friends in situation #2.
2	1. Would also answer the same way, I mean you never know for sure do you. I've fallen for some female Justin Bieber lookalikes.\n\n2. This has happened and I just say I don't feel the same. I stay friends with them yeah. It's up to them if it makes them feel awkward to stay friends. I'm cool with whatever.
1	On #1, we absolutely love to give vague answers, wittingly or not. Several friends have uttered dismay about this.\n\nOn #2, assuming she is heterosexual, she probably doesn't care. I would be more concerned if *you* can be friends with someone you are in love with. While none of my gay friends have "come on" to me like that, I have perceived that some have had feelings for me, but I don't mind at all (in fact, I only get flattered). It's only natural, right?\n\nThen again, I too am male, so YMMV.
1	I'm a male ESFP and the spontaneity of our responses surely explains why "as far as I know". We are highly emotional and extremely involved with others lives. \n______\nFor me, if a girl has expressed her emotional feelings for me, it means a lot. While I constantly have experiences with men/women at the bars/parties ending with "you're a really cool, person. I hope we get to know each other more"...it doesn't mean anything until a female truly expresses themselves to me... followed by my full attention on the people who contact me after the bars/parties.
1	Female ESFP here\n1: I also say the same thing. Not so much because I'm trying to be vague, but more because I don't have a "yes" or "no" answer to the question yet. I've only been with my boyfriend of almost 3 years, I have nothing to compare to.\n2: This has happened to me, and although it made me self conscious about whether I was being too flirty with my friend or not, it didn't change anything about our friendship until he continued to confess his feelings for me on multiple occasions (even though I was in a relationship). My initial reaction was to let him down gently and express that I loved him a lot--platonically. The 3rd time, which was a year later than the first, I told him that if he continued I would have to stop talking to him completely. I wanted to continue being friends with him but I felt it was too emotionally straining on both of us. He never confronted me with his feelings again but we have since drifted apart.\n\nBasically, it will only ruin your friendship if you make it awkward. The ESFP is more than willing to pretend it never happened to avoid confrontation.
1	ESFP female here.\n1. Things always change so just take 'as far as I know' as it is. It means they're straight but you just never know because ESFPs live in the now and who knows what could happen.\n2. I would be able to remain friends as them, but as someone mentioned above, I wouldn't be able to be my full self. I can be a bit touchy feely and that can be misinterpreted as being intimate so I would have to act a bit cold to them.\n\nPs. I recently met an INTJ and I've connected with someone so well.
1	I'm an ESFP female, I also would answer the first question the same way. I'd want to get my answer across but keep my answer kinda light. I personally would be happy to maintain a friendship with someone who had feelings for me but for whom I did not. I would be upfront with them about only wanting friendship though.
3	What is a good gift for ESFPs?	Hello! I am trying to think of a good gift for my boyfriend's sister, who is an ESFP. We are not close, but we are friendly. I thought about getting her an "experience gift," like a ticket for a zipline or hot air balloon ride. I think that would come across like me trying way too hard, however, because it is quite pricey. Any help? She loves her dogs and she is very very social. She is also into material things it seems (always well-dressed and very put together home). Please help! I am an INFJ female and we do not look forward to the same kind of gifts. I bet she would hate a book of poetry or any book at all for that matter. :p
3	I would not advise a book, it's like impossible to gauge someone's reading taste. Does she seem to wear very pricey things? If not a gift card to a store would be a good bet. And you can't go wrong with Victoria's Secret for females
2	(probably) not ESFP, but I would reccomend something like a luxury soap or (not too pricey) perfume. Most people enjoy getting such gifts. 
2	i am an ESFP-n if you gift me a perfume consider that the end of our friendship i am allergic to all kinds of perfume, it's personalty gift suggestion place!!
2	I'm an ESFP and love reading. A common misconception about our personality type is that we are ditzy which is the opposite of true :) [Here's a link to an article that might be helpful](http://shopcatalog.com/collections/esfp/) 
6	Do any of you seem introverted in person?	Am I the only ESFP who doesn't really...have much to say? In general? I don't identify with the ESFP description of being lively and jovial and a party hostess or anything. But I'm quite sure I don't identify with being a Fi Dom either. And I'm most certainly not ENFP.
8	I'm really quiet in class or at my\njob. Mostly around a professional setting. Everyone thinks I'm really shy until they get me around my friends and I'm really loud and I talk non-stop. I think because I am a very playful person that I try to keep my play side and my professional side very seperate because I don't want professionals to see how crazy I can get. Sometimes it's disheartening though because I feel like most people I see every day don't really even know me.\n
2	I tend to be extremely shy on first meeting people and extremely irritatingly chatty when I get to know them.\n\nI'm not sure, though, if this is just because while I keep rolling ESFP on personality tests my E and S are actually so borderline I could be an ISFP or INFP in disguise.  Certainly I think I have ENFP stereotypes (idealistic, restless, emotional) and am missing some ESFP ones (people skills!, and I'm certainly not straightforwardly 100% social 100% of the time).
1	No, I am very outgoing, but deep down I am very quiet and I'm extremely observant.
1	Like others have said, I'm also really quiet and reserved at first until I'm comfortable enough to open up to someone. That's when I'm more playful, more interesting and wild.
5	How can an ENTP and an ESFP get along better?	Hey y'all. I am an ENTP and my dad is an ESFP. We used to be pretty close in the past, but our relationship has became more distant over the past years. Do you guys, as ESFPs, have any tips on how we can get along better? \n\nMost of the problems we have consists of either my dad complaining about myself being too emotionally distant, even though I consistently make an effort to spend time with him. Another issue we have is when we start an argument after I tell him about some ideas I had. I tend to enjoy debating ideas, but he always leaves the conversation looking very nervous/drained.
2	My ENTP friend and I have gotten into arguments too. There is really no debating with an ESFP, either they don't care because they don't have a position on the subject or they do care and it gets personal. I'd say stay away from arguing, debating is not really our strong suit
1	Hes probably referring to your decisions being more logically based rather than emotionally based. Not everyone likes to debate, he probably has that nervous/drained look because your logical responses conflict with his emotional responses or feelings. Which would tie back to him calling you emotionally detached. Instead of debating or arguing try to listen and understand. or Just listen/act like you are listening. Just some guesses based off what you gave. I'm an ISTP btw. 
2	Just want a little help on how to approach a topic	Hey ESFP's, I just met an amazing ESFP. I'm INFP, and while I know we are not the most compatible, I still want to see if we can make it work. So the only issue I have is her obvious superficial sense (I love everything else about her) I want to somehow discuss that with her, but without hurting her. I realize ESFP can be really sensitive to criticism, so how do I jump into this topic in the most delicate way possible?
2	[deleted]
1	In what way is her superficial sense an issue? I'm an esfp female myself and highly sensitive to criticism (it can be even the smallest thing!) so I'm trying to consider how I would handle it myself :-) 
1	Jump into what topic, the fact that you think she is superficial? I should think you wouldn't want to jump into that topic at all if you want to keep her as a friend
1	Absolutely no promises on this, but what about approaching the situation with curiosity? You've mentioned that you won't actively bring it up, but if she mentions how much makeup she wears you could try, 'hey yeah, I have noticed that. It surprised me a bit since some girls who wear a lot of makeup can be so vain, but you've never seemed that way. What drives you get all dressed up so often?'\n\nYou may learn something important about her, without offending her.
3	Entps looking at you..	SO what have you encountered with entps? \n
2	I've lived with an ENTP. I got along with him well. It was great because he loved cooking and would randomly cook something amazing every now and then. He was also highly addicted to drugs so my other roommates told me to keep it low if I had my hands on anything. Thing I liked most about him was that he would be highly productive with school work... everything he did seemed passionate to him. Thing I didn't like was that he was the lack of emotion to myself and everyone else. \n________\n\nI'm friends with a few other ENTP's who I haven't lived with. As a friend they are great. Anytime I see them on campus they are lovely to have a convo with in between classes. The ENTP's I know are always active, start the day early, and are done with class before noon. They are great people to know, and I would love to live a day as an ENTP for sure, but that Ne dom followed by Ti aux is just too much for me to handle.\n\n________________\n\nAs an ESFP i've noticed how easy it is to tune myself with ENTP's. If there is some logic, theory, or subject I know they're into, it's so easy for me to strum at their chord and keep them very excited. It's fun for me because I love hearing how much they know about something I poke their minds with. \n\n\nENTP: I've been getting interested in philosophy\n\nMe: What's the point? We're all just lines of chalk in the cement waiting to be washed away.\n\n\nENTP: (immediate argument and opinion about life and death)\n
2	I hate ENTP humor, it's like the most annoying thing in the world. I don't know what it is but you all seem to have this similar brand of humor where you think talking incessantly about stuff you know we don't care about is funny. And it's like every single thing that comes out of the entps mouth has to have some sort of cutesy spin on it to make it quirky. Everything is exaggerated or twisted or whatever, it's just not natural conversation.\n\nYou guys are alright, just don't expect me to laugh at anything you say. It seems entps think their humor is all they have to offer.
0	An introverts' perspective on Extroverts with a million friends!	
2	This is stupid. I'm an extrovert and I have less than ten people I truly consider friends.
2	People gotta stop thinking that extroverts automatically have a million superficial friendships and introverts automatically have a few perfect friendships -_-\n\nPlenty of extroverts cut down their social circle and keep only the "best" ones as they get older because adult responsibilities make it hard to maintain many friendships or maybe they choose to devote more time to a romantic relationship. Introverts who are actively engaged in a lot of hobbies usually have tons of friends and acquaintances from the various communities they identify with. And someone of either type could have no friends simply because they're a shitty person.
1	Sorry, what? That rambled pretty hard and I had difficulty following beyond "quality not quantity."

1	(xpost r/MBTI) ESFP and ENTP started an MBTI podcast!	* [Soundcloud.com/when-myers-met-briggs](https://soundcloud.com/when-myers-met-briggs)\n\n* [Facebook.com/WhenMyersMetBriggs](https://www.facebook.com/WhenMyersMetBriggs)\n\n* [Subscribe on iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/when-myers-met-briggs/id1060274982)\n\nMy friend and I are hardcore MBTI hobbyists that recently decided to start a podcast. I'm an ENTP (The Debater) and she's an ESFP (The Performer), and together we have four years of MBTI knowledge, a love of self reflection, goofy humor and a very fat cat.\n\nIn our first 30-minute episode we talk about our history with Myers Briggs, why we love it, a short version of our lives as Extraverted Perceivers, and our vision for the podcast.\n\nWe're super casual and looking to talk about pet theories and MBTI jokes as much as serious self-reflection and analysis. We stumbled a bit cause it’s our first show and we don’t script it, but we’re hoping to get better with experience and feedback.\n\n**Tl;dr What do you think about our podcast? What questions do you have or do you get all the time about Myers Briggs?**\n
2	My INTJ husband is going to be very excited about this. I'm glad there are ESFPs that can really get into the mtbi self-analysis! I've never really grokked the nitty gritty of it, and blamed my type for that. Makes me happy that there are people who can speak for us.
3	Do ESFP women cheat?	I'm a ENTP male and in a "happy" relationship with a ESFP. \nWe have a lot in common and really love each other, but every time, like EVERY time, she decides to ignore me at all as soon there are "new" people.\nI also caught her kissing (i was picking her up from a concert and spotted her with him kissing) her ex two times and she nearly got raped twice, and that were just the things she let me know.\nWe live in a long-distance-relationship and I simply don't know, how I could loose my enourmous trust issue in her.\nThe things I loved about her; being open minded and friendly, caring and very fast in making social contacts are now it making me feel insecure and i'm just thinking about how long it will probably last until I'll catch her cheating again.\nI mean, she can't even control her body language when she's around new men, especially men which are looking good. Because when new girls are around, she's just friendly and open minded, but when there's a new guy she has interest in, her body language switches automatically to flirt mode, even when she says that this is her way to show she's interested (she would be even interested in a talk to biggest dictators and would find something good in them)\nI wanted her to let me know just a few things when she's going out   but now she said i would cutoff her "freedom", but when I'm not writing back for like a hour because I have something to do she really gets upset and thinks that i'm with another girl.\nDo you guys need freedom all the time or is it just a sign for me to break up and leave her alone with her so called "freedom".\nI'm just shaking in fear because of the faults she did  in the past but she's just saying, "I won't cheat on you" but demands massive trust while not going any step towards me and make me know more about her life or her actions, also she keeps her mobile phone always in her hands and writing or tumblring all the time, but when i'm talking to her vie whatsapp or the facebook messenger i wait around 20 minutes for a respond wich is indeed more often a simple "k", "y", "chill" instead of the intense talks we had in former times. It's killing me because i love her but she doesn't give one single fuck about my trust issue and is upset because she thinks i would see her as a bitch.\npls halp.
5	>"I'm a ENTP male and in a "happy" relationship with a ESFP"\n\n\nNo you're not. My guess is you guys have been together for <1 year.\n\n\n>"We have a lot in common and really love each other, but every time, like EVERY time, she decides to ignore me at all as soon there are "new" people. \n\n\n\nRed flag #1. This is an observation I've seen in manipulative people. In one on one interactions they may treat someone very well, but when other people around the respect completely goes away. She is using you for something.\n\n\n\n>"I also caught her kissing (i was picking her up from a concert and spotted her with him kissing) her ex two times and she nearly got raped twice, and that were just the things she let me know."\n\n\nShe's lying to you, cheating on you, and manipulating you. What more could you ask for in a girlfriend, right? Rape is something that should be taken seriously. Judging the behavior you described in your post, I honestly think she's full of shit about "nearly" getting raped.  \n\n\n>"The things I loved about her"\n\n\nSnap out of it. You're acting irrationally.\n\n\n>"i'm just thinking about how long it will probably last until I'll catch her cheating again"\n\n\nYou're treating her cheating as if it is a ticking time bomb? It doesn't have to be. She clearly has no respect for you, but let me ask you something: do you have any respect for *yourself*?\n\n\n\n>"Because when new girls are around, she's just friendly and open minded, but when there's a new guy she has interest in, her body language switches automatically to flirt mode, even when she says that this is her way to show she's interested"\n\n\nOh, she's "interested" alright. If there is a positive correlation between her flirtatious behavior and the perceived attractiveness of a guy, then she is definitely "interested". Come on, buddy, this is common sense.\n\n\n\n>"I wanted her to let me know just a few things when she's going out but now she said i would cutoff her "freedom""\n\n\n\n"Freedom" as in freedom to pursue her "interests"?\n\n\n\n>"but when I'm not writing back for like a hour because I have something to do she really gets upset and thinks that i'm with another girl."\n\n\n\nShe's fucking with you. 100%. Let me make this clear: She doesn't like YOU. She likes the attention you give her. \n\n\n\n>"I'm just shaking in fear because of the faults she did in the past"\n\n\n\nAnd you don't have to anymore. Next time somebody cheats on you, or you see red flags, you cut it off.\n\n\n\n>"also she keeps her mobile phone always in her hands and writing or tumblring all the time, but when i'm talking to her vie whatsapp or the facebook messenger i wait around 20 minutes for a respond wich is indeed more often a simple "k", "y", "chill" "\n\n\n\nFrom my observations, girls have their hands glued to their phones all the time. And by the sound of it, she deliberately took 20 minutes to reply to your message. There is no mutual respect in your interactions. This is not a relationship.\n\n\n\n>"It's killing me because i love her but she doesn't give one single fuck about my trust issue and is upset because she thinks i would see her as a bitch"\n\n\n\nHas it ever occurred to you that the reason why she doesn't give a fuck about your trust issues is that you "love" her? Think about it from her perspective. If a guy is giving her constant validation despite him knowing that she cheated and has not broken up with her yet, would she invest her time caring about something as contrary to her "interests" as your "trust issues"? She has no respect for you because you have no respect for yourself. Stop caring about what *she* thinks. She is a bitch/slut/whatever because she cheated, no matter what she says.\nStop trying to accommodate for her point of view and view her objectively. \n\n\n\nHeres what you do, and you can ignore my advice at your expense:\n\n\n\nYou're going to cut off all contact and work on yourself. In a couple days/weeks she is going to apologize/miss/text/etc. you. You're going to ignore it. What happens if you don't? She's going to cheat on you again and again and, eventually, she is going to be the one that dumps you.\n\n\n\nYou sound like a guy that is dependent on people for his happiness. Don't be that guy. Work on your OWN life and people will come. Give people a REASON to want to hang out with you. Work out, pursue your interests, and people will come.\n\n\n\nThe problem with this girl is that you are disposable. There are more attractive guys that she has access to and she is only using you for the attention/validation you give her. The way you combat that is you simply stop worrying about other people and pursue your own interests. In every interaction you have with people there is an exchange of value (money,looks,skills, etc.). Work on your own value and people will come.\n\nIn the meantime, erase this girl from your memory. You are only wasting your time
3	You're in the relationship. She isn't. We cheat when we don't take the relationship seriously. ESFP in long distance relationship is just asking for it. We are out of sight out of mind. Trust me I tried it with another ESFP.\n\nThat said just because we get in flirt mode around some guys doesn't mean we are interested, sometimes we might just be nervous around them.\n\n>she keeps her mobile phone always in her hands and writing or tumblring all the time, but when i'm talking to her vie whatsapp or the facebook messenger i wait around 20 minutes for a respond wich is indeed more often a simple "k", "y", "chill" instead of the intense talks we had in former times\n\nYeah man she's not into you anymore, you're a backup plan when she's not getting attention from other guys. Seems like she is trying to get you to stop contacting her since she doesn't wanna break it off herself. Sorry but time to let her go.\n
8	ESFP's are the flightiest, most illogical people I've ever met. They are fun, spontaneous and can be absolutely captivating, however, there is no rational thoughts in their world. Only feeling and being in the moment. Responsibilities and real life are a chore for them to think about and a relationship where they are tied down is no different. They have no concept of consequences. Honestly dude do you constantly want to be disappointed in the person who you are dating? She clearly treats you like garbage so why torture yourself? There are LOTS of red flags with what you posted and you should already see the writing on the wall. I will honestly be surprised if an ESFP even reads through your entire post before getting bored. Do yourself a favor and end it with her. She will not meet your needs in the way you expect her to. You deserve to be in a relationship where you feel wanted. Speaking as an ENTP with experience with this...run. You will never be happy in this relationship.

5	Insights Into The ESFP Personality That You Should Know	
1	Most important are the alone one and the shallow one. My Fi makes it hard to get along with the same person for extended periods so I usually need a break. And it also makes me feel things pretty intensely, so I definitely wouldn't say I am shallow, though based on my interests someone might pin me as being that way.

2	My ESFP gf has worryitus.	Whenever something goes wrong in the day, it will ruin the rest of her day and she'll like start worrying about other things that weren't even related to her current problem. I have to choose my words super carefully, and if I say one thing wrong, it goes back to the start. But I'm ENFP and she often tells me that I'm being too optimistic, even when I'm trying to look at the situation in a realistic way. So it's rare that she'll take what I say seriously, when it comes to this stuff. The only person that she ever really calms down for every time is her ESTP father. But I don't want to just tell her that she should call her dad every time she starts worrying.\n\nI want to be able to help her, but it feels like she really doesn't listen to me, until she calms down. I've tried everything I could think of, but I just can't seem to get through to her. I've tried talking with her calm and sensibly, talking enthusiastically positive, shutting up and just listening, yelling at her to stop worrying(this definitely didn't work), mimicking her father, changing subjects, worrying with her. Like I'm just lost. Is this a ESFP thing? And what can I do? We've been together for 6 years now and it's something that has been draining both of us.
1	In my experience as an ESFP I just need my feelings validated. I need someone to sit down and say "your feelings are real and therefore are worthy of being felt". Words also cut deeper than you would think. Any insult towards me, even as a joke, hurts me to the core, because I don't understand why people have to hurt other people. \n\nBasically, to help her, I would be very careful what you say and how you say it.\n\nAnd make sure she knows that how she is feeling is 100% okay. I promise you that this will help. Once I know that people understand my problems and feel for me I am able to get over it.\n\nI hope this helps :) 
1	It's not really an ESFP thing no, in fact most esfps are prone to not worrying about things they definitely should worry about. I agree that she probably wants her feelings validated and someone to hear her out. If I am caught up in worrying I want the other person to just listen to me and agree that what I'm worrying about is stressful but also calm me down a bit by breaking the situation down.
1	Does she have Bipolar or ADD ? I am not a worry wart nut have horrible stress. Sometime exercise therapy and medication doesn't even help me at all. I have PTSD,Bipolar 1 and ADD life is so sucky sometimes. Maybe therapy would help her? you sound really sweet she is so lucky to have you. Maybe do more research persuade her into getting therapy.

0	ESFP sister who always thinks everyone is criticizing her	I'm an INFP with an ESFP sister. She does have ADHD, but even so let's say she is messy, leaves things around the house, is not following on a decision through in a smart way, just anything... When i mention it, instead of taking the responsibility or even just listening to what i'm (or frankly any of my family members are saying) she just screams OKKKK I WILL and then never does it.... or just proceeds to yell that everyone is attacking her. All we are saying though is just to PPICK UP THE REMOTE UCHHH. It's so frustrating. \n\nI found what helps is saying in a calm voice something like "There is this thing on the floor and it's preventing the room from being messy, since these are your things, can you please pick it up?" Like breaking it step by step i guess helps...\n\nDoes anyone have any other suggestions? Drives me crazy!!!!!!\n\nThanks
1	This isn't an ESFP problem it's an I have an immature sibling problem. I mean I have ADHD and it's no excuse to be irresponsible if she is medicated. hopefully it will improve with age but I think this is the wrong place to be asking for advice. Any type can be a brat.
1	Can confirm. Am ESFP with ADHD, your sisters just a bitch.
1	I think all you need to do is being messier than she is or pretend everything is in the right order till she cannot stand it any longer :p 
5	ESFPs, lets discuss our Se	Anyone with knowledge about the MBTI has little grasp on how Se works, especially as a primary function. We are blessed with the ability to be aware of our surroundings on a constant basis. Do you feel that every day life is a 'stage' for you like how we are described? \n\nFor me I don't see life as a stage BUT the way I dress heavily influences how I would like to appear outside of my home. I don't feel like I need to entertain people but I do feel like I need to present myself nicely. \n\nIn a bar or social setting, I feel like I can hear everyone's conversation at once. It gets annoying yet I try to concentrate on what I am doing. My Se makes me feel like Spider Man at some points; I am way too in tune with multiple conversations without actually being apart of them. \n\nI also hate having Se in the classroom. It makes me worried to raise my hand or ask questions. I am too worried about someone elses view toward what I think than my own. \n\nWhat do you think about your Se?
6	I'm also very conscious of how I look. If I look like a slob it is because I actively chose to look like that that day. I don't wear makeup usually unless I am meeting someone important or looking to pick up guys. But I always coordinate my outfit, otherwise I feel like a dumbass. I mean realistically it doesn't take much effort to make sure your shirt matches your pants, so if they don't match I assume everyone notices and thinks I have no pride whatsoever. I feel awkward walking around with stained clothes too, I want to take them off immediately.\n\nI also have super sensitive hearing and pick up info from everyone's conversation. Which can be cool learning tidbits from everyone but then again it usually leads to me never saying anything because all I can do is fuckin hear everyone else. And then people ask why I'm not talking. I'm not shy dammit I just don't like talking over people.\n\nOverall though I like my Se. I don't know what the hell I would do with Ne. I would probably be too weird to function.
0	I need help! calling artisan salesmen	Hey everyone. In my work I sell, organize, and facilitate 8-week entrepreneurship boot camps in Chile. We have been doing this for just over 2 years now. As we have evolved as an organization it seems we have gotten away from what worked in the beginning--that was basically just being excited and happy about what we were doing and others wanted to be involved. \n\nNow we talk mainly about vision, goals for future, and how difficult entrepreneurship is. But then we forget about the most important thing, the users experience! \n\nSo I would love to ask a big favor and have you guys check out this website and give your artisan lens feedback on our newest program called Hydra. Its an ocean themed entrepreneurship program - http://hydra.exosphe.re \n\nplease be BRUTALLY HONEST. I would prefer that over fluff. \n\nthanks to everyone who helps out. 
1	Too. Many. Words.
1	Wait this is a course on how to be an entrepreneur? I feel like if you have to pay $4000 to learn how to start your own business you've already failed. And yeah what that other guy said. Too many words.
2	How 'smart' would you say you are?	Fellow ESFPs,\n\nI'm curious to know how educated you think you are in comparison to your average peer. For example, post your age, HS GPA and ACT/SAT score, College degree/degree you seek when getting into college, and your post graduate profession (salary if you'd like).\n\nI am only asking because ware are commonly known as being the butt of a joke, gullible, and are sometimes seen as having no scholarly background (stereotypes of ESFPs I've seen people post online). If you don't feel like posting this much personal information about yourself, give your opinion about the subject.\n\n________\nHS--\n\nGPA: 2.5\n\nACT: 31 \n\nI hated homework and project deadlines and was frequently late on turning everything in, but would do extremely well on exams with night before studying.\n\n____\nCollege--\n\nDegree: European History/Business Administration\n____\nProfession--\n\nMotorcycle Salesperson: Nothing of my degree trained me to become a salesman, but sales has become a natural talent of mine. If I was an ESTP rather than ESFP using Fi my numbers would be much higher. \n\n____\n\n\nDoes having an education aid my sales talent and ability to work with people so well? I think that college classes have benefited my intelligence, but my college and high school experiences outside of the classroom have made me a smarter person. What do you think about yourself? 
1	I have some where between a 2.5-3.0 average as undergrad, i dont consider myself smart at all.
1	18F, 3.8 GPA, 2390 SAT and currently attending an Ivy League college to study engineering and applied math. People think I'm stupid all the time. I don't consider myself smart, I just consider myself hard working and well disciplined which I guess is smart in the sense that I have the sensibility to know to work super hard.
1	3.4 I am really smart, but act like a dumb ass. I have a lot of N and T it's just not as high as my S and F. I'm really good at History and  Science, and English . Math gives me a head ache. It's wayyy to concrete and then too abstract. I'm finally understanding it. I also have good common sense. I am going into Pediatrics, I  Love kids and Science/Health.
-2	My IQ is about 140. My SAT I scored 1950 and I've been on the honor roll since like second grade. I'd say I'm very smart but honestly I'd rather be dumb. Ignorance is bliss yo.
0	Myers briggs dating ?	hi esfp's! I'm posting here because i (male, istj) dated an esfp in the recent past and she was the most compatible person i've ever dated!  I can't think of a single moment i did not laugh.  She was just full of life and couldn't stop talking.  I mean the stories would just keep repeating themselves and she would sit there trying to catch her breath telling me stories nonstop, i'd find it adorable.  She was also extremely nice to everyone.  The issue was that even though everything was 'amazing' I didn't feel complete compatibility for a couple other reasons i don't really want to lay out, it would just be rude.  That said, you guys are amazing and I just wish there was a way for me to focus my dating on esfp without the trial and error and randomness of dating that is what we currently do.  where do i find you guys?  The fact that she verbally adored my (flexible) structure and easy going focus was awesome.  And the fact that she could verbally walk me through a number of scenarios on things i was thinking about and help select the best option was super cool.  I finally think i figured out a way to find an actual compatible match... But how to find you guys in the first place apart from chance? :)  Thanks!
2	Go outside and your chances will increase 10x
1	I love you xSTJs LOL. But sorry, have no tips.
1	Go to a bar. Any bar. Really. Just go out. They are literally everywhere.
5	You asked for it...	...and after a few months of careful deliberation and contemplation, I have decided to edit the tab from Preformer to Performer. \n\nAlso I'm looking to add a new moderator. I unfortunately do not have the time I would like to participate in the sub so if anyone would like to come aboard to make discussion threads and other features to engage the community comment here or shoot me a PM.\n\nI'm also aware of the missing search bar, If there is someone who is more adept at CSS, and would also like to be a mod, comment or PM\n\nIf anyone would like to see some changes/additions to the sub, comment here and I'll set aside some time this weekend to make it happen.\n\nThanks
-2	I'll be mod. I don't know CSS though.
3	ISFJ (f) in a relationship with an ESFP (m)...help!!!	I'm really falling for an ESFP and he's been sending me mixed signals. One moment, he's CRAZY about me. The next, he's very standoff-ish. \n\nIn my past, I've had a history of emotional neglect and traumatic experiences (that I don't really want to get into). It's difficult for me to speak about these things and connect with ANYONE on an emotional level. It's been difficult for me to deal with all of this, and I've been trying to overcome my pessimism and withdrawn emotions.\n\nThe ESFP I am dating seems to get discouraged whenever I am withdrawn from him. Sometimes I say things jokingly (that can probably be taken offensively if you don't "get me") and it's written all over his face that I have hurt his feelings. I'm not really sure what to do. I want to make this relationship work and I am so afraid of rejection. I've really began to fall for him and if this doesn't work out, I'm going to be very hurt.\n\n---\n\nThe other night, I was having a full-fledged conversation with him in my sleep and he thought that I was consciously speaking *to* him. He thought that I was fully aware of what I was saying. He had taken a shower while I was asleep and he came into the room, and apparently I said "Ugh! Why didn't you hurry up? I've been trying to sleep!"\n\nIt sounds absolutely ridiculous now that I speak about it...in the past, whenever my daughter has slept in the same bed as me, she claims that I get grouchy if she moved the slightest bit. \n\nMy boyfriend seemed very offended by what I said in an unconscious state. He said that he didn't like how bossy I was in my sleep. There's only so much that I can help when I am in an unconscious state! LOL!\n\n---\n\n**(TL;DR) What can I do to show my ESFP boyfriend that I am committed to this relationship; that I care about him; that I want to make this work?** This isn't easy for me considering my past experiences.\n\n
-2	I tend to be really flip floppy. I think ESFPs are just natural players unfortunately. Lots of us are missing the empathy chip unfortunately too. I mean look at Justin Bieber, he's got a million girlfriends and he still isn't satisfied. I'd say get treatment for yourself and learn to be happy being single. Which is really hard for housewife-y ISFJs I know but you gotta try. ESFP and ISFJ are really hard to make it work. ISFJs work best with ESFJs in my experience. Exxx and Ixxx counterpart make a good team.
0	Identity crisis	I am an ESFP and I think I am trying to turn into an ESFJ. Pls 2 halp. Hacking into an ESFJ's brain is fucking hard. I'm also having trouble coming out of inferior Ni grip. Any solid solutions and steps I can take? I'm trying diet and exercise but mentally it's really damn hard. Plus I have ADHD which makes it even harder.
2	Sup dude. I had this same problem when I had to take the MBTI in my business classes. The infp who originally showed me MBTI told me to check out the functions for each type to truly understand what I am. I also have ADHD, but go figure considering who we are. First, think about Extraverted Sensing as your primary function... if you don't have a strong grasp on how it works do some research on google. It already sounds like you understand inferior Ni... which I fucking hate to have as well. It will make up feel anxious and worried out of nowhere because we are wayyyy too in the moment. Sure you could say that you're 'trying' to turn into an ESFJ but look at the functions of an ESFJ and conclude whether or not you could transition to that type. Also keep in mind that us ESFP's are natural actors wherein we can put on the mask of any type. stay true to your actual functions 
1	Are you saying you're trying to turn yourself into ESFJ from ESFP, or you think you have always been ESFJ? Keep in mind, there's no such thing as "turning yourself into another type".
1	I feel this. I'm an ambiverted xSFP but I spent most of my life trying to be xSFJ. Trying to force Si and Fe and organizational skills was just making me dig myself into this big terrible hellhole. \nJust understand your functions and learn to accept how they effect you
4	Is the ESFP subreddit lacking a search bar or am I just completely overlooking it?	
2	You're right in that it appears to be missing. Use RES and uncheck "Use subreddit style" and it will once again show up.
1	It would appear you're correct. \n\n(Didn't even notice until you pointed it out because I have RES on and subreddit style turned off.)
0	Need to talk to an Indian ESFP	Need to talk to an ESFP from India. Need perspectives and opinions on something.
4	ESFP: the Preformer!!!	I love being a preformer...but seriously, it's been buggin me for months that the tab title or whatever is spelled incorrectly hahaha
1	Haha I know, it's been annoying me for months too. Isn't there a way to fix it..?
1	Being an ESFP, *The Performer*, is nice... I generally love to learn new things.\nI like to play music, sing and act, but I also love science and math that is actually applicable to my everyday life. \n\nI believe myself to have great anger management skills and social skills. \n\nAlso I am obviously confident in myself and far from depression of any kind. I strive to be optimistic and wise and was raised by an ENFP mother who taught me compassion and perspective and an INFP older brother who taught me self control, and really just how to not be *that guy*, as it is often so easy for an ESFP to quickly become *that guy*.
4	How do I communicate with my ESFP boyfriend.(INFJ)	Not matter my tone of voice if I asked him for anything he would see it as me attacking him. We had a baby in Jan. and I have been nonstop ever since. I haven't been getting much sleep. I havent had a day to myself. It's stressing me out. I went to the movies with friends one night after I got her to bed and that is all I have done in the past 17 months or so. All I ask is for general help. He says I need to be more specific bc he doesnt know what to do. Which I think is just an excuse bc he doesn't seem to wanna try. He just plays a game, spends time in the bathroom, and passes out early and doesnt even bother to talk to me or interact with her most days. Until Yesterday, when I started work, he hadn't even changed a diaper in over a month. Comes to me after I have already done something like give her a bath and will ask if I need help. With what? He doesn't pay any attention to anything and gets upset that I consider everything. Someone has to! I need a moment to think and he doesn't give me any relief. When I was working nights and he was working days, on weekends AI would pick up the slack. Since we were doing equal parts. I dunno what happened to working on this together. But it's killing me bc I cant talk to him. All I have been doing is trying to approach him with a better understanding of my personality and his. I know how bad it can get and I am trying to prevent us from fighting. And he doesn't care about that stuff. I'm trying to be a better person and consider all options and he wont even consider my feelings. I'm so close to saying fuck it. Am I asking too much. And how can I relax when I literally cant relax!
4	If he really is SF then he's a progressive conservative in good times\nand revolutionary communist in really really bad times. He appreciates\nfreedom and exploration in small doses, or when other people do it in\na safely contained environment. He does what he knows how to do which\nhe knows works. Unlike RWAs he'll quickly abandon anything that\ndoesn't work or is destructive, and be much quicker at adopting new\nthings once they're proven to work.\n\nSo, assuming he is definitely PC then the reason he hasn't been\nhelping is because he doesn't know how to do it, and the reason he\ndidn't try new things is because it might lead to disaster, and the\nreason he didn't approach you to help while you were busy is because\nit might lead to disaster, and the reason he didn't adopt a framework\n(babycare) which is revolutionary to him is because he simply didn't\nhave any theories or intellectual framework to understand it with. He\nnever saw it done, he didn't participate in it, he didn't read any\nbooks on it, and he didn't attend any classes.\n\nAs an SF type he should be supportive and helpful ... when he knows\nwhat to do. Expect him to flounder when he doesn't. You need to\nsupervise and micromnaage him, and clearly articulate standards, and\nnot expect much initiative until he's got a solid grasp on a subject.\nSFs like solidity. Don't ever expect him to read your mind and don't\never expect him to smoothly grasp an entirely new situation.
5	This isn't an ESFP thing this is a "i had a child WITH a baby" thing. I don't think ay one here would be qualified to help you, you guys might want to go to couples counseling. 
1	I have just been telling him what to do lately and that somehow is working he just does what I say. I even have his mind set on going to school. lol
1	I'm and Infj with a ESFP. You really have to be independent and stand on your own two feet. I don't have any children with him, but basically they want you to accept them for who they are, not what you would like them to be. And allow them to have their faults. You really have to know yourself, and be self-reliant and he has to be able to do the same. They don't like nagging, bitching, complaining, and want a peaceful environment. They like time to themselves, but also like being with friends at time. They don't like being pushed into anything. So, basically what you need to do is be strong enough to do things on your own, and ask other people to help you. Be straight and honest about your feelings. Don't play mind games. Don't lie. If they feel you're not being honest and direct they pull away. And you'll have a heck of a time getting on their good side if you betray them. You really have to have a gentle spirit with them, and be a man whisperer. Know his language and accept his differences. We hardly ever fight, because I understand where i begin and where he ends. You treat him like a king, he'll do anything for you. It sounds like you're just not approaching him the right way. You have to be very positive and loving towards him. Focus on the good in him, compliment him, tell him how much you appreciate him etc. When you respect him as a man, he will do the same in return.
1	He told me, a few days ago, that there is an event in his game and he wont be doing much for the next week. I wish I could say "hey, I'm gonna sit around on my ass and ignore you and the baby for 7 days. I will go and come as I please and spend what I want and leave everything up to you. See ya next week! \n\nHe did this to me once and I had no idea what was going on. All I see is him not doing anything and not engaging with me or her. And it broke me bc I was going through some stressful family stuff and needed to tell him what happened. He didn't bother to give me any feedback other than "That sucks." I am always game for whatever it is he wants to do. Bc I wanna understand him better. As an INFJ I cant help but to give all of me to the people I love. And is it so wrong to want that in return? I have things I need to do. I cant do them if I have no help. \n\nI want to become a writer, I dont see myelf getting the time to sit and write. He thinks I do too much. And I agreed with him, I do take on too much only because he lacks initiative. i dont believe in having to make decisions for him. Then he went on to say that he just lets her play alone and he is able to do the things he wants. And that it seems like i'm always doing something with her. I suppose he means ike going to the park and spending a day (not just 15 minutes), reading to her, making sure she has a set schedule and a bedtime. He rather her just fall asleep on the floor when she gets tired. He has no organizational skills. And doesnt seem to be interested in learning fromm me like I am learning from him. I dont see how letting our kid do whatever she wanted, waiting until she is crying bloody murder before giving her food, or putting her to sleep. He just waits until she cries. And I should let him do it? I shouldnt have to say hey you shouldnt do that, its unhealthy for her. He admits to not knowing anything about childern....and I do! why cant i give you advice. If you are doing something the wrong way when there is a better way. why wouldnt i pass along this info. And I am suppose to let it go and let him do his thing? He has no thing! Winging it with a newborn is not a thing!\n\nHe gets so angry when I bring anything up. We once could talk about anything that bothered the other person. and we listened to each other. now he wants to close up shop. I can easily count my losses and move on. But I'm not doing that this time I wanna know what is going on in his head. He thinks that he is just a guy and doesnt realize anything about his personality type. And doesnt care to understand mine.\n \nA few days ago I had to take a drug test at a clinic for a job I wanted. And was nervous not to fuck it up since I had 48 hours and a crap ton of errands and a doctor's appt to get to the next day. So I woke him up (he always passes put too early) and asked him where exactly the place was and how do drug tests work. I have never taken one before so I was worried. He kinda snapped at me bc he thought I was being mean to him! I didnt understand it. I told him i'm just really nervous about the process. \nI'm the kinda person who is always concerned about looking dishonest and wanted to get it done as soon as I could In the middle of an already busy day. The next morning I started to apologize. Told him that I didnt mean to sound rude I was just trying to get my plans lined up and make sure I could squeeze it in. He cut me off and in an aggressive way told me to forget it and that he didn't want to hear it. I didn't understand that either. \n\nWhen I told him today that we need to start communicating better started a whole new mess of crap. And we cant outright fight because we both get so closed off. I am 28 in three days. I have no more time to waste when it comes to the career and life I want. I want to develop. I am trying to tap into my genius. I know what I need to do to be successful. I want to have a peace of mind and not have to worry so much. I hate that I have to rely on another person for help. I am learning to voice my concerns even though it's being met with lack of interest. I just want us to get along. I hope that made sense for any of you. What do you think? how should I approach this situation? (sorry for the typos. i don't think I'm going to edit any of this. I'm mentally exhausted now)
-2	Have you considered you might just be an ESFP in the grip of inferior Ni? Because this sounds a lot like some problems I've been having. On another note you should watch Southpaw.
4	What was high school like for you?	
2	Awful. Lots of bullying and I developed an eating disorder because I had so many feelings and didn't know how to properly express them in a healthy way. But I've learned so much since then :)
1	[deleted]
1	i studied in 4 different high schools (long story) and loved all of them except one (only went there for 2 weeks so no fond memories, don't hate it but don't love it). All the others were great. I was known as the captain of the school cricket team in one, super nerd math whiz in another (that was the American high school), and a shy introverted geek in the third (school was full of morons, I kept to myself and had 1 friend only). I enjoyed all three for different reasons but my favorite was MEIS where I got to be captain of school team and got rep as a cool friendly guy who knew everybody, those were some of the best days of my life.
1	Great! I had a great time and a few close friends I loved to be around. 
1	In high school ATM. xSFP. \nI am fond of saying controversial things, and often I say bizarre things out loud without realizing I'm talking.\nThat being said, no one hates me or anything. I don't have one fixed group of friends, I just talk to everyone, yet I make zero efforts to communicate with anyone outside of school hours. 
1	I'm in High school right now (16). It is Ok could be better. I am very tenacious out going and genuinely nice. I have a lot of friends, then there's my best friends which is 6 people. I am pretty smart,some people assume I'm dumb because I act goofy and dumb with my friends. My teachers love me because I'm always participating and am doing well and am not dumb. I also get told that I am unique and eccentric which I agree with. I either get along with people perfectly or I clash with people like an explosion. When I do it's really intense and cringey.
1	Unpopular but only because I was *too cool for school*. Hung out with all the rebellious "badasses" who ditched and smoked weed. Lost touch with basically everyone save for Facebook. But damned if I wasn't super hot. Now I'm trying to get back into high school shape.
1	Full of drama
1	[deleted]
1	I was chill. High most of the time and just there to be happy have a good time and learn some shit. The teachers liked me. I am an ESFP who learned to chill in the background and not get in trouble for stupid shit. Which allowed me to do what I wanted. 
1	Male here. I was student body president every year in HS. I was highly involved in just about everything. I was a football player and a member of student council. I played/singed in every talent show and competed for prom king every year as well. 
11	Stealing from /r/INTP. What do your personalities look like?!	Came across this neat website today: www.talentoday.com.\nComplete the 10 minute test and a "personality radar" with 5 clusters will be generated according to your answers. The clusters are: Communicate, Manage, Dare, Adapt, Excel. They cover the main personality traits that employers seek in individuals. They say it's how you describe yourself.\nAt the end, there's a part that summarizes your strengths and weaknesses in career professional lingo. I will probably add this to my resume or LinkedIn profile.\nThought some of you may be interested. Share your results if you like. It's free too!\n\nI'll start, here's mine: http://i.imgur.com/xfQRN2T.png
4	This was really cool, and a nifty little site to boot.\nhttp://imgur.com/rUGf4Ng
3	http://i.imgur.com/sztSiKM.jpg\n\nSomething that really surprised me was one of my improvement areas: *You would benefit from distancing yourself from the opinions of others to develop your own ideas.*\n\nI think this stems from the fact that I'm early into my career and am still absorbing best practices from my peers.
5	Bookmarking for later\n\nedit: damn this is gonna take forever
2	Thanks so much for sharing this. I took this test last year and just retook it! Here is my personality: http://i.imgur.com/J3WaNFA.png
2	I need to remember to take this later. They have an iOS application by the way - probably a bit easier 
1	[Too many false dichotomies but wouldn't really disagree too much with any of it.](http://i.imgur.com/h1CdnJb.png)
1	Weird questions, but [the results](http://i.imgur.com/Z445g6i.png) seem realistic enough.
1	What have you been up to this summer?	
2	ESFPs would be too busy to not reply to this thread.
1	Middle/late 20s here. My summer has been mostly work. \n\nI'm captain of a softball team that plays once a week.\n\nMy weekends are always busy and mostly very fun. My ENFP fiance makes sure of it.\n
1	Mainly working, helping friends move, and doing lots of yard work...
1	skateboarding and reading up on fashion
1	Heeey-o. Graduated from college in May, started grad school online and moved to Costa Rica this past August. It's been a crazy ride!
1	What color aura do you feel most associates with ESFP?	I would think it is orange but I'm curious to what y'all think and why.
2	I want to say green because it's my favorite color but probably red since it's vibrant
1	I immediately thought of red.\n\nEdit: forgot to explain why. Because I think it's a lively color that symbolizes passion :)
1	yellow!\n\nedit: I don't know, I associate ENFP with yellow too, it's the smiley face colour.
1	Mine is orange but I swear I've seen it pink. 
1	I dated an ESFP and she was wonderful and full of energy.  Definitely a cheery yellow.
1	WTF is that sorcery !! we don't get colored ,we coloring the colors of ESFP
1	It is orange. I have a book on it and all xSFx types are orange. Mine personally is orange-red.
0	Any Asian ESFP's here?	<--Male ENFP.\n\nI just started dating a very nice girl (Japanese born and raised) who is an ESFP and I'm just curious what parts of her attitudes and actions might be more ESPF or more culturally Japanese?\n\nAny thoughts, insight, ideas will be greatly appreciated.\nI really like her so I want to be me but at the same time understand her without offending her.\n\nthanks
5	Ehhhhh, tbh I'd just treat her as any other person instead of a conceptualized mishmash of characteristics resulting from her MBTI type and culture. MBTI only really describes personal tendencies and trends, and isn't an end all be all script for someone's life. \n\nBut yes. To answer your question, Asian ESFP here. 
2	My twin and I are opposite	This sub needs more posts so I'll throw my hand in. I just wanted to share that my twin is an INTJ.  As an ESFP, there were many interesting encounters growing up.  He was always very focused on school and I was immersed in different extra-circular activities namely music.  While I dabbled in science (bio) and he dabbled in arts (violin) we finally managed to have some overlapping interests.  We recently have found areas of similar interest and are talking on a regular basis.  He even has opened up to me a little bit, and is less reserved around me!\nAnyone else have similar expereinces?
1	I would feel very bad for my twin if we were opposites :( glad things are looking up 
1	Yes! Omg I can't believe someone else has the same situation!\n\nMy little brother is 4 years younger than me, and he's introverted and quiet and reserved, while I'm a total ESFP. I imagine he'd be an INTJ if he took the test. It's been the cause of some strain in our relationship, but it's gotten a lot better now that we've realized how different our personalities are, and how to work around that.
1	An inverted post like this was over on /r/INTJ. This can only lead to speculation.
1	I know twin girls, one who is an ESFP and the other is an ISFJ. But I've never seen complete opposites. I've met triplet guys who were all intj's tho hah
1	my identical twin and i are both esfp but despite that, she has mental problems and i don't so you could say we're opposites in ways. but no that many ways. 
3	What's something that just worked out for you?	A lot of times, we go with the flow, and stuff just works out for us.
3	Moved my daughter and girlfriend 3000 miles to the west coast, didn't have a place to live, no job, and my car hadn't sold. we got a place to live and sold my car in the 2 days before we left, found a job 2 weeks after that. Things absolutely could've gone horribly had I not found work, but if things are meant to happen they'll happen, and that's why we're on our feet and doing ok right now.
1	Applied for a school that looked cool.  There I met a girl, majored in music, getting a performance job out of college and will be financially independent.  
1	When I was in college, my mother called me up one day and told me she will not be able to send me money for groceries. So after my first class (some time mid-morning) the same day, I got on my bicycle and rode it to the nearest Target, applied for a job, and asked to speak with the person that does the hiring. I got a position the follow week (I didn't care where b/c I needed income badly but I didn't tell them that). I had some, and still do, good friends that let me mooch off them until my first pay check.
1	I didn't put very much effort into the job search my senior year of college, only went on one interview and got woken up hungover as shit on graduation day with a job offer. Almost 4 years later I'm still with the same company and have had quite a few promotions.
-1	One time I was just sitting in a shopping center and someone offered me a job. Another time I just walked into a bar and got offered a job on the spot. I have good luck with getting jobs. And apartments. I always manage to find one right before I get kicked out of the other one.
2	Conflict, confrontation, and moving on.	Hi ESFPs,\n\nSo I apparently scared away one of your type by sending a very needy text and I'd like to know how you guys can get over people so easily. The ease with which he was able to stop talking to me is frightening to me and its making me think there HAS to have been something else I did that I missed, or maybe something he didn't like that he wouldn't tell me about (b/c I confronted him about the matter). I waved hello for a long ass time tonight, and it was like I was invisible, not even a look in my direction. I've never felt so ignored in my life. \n\nPlease enlighten me as to what I may have missed in our short "relationship".\n\nThanks in advance y'all.\n\n-22/F/ENFP\n\nP.S. I'm not as upset about the loss of the potential "us" as I am about being completely ignored and invisible to him.
4	I don't get over people easily but let's be clear, this is only for people I deeply care about and/or people who I feel I wronged in some way. For the ones I deeply care about, I never get over - ever - until a reconnection is established and then I can rest in peace. For the wronged ones, once I correct the wrong in some way, I'm able to get over fairly easily since there's no reason to hold on. There have been times in my life when I've let go of someone without any trouble whatsoever because I was never into them beyond physical attraction. With such people, I will enjoy their company and spend time with them as long as I know they don't have feelings for me. The moment I do know, I will express my thoughts and feelings in a VERY clear manner so they know not to pursue their feelings. 9 times out of 10, they are unable to control their feelings and I go away because I don't want to keep them from being happy. I'm not going to keep you around for my physical pleasure knowing I'm preventing you from pursuing other, more meaningful, relationships where you may find what you're looking for. Sorry to break it to ya but I think that is the case with your lover boy here.
3	we burn bridges easily... it's in our nature. it's something I detest about my type however each type has its corks! you could try to rekindle it but his brain is thinking "well that didn't work out, so fuck it". good luck!
2	Even with people I care about, I can go some time without even thinking about them. It's usually because I'm preoccupied with something. If it's not a strong relationship, I can see myself being able to fade it out pretty quickly. I don't think I'd do that since it's happened to me, and I know it sucks. My emotions are pretty rigid, so it takes a lot to get me to consider someone to be a good friend instead of a regular friend.

1	>I'd like to know how you guys can get over people so easily.  \n  \nDepends. What did you do?
-1	We live in the moment. Personally I have a one strike rule for that kind of stuff because it's an indication this person is gonna suck the life right out of me. ESFP and ENFP are not good together at all.
4	parenting and ESFP kid who lies (a lot; for little/no reason)	Hi all,\n\nWe have 3 kids, and our darling, gregarious ESFP girl is causing us some consternation. She's 14 and she lies (a lot; always has). The problem is that we can't figure out how to parent this effectively. We are pretty permissive parents who try to engage the kids and get them on board with decisions like chores and rules, and it works beautifully with the other two, who want to be honest, and will tell us "Hey, I don't think I did enough chores today to get my allowance. Is there anything I can do?" \n\nNot our ESFP, though. She lies and we know she's lying and it creates this uncomfortable situation. "I know you didn't do that, but now you said you did and I'm staring you in the face, dumbfounded." If confronted, she will cry and claim persecution "You never believe me!" \n\nShe lies to make her stories sound better (it usually works -- she's charming and funny). She lies to get out of things. She lies to get into things. It's just a tactic that works for her. The problem is ... my husband and I both really value authenticity and it's straining our relationship with her. We don't believe much of anything she says. Every anecdote is suspect, and the intimacy is suffering bc of that. \n\nThe question is ... what would appeal to an ESFP to encourage honesty? She's not idealistic, so that approach doesn't seem to work. Does she need to know what it means to us? Does she need to get punished harshly for lying (I would think that would just make her lie more)? Help, please? I'm INTP, by the way. Thank you!
5	Oh boy...I remember going through that. I had the same thing going for me, and I think getting caught was really what got me to really stop. You have to set the rule up and enforce it. I know you can't say no to those puppy dog eyes and innocent act, but you have to. Trust is very, very important so assume that she's telling the truth otherwise she'll say you never believe her like she does now. Give her the benefit of the doubt initially. When she gets caught (because she will), you HAVE TO enforce it. If you're going to ground her, don't back down half way through. Don't take any of her shit with emotional blackmail and making you feel guilty. She will grow out of it, but you have to show her that rules apply to her as well. What we learn early on is that rules are for suckas, and we're no suckas. She won't go for the "we're disappointed in you" or "you're better than that" bit. We don't care as much about what you think because we have strong opinions of ourselves to begin with. We like clear cut things. If we lie, you're in trouble, and that's final. No talking your way out of it.
3	RULES RULES RULES. You have to make lying not worth it anymore. Make the consequences ridiculous and it won't be worth it. Hope this helps. 
3	As an ESFP they are naturally good at knowing right from wrong. So once they find lying no longer worth it, hopefully they see honesty WILL be worth it. ESFPS like to learn a system and then ride it so if you make honesty the next best thing they should gravitate towards it. 
3	As an ESFP, growing up I remember going through that stage and growing out of it.  Firm boundaries are key.  I would lie about stupid things and get away with it.  This in turn let me lie about more serious matters.  I was around 9 when I realized how stupid lies were.  Maturity is a key part of growing out of it.  If we lie, we'll just go with the "flow" which consists of keeping lying.  Establish firm boundaries early on if you want to weed that habit out.  It really becomes second nature if you don't.  
2	as an ESFP my parents raised me to be honest and truthful... the Fi function supports that. She is in a developmental stage and it seems that she has a strong grasp on her Se which allows her to lie often. With more growth she will develop the other functions that make us ESFPs truthful beings to our loved ones. I would suggest more consequences... my parents did that with me and it allowed me to develop my other functions.. just know that our Se dominant allows us to create anything up on the spot.. 
1	I am an ESFP and I also have ADHD. I lied all the time growing up for absolutely no reason. The entertainer in me wanted top make things larger than life and the lack of impulse control and hyperactivity didn't give me a chance to think through the consequences. It wouldn't surprise me if there was a link between the ESFP personality type and ADHD. If she shows any other signs of ADHD, it might be worth checking into.
1	What's some fun/exciting stuff you've done recently?	I turned 21 a few months ago, but I only had the bar experience last week. I got to the place and felt so at ease with the loud music and drunk people around me. 
2	Just come to the ENFP sub we're way more active and have more fun! 
2	Just graduated High school in small town Arkansas. Did some neat shit there:\n I sang in Carnegie Hall in NYC with choir. Also about to act in the International Thespian Festival with my troupe. Grew up with some amazingly talented kids with nothing else to do but succeed.
1	I turned a few panties and some bungee cords into a slingshot. I'm quite pleased with this, as this device is capable of launching and/or exploding large fruits. Seriously, it's an amazing feeling to make one watermelon explode by hitting it with another watermelon. 
1	This thread has brought to my attention that I have done nothing fun or exciting recently at all. But hey who knows what the future holds am I right?
0	Went to a Lil Wayne concert with someone associated with the illuminati. We kept wondering if we were gonna be taken backstage. It was weird to say the least. But cool. But the beer was not good.
3	What do you ESFPs look like?	I saw ENTP do the same so i thought it'd be cool to see what all you guys look like? :P

2	Any of you feel self-conscious or are you like a rock?	
3	When I started going out a lot more i started to get more out of my shell and started to not really care about what people say or think.
2	I've always felt self-conscious. Then I remember that I'm weird, and if people are going to talk about me (or my paranoia says they do) then I might as well give them something good to talk about.\n\n-*continues to dance to beat while unloading packages at work*-
2	I use to be. As an ESFP we are the trend setters though!\nJust remember we can easily make what we do look cool. You do you, and somebody will like it and follow. 
1	I have really bad self esteem issues. I am starting to work on them more productively than in the past but they seem to always hold me back in almost everything I do
0	Anyone got any wacky stories!?	Just curious to see what all you crazy people are like!
3	I've got some wacky stories, but it depends on what you wanna hear!
2	I blacked out once and on my way home my friends and I saw a couple gangs engaged in some heated conversation. After we passed them my friends kept walking and I stopped to talk to them. I don't remember what I said but my friends told me that after I was done talking to them they were all hugging and giving each other knucks. Mission accomplished 
1	Showered with a hairy hippy lesbian in the Fountain at Bonnaroo. Good times. 
1	Played some monopoly with my baby cousin. After three hours I noticed my hotel over Regent Street had mysteriously dissapeared. Turns out she had eaten it and died shortly after.
7	This Page is Too Inactive.	The reason no one really posts on this page is because all the ESFP'S are out doing crazy shit. Am I right?
3	Pretty much. I get on here probably once every night and look at the new posts, but I usually don't post myself. \n\nEdit: Still an awesome subreddit! I enjoy chatting with my other esfp's. 
3	I've heard that theory a lot, but I don't agree with it. I think ESFPs would end up with spare time like others, and it makes sense for us to want to communect with people online. I think the reason is more so that discussing Myers -Briggs testing requires a certain level of abstract analysis, which is not our favourite thing.\n\nI do really enjoy discussing things in depth. I am from a science background, its not that I think we are bad at all analysis or abstract thought... but something about dissecting personalities in such a structured way doesn't fully engage me. I enjoy it, but not nearly on the same level as my INTJ husband. 
1	I am typed 50/50 for esfp and isfp. I think i usually identify more with ESFP and I always hope this sub gets more active but it isn't usually, I try to talk when I can.
1	How do you tell an ESFP you need some time alone without them taking it personally?	Let's get something straight: ESFPs are awesome, but the rest of us need to recharge alone from time to time, hence my question: What's the best way to tell ESFPs that you need some time alone?
3	I honestly would say tell that person the first sentence of your post before the actual question. It's short and to the point, but it's not rude or "in your face". 
2	I told my friend that the time doesn't change the way I feel about him, whether that is 3 weeks, 3 months, or even 3 years is irrelevant.
1	As an ESFP personally I understand when people need alone time. Grew up with an INFP older brother. \nTo the more rambunctious ESFP's, they have introverted feeling, just tell them you need some time to process your thoughts and emotions. 
3	How do you cope with not having any energy?	
6	Its weird sometimes when I'm depressed I seclude myself from others even though being around people is what gives me life. To be honest i have to be forced to be with people to get energy, or I ride it out until the episode is over and am back to my energetic self
2	In general or at specific times?
2	At points of low energy in life, I take it as a sign to recharge. Give myself some introverted time. Yes even as an ESFP I still respect and enjoy some well needed alone time. To the other esfp's out there, get outside, and appreciate some sunlight. Go on a trip by yourself. Get out in the world by yourself for a little while and just do you. Hope this is encouraging!
2	This sub is too inactive!	Hey motherfuckers, I'm an ENFP that tested EXFP for a while and I'm pissed that you guys aren't being the cool people you are and talking about how cool you are. Tell the world about yourself, we want to know! Or about why you're happy today! Or why you're not! And then have people make you happy because that's how people work! Exclamation points!!!!!\n\nSrs tho let's hear it
7	I think it's because we're all out doing fun shit. 🔥
6	3 upvotes and no one being attention whores?!? What? Have we lost our edges or something??? I'd love to stay and chat, but I'm too busy being a cool guy. I'm smooth as I Can't Believe It's Not Butter, and I've got enough muscles to impress some of you. That's right! I'm average on the outside and extraordinarily decent on the inside. I like long walks on the beach and other people knitting. Hello, elderly ladies and craft lovers. Need a hand with that missed stitch? I have to go now and play sports.
1	ENTJ Relationship With ESFP	I've (22M) been super close with an ex girlfriend (21F) who's an ESFP. Her and I have a ton of history. The issue is that in the process of being in a relationship before, I hurt her. My more aggressive nature tends to take over and I made some mistakes which now led to her and I being exs. That was 2 years ago now. I adore her, I love taking care of her and we've been close and talking about dating.  She used to adore me too, she still does but she's apprehensive. Now another guy has started to get in the middle and she's been pulling away needing her space to think over her life and family drama. I admit I've gotten lazy with her and I.\n       I also have to admit I don't take the space and lack of communication well. I'm concerned about losing her again and I'm looking for the best way to approach this with her. She's been super distant and that's really hurt me. I'm hoping you guys can provide some insight on where to go from here. I'm hopefully going to see her soon. But every time we plan to meet she's been flaky. I want to ride this out with her but I'd like some insight from the other side of things. She doesn't deal with conflict well which i get and I've always been understanding of, but my instinct tends to go that way when I feel things go wrong. I'm a fixer so when u face an issue I try to dive in. \n      Any suggestions on how I should approach this with her?? I've thought over this for a while and I think I know what I want to say but any more information would be greatly appreciated :-)

2	What can I do? This sounds like fun!
0	Q&A: ESFP's	I personally am an esfp and have studied personality types for quite some time now. Ask away, about esfp's or other types. 
1	What do you do that stimulates your Se? How would you explain Si to someone who doesn't know MBTI?
1	How do you feel about INTJ's, your "dual" (according to Socionics)
1	1. With Ni being your Inferior function, what role would you say it plays in your life and how conscious of it are you?\n2. How do you feel around people less focused on stimulation than you, and how do you work your needed stimulation in without alienating them?\n3. You mentioned earlier, "everything [ESFPs] do is stimulating." How do you coerce yourself into activities that are distinctly less stimulating, such as studying about psychological types?
1	Anyone have any experience parenting an ESFP?	My daughter (7) is an ESFP. I'm an ISFJ and I fund it really hard to relate to her and she drives me crazy!
2	**Some Characteristics of the ESFP Child-Some Behaviors to Look For**\n\n* As mentioned about…they are laughing, cuddly, moving a lot, alert, really loving babies\n* The see to enjoy just being close to\n* They are by nature friendly, outgoing and social\n* Easily adaptable\n* Love the outdoors and being with friends\n* These are young extraverts…they can get very excited…normally that will be having fun with others\n* They can get carried away in their excitement\n* Impulsive young ones\n* They like to touch a lot of things\n* The ESFP child…at any age…typically wants things right now\n* They normally enjoy school\n* Many ESFP children are drawn to art\n* Very generous children\n* They are at times mis-diagnosed with “ADD”. They go form thing to thing, touching everything…this is natural for them\n* They typically have difficulty with staying on task, schedules…they learn to adapt, don’t worry\n* These children (people) truly live for the moment!\n\n**Regardless of Your Type Mom and Dad-Here Are Some Things You Can Do to Nurture the ESFP Child and Improve Parenting Skill.**\n\n* Don’t stifle their energy…let them SAFELY get it out\n* They will talk a lot…channel it, let it be…..chatty little ones\n* You can’t stop them from “touching things” so teach them how to touch things\n* Do NOT jump to the “ADD” conclusion…so much damage is mistakenly done with this type in this area…study them with “ESFP” in mind BEFORE you seek “clinical” advice\n* Support their emotions…well “feeling” actually, it is strong in them\n* Reward them with things that can be touched\n* Let yourself hug them, kiss them, touch them…ESFP children thrive on it….some others don’t you know\n* They love surprises….surprise them\n* How many time can you tell the ESFP child (person) you love them….as much as possible!\n* Be real, specific, but loving in your discipline of them\n* If you are not a “spontaneous” person and want to be…allow your ESFP youngster to show you!

0	Help Dealing With ESFP Mother	Hi guys. ENTP here and was wondering if you could give me a hand at understanding my ESFP mother a bit better.\n\nI am currently studying for exams and am INCREDIBLY busy. I am going to school, studying, eating and sleeping. That is all i do and have done for the past month. Other than the occasional outing with friends to break the cycle. It needs to be done and there is no getting around it. \n\nMy mother does not approve. She is complaining that i don't give her any attention and that she feels i only spend time with my friends and give her no time. So i decide that i was going to meet my friends on saturday night and i will blow them off and go see mum. All is fine until saturday afternoon when she calls me and says she can't do tonight but she can do tomorrow (sunday). No problem. I will study tonight and see her tomorrow. Skip forward to sunday evening and i go round to her house. She is very happy to see me and i am too. Its not like she gets lonely she has lots of friends but i could tell she was looking forward to seeing me. I was too to a certain extent.\n\nWe sit down for the dinner she had made and i thought it was nice and then she says this. "so how is it so easy for you to just take the night off when it suits you, thats two nights you have had off in a row and you don't come and see me for a whole month?". I begin to explain that i had not taken last night off. She does not believe me. I say that if she wants me to come over more often maybe she should stop throwing accusations at me which are not true. Blah blah blah. She loses her shit.\n\nStarts saying that she feels like I don't even love her. That I don't come over nearly enough and that she is missing her boy. I then explain again that i can't i am studying. She gets herself in even more of a nose dive and then says that my sister sees her nearly everyday and that i should try and be more like her. I tell her that my sister is not in law school but doing a hair and beauty course that does not have even close to the same level of work. Once again she says i am just making up excuses. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't make the journey to see my mum even if it is just for a quick visit as it is a 20 min train journey and i don't have a car. I don't have enough time at the moment to see her and she refuses to accept that i am trying my best. She keeps comparing me to my sister who is not going to be the one i can guarantee who will be paying for her care home when she is too old to live on her own. Fucking hell it's just pissing me off.
3	I don't know if this is an esfp thing, it just sounds like really childish behavior. Would a skype or phone call that happens once a week not suffice? Or maybe after finals are over and yoi have an entire summer off? You should remind her that you have a life outside of her by now. If she flips put over that you'll know there's a bigger issue.
0	How do I stop my ESFP mother from annoying me with little things constantly?	I am an ENFP in need of independence and space. These things help me grow. My mother is always well-meaning, but she will always annoy me with the littlest questions that have obvious answers. \n\nAn example: It is 11:00 pm on Friday. I am sleeping soundly. My mother comes to wake me up asking if I need her to drive me anywhere tomorrow, knowing that my car is in the shop (major engine repair). She means well. She genuinely cares about me, but it always comes at the worst times. I do not react well to this, because if I were in her position it wouldn't be something I would wake someone up for. Tomorrow is Saturday- not an important day for transportation. Not a school day. I tell her that she needs to give me space when I'm sleeping (admittedly in an upset tone). She doesn't hear my message at all and says that that is not how you speak to your parent. \n\nWhy does she seem so compelled to come wake me up from my sleep to ask me questions that have obvious answers? \n\nThis happens quite often. I would often be in my room, studying with the intense focus of a thousand lasers. All of the sudden, she comes in and asks me to drop everything and immediately go help her take the groceries from her car to the kitchen. She never understands that I need space, and she takes my reactions personally as if I don't appreciate her. I can't always be ready to help her do these small tasks at a moment's notice. \n\nMy father, an INTJ, always knows when I need space. I tell him in a calm voice, "Can you give me some space, I'm working hard right now." He'll usually respond with, "Ok come out when you have time" or "I need your help with something in half an hour." And that's that. He backs off, gives me space, and I go help him when I'm able to. \n\nAnyway, how can I better communicate with my mother? I know she means well, but these constant pokes and prods are incredibly annoying to deal with. \n\nThank you for any insight you may provide. I really appreciate it. 
3	I don't think I would be annoyed by what she does. I understand it can get bothersome, but it's not a big deal. To explain without going into MBTI, she wants to take care of things when she thinks of it before she forgets because she will forget. You can be frank with her and have a talk. I don't like it when people are passive. 
1	have fun with the answers, let her know your annoyed. shell probably stop
0	How do you perform as an ESFP?	Hey guys, it's been a long journey for me. Making it short I'm an ESFP who experienced a trauma right before entering my teens which caused me to retreat from the world and live in denial about a lot of things for 5 years. Ever since my trauma, nothing has felt the same again and after "coming out of hiding" last year I was overwhelmed at how different myself and the world was. 5 years of hiding can really do you in and I found myself living in the body of anxious adult and experiencing an incredibly confusing, deep, painful and emotionally draining personality crisis. Fortunately, I discovered Myer Briggs which helped me a lot and was able to surround myself with several of great people who took me in despite my anxiety, etc. Fortunately, my body has loosened up over this last year and things are getting much better but my heart still craves to become whole again...to reunite with the cheerful, uninhibited and fun-loving person who I grew up as except now as an adult. I love performing and entertaining the people around me but now I don't know how my performing would look like as a 20 year old...I don't know how  my younger self would have developed into an adult if it weren't for that trauma. I need to get my performing identity back..back when I as younger I had a feel for the world and I had a grasp over my ability to perform (what would work and what wouldn't). Right now, I don't have that performing identity . I'm afraid to perform and make mistakes since I'm older now, I'm afraid of making a fool out of myself/being misunderstood, I'm afraid of forcing things and not seeming natural. I look back at my younger self a lot and remember how he performed but I can't bring that person out anymore (completely) because I'm an adult now so yeah my performing would be different. Guys, I miss feeling happy, calm and letting my spontaneity naturally run loose. An uncle of mine who I run to for help tells me that since I'm an adult now..things are going to be different and that I can perform now by being a good conversationalist and letting witty comments fly when the occasion pops up but I know that isn't the whole story. I still don't feel "free" and I find that I'm still conservative socially. My younger self was more over the top, outrageous, energetic and I want to bring that side of me out again. So my question guys is..how do you perform and liven things up as an ESFP? Thanks guys!
3	You're uncle's right about socializing, but before it really helps you perform, it sounds like you have some other things to work out. I went through something similar, and I recently became an outgoing, "performer" type. You need self-confidence to really get you there, and children are teeming with that stuff. You'll be a grown up version of that energetic person in no time. 
2	Helping an unhealthy ESFP	Hi everybody, I'm a male INFJ trying to help a really unhealthy female ESFP to grow as a person. I'm 25, she's probably in her thirties. I'm not interested in her in any kind of way except for wanting to help reach a better quality of life. I know I'm not a therapist, I know I can't work miracles. I know that I simply might fail. But at the moment, I don't care. I want to help her. And I already did, by giving her a couple of books of self help to read, which she enjoyed and it improved her quality of life.\n\nShe has plenty of problems.\n* Too forceful.\n\n* Too insistent.\n\n* Speaks with the flow, really fast.\n\n* Doesn't ever stop and listen to what others are saying.\n\n* Has little to no self control.\n\n* She's extremely gullible. Like, really gullible.\n\n* Remembers things badly and never doubts her memory, to the extent or putting up conflicts until disproven.\n\n* Doesn't trust other people's judgment. Thinks always negatively of other people's motives.\n\n* Unable to put herself on other's shoes to the least extent.\n\n* Unable to see the other's perspective unless shown.\n\n* Criticizing continuosly while being unable to think out of the box.\n\n* Acts childishly more in general.\n\n* And much more, making her come across as stupid to other people.\n\nPeople are scared and annoyed of her. She has little to no friend, except for virtual friends like me and a couple of others (because we're really, really patient with her). While she does come across as stupid, I don't want to believe she is beyond salvation or that she's inherently stupid and she can't change that. I think she can be just as other people. She really suffers from this state. She feels unlikable and useless.\nI've felt this way before, even if for different reasons, but I can really relate. I've been a reject of society before, I almost no friends, and had to grow. My only friend helped me, I've made mistakes, but eventually survived this and became much more balanced. She's far from balance, but I really want her to achieve something. All I know is that if I don't help her, she's doomed to a life of loneliness (which expecially for an extrovert seems like hell) and being completely dependant on her parents. She's been on therapy, I don't know if she already is, but I guess that didn't work too well.\n\nAt the moment I'm working on making her solve a problem of her personality gradually, by making her mindful of her mistakes. I'm making her write a couple of problems, and try to improve a single aspect of her personality at a time (like self control) for at least a week. Ex: We're starting with self control, for now.\n\nAnyway, this is the first ESFP I know, and I don't know any other at the moment. Do any of you have some suggestions to allow her to improve? Any story with similar problems? Things I should avoid to tell her to hurt her feelings? Obvious pitfalls I might fall into by not knowing how to handle Fi users?\n\nThank you very much in advance.

1	INFJ in need of advice	Hello there!\nBrace yourselves, it's going to be a long post/rant.\n\nI'm a 31yo INFJ, female, and I need advice about how to deal with my mother in law. I know, cliché, right? :)\n\nI have been married 6 years now and I'm very happy with my husband. However, things aren't always easy when it comes to my relationship with my MIL. It doesn't help either that we live very close to my husband's family and really far away from mine (so far, and tickets are so expensive, that it's been 3 years since I've been with my family). So this kind of intensifies the problems for me because I can't go and have some "my family" time when my in-laws stress me out.\n\nMy MIL has never taken the test but I'm pretty sure she types as ESFP. But the worse thing is that I believe she also suffers from Histrionic Personality Disorder. Now I'm no Psychologist, but she has many of the symptoms, the only one obviously missing being the seductive behaviour. She does however fit this to a T (from Wikipedia):\n\nThe World Health Organization's ICD-10 lists histrionic personality disorder as:\nA personality disorder characterized by:\n-shallow and labile affectivity,\n-self-dramatization,\n-theatricality,\n-exaggerated expression of emotions,\n-suggestibility,\n-egocentricity,\n-self-indulgence,\n-lack of consideration for others,\n-easily hurt feelings, and\n-continuous seeking for appreciation, excitement and attention.\n\nEven if she doesn't really have HPD, that list above pretty much sums up her behaviour. I know a lot of the things she does are with good intentions. She cares about her family. My problem is that, even after more than 10 years knowing me, she doesn't really *know* me. She has picked up a few hints about the kind of thing I don't like along the way, and I'm grateful for that. \n\nBut still she pursues me - I could even say sometimes I feel like she *stalks* me. For instance, like a good INFJ (or an introvert for that matter) I hate talking on the phone, and she knows that. But she will call me many times, even after my husband tells her to send me an e-mail or a message on Facebook (ah, Facebook, another one of our battlefields lol), and when afterwards we meet in a family gathering, she will put me under the spotlight and ask me really loudly and in front of everyone why didn't I answer when she called. And then I look like the evil daughter-in-law, because everyone just loves her (except for her two daughter-in-laws so I know I'm not crazy or a bitch). She will make a point of saying that she really only wants to help, to be my friend, what's the problem in calling me?\n\nWhen she does something that annoys me, I try to hide my feelings so not to create an awkward situation but I don't always succeed. So what I do is I try to discreetly avoid her. That's when she senses I'm kinda mad at her and then she comes right up to my face and starts noticing everything that I'm wearing and saying "what a nice blouse you're wearing", "what a beautiful necklace!" (as if it was new, even though she's seen me wearing it it tens of time and even complimented it before), or she will show me something she bought and ask my opinion about it. And I can see in her face that she doesn't really want my opinion but to assess if I'm ok with her. I wish she would just apologize for whatever it is she did wrong, and leave me alone for a while instead of coming on so strong. Once I actually hid in the bathroom the escape the MIL probing eyes and when I was in there I heard her asking where I was. Oh, dear! LOL\n\nThere are many other things she does that annoy me, especially the way she is like a toddler when she doesn't get what she wants, and the fact that she inteprets every little thing people do or say as something else entirely. She also is a little paranoid and always thinks people are talking about her behind her back or judging her, even (and especially) her closest friends. I guess it comes from her low self-esteem. Honestly, I think she's a mess and could benefit greatly from therapy, but she's also religious and will have none of that. I wish my husband and I could move to a different location so we would see her less and maybe my relationship with her would improve.I also wish she was more mature and would not act like a kid.\n\nMy question for you ESFPs is what can I do to try to improve my relationship with her as it is. She sometimes tells me that she loves me but I can't say it back to her. I don't really think I love her. But what can I do to assure her that yes, she's a good person, that she doesn't have to try so hard, etc? She is really needy (see HPD symptoms) and I have the worst time dealing with needy people. But I also can't tell her some things like I would with a friend, because she's so sensitive. I think she longs for me and her other DIL to see her as our second mother, since our own mothers live very far, and she's hurt when we gently say we don't see her like that. She wants to be our friend, but our personalities clash too much. So she wants to help, she wants to be a mother figure, but it has to be her way or she'll be hurt/offended. I find it very hard to deal with this situation and I would love to hear what you have to say about it. I'm open to answer any question you might have.\n\nI am not saying that I want her to completely change for my sake and behave the way I want. I just wish it wasn't always such a struggle. Maybe sometimes she could refrain from doing something that she knows I don't like, and next time I'll do something nice for her in gratitude. It's not like I don't know how to live with Es - both my husband and my dear sister are extroverts and I adore them, and we manage (have managed, in the case of my sister when we were growing up) to live together without killing each other LOL! So it's possible, unless INFJs and ESFPs are the two most incompatible types there are!\n\nI am also posting this on the INFJ forum, it will be interesting to hear what each type has to say. :)
1	I would playfully insult her, be rude to her, but always give a smile after like you just farted in her pillow. It sounds like she's loud and obnoxious, like me, and that list you listed described me to t. Treat her as if you get annoyed by her and let her show it. This may blow up in your face but if you have known each other for 10 years with no improvement I say go for it.
1	I'll try me best to answer this. I'm an ESFP and I've been in a long-term same-sex relationship (over six years) with an INFJ. We're both 31 as well, funnily enough!\n\nFirst off, it sounds like some of the problems here stem not from her being an ESFP but from her being a bit immature. I know one or two other ESFPs and while some of them can be very needy/attention-seeking, others aren't (in my experience, this can be true for people of all MBTI types!).\n\nThe phone thing stood out to me, though, because my partner *hates* talking on the phone, I'm guessing for similar reasons to you. He's told me that when he's on the phone he finds it overwhelming because there will usually be other noises vying for his (or my) attention, and that he usually prefers email/messaging or face-to-face; the former because it allows him to answer things on his own terms and in his own time, or the latter because it makes it easier to place what's being said in cotext (through body language, tone of voice, etc.). With that, at least, I think your best bet is probably to take a deep breath and broach the subject with your MIL. Just tell her that while it might seem odd to her, you really dislike talking on the phone. Explain why and reassure her that it's not personal but something that you need from *all* people. Do whatever you can to calm yourself before this; having known a few INFJs in my time, I know that your type can be highly sensitive and if you're anything like my partner or one of my close friends, you may say things more abrasively than you mean to because this kind of confrontation feels particularly stressful for you. If your MIL is perceptive enough she'll know not to take it to heart, but it sounds like she's not and so some of the heavy lifting (emotionally speaking) is going to have to come from you. It might feel really exhausting to discuss this with her and express your needs in detail while keeping calm and not reacting to anything she shoots back at you, but it will hopefully be worth it in the long run!\n\nThe other issues with her singling you out at gatherings can probably be dealt with in a similar way - if you can explain your needs as not being about *her* but about being introverted, there's a better chance that she'll understand. Tell her that while you appreciate that she likes to involve everyone in conversation, for an introverted person such as yourself it's usually quite taxing to be pulled into group conversation. That doesn't mean you're not enjoying yourself, but as an introvert in group situations you're usually more comfortable listening to other people talk and inserting yourself into the conversation when you feel like you have something particularly meaningful to add. Her behaviour sounds like it might just be a clumsy attempt at putting you at ease - something ESFPs tend to like to do, but which can backfire if they're not perceptive enough to pick up on when someone would rather be left alone. I'm guilty of this on occasion myself.\n\nI'm going off a bit of guesswork here based on my experience with INFJs and the strong/weak points of both INFJs and ESFPs, but hopefully that helps a little!
1	Are you sure she isn't an ESFJ?
2	Seeing an ESFP right now. How can I manage the relationship so she doesn't get "bored of it"? Best frequency of dates for you guys? Texting habits, let me know it all.	ask me questions cause I really dont know what to ask. I just know its important to know MBTI, I love myers briggs 
3	my boyfriend and I are kind of homebodies so this may not work for others but we text almost all day, start & watch shows together (probably our second fav activity), video game together, have a lot of sex and often do mundane things together like homework or laundry or cooking. These are the things that excite us or rather keep things interesting. 
2	All depends. I love conversing so I like to text all day and go out everyday if I can. Even if it's just to chill on a couch and watch shark tank or something. 
0	HELP! ESFP said "I love you" last night....	So, I'm an INTJ - I know, blah blah blah we aren't good at emotions - but it felt soon and I want to know what you all think.\n\nBack story: We met a few months ago and he's been chasing me and finally around the beginning of April I agreed to dinner. So we've been dating for about 3-4 weeks. (We don't really have a "bf/gf" label yet).... And last night we were getting hot and heavy and I did something awkward - per usual - and he said "It's ok, I love you"... And that took me super off-guard. We talked a little about it, and I told him I couldn't say it back yet. He admitted he said it too early. \n\nSo my question is - is that common for ESFPs to say that too soon? I know there tends to be a stereotype that you guys are a little flighty - no offense meant there. I'm just a little skeptical.
6	We tend to be very bubbly and very impulsive. If I feel like I love you I am going to say it without ever thinking if it was too early or what it might mean for the relationship's future.
1	[deleted]
1	I am an ESFP married to an INTJ and yes, I had to be super careful with not blurting that out too soon in my relationship.  I totally agree with /u/Troy521 that when I get sucked into the moment (like intense sex where get 100% focused on my husband) and I tend to ignore other parts of my brain that tell me not to blurt out that kind of thing.  I would disagree that I am flighty, but I would say that I tend to think too heavily about the moment right in front of me at times rather than getting enough of the big picture.
1	I sometimes forget and start using that word as just a term of endearment when I am beginning to care about someone (versus falling head over heels in love with them). The fact that you stopped and talked about it is good.
1	I felt it at what seemed like early on but didn't have the hear to say it yet, as I've scared away many people with my intense feelings. During this time my newish (at the time) INTJ boyfriend waqs picking up on my vibes & thought I was going to dump him. When it didnt happen at the end of the day he was further confused.\nHe ended up saying it first around the second month via webcam while I was on vacation. I felt exactly the same way and it turned out we developed the feelings at the same time. So if it was early on then we both felt it early on.\n\nTo be honest, I can't tell if I fall fast and heard for people because I'm an ESFP (also I'm 50/50 introverted) OR because I have borderline personality disorder.
1	It's funny because I'm an ESFP in a long-term relationship with an INFJ (so not quite your type, but close-ish), and he said "I love you" well before I was ready to. Same with my previous relationship (which was with an INFP).\n\nI guess I'm pretty comfortable saying it to friends, but that's a bit different. There's a different kind of love that I feel for someone I'm really committed to, and that's not something I take lightly. When I'm really *in* love with someone, it's a huge fucking deal.\n\nWhat I'm getting at is that his way of expressing this at this point could well be a way of expressing a feeling of friendship and comfortableness, since the way you describe the scenario makes it sound like he said it fairly casually. That doesn't mean there won't be some other, deeper layers of emotion that get peeled back further down the line if things continue to go well with the two of you.
0	it doesn't really mean anything, I say it to girls all the time... i'll even grab their hands and say it in the most sincere form. It's our way of displaying affection whether it seems a bit extreme. If we love you... you'll know, words wont be the defining way of realizing it :)
2	How great is your charisma?	ESFPs stereotypically have very magnetic personalities. What's it like to be to be you as an ESFP?
2	At the risk of sounding braggy, I'm pretty freaking likable. 
1	I guess I should preface this saying that I have social anxiety so a lot of my personality when being around people can be blunted. I wouldn't describe myself as charismatic though. My boyfriend says I do have a very magnetic personality which draws people to me. I guess I've never noticed it happening and in high school I had a relatively average time making friends. As I've gotten older I realize that maybe I can come on too strong so I try to tone it down, even when I'm with close friends, to not be overwhelming. \nI'm borderling ISFP as well so I pick and choose who I hang out with carefully as well. Being an ESFP is fun but being mentally ill can be hard because I don't feel like myself often. I love to hang out with people and being with my friends gives me life, but I often feel like secluding myself when I'm having a bad day.
1	my charisma is through the roof. This is somewhat of an example but one night when some friends and I went back to our house from a party I was extremely wasted and overheard some gang members nearby the backyard of our house arguing and fighting with each other (by gangmembers I mean some 19 yr old kids who tagged a lot of stuff by our house and were always up to no good). anyway, I was very drunk and barely remember going back outside to talk to them, but from what my roommates recall, they told me that they heard me outside talking to them for 20 mins and then when they came outside to retrieve me, the gang members were hugging and had completely made amends with their troubles. as far as other parts of my charisma go, I've never met someone who I wasn't able to make open up to me and become comfortable with talking to me. I'm also a salesman and have had many customers tell me that I 'seem genuine and able to make people feel that they are not being bullshitted with'. Maybe if I was an ESTP i'd have much more sales, but I still want to stick with my own morals and beliefs when it comes to selling
3	What's an ESFP stereotype that doesn't apply to you?	
2	Fuck if I know. What's an ESFP stereotype?
2	I am not sure if I'm mixing up this stereotype with the "leo" stereotype but I remember one of them is that we're cheaters or we get around. I don't have a problem with that if someone else is (the sleeping around one, fuck cheaters) that way but I'm actually way less exciting. If I have feelings for someone it's really intense and I like to be in serious relationships vs. many hook ups.
1	I do not really enjoy dance clubs. I love dancing and I love being around friends and people, but they are too goddamn hot and the music is usually weird ass mixtape bullshit where there are DJs yelling over crap and not the fun stuff I want to hear. That's one of many stereotypes that probably don't fit. lol
1	That we like to go out partying all the time and don't care where.\n\nI love things like house parties, generally, so long as the crowd feels genuine. Usually it's a great space for conversation (because the music isn't deafening) and activities (I'm so down for a house party that also includes board games or Mario Kart or something like that).\n\nIf it's the wrong *kind* of house party or a nightclub or something I'm almost as likely to find an excuse to leave as an introvert would be, because I'm very sensitive to environments in which I feel like people aren't being genuine.
1	Irresponsible
1	infj needing advice from you	Hello, wonderful ESFP!\n\nI am in a bit of a spot. One of my best friends, an ESFP, had a crush on me. It was a brief one, got replaced quickly (he has the attention of a goldfish), and then flared up again after a period of time in which we hung out practically every day and had fun adventures. Now unfortunately, he said this lasted for an unordinarily long time (a year), and was hard to shake out of. He would keep hoping that I would reciprocate. Thus, he's cutting off ties to move on, among other reasons.\n\nSo I have several questions. What on earth would an ESFP see in an INFJ??? He certainly has more attractive, more fun friends surrounding him, and I don't fit the type of the usual girls he likes, physically and personality-wise. Secondly, is there hope to be friends? Will he forgive and forget, and stop fearing a "relapse"? Because I'm very optimistic and I think we can definitely keep our great friendship.\n\nThanks ESFPs!
2	As ESFP's we can just be very emotional (at least me especially). So when we find someone we like, we can either take a relationship really fast, or we can just get attached even when nothing is happening. And I am talking from experience, it is very hard to get unattached. \n\nJudging from just an ESFP to INFJ standpoint, he probably sees a lot of things in you that he's missing. I've always said friendship is a good foundation to a relationship, and I would assume everyone would agree, but those are probably the main reasons. 
2	I lived a version of what you are describing. Years ago, I developed a crush on my INFJ friend, but she was dating someone else. It became a thing where we would see each other every day almost no matter what because her relationship was long distance so I was who she relied on in person. I was completely smitten but she always had reasons that we wouldn't work. Twice we tried to make it work, each time ended up with us both angry and sad because of our different needs and expectations (I saw a relationship as just a continuation maybe just strengtheing of our friendship, she had much higher expectations of what being in a relationship entailed) So multiple times we tried and then crashed and burned. It was very hard for me as she would quickly usually react by trying to get into another relationship but I never wanted to because I didn't want to hurt her. We finally came to the conclusion that we should not try to be in a relationship and we are just very good friends and housemates and we get along amazingly well because we both know that nothing romantic is on the table and we are free to go about our business but still have each other around. Not sure how helpful this is for you but at least in my situation it was possible to remain very good friends! \n\nTo the whole aspect of why does he like you? Well, at least in my experience as an esfp, I see potential mates as friends and when i really care about the friend it becomes something more, I don't have any sources on hand but I have been shown MBTI interpretations that speak about how well INFJs and ESFPs can work as friends so that might explain why he is so into you because you are a good friend!
5	How do you make decisions?	Asking as INTJ
3	The socionics post on us gives a pretty good description.\n--------------------\n\n"He typically wants to make all decisions that concern sensory aspects of his life for himself: what he will do, wear, eat, look like, etc., and resents any attempts by others to make these decisions for him (conflicts over sensing). However, he is willing to make use of other peoples' suggestions, advice and ideas, as long as he plays the most visible role. He usually values first hand experience, lives life experiencing it "on his own skin", and will gladly teach it to others whom he sees as less knowing and aware of the realities."
2	Whatever jumps out at me most and is most exciting. Has potential for most opportunity/enjoyment. Think this is more enneagram than mbti. It's mostly instinct though. Thinking is more like rationalizing what I already chose to make sure I won't damage myself somehow in the process.
1	I was literally about to come and ask this same question. As an intj the idea of your minds just makes no sense to me! I imagine it to be like walking on the moon
1	I go with my gut! I do what I want! 
1	Well, I convinced my best friend to do various tests.	She types as an ESFP and I am an ENFP.\nAny insights on how we might help each other grow?
1	Listen to her when she gives you advice. We don't just dole it out randomly, we do it for a reason. Enfps have an awful time accepting they have a poor grasp on reality and are stubborn taking advice that conflicts with NeFiLand.\n\nIf she doesn't want to go deeper into discussion or get philosophical about something then change subjects. This is the best way to make her hate you.\n\nOh and don't be passive-aggressive/shady when you're moody. Be upfront. Enfp moods change about 200 times a day and my enfp friends sometimes just randomly stop talking to me for weeks when they get in a mood. I guess they think it's easier to make me wonder than to actually tell me what is going on. Also read [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/ENFP/comments/3269zt/enfp_homies_got_my_back/cq8b9b1?context=3).
4	What are some common traits of ESFPs?	I'm typed as an ENFP, but lately, I'm not sure with all that's going on with me. The two types share common traits like loving possibilities and socializing, so I can't really pinpoint it.
13	ESFPs are grounded in reality, not ideas. We see things in terms of how they work in the real world, not how they could work in an ideal society (ENFP).\n\nBehavior wise...I've found ENFPs are better at talking about anything, they can keep any conversation going and find something to add to it, where ESFPs mostly talk about what's going on around them, what's happened, what's going to happen, concrete stuff. We don't talk much about stuff outside our experience. ESFPs are more physically adaptable, able to adapt immediately to their current environment and react quickly. ENFPs are too spacey to do that. They're the ones who lock themselves out of their cars and throw their phones in the trash.
2	Personality types can change a bit.  I used to suffer from acute social anxiety that held back my ENFP tendencies, but the more I have overcome that with age and experience, my true extrovertedness has surfaced. \nThe spacey, idealist stuff I've had since I became cognizant.
1	ISTJ Curious About le ESFP...	In an effort to understand a friend better I'm wondering, do ESFPs* keep up relationships just for the sake of "being nice" or avoiding confrontation?  Would an ESFP tell you if their romantic feelings changed or just move on?  This guy is still keeping up with me after 8 months of not living in the same country, we're barely talking, but when I bring up the fact he says he does want to keep me in his life.   We're just friends who had mutual feelings for each other.  It's not *that* complicated.  *I realize some characteristics transcend type, but opinions would be appreciated. 
2	That's awfully specific... but I think a more ESFP thing to do would be to say "huh, well *that's* not working.  Ok, was fun.  Have a nice life!"
2	he's being nice, keeping up relationships is an Fi thing, even tho we're known to burn bridges easily. a lot of us wouldn't be able to tell someone if our feelings have changed... we just might insinuate it through the way we text or respond to messages. we want to keep everyone in our life, especially if we think you possess similar virtuous qualities. ESFP with an ISTJ actually has great compatibility. honestly tho, we definitely are extremely flirtatious so keep that in mind. if you're barely talking tho, he's definitely engaged in something new
1	What do you mean "keeping up with"? He initiates the conversations? That seems weird. Maybe he just wants someone to talk to or there are still feelings left over.
1	You're just probably too hard too drop, I don't see other option here. I doubt ESFP would keep that shit rollin if you were a total wreck, but just because you describe your relationships so easy going y, he's not quiting it. And since you're not mad about each other, you're not mad about each other. That's how I see it. As faggy as it sounds, sorry for my Engilsh, leul ;)
0	Question for ESFP's from a male INFP	Hey there ESFP's!\nI have a question for you! I'm a male INFP and i had a thing with a female ESFP.\nShe was in a relationship that's why called it a "thing", but it was more than just a fling or her cheating, we not only had sex but we also made other stuff together, we talked a lot and went out. As an introvert being with her was a blessing because i became really confident of myself. \nBut that's really it, i asked her many times to leave her actual partner to stay with me, until i bursted and said i was done. That happened 2 times and for a reason or another we started dating again, and now 7 month ago a third time for real. We haven't seen each other since then.\n\nNow, as an INFP of course I tendo to overanalyze things and i still am thinking about her.\nThe question is: is she thinking about me or is she really done? \nAt the start of january i went to my old workplace (where she works) to wish all of my ex-colleagues a happy new year, unfortunately she was also there. Of course i gave her my best wishes like i did with everyone else. 40 min later she wrote me and wanted to chat. WHY? I mean i'm giving my everything to forget her she writing me gives me hope (and i don't think that is a good thing). February was my birthday, she wrote me happy birthday and i thanked her. She wrote again trying to start a conversation. WHYYYY?\n\nCan you ESPF guys and gals tell me what the hell is going on in her mind? Does she want to be friends or is she just trying to keep me hooked in the case that she Leaves her bf or something else? what is her plan? is there any plan or is she just trying to be nice ? \n\nSorry for the long post! \nhave a nice one !\n
2	I think this is a post for /r/relationship advice and even then it sounds like right off the bat this relationship was doomed to begin with. \n\nIn my opinion, it wasn't *more* than a fling or cheating; it *was* cheating. She cheated on her partner with you and you're upset that she isn't faithful to you; moreover you demanded of her that she do as you want - to leave her partner for you - without considering that she may not want to or she might've already.\n\nJudging from the rest of your story it sounds like she wants to keep entertaining the notion of you but the thought only crosses her mind when you come around again. For the most part it seems she's had her fun already and she's probably not interested in more.\n\nHave you given thought to the idea that if she was unfaithful to him in a relationship, she might also be unfaithful to you in a relationship? Don't let yourself be strung up by your emotions. Assess the situation logically and determine the next course of action. She doesn't appear to be dedicated to anything more than a passing glance whenever you come her way and so it seems to me you've simply got to forget about it.
1	She sees you as a hook-up. Don't go looking for emotions where there are none. I know it's next to impossible for an INFP to do that which is why ESFP and INFP make a shitty pair. Choices are accept your hook-up status - good luck with that being an INFP - or leave her and move on. You're just messing yourself up obsessing over her.\n\nFemale esfp btw.
1	When you're out of her presence for more than a few days, she's stopped thinking about you. She's probably having fun with her old boyfriend again, or maybe she's banging new dudes.\n\nThen when she is reminded of you, she thinks, "Hey, that was fun. Let's see how that could go again." Or maybe even, "I really, really like him."\n\nThe point is, at least for me, I fall hard, but I recover quickly. I've not been single for more than a few weeks since eighth grade, almost twenty years ago. Many of my relationships have been long, several years, so flighty isn't exactly the right word. I am just not a dweller.\n\nFor most of my life, I've felt as though i always get what I want. To a degree, that's true. But it's also true that once something is an inconvenient option, I no longer want it and it's not much of a loss. The fact is, once you're out of sight, you're inconvenient, uninteresting, and probably not much a loss.
1	ESFP female here. Unfortunately I recognize this girl's behaviour in myself from a couple of years ago, I'd like to think I'm not like that anymore but sometimes 'the old me' comes back and surprises me. When I was a bit younger I enjoyed the idea of keeping many doors open or whatever you'd like to call it, sometimes I wasn't so considerate about other peoples feelings and I just wanted to have fun, flirt and see how far I could take it. I don't really know why I did it, it somehow felt like a game, I liked having these casual flings (and many of them at once!) and just screw around for fun. In the end the fact that people would get feelings for me and end up getting hurt was probably what made me try to change myself later on. But in your case, I would say this girl just wants to fool around for fun and isn't really planning on leaving her partner anytime soon. If you however stop answering her attempts at conversation I'm 99% sure she'll start saying she misses you and the time you spent together etc... It's a tricky situation!
1	Don't let her string you along, you're doing a disservice to yourself. Cut ties.
0	Another male INFP here. The mid-age female ESFP at my work is just incredible. I was on a walk today thinking about how she operates, why there is something about here that is just outrageous yet relatable to me, and I worked into Se (she's so damn smooth, too smooth not to be an extroverted senoer), Fi, Te, and Ni. Looked online, I was right. Watching her engage into Te/Ni with customers is great, because you don't expect it. She goes from total outgoing partier to confident thinker (Te is the logic and external order, Ni is confidence). Just have to say, the older ESFPs are probably the coolest people on earth. \n
2	ESFPs needed for a study on personality and sleep patterns!	edit: 6/30 ESFPs have taken this survey. Need 24 more!\n\nHello Everyone! I am undertaking a project to investigate the relationship between people's personalities and their sleep patterns. This survey will be posted in all MBTI related forums- if you could take it, I would greatly appreciate your time. It is pretty brief, and at the end there is the option to see the descriptive results (percentages of each response to see how you stack up to your fellow redditors). Once I have a sufficient number of participants, I will analyze the data to find correlations between different traits, and then post any interesting findings from the data. https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1lW19vAWhfaGu_MBDWkZl2KrJkTTGj3nXSvZJOTvEJhg/viewform If this goes well, this could be the first installation in an interesting social science series! Thanks!\n
1	I've submitted my answers!
1	Just filled it out!
1	I'm not an ESFP but heres a friendly little anecdote.\n\nMy Fiance is an ESFP and he's a morning person. I'm an ENFP and i'm a night owl. 
4	/r/esfpmusic is now a thing!	
1	Still need to come up with a good banner but yeah, feel free to post your tunes there :D
1	Love the selection there, especially Underground Charisma. As an INTJ perpetually interested in all things ESPF, let me ask: what exactly classifies as ESFP music, in your opinion? Would you consider the currently very popular EDM genre ESFP music?
1	Songs without lyrics that best describe you	fellow esfp's, what songs that don't have lyrics (or very few lyrics) move you and describe you the most? \n\nhere are mine:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL4KJmMGda8\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trT7cpSZQnk

2	The message at the end of this Childish Gambino song really spoke to Se in me.	This hit close to home.\n\n"Cut out the middle man, make it all for everybody, always. Everybody can’t turn around and tell everybody, everybody already knows, I told them."\n\n[Childish Gambino - That Power](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgVH9vd06Xo)\n
2	<3 Childish Gambino\n\nYeah it seems like kind of a combo of Se & Fi. I dig it.
1	My People- I hope I am speaking your language	So this is actually a true delight to find this. \n\nI am wondering if this means that you and I experience the same things, the same anxieties and such. \n\nI have found that I had to articulate this recently to several people and have yet to find anyone who understands quite clearly- maybe its an ESFP thing? \n\nI am anxious that I am not social enough. \n\nLet me back up I just moved to London, before I moved to London I lived in DC. In DC I had a very established social life- three plans an evening the weekends were packed. I moved to London as the result of a quarter life crisis and you know all that jazz. Before I left I remember quite accurately sitting in my empty bedroom sobbing. My fear was- no social life. \n\nWhen I got here- it was game on, I did not allow myself to sit in my room, I did not allow myself to have down time. Every second, every dinner was directed at making friends. I voraciously did this- when my social calendar was not full (plan every single night)  I had so much incredible angst and stress. \n\nThis stress caused me to invite 49 people over for s'mores one night at my new flat and spawn a tradition on Thursday nights. I mean people in the building view this as an awesome sense to socialize as we are all grad students but for me it was less about socializing but more about me getting my Thursday nights filled. It was almost about thriving- if this makes sense? \n\nI have taken up closely- and again maybe an ESFP thing- with a roommate who is unimpressed by me. Its not hard for me to find people who will laugh at every thing I say because they want to be involved with me and company to my plans. My roommate is the complete opposite, introvert, unimpressed and the only thing we bond on is sassiness. I adore her for her honesty. I have to work to get her approval. ( I call myself a human golden retriever). She has as a challenge tried to get me to stay in on nights. \n\nSo I have I have stayed in without plans for three nights. I am getting used to it- but I have to equate it to feeling like I am gaining 50 pounds and watching trashy TV- I feel gross. \n\nI guess what I am saying do other ESFP-er's get it? Am I alone? Is this what we deal with? \n\nDo you also have friends who are embarrassed about how many conversations you start with strangers at a bar? No matter how many friends you have you sometimes feel very alone? Do you all have different levels of friends with whom you consider on an order of closeness. From the people you can hang out with, in sweats and those you do to ensure that you are included in some social group you bounced into when you went to that Goth Rave that one time? \n\nJust wondering...
1	[deleted]

1	Yeah if I don't go out and do things I also feel like ...gross. That's a good word. Like wtf am I doing with my life, just sitting here? Everyone else is out.\n\n>Do you also have friends who are embarrassed about how many conversations you start with strangers at a bar? No matter how many friends you have you sometimes feel very alone? Do you all have different levels of friends with whom you consider on an order of closeness. From the people you can hang out with, in sweats and those you do to ensure that you are included in some social group you bounced into when you went to that Goth Rave that one time?\n\nI start convos with strangers like it's my job. Mostly cuz I can't sit still, I need to be doing something. And I think ESFPs tend to attract flaky friends so yeah, I have a lot of those and I do end up feeling alone if I overthink about it. So I just try to be ok doing things by myself. My best friends are introverts because they're loyal, but fuck they never like going out! Once every 2-4 weeks and they're done. But all my friends are all in different circles. None of them know each other. I just collect a bunch of random people, there's no real theme to the kind of friends I make. They're all interesting though.
3	any other ESFP dated an INTJ?	Sup everyone, ESFP male here. I have recently been on a few dates with an INTJ girl and so far things seem to be clicking. Have any of you dated one? What kinda of tips or words of wisdom do you have toward dating an opposite type?
3	I'm an INTJ.\nTry not to keep secrets from us if you can tell others. Just stay honest, because not knowing something is often much, much worse to us (or at least me) than knowing a bad truth. Also, I will give constructive criticism to almost everything, even if I really like it. I may seem really cold sometimes, but I really, really like affection; I often can't stop thinking if there's something I've done wrong, if I don't get enough affection (once again, maybe just me). In fact, I often can't stop thinking in general, sometimes it can cause me to worry over nothing, or text at really bad times. Keep in mind, MBTI tests and every other personality test give extremely generalized results and really aren't used for many important things anyways.
1	Nope only an ENTJ. It clicked pretty well, we didn't seem to have any problems. We found each other fascinating. I'd say just go with it.
1	Dated an INTJ for a year and a half. Don't let their complaining or criticism of you get to you.  It will happen. Remember your needs, don't only focus on theirs. I think a lot of my problems stemmed from her being pretty narcissistic and somewhat abusive and me either giving in or not knowing what to do. It was a hell of a roller coaster ride though, some of the best and worst times of my life.  Try to avoid arguing without giving in though and suggest compromise after compromise if you have to. Good luck! I'm sure it will be great, just understand that she is the complete opposite of you and that you both think through things very differently!
1	I'm an ISTJ Male and my girlfriend of 22 months is an ESFP. I feel like this is significantly different than your situation though, because Extroverted Males are much different than introverted ones. If you'd still like to ask me questions about either of us, I'd be happy to answer.
1	I'm glad I found this thread because I was going to open a similar discussion. I'm a male INTJ and my most memorable relationships have been with ESFP females. It really is as if opposites attract. She's the water of chaos against my immutable sandy banks of sanity. It takes both of us to create a dynamic, but stable, flowing river. That old TV series "Dharma & Greg" was a perfect illustration of the ESFP & INTJ couple. Is there something like that on TV these days?
1	Hey! I'm an ESFP lady who just married a goofy INTJ man. We've been together about 8 years. I have so much wisdom to give. I'm having some beers, so I'm not going to go into too much detail, but I do have one important point: \n\nIn a strange way, INTJ and ESFP are not actually opposite. As my husband can explain much more competently, we have the same ways of thinking, we just use them in the opposite order. In that sense, it becomes an opposites complement each other sort of relationship, rather than a we dont understand each other sort of thing. I'll bet I can convince my husband to weigh in, on the off chance you want to hear more about this.\n\nI think one of the harder parts is just the partnering of an introvert with an extrovert, as the couple has to be willing to do things separately more than usual.\n\nask any questions that come to mind!!
2	ESFPs with insight about your cognitive functions: Let me pick your brain and I'll let you pick mine.	I am curious about how our cognitive styles compare. We essentially share the same functions but with reverse emphasis. This makes your way of thinking especially interesting (and if I'm being honest, especially alien) to me. \n\nWhat are some behaviors or thought processes you associate with Se? What inherent strengths and weaknesses do you note from Se dominance? In what ways do you feel your auxiliary Fi and tertiary Te supplement it? \n\nNi is supposedly your Achilles heel and while I have lurked and hypothesized contrasting scenarios, I don't really know how you experience it from *your* perspective. Lastly, what potential benefits in your personality do you see in improving Ni?\n\nApologies for barging in and quizzing you all. I hope that between the topics I've posted here and in /r/ENTJ and /r/ISFP, I might get better insight on how to develop myself from people with more experience than me in those areas. 
2	Um I'm not really sure how to describe Se because it just seems like an obvious thing to me. It's just reality. Living in and reacting to it and taking it for what it is. Honestly I don't think there are any downsides I experience from being Se-dom. It fits with my way of life.\n\nFi doesn't come out very much for me, it's more related to like my interests and stuff. What I find appealing. How I can derive enjoyment from a situation. Te supplementing Se, hm, I guess I am good at figuring out plans for action on the spot, figuring out who needs to do what. But then Fi makes me feel bad for ordering people around lol.\n\nI really am not sure how I use Ni healthily. I think it causes me to read into things too much and make me paranoid. Or fear the consequences and prevent me from taking action. I think I was in Ni grip for like a year or more. I was literally stuck doing the same thing every day because I was sure if I did something different this would happen and then this and my life would be ruined forever.
1	Se: taking things in their literal or physical form. Se can lead to pursing new sensations, environments, feelings. This can lead to risk taking behavior or overindulgence.\n Fi is the process that helps us decide how to act based off the information taken in. Se can affect Fi in the way that sometimes information we perceive literally can mean something else, and may incite an emotional reaction that is conflicting internally. \nTe in combination with Se helps us form thoughts that are literal and 'tell it like it is'. Also like I said, verbalizing Fi processes. \nBenefits to Ni I think might include more in depth abstract understanding of everything. Also a different system of organizing and applying data in the form of predictions, future planning and understanding people. \nHope this helps! One of my best friends is an INTJ and we can understand each other pretty well since we both have our lower functions fairly developed. 
1	Come check out /r/sensor	Hey fellow Realists.\n\nTired of condescension, scrolling through walls of boring text, intuitive ramblings, and nerdy discourse?\n\nHead over to /r/sensor, a fun sub where anyone is welcome and we don't turn down for nothing.\n\nxoxo,\n\nThe mods at /r/sensor

4	Why so few ESFP?	Just wondering. Why this sub is so inactive? Are ESFP that rare?
5	I'm an ESFP and I come and go on reddit. Depends on my schedule and whatnot 
5	I'm curious about that, too! My boyfriend is an INTP so I sometimes check out his subreddit and there are always a lot of people there discussing new topics and writing looong posts etc... While over here, it's amazing if you find more than like three answers on a post :o
3	Yep, don't worry dude. The internet age was basically invented in order to grant introverts worldwide a shield against real life contact, and then Zuckerberg comes along, revolutionizes social media, and turns the internet into a means to augment real life interactions rather than substituting them. THANKS ALOT MARK. 
3	There are probably also a number of ESFPs who think they're other (read: intuitive) types.
2	[Spidey puts it best.](http://i.imgur.com/Rs9qFYg.jpg)
4	ESFPs aren't rare, no. But ESFPs interested in talking about typology on Reddit are very rare. INxxs tend to be drawn to this stuff a lot more.
2	Because we are out doing stuff. I only hang out here cuz I'm on sick leave and can't do much. ESFPs are about 9% of the population so we're not too rare.
1	I think that's it's just the ESFP's Dominant Se would rather be doing something else than browse a subreddit.
1	ISTJ Male here. My ESFP girlfriend loves to be very socail and likes to be in-tune with social media and everything that is happening in the social world, rather than discuss something like this haha. This is what I like to do.
1	Necro, but found this, lol. I browse a lot, but mostly I see arguing or very subjective questions on MBTI subs so I don't bother to get involved. 
1	Because talking about typology is too abstract and boring for them usually. All myer briggs ESFP groups are the smallest in numbers. 
1	Question should be why there are so few ESFPs online?\n\nAnd the answer is because they are busy in "Real Life".
2	I need more ESFP for my next Watson analysis.	I'm in the process of developing a more advanced analysis than [the one I provided](http://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/2r2uix/an_analysis_of_the_myersbrigg_subreddit_comments/). It will be based on people global reddit activity and take into account their type. \n\nIf you posted in /r/MBTI and your flair is set, I already got you in my database. Otherwise, please set your flair and post here. My script will find you that way. As a bonus, I will provide everyone that made it into my database their own graph comparing them to other redditors of their type.
2	u kan analys meh bat u dent kno m3 so hao u gona do eet\n\n<3
1	*Boop.*\n\nDoes that count? 
1	I sort of work with a Watson offshoot! I'm really excited about it! i hope your script can find me.
3	Saw this, and thought of you. :)	
2	"fear disguised as practicality" so on point
1	Every time I see a celebrity saying something like this, I'd love to see it juxtaposed with interviews of the 1000 (probably magnitudes more than 1000) people who attempted the same thing and failed, and what their advice is.\n\nIt's easy to advocate playing the lottery when you were a winner.

12	Michael Pierce presents: ESFP	
3	wow this is so on point
3	What is your favorite type to party with?	For me, I love partying with ESTP, ENTJ, and INFPs. Another Se dominant is fun to go to the bars with, and an ENTJ intensiveness is something I like to keep up with if I'm partying. I say INFP because I lived with one for 4 years and I tended to drag him out to parties whenever I could. N types are fun to party or have drunk convos with since you can talk about just anything if it's abstract. \n\nI am not a fan of partying with ESTJ, ISFJ, or ENFJ. Something about them brings me down when I'm boozing
7	ESTPs, ENTPs, other ESFPs, not sure if I've partied with ENFPs but probably them too. It depends what kind of party though. If it's just a kickback then ISFPs, ISTPs and sometimes INFPs or INTPs can be pretty cool too. So basically P types lol. P for party
3	In my experience: ISTPs will follow you until the end of the party and far beyond. Partying with an ESTP is brutal! and party with ENFP is really fun too. 
1	I saw ENTJ, someone likes to party with us!! :D
1	-NFP ENTJ ISTJ               \n                   \nEdit: oh wait those are just my friend's types. I like to party with my friends 
5	Being friends with other ESFPs	Do you have any other ESFP friends?\n\nI think our type is one of, if not the, best types, but honestly it can be hard for me to be around other ESFPs, especially in a group of people and especially if they're my gender. I hate to say it but I feel like I'm competing for attention. Most of my friends end up being introverts or intuitives (who seem more introverted than sensors).\n\nDo other ESFPs feel this way?
3	I completely agree. I have many ESFP/ ENFP friends and I, too, often feel as though I have to compete for attention.\n\nWe just have to remember that everyone is awesome, and we are all fun people to be around. Stylish, too. ;)
2	The same here. My only extroverted friend is an ESTP with whom we're always looking for adventures, but also we argue a lot. 
-2	I'm an espf, and I'm incredibly confident. like to the point I feel as though competition doesn't exist....
3	Do you consider yourself an assertive person?	If so in what ways, if not why not?
6	When I have to be, yeah definitely. It's not like my natural state though and I kind of shake it off once business is taken care of. It's just another "role" I play.
2	Unfortunately I am not I'm so terribly shy which I think sucks when you're extroverted. Even if i want to get something done I'm terrified of putting myself out there.
1	Not at all. I am very laid back and I go with the flow. As long as my friends are happy I'm happy, unless we are doing something totally and morally wrong then I'll step in to stop them.
8	How easily do you fall for people?	For me it's pretty easy to fall head over heels for someone really quickly, and they're pretty much all I think about. Being in love or having a crush on someone is like the best thing ever and I'm constantly checking people out... I am constantly going through phases of being in love with someone and there is always someone on my mind. I can't think of a time in my life when I have been mentally "single".\n\nOn the same token though, if I get tired of someone, the passion runs dry very quickly.\n\nAny of you guys like this?
6	god i fall so quickly then get bored just as fast
3	damn. this is tough for me for sureeeee. I fall for people quickly, but it lasts a while for me. For instance, I dated an ISFJ in HS, went to prom and whatnot and it was great. I felt way stronger feelings for her than she felt for me. In college, I met another ISFJ who I became very close with. I suppose I have very close feelings for her too. In between these two girls i've met and interacted with girls I like, not sure their type... but after my attraction toward them, I immediately lose it when I hear that they have interest in me. Idk what it is, but this has happened with at least 5 girls in the last 3 years. 
3	Yup yup yup. I am always attracted to someone. It is weird to think about but I guess I just love having someone close to me at all times. 
3	God yes. I just think that we need to let ourselves be more patient with people and the passion will return. Just like being angry or remembering that your cat ran away. I feel guilty for forgetting so easily since I haven't seen her prior to like 1.5 years ago
3	I fall quickly. I can get over someone quickly if I find someone else to be interested in. I am not very good at being alone.\n\nRight now I am trying to stay mentally single. I am actually trying to overcome my falling quickly, and make myself take things slowly in my next relationship. I don't want perfect, but I want long term and happy. My focus today is finding friends, which is tough - I've recently returned to this area and I feel like I have no community whatsoever.
2	I used to always be romantically interested in someone (sometimes more than one person at once) and they would consume my thoughts and I would always be wanting to talk to them. But recently I haven't had feelings for anyone most likely because I haven't interacted with many new people and all of the people I know, I'm not interested in. 
2	This sounds exactly like me. I'm 22 now, but reading through my old diaries (from my teenage years) I realise I've almost always been "in love" with someone and when I got bored of that poor soul I found someone new in just a couple of weeks. Sometimes I did it just so I could have someone to write about...
4	Do you identify as a feminist?	Just wondering if there is a link between ESFPs and the current feminism movement.
5	Yeah I think all people should nowadays. I'm not vocal about it though. There are some extremists but those are the minority.
3	I am, but I haven't always been. I used to be quite the opposite, actually! Always very opinionated, but I have become surprisingly more graceful and kind to those who disagree with me now than I ever was before I became a feminist. Not that the two are correlated. I just think I'm growing up.
4	Feminist, not quite, but egalitarian yes. I think singling out a group isn't the best strategy for equality so let's include everyone!
3	yup\n
3	Definitely! I feel like I wanna be a part of this new wave of feminism and would never change my mind on that. However, it's only for the last two years that I've identified myself as a feminist, before that I was highly skeptical and thought it was about hating men and what not. Feel pretty silly about it now.
1	No. 
1	I'd contend that ESFPs are *most* inclined towards activism in general, due to Se + Fi being their two strongest functions . \n\nLet's (etymologically) break it down: \n\n"Activ" = doing in the present moment = Extraverted Sensation \n\n"Ism" = values and ideology = Introverted Feeling\n\nHell, can we just call ESFPs "activists" from now on?\n\nEDIT: Put introverted sensation instead of introverted feeling\n\n\n
2	Pride	Are you prideful? \nHow does it manifest? \nHow do you feel about it in others?
1	I don't think I'm prideful until my bf points it out to me. \nI tend to take critisism very poorly. I also am very proud of the things I make or put efford in to. I am also a leo, if that helps describe me. Im not very big on astrology so I attribute most of the "leo" characterstics to bei ng esfp.
2	I can't figure this ESFP girl out	INTP male here.\n\nA couple weeks ago I started dating this ESFP. We're both seniors in high school but we've liked each other since junior year, so we already know each other on a friend basis. She was in an ill-fated relationship with this other guy (everything was against him) when we finally confessed to each other. She couldn't withhold her feelings, so she told him about me and he kinda just gave up on her and is still angry at her.\n\nWe went on a date to the movies soon after. The next few days were weird. She seemed less interested in me. After a long talk with her, we decided to just be friends. The next few days we hung out and interacted with each other as if nothing had happened, like two very good friends that just like to chill with each other. She was going to the homecoming dance with our friend (girl), but the friend cancelled on her at the last minute. Now she (ESFP) just told me that they were going to ask me to join them yesterday, but they forgot. I agreed to go with her to the dance tonight, just the two of us.\n\nBeing an INTP, it's natural for me to seek hidden meaning or motive behind every word and action, and I recognize that not everything has a hidden meaning. Help me judge how she feels about me based on the following and what I have already told you. I've been getting mixed signals here and I need your ESFP perspective on the situation. Here are some of the things she's told me, which might not actually reflect her own feelings and were just said to deal with things in the moment, such as excuses to just be friends. What do these statements say about her true feelings?\n\n   - she has feelings for me\n   - she has feelings for him (the guy she was "dating")\n   - he is mad at her because his "pride is hurt"\n   - I'm too clingy (I'm not at all, but must have come off that way because my previous attempts at convincing her to stay with me implied an exaggerated a desire for long term commitment)\n   - she wants to save romanticisms (such as holding hands) for someone she's willing to commit too in the long term ("mr. right")\n   - once suggested I should give this other girl that likes me a chance (I said I wasn't into her and she never mentioned it again)\n\nI really like this girl, just everything about her. But God I wish I could just read her mind. I want to be with her and make her happy. I fell that she wants to be with me too, but her feelings change a lot and can even conflict. I want us to be together. I want the best for her and for me, even if that means being just friends. I truly hope that's not the case.
2	It sounds like she is still confused and not completely over the last relationship. Maybe now is not the best time to be in a relationship with her.. It sounds like she wants the best for you though, even though she is trying to set you up with someone else. Sounds like she feels guilty for not returning your feelings. Yeah I would just give it time and put off a real relationship for now, then reassess.
2	>it's natural for me to seek hidden meaning or motive behind every word and action, and I recognize that not everything has a hidden meaning.\n\nNearly everyone does this. She's a person, not an MBTI type- try a dating/romance related subreddit instead. Just because we're ESFP here doesn't mean we know how she ticks. 
2	She may either be unsure of her feelings or she's over you. I feel like every one assumes ESFPs get bored of people quickly and move on to the next crush. That's never been an issue for me, but it could be true of her. You should talk to her about the mixed signals.
1	Your over thinking this. Your over-thinking will scare her away.\n\nJust look at how she feels around you. If she said no and that she just wants to be friends, then respect that. If she starts showing more of an interest or flirting with you, then show interest and flirt back. If not, then most likely your in the friendzone. \n\nShe probably has feelings for her ex, and your her second option. You need to let her end things with her ex in her head. Which she will eventually do. After then, reevaluate where your at and try again. Maybe something will happen. \n\nAs for the dance. She could be wanting to make her ex jealous, she could be wanting to get closer to you, or maybe her friends really did cancel and she doesn't want to stay in. Just go with her and don't overthink it
5	ESFP + INTP	I'm an INTP male. I recently got out of a relationship in which I let myself fall into with an ESFP woman. For various reasons, after 2 years of unsteady interaction, it broke apart.\n\nI loved her. I still love her, even though she's no longer a part of my life, and the fact that things went "bad" between us. She lied a lot, and was sneaky, and my perceptive nature never really let her get by with the lies. It's a long story, and any rational person would call me insane for still caring/loving her.\n\nTo make a short story of it, she wore me out and made me fight "too hard" to feel secure in the relationship.\n\nMy question is, are there any ESFP women who have either married an INTP, or had a long, more-or-less happy relationship with one? How did it work out?\n\nThose who have had failed relationships with INTP males are encouraged to give their stories, too.\n\nI don't know how to sum up my problems in one question. Any detailed or abstract summaries would help me understand, I think.\n\nI'm moving on, but it's hard without understanding what went wrong. Or, rather, WHY it went wrong.
3	I'm an ESFP female who's currently in a serious relationship with an INTP male. Even though our relationship is still going strong and not anywhere near ended, I can't deny that there are some real big differences between us that sometimes shine through and make things rather complicated. I don't consider myself an "overly attached girlfriend", but I DO need a certain (sometimes big...) amount of attention and support for my ideas and some lovey-dovey type of compliments once in a while, and if I don't get those things I can get extremely irritated and sometimes start fights without reason just to get some reaction out of this guy.\n\nI know this sounds utterly ridiculous and even mean, but I just can't help that I get so mad when things don't go my way that I wanna make him mad too. We've talked about it a lot and are always trying to find ways around it and it's working pretty good so far even though it gets exhausting sometimes. You mentioned that your exgirlfriend wore you out and I sometimes get the feeling that I'm wearing this INTP guy out aswell, with all my emotions flowing this and that way and my inability to handle them sometimes, making me act all crazy in some situations.\n\nSorry if this became a bit confusing and not relevant to your story at all, but I just wanted to give some thoughts on how our ESFP + INTP relationship is going. I hope your moving-on-process goes well! Take care!\n\n
2	I dunno if this will help but I do have a very good INTP friend, we have known each other since we can remember. So it is possible. It sounds like this woman was an immature version of her type, in which case it would be very hard to get along with any type who is immature.\n\nI do know that INTPs are very conflict avoidant, and even though ESFPs are allegedly too, we tend to cause more drama than we avoid. Could be this is why it went wrong. Maybe look for an older ESFP who has matured some.
2	My experience is slightly different from yours, but perhaps you can still relate. I am an INTP female who was "friends" with an ESFP female. She said all these wonderful things to me about how much she valued me and wanted to hang out. She told me she loved me. She never followed through on all her promises. Things became toxic. She ended the friendship by stating that she had never cared about me in the first place. She basically just led me on because she craved attention. So, from my experience, this pairing does not work AT ALL. I expect people to be honest and honor their word. Lying and hurting someone else in the pursuit of meeting your own emotional needs is something that I abhor. It is a terrible thing to do to another human being and an unhealthy way to live.  
1	I don't have any experience dating INTPs, but I want to reassure you that ESFP women aren't all sneaky and lousy at secure relationships. I have read a number of times that we aren't supposed to be great at chill, committed relationships, but I'm not convinced that's true. I agree with others that it seems like she may have some growing up to do, by what you've said.
1	Sorry about your loss. I'm an unmarried male INTJ, but maybe my perspective and experiences can help answer some of your questions. \n\nFirst, it's possible for any type to have either a good or bad relationship with any other type. Individual differences really make or break it here. That said, MB type can be a useful predictor of relationship compatibility. In my experience, N types, especially NTs, don't mesh well with S types in relationships. There can be a very strong attraction and good sex between the two types, but the connection rarely lasts due to vastly different ways of understanding the world and behavioral prioritization. \n\nYour experiences are not unique. I've dated xSFx types before with similar results - intense ups and downs, some good, lots of bad. Give yourself some time to get over this loss, which (to be blunt) probably isn't much of a loss anyway. In the future, it might help to remember that stable and fun relationships are where it's at, so if you're dating someone and the relationship is overly stressful and problematic without remedy, you owe it to yourself to end that relationship. You know why your recently-terminated relationship was problematic, now is the time to ask yourself why you put up with the pain and commit to not making that mistake again. 
0	Hey dead thread. I'm an INTP male. Just found out my girlfriend is an ESFP.\n\nOur relationship is definitely riddled with arguments, but still going (despite her trying to break up with my numerous times, usually over dumb shit). Thankfully she laughed at that.\n\nIt's not easy I guess. She's very attention seeking (she objected loudly), but never wants to give attention to me when I seek it (because her phone needs it more I guess).\n\nIt's not an easy pairing but sorry to say it worked for us. You just have to be hard headed (and not to stick your dick in crazy (whoops)).
5	Alcohol/Weed effect?	How do these things effect you? When I smoke weed I either become extremely talkative and interested in just about anything... but if i'm too high my inferior Ni kicks in and gets me paranoid about things. Alcohol however makes me more of an ESFP than I already am. Friends constantly ask me to go out or party with them cause they enjoy my presence. Maybe most SP types enjoy the effects of alcohol?\n\nDo either of these things cause you to act drastically different than what I am saying?
3	Weed occasionally makes me anxious in social situations especially around people I don't know very well. However when I'm alone it usually makes me euphoric, more creative and introspective and is therapeutic emotionally. Alcohol makes me more confident and less self conscious. Which, depending on my mood can make me very outgoing with no filter at all or just very content to be inside myself at peace. 
3	Booze makes me talk a lot. I get loud and am always looking for a conversation. I can't speak for smoking. 
3	The same happens to me to. Except that when I smoke, I almost immediately get paranoid. 
1	Weed makes me very sociable and I'll strike up conversations with just about anyone cool around me. Except on the rare occasion I get some bad shit and I wanna curl into a ball. Alcohol just kind of makes me less coordinated and blurry. I never feel like I'm drunk, only that I'm acting drunk. I don't care for it.
2	How effective is your future planning?	ESFP's are known for living in the moment, I personally feel future planning, specifically what I'll say makes it less authentic and makes it harder for conversation to flow naturally. Improvised situations just feel more natural and comfortable for me.
1	I mean it's good to have some idea of a future goal in life, if that's what you mean. Or at the very least some kinda backup plan. Unless you're just talking about daily stuff like conversation and whatnot, then yeah I would never think to plan that.
3	What bores you?	As an ESFP I feel that most things are interesting, depending on my mood quite a bit. What about you guys?
3	Routine
3	boring people. I work with generally interesting people from all walks of life which makes work bearable. but put me in a cubicle with 1009 zombies I die a lot
2	Listening to people people tell me that I can't go through life being as chill as I am now. Tbh I think they are just jealous. 
1	Small talk. When people insist on talking about the weather or ask me how my summer was for the tenth time because they have nothing else to say. It feels so utterly meaningless and I feel like I'm responding as mechanically as a robot.
1	How strong of an ESFP are you? And do these percentages make that much of a difference in our type?	So I just retested to see my percentage scores in each of the E S F P traits. Here is what I got:\nhttp://www.humanmetrics.com/hr/JTypesResult.aspx?EI=89&SN=62&TF=-62&JP=-78\n\ndo you think that these percentages matter that much with our type? I'm sure the "on the fence" ones matter\n\n
1	Uh. Idk man. You seem pretty cool to me though.
1	Percentages mean zilch. That's an unofficial test. MBTI types aren't graded on percentages.
3	How easily do you empathize with others?	As an ESFP I find it extremely difficult and often find myself being sympathetic instead which is hypocritical of me because I dislike being subject to sympathy and or pity. What do you guys think?
2	I actually feel exactly the same way as you do.   I don't often empathize with someone  unless their problem hits *really* close to home. \n\nThe way you worded this makes me want to reply with "are you me?" 
2	What is your hobby?	I am looking for a hobby. I have no preference when it comes to work or hobbies as long as I can have fun. Hopefully I can steal some of yours 
2	Take up an instrument
5	What do ESFPs look like?	This sub doesn't have a picture thread yet! Post a picture of yourself and show us what ESFPs look like!

3	My favourite ESFP is, without a doubt, Mac DeMarco.	
2	Music tastes? (Story-ish)	I'm an ESFP and my and my INTP boyfriend get into fights about music a LOT.\n\nI love any music that excites me, as might be expected, or that I can really relate to. Panic! at the Disco is my favorite band. Other faves include Dirty Heads, Walk the Moon, Twenty One Pilots, First Aid Kit, and Alt-J. I often end up enjoying shitty dance music.\n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend, who's an audio engineer (which makes him act like he's the authority on music), enjoys this sorta... progressive electronic music? He talks about the mixing of it and how it's like... logically good? He has me listen to it all the time, since my music is practically off-limits around him, but it's very rare that any of them actually stick in my head. In complete honesty his music bores me to tears, but in my mind, if he enjoys it he's free to enjoy it.\n\nHe does not feel the same. If my music taste comes up, he often tries to talk me out of enjoying it. Of course, this only accomplishes me getting really irritated with him. In his mind, it's totally objective, while to me it's almost entirely subjective.\n\nESFPs, or really any type who sees this, what kind of music do you like and how objective/subjective do you think music taste is?\n\n
3	As a fellow ESFP (and musician) I completely agree with your argument. I feel that every music has its merits, I try to never put down a genre or band that I don't listen to. I don't eat seafood, but I don't denounce it as a food because of this. Entirely subjective.\n\nI should add that my favourite type of music to listen to is rock, but have a soft spot for chart tracks for their catchy hooks. Would be interesting to see if other ESFP's are similar.
2	I listen to progressive rock and I completely agree with your boyfriend. I think that the taste for music is objective: it is based on your knowledge about armony, melody and rythm. \nOf course, sometimes I listen to Infected Mushroom or whatever kind of electro trance music just for fun. But when I listen to my favorite albums, all that matters is the sound and its structure. \nAs an ESFP I'm a very worried person about aesthetics and art, I feel that the sensual pleasures are my world and I must refine my taste in all that sensual pleasure involves.  
2	INTP here. I think the technicality of music is objective, but the enjoyment you garner from it is entirely subjective. For instance, there is some simple music that I love, and some technically complex music that I dislike. I know music theory, have been in chorus for 3 years, have been singing for 7 years, and screaming for 3. Complexity is impressive, but it isn't always enjoyable. I mainly listen to and perform -core (Metalcore, Djent, etc) genres, as well as many types of "genuine" Metal (Folk, Progressive, etc.). Some things I like are very instrumentally simple (For instance, Asking Alexandria), and some things I like are very complex (For instance, Periphery). Enjoyment is subjective, technicality is objective.

7	ESFP dating	What do you guys look for in the initial step of dating? I've read that the opposite of your dominant function is best. For us that would be that would be ISTJ or ISFJ. I personally love introverted girls
5	I want you to be happy. It sounds weird but I feed off others happiness and I will do whatever it takes to make them happy. I am VERY slow to judge people so please do not be afraid to talk to me or joke around with me. I live for that kind of thing. I don't care if you like skydiving or if you like reading. I just want to be able to enjoy my happiness with others. \n\nI do like it when she knows what she wants. I am an extremely easy going person and I enjoy basically every aspect of life. If you ask me where I want to go for food or what I want to do today 2/3 of the time I will say that I don't care and I want to do whatever you want to do. People mistake this as indesiciveness but I really don't have a presence and I WOULD like to just be with you doing whatever. 
4	Don't mind me, I'm just here for the comments...\n\n*fixes hair*
2	I'm dating an INTP, and have been for 4 years.\nWhat attracted me most was how forward he was. Looking back, he was really stepping out of his comfort zone. Initially, I'm way more attracted other E_F_ people because I can more easily start a conversation and get excited with/about them.\n\nLong-term wise, my boyfriend INT nature truly drives me nuts sometimes, and vice versa for him. I think if looking for a long-term relationship, ESFPs should be aware of how little Introverts may like the "jumping from extreme to extreme" lifestyle we have.
1	The opposite function of extraverted sensing is generally regarded as being introverted intuition.
5	As ESFP, how difficult is it for you to make major decisions?	
5	Easy peasy I think. I usually try to just jump right in and worry about the details as I go. Sometimes the decision you make is the wrong one but whatever, not like I died, and it's more productive than had I mulled it over forever anyway. 
4	At first it's difficult, until I impulse the decision and have no regrets. Ever 
4	I'll have a hard time deciding whether or not to do something until I tell myself "Just fucking do it" and I do. \nI do try to put a lot of thought into decisions that really effect my life... but I often get caught in a loop and don't actually make any progress. More often than not I look for validation in my decisions from someone.
3	I find it extremely difficult to make major decisions. I find myself unable to choose and will often default to the easier choice or let someone else decide for me. \nWith  insignificant choices I will usually just go with my first reaction but I also end up changing my mind a lot. I've realized that I can't make hardly any decisions in advance. Even if I have time to think it over I can't finalize my choice until I'm in the moment where I can't delay any longer. And I usually end up choosing the same option I would have chose initially. 
2	[deleted]
2	Surprising amount of variation here. I struggle with major decisions that involve renewed long-term commitment. Choosing a career path for example has been a nightmare because whenever I begin to commit to one, I feel that I'm missing out on certain "important" qualities and I swing quickly to another which offers them. Rinse and repeat a few weeks later.
2	uh im pretty shoot first. there are no questions later 
2	ESFP and depression	I know the chance of an actual ESFP answering this is slim to none, but I'll ask anyway. How does depression manifest itself for you? Do you withdraw, isolate? What are your thought processes?
6	Personally, I feel like I have done something wrong - I get this eerie feeling of 'what am I doing with my life'. It goes away after a while, though. 
3	When I'm depressed I withdraw from everyone I know and only want to spend time by myself. When I'm by myself I try to figure out what's causing it and then try to come up with a solution. I hate conflict though and my depression usually results from me avoiding inner conflict and it sometimes takes a while for me to realize what it is exactly. Also I often think my life is insignificant to the world and this makes me apathetic and lethargic which only makes the depression worse. When depressed I start questioning my identity and feel as if I'm a phony which could stem from insecurity about what others think of me. But I'm not quite sure. Anyway, you can definitely have depression as an Esfp! 
2	personally not introspective enough to be depressed 
2	I know this is a completely useless comment, I have no answers- I am on prozac and all that jazz- but I can relate . \n\nDepression hits hard and it manifests for me socially- I isolate, I can justify being alone for a week- (which is not a sane idea for an ESFP). \n\nMaybe its an ESFP thing but my depression finds me when I am alone and I realize if I spend my full time recognizing its shadow- that I will truly be terrified about the pointlessness of my life and how unhappy I maybe. Thankfully I sought help- but being as social as I was and as happy as I was- people had a very hard time recognizing that I was depressed and had even more trouble accepting it. \n\nAnyway- I am not sure I offered you anything here. But please don't be afraid to ask for help, don't let anyone belittle what you are feeling for the sheer reason that you seem happy on the outside. 
1	Esfp trying to date an enfp.	Is there anything I need to worry about or be aware of? My best friend is also an enfp but we get into fights because we are very different in how we perceive the rest of the world (our n and s) and she's also very selfish. I'm afraid my boyfriend and I might conflict like this.
2	meyers briggs isnt a tell all about a persons character;if you think a personality can be summed up in broad sweeping generalizations youre gonna have a bad time\n\nrather than using mbpt to determine what kind of person they are use it to find common grounds on which to build a relationship on. dont ever focus on the negatives
1	ENFP can sometimes be put off by ESFPs big personalities. We might see you as being obnoxious even if you're not intending to be. We like to discuss meaningful things, and really like the art of conversation. Sensing is our very last function and we do it internally, so it's hard for us to understand ESFP because as you said, we perceive the world differently.\n\nWhat are the things you and your friend clash about? Perhaps I can attempt to explain her thought process...
1	Once you guys are intimate enough to talk about this talk about it. Tell the other one what difficulties you have with your best friend and how you should deal if such things arise.\n\nTalk about sensing and intuition, how each feels about them and just go from there. Communication is a great way to prevent pent up things from blowing up!
6	What's it like having inferior Ni? Also dominant Se?	As an INTJ, with the reverse order of functions I am curious how your inferior and primary perceiving functions manifest and how they compare to an INTJs.  Also, my wife is ESFP, so I'm trying to gain better insight into how she ticks.
7	Hey dude, I'm also an INTJ but my fiancée is an ESFP.  First and foremost, ESFPs generally aren't into analyzing things much at all, let alone to the level of depth that we INTJs tend to.\n\nI'm starting off with this because, unfortunately, I doubt you're going to see much of a response to this post.  You're just asking for details that they're not really prone to caring about.  Even just MBTI in general is oftentimes more analytical than they'd prefer.\n\nSo in lieu of that, I'll try to pitch in here as much as I can, with what I've personally learned and discovered.  At least, that which I can put into words.\n\nI have found the pairing of ESFP and INTJ between me and my fiancée to be very natural and enriching.  As you're obviously already aware, we share the same cognitive functions... except in reverse order.  This is massively valuable.  We seem to be generally "on the same wave-length" most of the time, which I contribute heavily to the fact that ultimately we are using the same cognitive functions to make sense of the world and produce decisions.  However, we also complement each other very well, in the sense that A) she picks up my slack in terms of Se and I pick up hers in terms of Ni, but also -- and more importantly -- B) we are continually learning from each other how to better utilize our inferior functions.  Which is to say, while she's picking up my Se slack, I'm also learning from her the value of Se and absorbing some of those tendencies.  (And vice versa.)\n\nTo get a bit more specific about how we compare?  Well for instance, much as I like to think I'm a very observant person, recognizing patterns in things and people that others don't see, she sees much more depth into the truth behind people, interpreting their words and their actions, to a degree of which I am simply incapable.  Many times I have felt certain I knew exactly what was going on and what I thought somebody "actually meant" when they said "XYZ," but she would contradict me, and she would be right.  Perhaps that is an overly convoluted example, but the point is... even though I can see patterns, and I try to apply that pattern recognition to **people**, she still just _gets people_ far better than I do.\n\nAs INTJs, our minds are very abstract and we think about things in this weirdly disconnected way that nobody else thinks about them.  ESFPs, as you would expect, are precisely the opposite.  They prefer the concrete, the tactile.  Another anecdote... I'm a programmer.  I don't know if you're very familiar with programming, but it can become _incredibly_ abstract.  I've been helping my fiancée learn to program every once in a while, and she can now usually handle the linear stuff fairly easily... but once you start stepping back and making things abstract (such as functions, or worse, classes) she begins to struggle.  By the same token, she perceives the world in a much more _direct_ way than I do.  I'm off in some distant corner of my head 90% of the time, but she's the one keeping me grounded here.  I'd forget to eat or sleep if it weren't for her (and that happens, when she's not around).\n\nThat's what I've got for now.  I might pop by again later if anything else occurs to me.  If you have any more specific questions, please let me know and I'll try to oblige. :)
3	Hi! I saw this post before and have been meaning to sit down and type up my response, sorry for taking so long!  \n  \nPlease keep in mind that my personal interests and priorities may be different from your wife’s. Also I’ve only been learning about MBTI for a little while so I might not be spot on. Feel free to critique, I can’t give broad generalizations since each person is different from the next but I can give you my personal view and hopefully it can shed some light.  \n  \nSo the ESFP cognitive functions are the opposite of an INTJ. In order they are Se/Fi/Te/Ni.  \n  \nSo this is the process which I usually use to synthesize information and come to conclusions about the world around me.  \n  \n**Outward Sensing (Se)**  \nI take in stimuli, such as seeing things, facts that people tell me, etc. This is the basis and the “food” that I am working with. Many times conclusions stop here. Some examples of this are:  \n  \nStimuli #1: See a ring on someone’s hand  \nConclusion: S/he must be married  \n  \nStimuli #2: See someone walking around with a full cup of starbucks  \nConclusion: There must be a starbucks pretty close by  \n  \nStimuli #3: Lamp doesn’t turn on  \nConclusion: Power out or lightbulb burned out  \n  \nSimple connections like that. Imagine all of these, but maybe multiply by 3 and that’s how many things I will notice at any given time. I don’t notice everything, I could see what color shirt you are wearing but completely miss what color your eyes are or vice versa. Or that you have thick eyebrows or a scar somewhere. I don’t think this is restricted to ESFPs but more like selective attention. If I am tired I will notice less, if I am in a new place or meeting someone unfamiliar I will notice more. Also note that I am making a lot of mental connections at a time, and because of that a lot of times they do not have much value and thus do not cause any motivation for action. Sure there may be a starbucks in the vicinity but unless I am really craving starbucks I will not actively seek it out. Same with the example of the burnt out lightbulb. I have noticed that the lightbulb may be burnt out but I will most likely not change it right away instead mentally noting that it is something I need to do later.  \n  \nA lot of things to me are considered “solved” at this point after I’ve applied Se. Some will go on and apply Fi and Te (they kind of go hand in hand). Very rarely will a problem be serious or unsolvable enough to need me to use Ni. Keep in mind that little things like this which the conclusions stop here after outward sensing are those that don’t have anything to do with me and only have to do with the physical environment so I am impartial to them since they do not make me make a decision that will change my schedule or involve my feelings.  \n\nAnother example is that I am writing this up but just now I noticed that my keyboard is dusty. I typed a little more to finish my sentence and then proceeded to clean the dust off my keyboard before resuming typing. Other things that happen are I realize I need to shave my legs while I’m browsing the internet, browse the topic a little bit more, leave the tabs open so that I can go shave but also go back to it when I finish. Other things are I might realize I really need to use the bathroom and go do that or I just suddenly want to check my face in the mirror to make sure it looks okay. Or I’ll feel hungry and open the refrigerator to see if there’s anything to eat. I may or may not actually make something to eat. This also may happen three or four times within two hours and I may actually make something to eat either out of hunger, the fact that it’s a bit ridiculous that I’ve opened the refrigerator door four times or to stop myself from checking the refrigerator again. There are a few times when I will be so into what I’m doing that I don’t notice things around me but it happens very very rarely. Usually my eyes will wander and notice things around the room or I will get up and subconsciously check on other rooms or other people who are around me (ie. notice their facial expression or what they are doing at the time) for example if someone is reading a book and smiling, I will probably notice so that if someone else asks “have you seen so-and-so” I will be able to respond “oh s/he was sitting on the couch reading a book” Usually the order that I get to things is based on how I prioritize things (work/friends/order in which the problem was addressed/how urgent it is eg when I need to get it done by/how much time it will take to complete/if I have to finish one task first because the second depends on the outcome of the first) A lot of times I will forget and need another message to pop up (eg. stimuli) for me to get to it. \n
1	Why don't you tell us about your wife seeing we are all INTJs here too?

3	If I wanted to date an ESFP girl, how would I spot one and what should I watch out for?	I've been realizing that most of my closest friends are ESFPs, and though it seems nerdy to use MB types to date, it couldn't hurt to see what this looks like romantically-speaking.\n\nI'm an ENTP, so it makes sense to be with someone who is spontaneous and likes people the way I do, but balances me out with the feeling stuff and and approaches the world a little less chaotically than I do.\n\nHow do I spot girls that are ESFPs without killing their interest by talking about Myers Briggs.
2	I am an ESFP and I would love to talk to you about science. I had a hard time in school but science still interests me. The most important thing is to just act relaxed. There is no reason to be nervous. When others come up to me and talk with me I automatically think we are great friends. I am a dude though so I won't be dating you anytime soon.
3	Correct me if I'm wrong, but 1) life of the party\n\n2) don't like school\n\n3) type 7 or type 2 enneagram\n\n4) likes attention
1	I'm an ESFP girl, and I agree with what's been said here, mostly.  I love school, though. But I definitely agree with the person who said they think everyone is their friend. I love talking to everyone and collecting new friends and ideas, but I'm really sensitive about a lot of things. I may be making a bold statement here, but for me, the most important thing about dating an ESFP is respecting their feelings. Don't belittle them. ESFPs love people but are easily hurt by them as well. It's like an extrovert/introvert combo. Haha. ESFP girls (and guys) are really empathetic and like to help people or keep the peace. I think an ESFP/ENTP relationship would be a good idea, because personally I'm always looking for someone to keep me balanced and level-headed when I get overwhelmed.  Good luck!
2	Is Chris Taylor an ESFP?	Hi, INTJ here. I am working on my ESFP-identification skills and want to know what you think about Chris Taylor if you have the time.\n\nHere is a 24 minutes long interview with him: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5abbTOzs_Vc&list=PLzsTvqyBRGv2HNUFi5XMhDnflvMm9Ll_h&feature=share&index=3
1	After watching the last video on the playlist I am in doubt between ESFP and ENFP.
6	ESFP ISFP relationship problems, 7 months of continuous back and forth. *rant*	Hey there everyone, I've taken the test once again and I've gone from ENFJ to ESFP. I guess I identify more with ESFP according to what I've read online.\n\nAnyways, I've been talking to this girl (ISFP), for about 7 months. Our relationship has been really off. She feels like she wants to be with me sometimes and others she doesn't, so its constantly back and forth for 7 months, every time I try to let her go we end up being drawn back to each other and she goes back to the unsure feelings.\n\nIt's to the point where she's unhappy and stressed out all the time because she doesn't know how she feels and ends up telling me she feels so much better when she gets away from me. It's irritating because I'm not doing anything, and I've told her that none of this is my fault, and that it's all her mind that's making her problems. She knows, but says a lot of it is BECAUSE of me. So she says she's "Don't trying to have feelings" for me. Which again.. irritating.\n\nEveryone says move on, I know that's the 100% surefire way to get over this issue, but it doesn't work for us, We've tried NC, we've had "space", and tried talking to other people, but she gets super jealous when I talk to anyone, even if its just a friend on Facebook...\n\n\nHer plight is this, "I don't want to lose you, and what we have, and some days you're what I like in someone, and others your not. I have feelings for you, but deep down I just don't feel it, and I don't feel like I want to be with you because I'm not excited by the idea"\n\n"So.. If that's how you feel, why are you still around?"\n\n"IDK"\n\n\nAre ESFP, and ISFP even compatible? We're really similar and we do have an amazing time together, really the only time things get irritating and shitty is when she starts to second guess her feelings. It just puts me through hell because one day the girl that I'm in love with is feeling things for me and its wonderful, but then at the drop of a pin somethings wrong and she is turned off by me and then things get complicated..\n\nand the contradicting, holy shit. She contradicts herself on so many things. I love all her flaws, but this is one that I have a hard time accepting. Especially when all of her contradicting thoughts are about how she feels about me.\n\n"I want to be with him"\n"I don't want to be with him"\n"I have feelings for him"\n"But I don't feel for him"\n"I don't want to lose him, but I don't want to be with him I don't think"\n\nAH, it just frustrates me even thinking about it. Before I'd get all hurt and depressed and upset. Even now when she starts saying things like "I'm just done trying" or "this just needs to end" it makes my stomach sink, but my main feelings are just "Holy shit this is stupid and annoying, I'm not an item or a second option to you."\n\nBut neither of us can walk away. Whenever I get to that point where I feel like I can, something happens and I end up getting back into her. \n\n\nThe "way" that I am that she likes, really only comes when I feel like she's into the relationship. Like shes committed or invested in a way. Or if I'm stressed out, or after an argument. \n\nI guess the shadow type for ESFP is INTJ, which she's drawn to. \n\nIdk. I'm sure you're all going to say just drop her and move on. I just needed to rant. \n\nBut if you guys have any other advice on how to help her make up her mind I'd be more than happy to hear it.\n\n\n\nTL;DR: I'm in love with an ISFP that doesn't know what she wants, or how to feel about me and its been going on for 7 months. 
2	Hopefully all of you read this comment, as its me in a calm state of mind, and completely open with my feelings, as well as my thoughts and desires.\n\nShe's said to me that sometimes I'm not what she wants, and that I don't make her happy or excited, and her conflicting feelings I can see make her extremely miserable. \n\nI love her dearly, and I hate to see her like that, and I want the best for her. I want her to be the happiest she can be, even if that means having to leave her life. As much as I don't want to do that.. if it's the only thing that would make her happy, I'd be prepared to do so. \n\n\nAlthough, as stubborn as she is sometimes, I know that I hold a very dear spot in her heart. I love her to death. I hope she finds peace in all this, and figures out what she wants.\n\n\nAll her life, she's been left to her own problems. No one willing to really help, instead, would rather wait for her to figure herself out. She's not had a rolemodel, she's not had someone to set an example for her.\n\nAs much as I know this ISN'T my responsibility as a person, it IS my responsibility as a potential S/O. It's something that I want to do for her, and I hope that in doing so, it helps her further understand her desires, and what she really wants in life. I don't want to hold her hand, because ultimately there are things in her life that she's going to have to face without me. She'll have to be strong, and independent when that time comes. But I want her to know that she isn't going to be alone. That I'm always going to be here for her. Even if she's mad and ends up hating me for whatever reason, my love for her isn't going to subside, nor do I feel like hers will for me. \n\nI want to help her grow, and walk with her, as opposed to walking above her like everyone else seems to want to do. I genuinely want her to see how much self worth she has instead of constantly thinking she's not good enough for anything, or anyone. No matter how much shit I'll have to walk through. I'm patient, I'm in no hurry. I might not even end up with her in the end. But, with whatever time I have with her, I'd rather make it productive to help her along in life.\n\n\nThat is the extent of my love.
1	Oh my.  I feel for you on how difficult this must be.  I have no decent advice, sorry.  xSFP love sounds confusing and exciting all whirling around at the same time.
1	Oh man, I am going through the same thing with a guy ISFP, If you find an answer let me know. 
1	Esfp here. I'm going to have to PM my response to you, as this sounds extremely similar to something I've dealt with 
1	She wants you to go away...but doesn't really have the guts or the maturity to go through with it... just do it for her.
1	I literally had the exactly same thing happening to me last year with my best friend. She finally became so pissed of at me that we stopped talking for about 2 months, and then got back together. \n\nWe now communicate alot more, tell each-other exactly\nhow we feel and we really make US happy now. The sex is also like 1000x better.\n\n\nIt was probably the best thing that could happen to us and were closer than ever, i suggest you do the same.\n
3	Do ESFPs like to dance?	My ESFP wife hates to dance, and I have heard this about another ESFP as well from a friend.  Do any of you like to dance or do you hate it also?  Curious if this is a type specific trait.
6	Hmm.  In my experience, yes.  Maybe they've developed an insecurity about it? My ESFP daughter is constantly spinning,  jumping, dancing, singing, drawing, etc.  CONSTANTLY.  She can't stop.   She does it absent mindedly.
4	I freaking love to dance. I dance every time I go to a club and most every time I go to a bar with music. I much prefer to dance with another person, nothing overtly sexual just standard club dancing, but I'm also not opposed to dancing by myself. I'm not particularly good at it but I can't really help it, it's like an instinctual thing for me. 
3	I love to dance in my own space but I need a couple of drinks to dance in public
3	I fucking love to dance. I'm always the idiot breaking a sweat in the middle of the dance floor. 
3	I've never been widely confident about my looks or dancing ability, and I've never been one for 'girly' activities, but even I love dancing when I'm alone or watching dance shows. Something about it. It feels like some amazing combination of expressing yourself and hands-on activities.
3	I dance. I dance a lot. I learn dances rather quickly, too. I'm not a country music fan but went to a country bar and two-stepped the night away.
1	When I go to bars my ESTP friends and I will dance making it look like we're serious, but we really just do it to impress the ladies. Without alcohol... I hate to dance. 
1	I could dance my shoes off if I wasn't a fat blob who gets aches everywhere when dancing to one song. So yeah I love dancing.
1	I'm a dancing demon :) Ever since I started (about 3 years ago) I'm coming to dancing parties first and leave the last.
1	I'm latin so yea. Dancing is very important! Love it, need it, gotta have it!!
1	Studying as ESFP	Hi. I am currently in a phase of self-discovery. I have recently discovered that I am ESFP and was able to come to terms with things I am unhappy about. I am a first year psychology and computer science student.\n\nI entered the university with a low expectation of myself - in many ways - as I had rather unhappy time in high school. In high school, I did terribly in my study, partially because I was not happy, but mostly because I am not very good at sticking with plans and pushing myself when I could go out and watch a movie or dedicate my time in practicing for the musical that I had a lead in.\n\nEven though I want to use this oppertunity further educate myself and become a better individual in general, since studying has never been a strong suit for me, I am facing the same situation as I did in high school, where I am not studying because I've never really done it properly.\n\nAccording to ESFP description, we are not very good with academic stuff because we are more interested in being in attention and pleasure, and generally just not logical or persistent.\n\nMaybe I am giving the test too much credit. However, most things described in the ESFP page was true to me. And I want to know if any ESFP was able to really push themselves academically, and if so, how they did it. If you have any study experience as ESFP, please share it here for me. I just want to know what other ESFP has done.
3	I found this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72OW1F8ouvA) to be helpful. \n\nAlso, remember that whatever is noted online about ESFPs is regarding your "tendencies". You're not always being non-attentive, illogical, etc. \n\nLastly, the fact that you are taking the time to learn about your MBTI will help you by identifying your possible triggers into procrastination and overall lack of proper studying. 
1	I've been thinking about responding to this for a while, but it is a hard question to answer. Just thinking about this topic makes me a bit anxious. I've managed to make it to my Master's degree and I find myself surrounded by people who have their shit together to a degree that I can only fantasize about. My academic history is riddled with disappointments where I can remember just fucking off before the exam. uuggghh. THE SHAME.\n\nI wish I had tried harder in University, so I could have been eligible for more grants and scholarships in my Masters. I don't really expect that to motivate you, as it wouldn't have motivated me. \n\nThe best advice I have is to use your passions as much as you can. Let them lead you and motivate you as much as you can within your field. When you are selling yourself, sell your passion. Professors and Industry leaders want that in students and employees.\n\nAnd halonut's advice is really good as well. Don't use MBTI personality typing as an excuse, but a road map to improvement. \n
1	INFJ here, I have an extraversion question	I'm an introvert, but I've pushed myself and become more ambiverted over the last couple of years. I willingly engage myself in more social activities, because it's not that I don't like to talk to people, I just don't like to talk to people about things that aren't interesting or stimulating (to me). I'm a very deep thinker and I find if I can have really deep, intellectual/philosophical conversations, they actually kind of re-energize me, but if someone wants to tell me about what happened on any given reality TV show the night before, zzzzzzzzzz. That's not to say that all extraverts are shallow, I know this isn't true, I *am* curious how many extraverts also like deep, stimulating conversation, or if it's more just a sense of connecting/relating to someone, regardless of the subject matter?\n\nAnyways, some weeks, there are events almost every night after work that I would like to go to, but I have a limit, and this can be frustrating especially when say there are 4 events and 2 of them I'm not sure how taxing they will be so I don't want to go, not enjoy it as much as I thought I might, and then be too tired the next night for something I really do want to go to.\n\nI thought to myself the other day "man, Extraverts must be like the energizer bunny, they can go out every night and have fun and almost never have to worry about their battery running out".\n\nBut I know there's more to it than that. So, what are your limits, what tires you out and do you actually like going out all the time?\n\nThanks in advance for the insight :)
6	It's funny that you say having deep stimulating conversations somewhat re-energizes you because that's how I (an extrovert) feel about almost all social interaction. No matter how tired I am I know that once I get out to whatever party/event I'm going too I'll be immediately swept away by the atmosphere and the moment then forget that I'm exhausted. \n\nSo I wish I could offer you a better explanation than just "I'm extroverted because I like being around people" but that's basically exactly what it is. \n\nAs far as the deep intellectually stimulating conversations I do really enjoy those, but if I'm gunna be honest, I only like them in very small get togethers. 2 or 3 other people max. If I'm in groups of more than that I would rather be bouncing around to more 'shallow' conversations with everybody so that no one feels left out and I get a better opportunity to build relationships with everyone there. 
3	First of all, I know two INFJs, both are amazing individuals and I cherish every moment with your type.\n\nyou seem like a hard introvert which out of the two INFJs I know, one of them is a very very hard I\n\nyour type has a predetermined schedule at all times it seems, however you feed off the the emotions of others.. and I love that because when I know you're INFJ, I am only catering toward making things better for you all. \n\nI have no limits, lack of sleep tires me, I will constantly be involved in any social activity and I will be extremely talkative and engaged with the group, it's hard to explain why but I just absolutely love it. \n\nas an INFJ I know this is so confusing to you, but I highly respect your type, your work ethic, and the way that you treat people. As an F male, both INFJs I know are also males. I love meeting other F males because they see most things on the same level as I do, and that is very admirable for us males who are generally T dominating types.  
4	ESFPs with ADHD	I'm an ESFP with ADHD. This can sometimes be a hard combo. How do you deal with this. Do you have methods you use to make life a bit easier for you?
5	I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was younger, however I only took meds for about a year. I'm unsure why I stopped, but I remember my mother asking me in third grade if I felt they helped. I didn't really know what the medicine was supposed to do in the first place at that age.\n\nAnyway, a lot of the problems I encounter on a day to day basis are memory problems. Certain things catch my attention, where as others do not. I currently have a pile of laundry to do, bills to pay, a party I could attend, among assorted other tasks I'm putting off.\n\nI'm not sure exactly how ADHD has affected your life, but I know a couple of things that help me. Making lists, and actually doing those rather than things you WANT to do. Making programs and sticking to them. Now, I know it's hard to do this, especially for myself, so it takes a level of emotional commitment to really see these things through.\n\nAs I've grown older, I've grown more sedentary. I stay at home and play video games, the only thing that really grabs my attention for long periods of time, mostly to a bad extent. Whatever you're comfortable doing, stop doing it and just get out there and enjoy life. Do things that you wouldn't see yourself doing normally. Pick up a class, start a hobby, hang out with friends more. Try to work towards getting more responsibilities in work so you're never just sitting around being bored. Strive for more. Put more on your plate so you can switch from one to another getting all of that shit done.\n\nI don't really know where you have problems in life, however I know my own faults and this shpiel is just from what I know. Also, this is just a stream of consciousness while I take a break from gaming :P Where do you think you're missing out on life?
3	You have one advantage and one disadvantage in terms of ADHD, if my guess is right.\n\nAs a feeler, it's hard to not take the challenges personally. You're hard on yourself about what you see as failures and see them as a reflection on your character. Try to step back and see your habits the way you might see problem skin or frizzy hair. Don't equate ADHD to character issues; just a challenge that you need to be aware of and take actions to keep in check.\n\nAs a sensor, you have a huge advantage in habit forming and following systems. Once you have identified a process to keep ADHD in check, which may include medication, then you will do much better than an intuitor at sticking to the process.
2	I just go about my day as best I can. My pills make me feel sick so I don't take them. I just try my hardest and at the end if the day I realize that I tried and that is good enough for me
2	Though it takes a lot of effort, I try to force myself into creating easy routines that I won't break because they become mindless. Meds have definitely helped me feel motivated enough, which made this process somewhat easier for me. 
2	Ironically enough, most of my ADHD related issues (aside from the extreme inability to sit in one place and do one thing for an extended amount of time) come from being in crowds.  When I'm in a situation where there are a lot of people or there's a lot of stuff going on, and one person is talking to me, I cannot focus on them. I'm listening, I know exactly what they're saying and how to respond, but I can't keep my eyes on their face. I'm constantly scanning what's going on around me. I've come to remedy this two ways. 1) I've told my close friends about this problem and I remind them often when I'm talking to them in these situations that even if I'm not looking at them, I'm absolutely listening. And 2) I've worked really hard on focusing as much as I can on the person I'm talking to. It usually means drawing a triangle with my eyes from one to the other, then to their nose, then to an eye, to the other, to the nose, etc. It keeps my eyes moving, but the movement is imperceptible to the person, so it just looks like I'm only focused on them. Score.
1	ADHD Esfp here, with a mixture of laziness as well. I have a prescription for adderall that works well for my studies, other than that, personal motivation and drive is all I can say
3	Bursts of Rage?	So I'm a mellow ass guy, I'm happy to take bull shit if it means avoiding confrontation (something I'm currently working to change), but my anger always seems to come out in a sharp, intense burst which last no more thant a second or two. But by then the damage is usually done, I just launch shit at walls or at other shit (Never at people) but the ammount of holes in my walls is just stupid. \n\nSo, do I have anger problems? Is this sort of explosive anger common in ESFP's? Do I just need to wank more??
4	can confirm. punched a hole through my wall, and I am normally pretty calm and/or outgoing in most situations.
5	You need to perceive the stress earlier and take a deep breath or something Instead of letting your rage fill up and burst later.
3	I get the same thing. I'm a very calm person usually, however when something or someone pushes me over the edge I do explode spectacularly. I've been known to punch holes in my wooden door, often injuring my hand in the process. Same as you, as soon as that happens I revert back to being calmer. \n\nI just need a punching bag in my room.
2	I guess when someone does something redundant that I've made it clear annoys me I can kinda freak out. I get bursts of rage when I'm tired I suppose.
5	Are ESFP's non-confrontational or 'Push overs'?	I'm new to this site and personality typing so excuse my general noobiness, but I don't recall reading anywhere relating to ESFP's avoiding confrontation or letting things slide when they really shouldn't. I do know that a lot of us find we aren't taken seriously though, which might be related. I'm just wondering if this is more prominent in myself, being a little under confident as a person, but I just hate the idea of upsetting people or feeling as though they'll dislike me for solidifying my point and rejecting what they're doing, even though rationally I know I take bullshit all the time and I dont dislike that person because of that... \n\nSo yeah, anyone get what I'm on about?? :)

2	My wife is ESFP and she doesn't take crap from anyone and is one of the most argumentative and stubborn people I know, lol.
1	/u/cloop417 posted this great summary a few days ago: https://type-coach.com/esfp. It has the line "Highly averse to conflict or tension, ESFPs go well out of their way to maintain harmonious relationships and avoid confrontation." I definitely think it is typical! I'm fine debating factual things, but when it gets personal or heated I will avoid it like the plague.
6	Best Description of ESFP	
2	That is really bang on. INTJ is pretty accurate as well, judging by my fiance. Good find!
1	I love reading stuff like this.\nFrighteningly accurate.
3	How to teach a highly abstract topic to an ESFP.	I'm an INTJ programmer, and my roommate is an ESFP artist. I'm helping her with her required programming class. As you might imagine, it has been quite a struggle for her to grasp the highly abstract nature of programming. It also doesn't help that this is one of her last classes. She is very burned out by college, and her primary worry is on finding employment, and not on her last classes.\n\nDespite this, when I come to help her, she will be very attentive, and try her hardest to understand what is going on. Of course I'm not expecting her to become a pro at this, but I do want to do what I can to help her as much as I can since she is struggling A LOT.\n\nThe main issue I see is that most of the time she can understand very simple concepts by themselves, but only in a very specific circumstance, and fail to learn the pattern and reason behind that concept. To put it in more concrete terms (and ridiculously simplified example): she will understand that "2 + 2 = 4" after seeing an example of 4 things together, but afterwards, when ask to put the sumation of 2 and 3, she will be lost, and unable to relate that to the prevous example.\n\nI hope I expressed my problem clearly. Is there anybody here that has come across a similar situation? What strategies did you use to be able to learn easier?
2	I am also an INTJ programmer and my fiancee is an ESFP artist/biologist. She occasionally becomes interested in learning programming, both for professional purposes (building websites, or games) and also to better understand and appreciate what I do (she's so great).\n\nShe's pretty comfortable with simple concepts such as arrays or the distinctions between different primitive types, but once you start getting into OOP she begins to have a harder time conceptualizing the more abstract class vs. object vs. function/method distinctions. (She also tends to forget her semicolons... I wonder if that's due to a more urgent "let's get this done and try it out right naow" sort of mindset.)\n\nWe talked about it, and /u/Kafke is definitely right that you should try to use as many real-life analogies as possible. I like to compare classes to blueprints or schematics, while objects are the actual **things** created *based on* those blueprints. Methods are actions that those things are capable of *doing*, e.g. a Car is able to "drive," "turnOnRadio," "openDoor," "lock," etc. I have found this approach to be somewhat successful, but not perfect, so I'm still learning the best ways to communicate. I also recently compared constructors to "a machine that can convert a blueprint into the end-product, e.g. 'construct' the actual car" to explain why it's a method that looks like a class (has the same name). It was not a perfect analogy and made me realize that constructors are surprisingly difficult to explain.\n\nThis is a very interesting topic to me and I would love to work together on finding the best ways to communicate these abstract concepts, and continue sharing our results!
1	How I learned to program, and how I teach people, is by using analogies to physical real-life things. So an array would be related to mailboxes.\n\nMost of programming lines up to physical things. And really, the only thing you need to teach past that is the "grammar" of the programming language (write lines, end with a ';', if's, loops, etc).\n\nThough, I'm an ISTP, so that might not be the best way to teach an ESFP.
1	One idea is to make the best use out of her existing material. Which exercises and lessons does she have to comply with? This stuff should hopefully be at entry-level and gone over in class already.\n\nWhat I mean here is: instead of trying to get this huge overarching INTJ scheme of yours into her head just act as a coach for her to get her homework done. Don't even code.
1	INTP with an ESFP sister	Hi!  As the title said, I'm an INTP and my sister is an ESFP.  Do these two personalities naturally disagree with each other?  When we were younger we fought constantly and she's always been attebtion-seeking.  She'll do whatever she has to do for attention and I see through it, but no one else does.  I'm not trying to offend any of you, but is this behavior common for ESFPs and for anyone that has an INTP brother, is fighting common between the two types?
4	Maybe either you or your sister are just a pain in the ass.  That seems more likely than a vast, cosmic incompatibility.
2	Have you considered Socionics? Se-Fi and Ti-Ne are considered conflict partners, which means they constantly misunderstand each other and hurt each other.
2	I'm not taking offense to, however your question did seem pretty negatively presented. \n\nI guess you could say we 'do whatever we can for attention' but in reality it's because we truly enjoy the company and presence of others. We love being around people and being considered part of their daily experience if only for a moment. \n\nA lot of people get this confused with pride and greed. Also insecurity and self doubt but in reality I find it to be the opposite. Sure there are people out there who just want others attention to make them feel better but me and ll my ESFP friends just love having a good time. And if nobody is presenting a situation for a good time, then we make one. 
1	For me, I simply agree to disagree if an xNTP is pressing their opinion on something with me 
1	Yeaaah. I have a good friend who is a INTP and even though we share very similar interests we fight all the time because we have completely different values. We just don't talk too deep about anything anymore because that gets in the way of fun when we hang out. And who cares if anyone is an attention seeker? As long as they are not hurting you - and I presume your sister never stole your moment of fame or anything - attention seeking isn't a bad thing. She'll grow out of it so dw.\n\nPs. Lol just to give you some prospective, my friend thinks a lot of the things I do is fake because they are dependent on what others think about it. But I only go with the majority because more often than not, the main stream option works and I think having something that works in real life is more practical than blindlessly sticking to an ideal. Ideals are something that can change at any time you know?
3	intp here - you guys are great at having fun and doing stuff - can you explain how to do this to me like I'm five?	I'm a woman who dated an esfp guy - he was fun, but I always felt like he was putting me in a weird position where he almost wanted me to parent him or something.  The relationship didn't last long, but he was a good guy.  One thing I admire about him is that I know he will have no regrets on his death bed as he is certainly living a full life of adventure/pleasure/fun.  I figure I should maybe learn to do more of that stuff in my life time, but the logistic confuse me - HOW do I do it?
2	It's kind of a hard to explain how out brains process things. Our entire mindset is so fun and loving that we think there is no other way to act. I guess the best answer has to do with our mindset. INTPs are really interesting for me, I don't know if I'd date one but whenever I think I've spotted an INTP I always break their shell and pretty much get them involved in any conversation. It's a fun skill to have. I guess a good way to experience an ESFP mindset would be to go out drinking and to be super outgoing and emotional with the people you talk to. 
1	If his priority in life is pleasure it is very unlikely he will have few or less regrets in his deathbed. This means respect, planning, caution, common sense and all of these nice stuff come second.
10	Any ESFP's married to an INTJ?	I'm an INTJ married to an ESFP.  Just curious to know if any ESFP's are in the same situation and what your experiences have been like.  I want to try and see things from the other side of the equation.
5	ENTP here with an INTJ dad and brother whom both married an ESFP lady.  I maybe able to help from a third person point of view.  Seems like a crux of their relationship is that the ESFP has to be open about their feelings but then let go so the INTJ can make plans with the information.  
3	I'm an ENTJ (with the E being bordeline with I) and my girlfriend is an ESFP. She's wonderful, the relationship takes a lot of work but it doesn't really feel that way.\n\nWe have been together for a year and we have learned a lot about each other but being so different there were issues and lots of misunderstandings.\n\nOne very important thing is that she has learned to be very clear with her feelings. If something bothers her she will tell me exactly what and how.\n\nIn the beginning she would just act moody, I would completely failed to pick up the hint and think everything was normal, she would get even more pissed off and think I was purposefully ignoring her until she finally would burst with a bunch of repressed emotions to which I could only answer "Well why didn't you just said so"?\n\nI've also become better at understanding that she doesn't always mean what she says. I used to drive me crazy, one minute she would say "I want to go skiing" and the next minute it was "I want to stay home". I didn't understand that she was processing her feelings by talking out loud. For NT types what you say it's a fact and to me it sounded like she was changing her mind every second and I felt overwhelmed with information that I didn't know what to do with.\n\nWe always have a blast, we complement each other with things we couldn't achieve on our own. She helps me be more in touch with other people's feelings (ENTJS are almost robots in that regard) and I help her structure her goals. We make a good team.\n\nTry not to kill your partner, we're good guys and we care A LOT about our partners. We just suck at making it evident.\n
3	Hello. Im an male INTJ and my girlfriend is an ESFP.\nWe have been together for 2 years now.\nOur relationship is great. Ofcours we fight sometime, but all cupples do right. I thing I noticed is that I allways wants to make plans for the day or for tomorow, or even the week. And she only wants to improvise or do things spotant.\nIs INTJ and ESFP a comon combination?
3	I'm an ESFP dating an INTJ for a little over 3 years now. We were friends through out high school first then started dating after we graduated. \nMy boyfriend is very introverted while my social anxiety (& other illnesses) make me more of a homebody. We work very well together. He tells me I'm unlike any other person he's ever met & we are highly compatible despite what the internet says about INTJ ESFP relationships. \nI also have many close friends who are INTJs (Apparently I seek them out) and we get along well because I'm understanding of our differences.\nDeep down I envy my partner's personality type & his ability to manage his feelings better than me. I feel that he's smarter than I  am but he loves me just the same, he says that I have a light in me that draws others to me. Maybe that's why I'm so attracted to befriending introverts.\n\n\nEdit: grammar... swype is hard lol
2	I'm engaged to an INTJ man, and we discuss this sort of thing pretty frequently. I'd love to give my perspective on whatever you are wondering about!

1	I'm currently dating another ESFP. It's interesting to say the least!

1	My parents are INTJ and ESFP.\n\nThey were toghether for about 10 years and divorced when I was young. I still have absolutely no idea why they ever got together; They're not compatible people at all.\n\nGod speed.
3	So I took the test and I have no idea what this means.	ESFP  \nExtravert(22%)  Sensing(1%)  Feeling(25%)  Perceiving(56)%  \nYou have slight preference of Extraversion over Introversion (22%)  \nYou have marginal or no preference of Sensing over Intuition (1%)  \nYou have moderate preference of Feeling over Thinking (25%)  \nYou have moderate preference of Perceiving over Judging (56%)  \n\n\nWhat is any of this s'posed to mean?
2	Go [here](http://www.25quiz.com) and do the test. Other online tests are unreliable and are letter based, not function based. The results you posted mean nothing.
1	I would suggest going [here.](http://personalitycafe.com/whats-my-personality-type/) You can fill out a questionnaire and get typed by humans. It's decidedly more accurate than any test.
1	I'm on my phone and when I get home if no one else has answered I'll type one out for you 
2	What do you do?	Most of us have read articles talking about the best suited careers for our personality type and I thought it would be interesting to see how similar or different we are to those articles. \n\nSo what do you do (or want to do) for your career? 
2	Work with intellectually disabled adults. And you? 
3	I'm a pilot in the USAF. I might not satisfy the entertainer need of ESFP's but I do love the adventure and the travel! 
3	I'm a boring stay at home mom! I have a few crafty hobbies. 
2	Honestly I would really enjoy being in Human Resources. That is where the real money is and you get to travel all over the world!! But I may stick to Elementary Education. Because I feel like that would be the best way to go. Considering I want a family and I wouldn't be an amazing mom if I went ahead and did what i want  (:\n  
2	Haha all the jobs mentioned so far sound awesome. I guess that's what happens with like minded people!\n\nI'm studying to be a medical/scientific illustrator. I mainly do comics and  hope to work on comic based patient education for kids and teens.
1	I am a embalmer/funeral director. I love doing restorative art and giving families a chance to say goodbye when they thought it was impossible.   \n\nI also occasionally perform with a burlesque/circus troupe, where I spin fire poi, pole dance and walk around body painted for promotional work... Conservative by day unconventional by night! 
1	I'm an airborne linguist for the USAF. It's not a bad gig, and I really enjoy doing my job. All of the bs that comes with the military, and government in general, makes the job hard to stay happy with.
1	I am a corporate trainer. I train new hires for 6 or 9 weeks, depending on department. I am either in front of a group of 12 to 20 people. Or we do train virtually (camera time!) I love it. I have been told that I have been one of the best teacher/trainer they have ever had, and always made dry material entertaining/engaging. I get to tell stories with everyone all ears. I have basically an opening monologue every morning basically on par with any good late night host (work appropriate of course). And after 6 or 9 weeks they leave me go out and do the job, and I get a whole new group. Perfect!
1	How was your New Year's Eve celebration?	Being ESFPs, we are the life of the party and therefore we should all have some wild stories. Share away!
4	It's kinda weird, but my wife who is an ESFP does not actively seek large parties.  Leans more to the side of smaller get togethers.
2	My fiance's birthday is January 1st, and each year we have a ~3 day long party from new years eve to January 2nd with 5-10 close friends. Even though my fiance is quite introverted, we both look forward to it all year round. We mainly drink and play board games and eat truly unhealthy crap. This year I got trashed and begged redditors for Dogecoins. ^no^regrets\n\nWhat were you up to OP?
1	Ran around drunk, talked to pretty much everyone there, danced, got excited when more people rocked up, and made everyone I didn't know my new best friend. So yeah, typical esfp :P
1	Solidified a relationship.\n
3	I'm curious about ESFPs !	Hi There !      \n&#160;    \n~~I'm a near archetypal INTP !~~   \nI'm an ENTP, in fact ! =D \n\nSeen in socioconics that ~~INTPs~~ INTjs and ESFPs are [Duals](http://www.socionics.com/rel/dlt.htm) for each others ,\nwhich I find really interesting     \n\n&#160;      \nSo I wondered what meant to be an ESFP      \n\nSo if you want to help me a bit in my quest of knowlege ,I would ask you some questions then :\n\n&#160;\n\n &#3844; What does ESFP acronym means for you ? \n\n &#3844; Do you know some INTPish people ? \n\n &#3844; Do you have experienced a Duality Relation ?\n\n &#3844; Do you have some questions for me as an INTP ? (because I'll be glad to answer anything !)\n\n&#160;\n\nThanks alot for your attention ! 😊
2	Hi there, I am an ESFP, and I will gladly answer your questions, but first I need to clarify what you mean by "duality relation?" Those words have no clear meaning to me. It seems that English may not be your first language, but is there any way you can restate this one question?\n\nI'm thinking that you mean one of two things, either a "dual reality" (which would be like living one existence but believing another) or you simply mean a polyamorous relationship which is being in love with multiple people at once.
2	well for me being an ESFP is likeing to express feelings and would rather be around people then be alone. that is me personally. some of the other things apply, but people and feelings sums me up to a T.\n\nwell I dont know any INTPs per say. I am not sure exactly how I would tell. But I am curently dating a guy who is INTJ. which is almost the same. and It is working out amazing! we have so much fun.  The only thing is that we are exact opposites. he would rather be alone then go out with people and he does not share his feeling well. but he will eventually. and he does go out with me on occasion. but we love eachother. and vise versa. I let him have his alone time and I dont pressure him to spend time with me or share his feelings unless the situation calls for it. \n\n\n\n
2	My husband is actually an INTJ so I don't think they are that different. \n\nAt times it annoys the piss out of me that we are so incredibly opposite. He relaxes by sitting at home and playing on the computer or readin boring things on reddit. My relaxation comes from being out of the house. Loud music. Lots of talking and interaction. So what makes me feel good makes him stress out. \n\nBut I guess I love him no matter much. He reads things about me and though I FEEL everything and he THINKS everything... It's good for balancing us out. Though it is insane trying to get each other to see our points of view. \n\nHe's logical and I'm spontaneous. He's quiet until he has a very definite opinion and I kind of bounce around loudly until I feel comfortable. \n\nI'm kind of just rambling now so I'm gonna stop.... :) 
2	I'm an ESFP, close friends with an INTP who is studying graphic design. We get along really well and I understand the duality. INTPs are an interesting group because a heavy F mixed with a heavy I creates interesting conversation when it comes to emotion. 
1	[deleted]
1	Hi yea... I'm an ENTP and the dual for INTP is ESFJ.  In socionics, the last letter is switched for introverts.  Some people deny this, but I've spent a great deal of time talking to my mother and I am super confident she is ESFP and very happily married to an INTJ.  \n\nAs an ENTP I have spent a great deal of time interacting with ISFJ and ISFP and I am confident I like ISFJ wayyyyy more.\n\nGood luck.
1	ESFP actually stands for...	In my Sophomore year of high school I took the MBTI & discovered I was actually what's known as an "Extra Special Friend Pal."
5	Excessively Socially Forcefully Projecting\n\n
1	Need Help Finding ESFP	Can anyone direct me to a place where I can find many ESFP that fit this description and are single? If you can I would also like help improving my descriptions of me and who I am looking for.\n\nMe:\n-rationalist\n-male 28\n-wealthy, but dislike extravagance\n-many abilities and projects,\n but very careful to use what I have only to help others\n-good looking, but unconcerned with looks\n\nYou:\n-realist\n-does not drink alcohol or do drugs\n-female 28 or under\n-enjoy cooking and interior design\n-likes companionship\n-balanced and non-judgemental\n-easy going\n-likes humour and to entertain\n-likes solutions and creativity\n-practical but open to ideas\n-finds potential conflict irrelevant and pushes through everything with a positive attitude\n-open to improve planning\n\n(dream of becoming a watchmaker is a plus)\n\nI am going to sleep now, I appreciate any reply both positive and negative.\n\n\n\nEDIT: (short version)\n\n-might enjoy design, photography, buildings, and houses\n\n-balanced and positive\n\n-open to travelling the world\n\n-might like cooking and food\n\n-might like sales work\n\n-might want to become a watchmaker
3	My personal opinion here is that your are being far too specific.  I'm ESFP/ENFP (on the border of sensing and intuition) and my  opinions/interests change almost daily.  Things like enjoying cooking and interior design, I may get a blast of interest in those topics for a week, then lose interest, then a month later get another blast of interest in them.  My attitudes and preferences change based on random occurrence, you cannot expect the same monotonous interests, attitude, opinions, etc...  In my opinion it's boring and goes against everything I am to be the same all the time.  Some aspect of my life has to change every day and I don't know if that's the same for all ESFP's or not, but that's my outlook on it.
2	watchmaker. 
1	http://16personalities.com/dating/ this may help you alot!!
4	I dont like my career options.	See, I may get angry and emotional and express that. But in reality. I am not artistic in any way, I am monotone as fuck on stage. I cant even draw a flower, and I cant sing. and zero fashion taste. the only thing I can see myself doing is Early childhood because I love kids and it would be so much fun to be creative all day and not act like a kid! woah! \n\nbut has anyone else had this problem? I take every test made and it still gives me ESFP, am I a failure at my personality because of this? 
2	First, understand and remember that you do not do things _because_ you are an ESFP, instead you are an ESFP because of things you do, how you think, feel and act in certain situations. In fact, it feels strange even to say that someone is a certain type, again it is their actions that are typical for a certain type.\n\nSecond, as an ESFP I recognize myself in your description. I can't draw, can't sing, my hand writing is terrible etc. I do however feel quite creative in coming up with solutions, explaining things to others etc. I also love to help and entertain people, kids included.\n\nThird, for me, when learning about personality types, myself and others around me I have gotten much more understanding from looking at my temperament (SP) than the full ESFP type. This is also clear from the archetype word attributed to these, as Artisan (ESFP) feels a little strange but Problem Solver (SP) is right on the money.\n\nOne of my favorite books on this subject is "What Type Am I?". It is a short and simple read which gives a lot of insight into MBTI personality types and the four temperaments (NT, NF, SJ, SP) and how they interrelate.
1	The Myers Briggs personality types aren't that rigid where if you're an ESFP you must love to party, entertain, and live in the moment. Everyone is different and the personality types aren't supposed to be one size fits all. \n\nBefore I saw this I actually just posted a selfpost asking about which traits apply to them and which don't and I think it's true that almost no one is 100% an ESFP according to the personality page but thats what makes everyone unique certainly not a bad thing.\n\nAs for careers you should do what you want to do don't limit yourself to the websites saying ESFPs can only do x y or z do what you're ood at and what you love if thats early childhood then go for it!\n
1	Your reason for being monotone on stage, not being able to draw a flower, being unable to sing, having zero fashion taste may be that you aren't invested in those things and you don't really care about them.  In my experience I have never seen myself as an artist, but one day I was inspired to sketch something I had seen the day before and it came out beautiful.  I was astounded that my attention could even stay focused on that sketch for the hour and a half it took.  I have not made a decent sketch before that day or since, but I know that if i'm inspired to do it, then I probably can.  Same with acting, when I read a script and love it (this is coming from some high school theater) and I can really identify with my character, I immerse myself in the thoughts and feelings of that character and become that character on stage.  That happened twice, but in every other play I tried out for I couldn't find a single character I could become and didn't do the plays.  Same with singing for me, I played the piano for a few years and according to friends and some randoms acquaintances at a party, my playing of the piano and singing of Daniel Powter-Bad Day was better than the original, but no other song was that way for me.  To me it's all based on immersion into the topic or activity that does it.\n\nTl;Dr-Immerse yourself in the topic/activity and see if it truly interests you and you will find that you have those skills you previously thought you didn't have.
5	What traits of an ESFP are most accurate/inaccurate to you?	Maybe you find yourself planning out your weeks more than you think an ESFP would or perhaps the idea that an ESFP takes criticism personally describes you perfectly.\n\nDo you think you spill over into any of the other MBTI types?
8	What's funny is for me I identify strongest with the supposed weaknesses of an ESFP. For instance I hate conflict, I suck in academics, I cannot focus, and I can't plan anything out. \n\nHowever when it comes to the strengths, it's not as accurate in describing me. I feel like I am really good at entertaining my friends but I often find myself tripping over my words and sometimes struggle to  organize my thoughts. 
7	ESFPs and video games	I was wondering if you guys play computer/video games, and if so, what kinds of games do you play? I find it funny to compare the games I enjoy to those my fiance plays (INTJ :P)\n\nI tend to enjoy creative platform games the most, like the Wii Boy and his Blob or Donkey Kong.
8	I like games that don't require a full on commitment to play/beat. I like to be able to pick up and play a game and be done later that day. I don't often beat games with story modes because I just can't commit to it. I'm not sure this is an ESFP thing or just me. \n\nGames that really suit me are games like Mario Party and Civ something I can start and finish in one sitting
2	I don't really game anymore, and if I do it has to be something I can play for half an hour and then put down like Forza or Madden. I just can't really sit there and game hardcore like I used too. 
2	wow!! its so amazing that you have the same type of fiance as my boyfriend. I was thinking that we were doomed to break up because of how opposite we were. I am glad to here a success story. lol. He loves to stay in. I love to go out. it kind of makes it hard to do stuff. though I am glad to just spend time with someone. I HATE being along. its so bad. I get bored and movies are so not entertaining after 5 hours. so I tend to go out as much as I can. I call them dates. he calls them torture. 
1	I like playing a lot of team based games on both PC and Xbox like Arma II and the Battlefield series. Every once in a while I'll throw in Call of Duty or skyrim or something.
1	I'm going to throw out Kerbal Space Program as an excellent ESFP game, it satisfies the pick-up/put-down ability and is vastly engaging as an exploration game.
1	I'm ISTP, but I enjoy (a specific server of) minecraft immensely, as well as GTA.
1	I don't do well with storyline games either (except for like Pokemon lol). I can play COD and racing games but like, not even for long. 
1	My boyfriend and I play FF14 together. We both like videogames, but it's interesting how differently we will play the same game. He is ESFP and he makes a lot of friends in-game and can easily find parties to join. I prefer to play solo unless he drags me into a party. He's usually some sort of tank, and I'm usually ranged. Huge differences, but it all works out.
1	This is fascinating! I'm a deffinate ESFP, and I do often find myself only playing for a short-ish period of time, but I also love Fallout and Elder scrolls, creating a character I want to give character developement and perfecting their look. I then find myself playing for hours! Is this normal? Do I play for that long because I'm pushing myself (these being my favourite games by far). Questions questions...
7	ESFP strengths and weaknesses	
6	I love the people on this website's comment page don't understand that it doesn't have to describe them EXACTLY
7	New Moderator	I saw this place was dead and without a mod so I requested the sub and spruced it up a bit. I took the style sheet from the main /r/MBTI sub. If anyone has any ideas or something you'd like to see let me know, hopefully we can get this place a little more active!
2	Cool new look! I'll try to help make the sub a bit livelier. 
2	I noticed in the description on the right side that the I (and not the N) in iNtuition is capitalized.
7	How to be more social?	~Do you have any advice on how to be more social?\n\n~What is it like to be social?\n\n~How do you talk to people in real life?\n\nThere's something I may be missing here.
3	Is this a question from another ESFP? Or is this a question from a different classification looking for advice from an ESFP?\n\nIf it's the former then I don't think you're actually an ESFP if you find it difficult to talk to people. It's one of the key attributes **E**SFP\n\nIf it's the latter then the best advice i can tell you is don't be scared to start a convo. What helps me a lot is that I generally keep a shallow knowledge on a very broad list of topics so that no matter who i talk to I can have something in common with them to keep the conversation alive. It's an inch deep and mile wide type of situation. I can talk about everything from working on a car and sports to fashion trends and music preferences. I don't find it taxing at all because I really enjoy talking to people. 
4	Take a genuine interest in your conversations. Most people love to talk about themselves and what they are into. Do your best to relate to what they are talking about and share your input. If they are talking about something you don't really know about or don't have an innate interest in, use the conversation as a learning experience.
3	I started off by just 'pretending' to be confident. I told myself that if people didn't know I was nervous it wouldn't matter, and it was worth just putting myself out there.\n\nNot for everyone, and don't mistake my advice for telling you to be someone else. Be yourself, but just assume everyone likes you!
3	My advice is truly stop caring what other people think of you and take an interest in yourself for once.  Are you okay with you?  You shouldn't care what others think of you, only what you think of you without the influence of others matters.  \n\nTl;Dr-Don't give a fuck about people's opinions.\n\nBeing social is like finding a plate of thousands of different types of cookies and taking a taste of each one and deciding which ones you like the most and would eat every day, deciding which ones you're okay with and could give or take, and finding those few that you really hate and want to burn with a flamethrower.\n\nTl;Dr-It's like food\n\nWhen i talk to people in real life I basically just say whatever comes to my mind.  Like it could be my weirdest thought ever and the only person I have around me that is available for conversation is a gorgeous girl whose name I don't even know yet (notice i say YET which is how I think of new people is that i have YET to meet them but I will eventually) and I could turn to her and say "Have you ever just thought what would happen if you glued your butt to a chair and had to walk to the hospital or call an ambulance for it?" (this is not my weirdest thought but it was a thought that distracted me while I typed this).\n\nTl;Dr-Don't worry about what other people's reactions may be to your random topics of conversation.
2	And I'm the only one here know. XD\nWhere is everyone!?!?\n\nIS THIS THE TWILIGHT ZONE?\n
1	Confidence and a positivite mood. When I have both I can't stop talking. With one of those gone, I could stay silent in a group of people
5	A video on the ESFP personality type.	
2	Did anyone else feel this guy was being rude or was that just me? 
1	I've found a video on ESFP and you may have already seen it but I found it kind of hard to follow because to me it seemed like it was all a bit fast paced so I decided to try to type it out to make more since of it.  I DIDN'T WRITE THIS THESE ARE THE WORDS OF THE GUY IN THE VIDEO. \nI actually not sure why I typed this whole thing out...actually.. :) :P\nI dunno I guess I did it so I could understand it better and maybe it'll help someone else to understand it better too.\n\nThe Myers Briggs test has identified you as the ESFP \nor the performers as your personality type.\n\n\nYou have the ABILITY to understand the objective world its facts and reality.\nYou look at things and say "this is the way it really is" you are right on,\nyou are spot on.\nYou get it and you see how the world really works.\n\nYou have a TALENT for entertaining and pleasing others with words, and actions, and will probably be a pretty good actor, and everybody who knows you probably sees that. \n\n\n\n\nYou have an APTITUDE for getting the most out of any situation  or place. \nYou're the kind of person who can go into a situation, and organize things ,and make things happen in the way that other people can appreciate. \n\nYou are SKILLED at finding the best of things for yourself  and for others. You can go into a situation and everyone sends you out to be the "advance spy" to kind of check out how things are, and you'll be very good at that.\n\nYou have EXCEPTIONAL NATURAL MUSICAL or DRAMATIC SKILLS. You can be the drama king or drama king and act those out and possibly play musical instruments at the same time possibly.\n\n\nYou have a DETAILED and NUANCED appreciation for the outside world. You can look at the outside world and have a real good feel for the little things that make things special about life. \n\nYou can DETECT and RECOGNIZE the effect of minute changes that are made and see those in appreciation.\nEspecially if you have the strength for MAXIMIZER( the strength to take something that is already good, and making it better.) It very well could be that a maximizer is one of your strengths especially a high strength.\n\nYou have refined taste and make it a joy for others to be in your company. So you are the kind of person who can go into a restaurant, and if you are a wine drinker you probably know the best kind of wine if you're a person who is a connoisseur of food you know exactly what to order. If you go in a restaurant you are checking it out and seeing what people like to eat.\n\nYou can QUICKLY DIFFERENTIATE THINGS of GREATER and LESSER importance.\nYou can go into a situation and a relationship and you know what's important to other people you know in  project what's important in a project. It just happens to be that you think that way and you're good at doing hat\n\nYou RECOGNIZE and PROMOTE the talents of other people.\nYou go through this process and you're learning your profile, you can probably get a pretty good idea of how important for other people to go through the same thing. It'll help give you and feed you information that you can use for them and help them build there understanding of wh they are and how they are designed. \n\nYou DEFEND the best and most life promoting aspects in the world. You're looking at the world and you're seeing people in life and are trying to help promote the best parts of life and the best aspects of  the world as well.\n\nWeaknesses\nMay ignore the preferences or needs of other people.\nThere might be people around you and you just ignore what there needs are and so pay attention and make sure you take the feelings and attitudes of other people into account as you get through your day.\n\n\n\nMay perceive objective criticism as a ploy to spoil the fun.\nYou might look at when somebody says "If you did it this way.." and you might very well take that as they are just trying to spoil the fun they don't want me to enjoy this. That's not necessarily the case they might look at what you're doing and say "wow they are really good. If they just did this they would be even better!" That may be a strength you want to lean on instead of being concerned about. \n\nMay have a skewed or an unrealistic idea about the feelings of other people. You may believe that you have the ability to read other people but your personality is such that probably are not good at reading other people so having other people to spend time with that CAN read that can be helpful\n\nMay blame your problems on the world in general.\nJust remember that we're all responsible for ourselves and it doesn't matter what happened in the past what matters is the choices we make daily to make your life better and to make your relationships with other people better also.\n\nMay be oblivious to havoc you reek on other people's feelings.\nYou may just run right over the top pf people and not understand or might not know that you hurt people so learn to watch for the expressions of other people faces when you say things and do things you could very well hurt other people very easily.\n\nMay use inappropriate social behaviors just to make a point.\nYou might be the kind of person who does gestures just to make a point and remember that they are people that offends greatly  and it will tend to push people away and give you the opposite response that you were really looking for.\n\n\n\n\nMay come across as boastful and rash in attitudes.\nYou might come across as being a little arrogant or egotistical just remember to watch for these things and to read people and there emotions and to ask other people about how they feel about things you say and learn to control that because it will push other people away again.\n\nMay rationalize things in inane or simplistic ways.\nIn your mind you there might be things that are a big deal to other people and you just kind of push them off and don't think much of them \n\nMay believe extraordinary things about inanimate objects.\nYou may look at something and say "that thing over thing has abilitys or does something that it really doesn't do. You might look at a crystal and think "the crystal has powers" just watch out for that and look at the data look at the facts.\n\nSituations requiring careful consideration may overwhelm you. \nYou may need to associate with people who are good at digging into the facts, that are good at understanding what's going on.\n\nUnder stress you may since a dark unseen influence.\nYou might think that there is a dark undertow to life that is pressing in on you but just remember look at the facts ask people around you who have a good clear mind in tough situations and get them to help you.\n\nAction items:\nTEST your intuition on new prospects and opportunity.\n\nMAKE SURE that you are  looking up the facts.\n\nDo the RESEARCH when you find  a new opportunity or a have a respective opportunity make sure you check out the facts. You are the kind of person who can very easily make a decision that is wrong because you don't have all the facts. \nMake sure you check out the facts\n\n\nREACT to the lips and body language when others speak. Watch out for these things that people do when they have movements or are smiling. Watch that very carefully because you have the ability to react strongly to that. Use that to help in your judgments and your relationship with people.\nYou have the ability to react strongly to body language.\n\n\nASK questions and understand why others feel the way they do. You have a tendency to jump to conclusions with your type of personality so make sure that you are asking people and find out what the realitys are don't compare another situation with your own just try to discover what is going on for real.\n\n\n\nIt's important in your relationships to be extremely candid to give them permission to be candid and expect and get the type of feedback that you can actually use so you can bring a little bit more reality to your life. If you think about it reality is the only thing that is worth acting on. \n\nYou have a tendency to be very sensing, feeling and perception oriented  and very outgoing and if you put all this together you can have a tendency to build ideas in your mind that aren't true. Make sure you are grounded in reality and the best way to be grounded in reality is to put people in your life that are very grounded in reality and ask them questions and investigate these things. \n\nSee disagreements and criticism as an opportunity for growth. \nIf you will see it you can grow so when you see these criticisms come out look at it as an opportunity to grow. Beware of others and try to understand there perspectives,\n\nTreat others with gentleness. \nMake sure you come at people with a sweetness or a gentleness about your personality and you don't have to get all mushy with it but you want to make sure that you are thinking good about and are thinking loving thoughts about the people you work with. It will change the way you think and react to people in general.\n\nAssume the best a positive attitude makes positive situations so make sure you keep your mind on the positive things and the good things in life.\n\nIf something seems to be wrong ask questions, again you have the tendency to be a very touchy feely person you SINCE things you FEEL things you PERCEIVE things so make sure that you are getting a lot of information base your reactions to life base your reactions to people to projects and opportunitys on facts look for the facts. Go out and quantify what it is you need to know before you go out and take action.\n\nSorry for any grammar, spelling, or punctuation mistakes or lack of punctuation. :p

2	I can't think of much, and maybe this won't apply to you, but I always get discouraged when my peers are more organized and goal oriented than me. I think its important to realize that everyone is different, and though we have a different approach, we can still easily achieve the same results. We just have more fun.

I don't know, let's just somehow get this started again? \n\nI have read that ESFP take things one day at a time.\nIs it true for you personally that you take things one day at a time? Can you tell me how to do that?\n\nDo you think it is true that ESFP personality's don't pay enough attention to there own needs?\n\nLet's all just interact, maybe have a good time. I have read that you are all very outgoing so I don't think you will have a problem with that. :)\n\nI should also mention that I don't think I'm a ESFP but I am curious about people who are ESFP. 
3	i dont use a calender. 
3	One way to think of the "one day at a time" thing- royFat mentioned calendars. I've never really benefitted from calendar, but what I do love is starting a day by thinking about what I would like to get done, then making a big to-do list. So in the way, I do prefer the one day at a time perspective.\n\nI find that I sometimes don't pay attention to my physical well being as much as others. After some thought, I think its because I have trouble focusing on consequences. Maybe thats an ESFP thing?\n\nWhat sort of things make you think you are/arent ESFP?
2	Every time I try to make a to-do list, or a checklist or whatever, it usually ends up with me getting very overwhelmed and then I can't do anything. Taking things one day at a time helps me not be useless and stressed.
2	!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n**Hello everyone** on ESFP! I haven't been able to upload anything for some reason. But I'll continue to post in the comments until I can. \n\nI was wondering if you all like the daytime or the nighttime better. I like the night time better right know because it's more dark and quite. I also seem to be able to think better at night. \n\n
2	A crosspost of info I put on the INTp page. \nESFj: http://www.socioniko.net/en/1.1.types/es.html vs ESFp http://www.socioniko.net/en/1.1.types/fr.html\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/1k7vgh/a_socionics_intp_vs_intj/

1	ATTENTION: Dear ESFP, I am going to leave. I have to start thinking about things more. I have to. \n\nI also feel that I may want to revive this subreddit more then you want this subreddit which isn't a bad thing.\n\nI wish you all well and I hope that you all discover a lot about yourselves. \n\n\nNEVER MIND. I said I would try and I will.
2	Hey fellow ESFPs! Where is everyone?	I know we're usually the life of the party but c'mon now! We like to interact even when we're in the confines of our own homes. Where is everyone? 
1	well and I lied to y'all. I've taken SEVERAL of these the past couple of days. I seem to vary between ESFP and ENFP :)
3	ESFPs, Thor and Ariel	
6	Is there anybody in here?	
3	I am shocked someone else has posted in here.  It's been a while!!  Welcome.  :)
3	Today we rule this subreddit, and tomorrow the world!
3	I'm an INTJ figured I'd come check out ESFP because if I could, I would be an ESFP. Makes sense that nobody is here lol. ESFP is most represented in the real world and least represented in internet world. lol
2	i thought i heard an echo in here. hello ESFPs!!!
2	hello! here I am (I realize I am tragically late to the party) :) I just discovered this about 2 minutes ago :D

1	Hi! I'm new here. Lets get this place going again, it seems really quiet...	
7	Why is this subreddit so underpopulated?	Are we ESFPs that much of a minority on Reddit? What da deel?
16	Apparently so... probably because us ESFPs are usually out doing something with people tête-à-tête instead of through a computer screen.\n\nCheers!
8	I created this subreddit then deleted my account. I'm a very bad parent :(
7	We're probably a tiny minority on reddit given the massive amount of hardcore introverts on here. 
9	Sometimes I get turned off from Reddit when elitist introverts are around, judging me for being a fun person. :P\n\nCould def use some publicity.
5	A study found that the only leisure pastime for which ESFPs were overrepresented was "Watching TV 3 hrs or more per day."

0	So ~3 years ago I got INTJ	Just informing you that this personality type thing only captures transient trends and doesn't reflect any long-term personality traits. Thank you for your attention :)
