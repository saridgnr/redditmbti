18	New Mod Selections	This has certainly been ~~an exciting~~ 3 weeks. I'd like to thank all of the members of r/ENTJ that decided to apply.\n\nI have decided to follow a strict interpretation of the application rules that I initially set forth. Applicants were expected to follow basic instructions. Notably, applicants were required to send me a private message, rather than a public comment, indicating that they decided to apply. I explained this at least twice.\n\nIn selecting candidates, I considered the merits and motives behind each individual. I believe that all of the candidates that followed directions and applied are qualified for some level of moderation.\n\nWhich is why I've decided to promote all of them.\n\nThis new class of moderators will not be allowed to change permissions for each other. They will also not be allowed to add or remove moderators. That will remain my job.\n\nAs for the new mods (should they accept), their responsibilities will be as follows:\n\nu/Nobleghost will be granted almost-full privileges. His role will be to head up changes to the configuration (including presentation changes as desired) and to mediate low level disputes among the team.\n\nu/ArtemisWinchester and u/TrapWolf will both be in charge of content moderation. They will be given appropriate access, and are expected to work with each other to resolve disputes. \n\nu/Soul_M will report to u/Nobleghost and will be given permission to work with the wiki, chat, and flair.\n\nPrivileges will take effect around Monday, leaving time for discussion and further questions.
10	Nice. Looks like you have built yourself a good team. 
4	Looks good, I don't really do a whole lot on this sub unless chaos ensues. I'm still active on reddit so I'll remain on as a mod so if we have any rogue mods I can step in (like we had happen with some mods a couple years ago). 
1	Cool! Is it too late to apply?
7	ENTJs which goal do you catch yourself thinking about the most?	When you’re dreaming, thinking, envisioning this one thing happening in your life, it’s like music playing and you’re at peace.  What is that one thing for you?   Very curious to know about that.  
17	This isn't a goal but more of a desire. I would love to spend a rainy Saturday in bed with my SO without any worries of work or having to actually get out of bed. Just the two us taking and laughing while the rain is pouring in the background. \nSince I am super single, that is honestly just a thought in my mind. However, I hope to do this one day. 
11	The day I close a big deal. Once I do that it will be a snowball effect. 
8	I’m always doing something music related or dancing! Makes me super happy. \nBut also love dreaming about a nights sleep where I don’t wake up a few times with a new idea or thought relating to work the next day, lying in until the afternoon, drinking wine in the sunshine! I get to do that occasionally in real life and it’s bliss. Does anyone ever book themselves or their families a little weekend break ‘just because’ sometimes? (Planned in advance of course) x 
7	Having a stable and loving family with a big house, 4 kids, 2 dogs and land, for which I could provide by being the man of the house and bread winner.
3	Financial Independence
4	The happy place I want to be in three years: have a job outside of Manhattan, owning a home, watching my wife garden and renovate, drive to work listening to classical music, having summer cookouts with my neighbors, learning how to fly an airplane, maybe even find a low key church to join (more for the social networking and community integration rather than a religious need).\n\nI'm 33 and it's the first time in my life that I want anything like that. A year ago I thought I was happy being a workaholic but I burned out. I finally realized that I am human after all, and that the silly little things that don't seem to have a purpose in my plans are the things that have caused my plans to derail (burning out so hard that I got put on medical leave for dysthymia). 
3	For a while it was getting into my dream school. Literally ever second was spent in some capacity working towards that ultimate goal. Now that I’ve accomplished it, I’m sort of in this stagnant phase just envisioning how I need to operate during this next stage of life.
3	Helping the environment.
3	Getting a cat, not getting into debt and moving away from home. 
2	Paying off my student loans. It's pretty much top of mind everyday yet somehow I still manage to spend money on things that do not spark joy. 
1	Being satisfied with myself and always, always trying my best
1	The overarching theme is simplifying and organizing my life. Moving to a place where just about everything is the way I want it to be (no I am not ready to buy a house) so that I can have maximum freedom and relaxation at home. Getting rid of possessions. Combing through my digital files and purging what I do not need, keeping that which I do.\n
1	Starting my own startup has been the goal for as long as I can remember. I’m right now on the verge of closing an angel deal with a big investor and making it a reality. I couldn’t be more excited.
8	ENTJ Counselors, Therapists, Psychologists & Psychiatrists	It's a career path that many people don't often attach to ENTJs.\n\nI think we can be really amazing at it (as with any type and any career), particularly if it's something that aligns with our Fi values.\n\n*Are there any ENTJs on these career paths* that want to share their story? What were your challenges? What motivated you to go down this path? In hindsight, what would you have done differently? Any regrets? Do you experience emotional exhaustion? How often? What do you to manage it?\n\n*For people who do go to therapy, and have had an ENTJ clinician -* what was your experience?
11	My ENTJ bf is a psychiatrist, and I think it really compliments his personality. He’s tough enough to spot bullshit when he sees it, but smart and empathetic enough to know when someone truly needs his help. Additionally, working at a hospital makes him exercise his Te, which he loves, and the great lifestyle of a psychiatrist gives him time to work on his Se. \n\nI’m in an occupational therapy program myself and I believe one of the program heads is an ENTJ. Although the stereotype is that this type should go into business, I think they can do a lot of good for others in healthcare. 
4	I know an ENTJ pediatric occupational therapist. She works almost exclusively with special needs kids and I recently found out her niece has Down’s syndrome, which I doubt is a coincidence.
3	Just the other day I thought that an ENTJ would be an awesome life coach if I ever chose one
3	I am getting my Master’s in Social Work right now actually. I have a strong idealistic side and want to work with people. My wife, an ENFJ social worker, was an inspiration for me to change careers. I saw the important work she was doing and decided I didn’t want to serve media corporations anymore; I have a hard time doing anything I don’t really believe is important, and from my volunteering experiences, I found that I really enjoy working with older adults and learned a lot from their stories. It appeals to my creative writing background as well to meet lots of interesting people and learn about them. I discovered in my first social work internship that my calling is in hospice, and I’m thrilled to be working in a field that feels vitally important to me. On an everyday basis, hospice deals with what I perceive to be the greatest injustice of all, that someday we all must face: the process of dying and ultimately death. \n\nMy pragmatic side also appreciates that serving the aging population has advantages in that it’s a fast growing segment of the population. Also, unlike professions that favor some regions of the country or world over others, one can be a social worker anywhere. And social workers can’t be replaced by automated labor — or at least, they shouldn’t be. In hospice specifically, I’m finding that most social workers work in the field doing home visits, and they get to set their own schedules, which is something I value a lot. I also like the idea that with clinical licensure, I could start my own practice at some point should I choose that route. \n\nShould be no surprise to this crowd that as an ENTJ (and a 30+ y/o male to boot) I’m very different from most of my classmates. I have a sense of mental toughness, personal/professional drive, and organizational skills that not everyone around me has, and I’m not scared to speak up if I have a question, or to take a leadership role when no one else wants to. But in helping professions, difference is valued. \n\nSo don’t be discouraged when you find you’re different from others around you. We shouldn’t let caricatured Myers Briggs stereotypes define what we will do in our careers. Not all of us want to be heartless industry titans, nor should we be. 
1	HANNIBAL! lol 
1	I'm a doctor so there's that
0	I am an ENTJ psychiatrist. At me anything!
20	Why do NTJs get upset when people wonder if they have emotions?	Particularly ENTJs.\n\n1. Is it because Fi is an inferior function and  they constantly try to work on it?\n2. Is it because ENTJs feel misunderstood their whole lives?\n3. Why do ENTJs see expressing oneself as weakness?\n4. Why is it that vulnerability is seen as a negative thing to ENTJs? isn't making oneself vulnerable to other people a true measure of ones mental and emotional strength? because if they're willing to go out of their way to expose themselves to  people they feel like they have a chance with and take the risk of being hurt again, but with a different mindset and of course a better sense of judgement, isn't that bravery? rather than concealing certain parts of yourself that you fear might get you hurt?\n\nEdit:\n\nI've removed certain parts of my question because I did get a little carried away while writing them.
26	It's plain and simple: if you think a person is an emotionless robot, that means said person doesn't trust you with this vulnerability. Trust has to be earned first my dude.\nEdit: typo
24	Because everyone has emotions?\nOf course some types will be more open/ emotional than others but none of us are just robots. 
25	>why do NTJs get upset when people wonder if they have emotions? \n\n[I've never actually experienced this but...] Maybe because we are humans with actual emotions?\n\nNot only are you basically saying we're are robots, but you're doing it in quite an aggressive manner.  Flies and honey, you know? Is this personal for you? \n\nIm not going to answer you step by step, but only say it seems like you are really taking this personally profile too seriously. People act in the manner you describe for a while host of reasons, not just attributed to an NTJ tendency. People are people... meaning we're all quirky and don't fit into a box. We're never going to meet the ideal, but we all just try to keep getting ourselves... no matter the style. \n
11	This may be a personal thing but to me my emotions are background noise.  It's just scenery.  I don't actually feel them.  Good emotions is like seeing a nice painting, bad emotions is like seeing a dark painting.  I don't partake and I used to see myself as abnormal but I'm tired of it.   Now I say fuck it, it's empowering to just take the bull by it's horns and face it.\n\nI can tell when I am sad or upset if I feel dread.  I know I feel disappointed in myself if I'm anxious.\n\nEither way the Gym, sauna, nature, or reading helps these things.\n\nI just had a conversation about this with an INTJ about our Fi function, which is sort of a wrench in our highly logical intuitive thinking.  It's like a crack, but a good crack? because it keeps us in the periphery of humanity, just enough.
6	These questions are so loaded it annoys the hell out of me, and they're not even directed at me.
5	hmm don’t come at me like that! 
9	just reading the title makes me upset
3	1. No.\n2. Yes.\n3. Nobody, except for those who choose not to understand, and instead use them.\n\n4 & 5. They don't view vulnerability as a negative, they are just incredibly selective with who they trust. If you aren't one of them, unless you intended on using them like a piece of shit, don't take personal offense to it. It doesn't necessarily mean you're a bad person, it just means you "don't fit the bill". It's not really something you can change, as it has to do with the structure of your character. 
5	Why did you post this? It sounds like you are angry and this comes off as passive aggressive. You say NTJs are getting upset at the question? I don't think they are getting upset at the question i think they're getting upset at you for being so opinionatedly narrow-minded. No offense OP but have you read what you wrote here?\n\n"Who is at fault?" Are you being serious right now? You are talking about NTJ as if it is a defect??! Who is at fault for you being who you are?\n\nWhat motivated this post? Did you try have a relationship with an ENTJ and it blew up in your face?\nOr are you trying to get close to one who simply isn't reciprocating on your terms?\n\nAnd whats this ''YOU guys' and who is 'we'? You're talking like the world is divided into NTJs and everyone else. And frankly this is making me angry, you sound like you have your head up your own arse. No offense.\n\nMy gut feeling is that if NTJs aren't sharing emotions with you its because they sense you can't be trusted or wouldn't be able to handle it. Or they simply dont respect you enough to. You don't seem to have the depth of understanding required to handle or understand the range of intricate and complex emotions we do have. \n\nSorry if this comes off as aggressive, your post gets under my skin a bit.\n
2	It's like, even if I'm not emotional, I've never been shy about the fact that I *have* emotions. And it annoys me that people who are supposed to care about me can't tell that. Always brings me back to the endless circle of "are people dumb or do they just lie about caring"
2	Because we're human and we do have emotions. And our feels can be hurt. Easily. \n\nBut our Te naturally drives us to take action and take a lot of action. I, for one, can't just passively dwell on my feels. And actions driven by emotions are usually very, very bad ones in my experience. Thus I try to both isolate emotions from my decisions/action. But it doesn't mean emotions don't exist. 
2	I don’t get upset if people question or wonder if I have emotions. I get a bit upset if people treat me as if I have none though 
2	I get "upset" when people throw subjective criticisms at me.  Such as "why are you so sensitive?" Which is one I received in an altercation that confused the shit out of me.  I responded with can we remain objective and compromise?  I dont recall the convo just that part of it...
1	I don’t get upset at that question, or maybe I do, I have never gotten it.
1	You think that because you don't see my emotions, I don't have them? \n\nDo you also have to cause someone pain before you believe that your actions can hurt others?\n\nIt's the stupidity of the question that bothers me.
1	Lmfao this whole emotionless quibble about ENTJs is old. It’s the only condensation term used about an ENTJ other than bossy and successful. But to say that is to really not know how emotions factor into an ENTJ’s living experience. We feel, but just not in that moment. We feel it later. We think first, and process later. That should really be the end of the convo. But people love talking about this talk to no end, when the answer is so simple and actually shows that the question itself is incredibly misguided. Some people pride themselves on it and perhaps is why they continue to perpetuate the subject. \n\nIt’s a delay, not a missing part. 
1	Not gonna lie, this has never bothered me.\n\nThat said, emotions serve only to get in the way of making logical, efficient decisions, especially in difficult situations.\n\nYou go be indecisive and upset anywhere that is not here. Don't get in my way, and I'll take it from here.
1	I don’t get upset, and simply explain my emotions are complex and not easily translated
1	I think there’s a lot of mistypes on here especially intjs. It’s hard to answer this. As a real entj and professionally typed I don’t know if I agree. I think INTJ gets a bit mor bothered. Honestly.
1	(INTJ) Most of the time the emotions get in the way when I need think constructively to solve or deal with a certain situation so for the meantime I'd set them aside. Once the situation is better I'll go somewhere I'm most comfortable with and break down. This usually happens when I'm alone and for a specific period of time that I allocated for this breakdown. Then I'd feel better again. \n\nIt's offensive to be accused of not having emotions because it's not like we don't have them. It's more to we not having the time for a breakdown right now because we need to deal with the said situation and we know crying or being angry won't really solve anything. We'll get to that after the problem is solved. \n\nReally envious of people who can have their emotional breakdowns without thinking. 
1	Simple, cause it's rude? Lol, that would be like me (an INTJ) asking someone "are you stupid?" simply for not being as smart as me. It's annoying to think that just because I don't give off an emotional response or it's not to the same level as others, that means I just dont have them. And while it is true our Fi is "inferior" to others, that still doesnt mean they aren't  there or that I'm even necessarily trying to work on it (i mean I'm happy as  I am so why change?). Anytime I'm in an extremely emotionally charged situation, no matter the outcome I need time to reset and reflect and really just rest. It's like working a muscle you've never worked before, just cause it's "weak" doesnt mean it's not there. \n\n\nWe just use logic for a vast majority of our decision making, because ultimately doing what makes the most sense for us makes us the happiest (an emotion!). 
1	Because it feels like people are trying to manipulate me.
1	I express myself, and I think it's very important to express myself. According to my calculations I am 17% less productive if I have not not expressed myself. As I result, I schedule in expressive activities like attending church and singing lessons.\n\n/s Okay, I'm not the robot I'm pretending to be, but I think the problem is that I have difficulty understanding vague emotional stuff from others, and I find it difficult to talk about feelings unless I can articulate them precisely.\n\nI also don't "do" fear. I'm much more likely to get angry when I feel threatened or anxious. 
0	cause they lack basic notions of human design / neuroscience  
-2	Well I think most of us ENTJs are emotionless unlike other personality types
2	Never Met Another ENTJ	I live in Bangladesh and I feel that ENTJs are very rare here. I don't think that I have met another ENTJ in my life (I'm an ENTJ). What are the odds? Is it even possible to not being able to meet another ENTJ?\n\nP.S: By meeting I meant at least get to know someone or get acquainted with.  
1	I mean at least u met a couple on ENTJs online lol, a sub teacher of mine is a ENTJ :')

4	INxP (f) Seeing an ENTJ (m)... problems...	SO, long story short, I (f) started dating male (entj)...who I love... and we're not in a committed relationship yet (it's been 7 months!). A year and a half ago he was engaged. His ex broke up with him because of devastating family issues (dad has dementia) and is moving back to her home country soon. He's still friends with her and relies on her for support and is absolutely not over her.\n\nA few years ago, I dated an INTP who was trying to help me get over a breakup. He saw all these problems with me that he wanted to fix, but it ended up bordering on abusive and he was extremely critical of me (even if he was right). He had concerns about my own mental health which later proved to be true. Also, he was a genius and knew a lot about psychology and the brain, so he was basing his judgments on real info and he was right but I didn't realize it until much later.\n\nNow, I'm in the opposite position of my ex. I want to help this guy I'm seeing (entj) get over his ex. I have a whole list of recommendations for him that is research based and I know would help his mental health. There are real issues that I see, and I want to help him get better. He could get better in a few months if he followed my suggestions.\n\nIs this crazy of me? I just want him to get better. And I do my research and base everything on evidence. It's a great plan that will help him.\n\nAs an ENTJ, would you appreciate this?
9	First of all I think you're definitely INTP or a veeery stressed INFP.\n\nI don't think you should try so hard. You have to stand on your own 2 feet. Don't hang on to him.\n\nSometimes in life, you have to let go of what is most hurting you, in order to get it. It might not work out, but develop yourself. Become better yourself and then if he's into you - great. If not, you'll be attractive and strong. 
8	Definitely not your job. Been acquainted with many extjs, the "helping" can push them away. Because what you truly want is to be with them (been there, I get it. Sigh). You can't fix/heal someone, and the more you try, the more they will pull away. Save your sanity and find someone who can give you what you want, without you needing to 'heal' them. 
3	i dont really see the point in getting over her. if you love someone you will continue doing so and its a good thing.  \nfocus on yourself more than him. if you provide a good example , attractive virtuous human that wants him, thats the best thing you could offer.  \ntheres no conceptual solution as i perceive it  
2	Ahaha I'm a young ENTJ but as a advice it's better to let go and take care of yourself :))
2	Sounds like an unhealthy person and may not be ENTJ. But seriously I don’t know how much you can honestly do.
4	I would be direct with him.  Let him know how you feel about this ex thing.  ENTJs like it straight up no bs.  And will respect you for your courage.  This whole looking up ways to help him seems like you’re beating around the bush.  
5	How to work with ESTJs?	I’m working with an older gentleman who I originally believed to be ENTJ. However, lately I have started to suspect he might be ESTJ. I outline my reasoning below:\n\n* Strong Te (challenges me all the time)\n* He gets very impressed when I use my Ni \n* During one of the rare moments where we had a personal conversation I discovered that he is motivated by following his duty (Si)\n* His factual memory is impeccable (Si) \n* He calls himself old-fashioned (Si)\n* He is quite entertained by what he calls “madness” and tries to encourage my...”crazy Russian antics”. Has a bit of a chaos to him when he cuts loose (tertiary Ne)\n\nI greatly respect the man and even though he doesn’t ask for compensation I want to help him. \n\nIf you have experience working with ESTJ(s) successfully, the two main pieces of advice I need:\n\n1. How to successfully combine our different leadership styles? (He has history with the group but they are looking to me for the vision, and building momentum for the business)\n2. How to increase rapport? \n\nI also welcome any other wisdom you are willing to share on building a successful long-term business relationship with an ESTJ. 
4	1. Ask him to help you get organized. Ask him how he might make something better and then talk about potential for improvement.\n\n2. Talk about something controversial and ask him for the perspectives he thinks are noteworthy and then have a debate on which is best 
4	People generally like people that value the same things that they do. You guys are both high Te so it should be easy. Just find opportunities to appreciate them for their other strengths and try and relate as much as possible. \n\nI love ESTJs :)
3	I like ESTJs. And STJs in general. Really underrated hard workers, thinking if having one help me with my buisness. Id make them know that they are valued, that their loyalty and razor focus is dually noted. That will tickle their fi and make them wanna cry. 
2	I get along with eSTJs and especially one I know decently well. We have a little bit of issues but it’s minor I think. Discuss leadership with him and just work together. Usually if you have the same goals it’s very easy. Just discuss everything. You will just see what you and the estj can do you will have different ideas what you can do with the situation and I think both can be done. The ESTJ I am currently working with is a professor of mine but I may have to work with him in term of some work I am doing that may need to engage his club. Use your te to connect.
1	> He is quite entertained by what he calls “madness” and tries to encourage my...”crazy Russian antics”.\n\nLike what?\n
1	They follow instructions well. \n\n
13	Balancing ENTJ loops	I find I get into these all consuming aggressive goal directed ENTJ loops. How do you balance these out or come down from them? There comes a point when solving or taking on the worlds most difficult problems doesn’t work.
9	Have you seen *Was That Really Me?* by Naomi Quenck? This community talks about “dom-tert” looping but Quenck also talks about “being in the grip” of your inferior.\n\nFor me, I've noticed that my Te-Se loops are sustained by some kind of Fi-based black and white decision that's made me see everything in terms of Right vs. Wrong, Me vs. The World. I lose sight of my Ni's long range perspective instead of taking setbacks as a natural course of chance and realizing that the future is still to be influenced. I replace my world view with a nihilistic view of the present, and I can only pick fights with how things are now instead of adopting a strategy to deal with things.\n\nThe advise, from people ranging from Quenck to Jung to Von Franz, is that you need to assert your auxiliary, to *parent* your tertiary and inferior functions. I know I'm getting out of the grip when I start imagining the future several years into the future again, and using that perspective to make my decisions and to orient in the present.\n\nI like the concept of the [Orient-Observe-Decide-Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop) loop as an engagement schema. We ENTJs need to *continuously* orient with Ni in order to keep Te-Se from locking into maladaptive Observe (Se) - Decide (Fi, Te) - Act (Te, Se) cycles. (Or maybe psychles.)
2	A combination of understanding the Law of Polarity & Stoicism.
1	Going to the jacuzzi, sauna, and pool for a swim seems to snap me out.  Especially the switch from hot to cold brings me back to the moment.  
1	My fam brings me down.\n
36	I Am Shocked At How Many ENTJs Have Never Met An INTP	Recently I started talking one on one with a few ENTJs on here. \n\nWhile I have met a few ENTJs in person, it's admittedly rare. But I welcome it anytime I get the opportunity. \n\nYou guys aren't nearly as scary or as cold as your reputation portrays 😂 \n\nYou guys are a buncha softies underneath, at least for the people you care about. 😊 \n\nYou just prefer to take the "tough love", and blunt honesty approach. While the other more "sensitive" types skirt around issues, so they perceive the ENTJ's take on caring as aggressive, or indifferent. \n\nINTPs and ENTJs get along great, but I found it surprising at how many of you have never actually met an INTP, let alone talked with one. Interestingly enough, for a type toted as "Extroverted", one frequent I've found is you guys tend to stick to your comfort zone when it comes to people. Even when unhappy or feel unfulfilled with your current circle, you tend to stick with what you know. Personally I think you're more concerned about being hurt or betrayed, so you stick with the types you know what to expect from. \n\nI mean, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, I welcome it!  😄
8	Hi. I'm INTP and never met an ENTJ sadly ;(. I would love to hang out with you guys because you care about becoming a better version of yourselves.
17	ENTJ here. Met an INTP. We got married. We never EVER had a fight. We were the perfect team. She got cancer and died. I know I will never experience the same level of happiness again :( 
4	I agree with you concerning others takings as being insensitive when we are taking the tough love approach. Sometimes you need to be direct, and feelings need to be put to the side so one can think clearly. \n\nRegarding friends, I get easily annoyed by people and that drains me, quickly. Therefore, when I find people who don't drain me and I enjoy being around, I stick with them. It can take time to get there and people are put on different levels in a sense. There are very, very few people that I can always be around. 
4	I am an ENTJ and I know a ton of INTPs. However I do not know any other ENTJs.
7	I'm an ENTJ and my husband is an INTP. \nI think it works exceptionally well!
10	Hurt, betrayed, sure. But the biggest one is disappointed. I have very high standards for myself and I pride myself on that. I’m never satisfied with staying “the same,” and I tend not to hang out with people at all. Notably, it’s because I cannot help myself from holding others to the same baseline assumption that they are constantly working on themselves as well to be better, smarter, and more fulfilled in their lives: mentally, physically, and spiritually. Don’t get me wrong, every blue moon, I’ll go to a happy hour, but most of the time it’s just me and my girlfriend (who ironically is an INTP). \n\nI do this because so often I am disappointed by others. Their refusal to talk about anything interesting or “deep,” as I’ve been told; their tendency to avoid using their head; their somewhat, though at times only faintly, desperate need for attention and validation from one person or the group; their emotional baggage coming through in passive aggressive statements; and, the worst of the lot, their seemingly constant need to phish for compliments. Not something I care to babysit when I’m out trying to have a good time. \n\nSo, to be utterly blunt, my reasoning for pushing people away boils down to the following: (1) people are inherently bad, (2) people who choose to not use their brains for anything other than attention and real-time comments are incredibly off putting and boring (e.g. someone who says things like “man that’s funny, did you see how that napkin just flipped over like that, like at one point it was just laying flat and then the next second it’s flipped over”), and (3) people let their emotions take too much control of their worldly experience, and it’s just petty drama at some point with most people. \n\nSo, that’s about it. I do care incredibly deeply about a select few people in my life and that’s my significant other and my immediate family. If you’re anyone outside of that grouping, you’re basically getting ghosted. 
3	In brief interactions you can seem a lot like other types. I can only tell it's an INTP if it works in IT or wants to argue about Bitcoin or Politics. 
3	I never really got along that well with the INTPs I met.
4	Loyalty is of utmost importance.    \n\n\nI like INTPs as well.  
2	I get along with INTPs better than other ENTJs. 
3	entj and intp are 2 sides of the same coin. ideally both sides strive to develop the other. finding it in a partner is secondary   \nE shape environment, I analyze environment. focus is efficiency, efficiency is happiness )
2	Gee someone finally understood, I also dont get why people think we are so scary LOL. \nOur reputation is like you said "Cold and scary"\nBut we can be nice as well even though we lack emotions apparently. :/ We just like things our way and get critical if it's not. Or by inrelevant people, eh we can get mean. And that's how it is, people made stereotypes.
1	I'm an xNTx and geoscience student.\n\nI agree on the social circle part 100% from my pov, nice observation. \n\nLike 80% of my colleges are intp's and despite enjoying the mindheavy abilities of my m8s I really hit rock-surface bringing along my flattering jokes.\n\nI was in civ eng undergraduate and really had a better time with this branchea ppl tbh.\n\nP.s. At least one of my exes was defo intp and she kept rolling eyes on my grandiose excitement and constant need to explore new ground, which kinda made me mad (cuz I appreciated her rational down to earth bringing logics alot) \n\nTl:dr it's just a wague personal opinion, but maybe intp's and entxs dont mix along so well.\n\n
1	i know a couple of intps, and am close friends with one, but do not know any other entjs (though i do know *of* some) 
1	My amazing debate partner Maddy, an intellectual Scorpio bad bitch, is an INTP
1	Gonna get downvoted but here goes. \n\nThis thread: WOE IS US, FOR WE ARE TOO SMART FOR NORMIES TO UNDERSTAND US\n\nI know two ENTJ’s, and they’d never say something as stupid as “people don’t get our intellect and are too shallow for us to befriend”. Although both of them are some of the smartest people I know, they can have unbelievable warmth and a genuine interest in people around them. Please get ahold of your egos. Being ENTJ doesn’t automatically make you more intelligent than everyone else. 
1	If I would be given a chance to have an ENTJ as a long time close friend it would be nice. It is understandable however that it is highly unlikely. Given my current track right now I am more inclined to be with people high in Fe as I am learning to be more appreciative of collective effort and belongingness.
8	How to build up confidence?	I consider being myself good and a valuable person, but my psychologist told me that I lack to believe that I’m actually good and valuable, lacking on having a relationship because I just still don’t offer anything.\nAny advices on how to solve this? I’m 16 years old btw; adults needed.
9	Read the short novel *Old Man and the Sea* by Hemingway. You’ll finish it in just a few hours but emerge with a complete motif of how to answer this question for yourself. \n\nThe greatest misunderstanding about confidence is that it is gained and lost through victories and defeats. *True* confidence is immutable.
12	ENTJ tactical analysis. At age 16 you are making a transition from childhood to adulthood. You are discovering yourself, learning who you are and probably dating. Personal growth comes with high school, college, social networking and friends. What are you doing to better yourself? Be patient.
5	Self confidence is just that.  It comes from the self, there is no external validation.    \n\n\nWrite down a pro's and con's list about yourself and focus more on the pro's but see what you can fix on the con's list. 
2	Hi, ive a 50 dollar for you, want it, guess its worth?\n\nOh I dropped it\nOh I stomped on it\nOh I putted dirt on it\n\nIs it still worth 50 dollars?\n\nAnswering what one can offer is a bad question anyone might stumble across, especially in your age with troubles / uncertainty / (forced) dependence of your parents and teachers.\n\nBut guess what, there will always be challengimg circumstances esp. if you aim high enough\n\nYou'll fall and fell like the stomped dollar or compare with peers or your future goals (not good)\n\nEmbrace the moment, be aware youre always worthy no matter what\n\nProtip if you feel competitive\nThere was this runner guy (lost his name)\nHe won not only one but several distances and when ask how he could achieved this he told\n"no matter how much it hurt, I new my competitors had more pain, so I pushed trough"\n\nSo how does it transition to you?\nLove can and will hurt emotionally but dont take it on your ego, stay positive and open so you will find your other half\nAnd for the giving part, you are just good as you are, thats how easy it is
2	I read that we ENTJ’s are all about creativity, and it is when you create success with your creativity (which it is like your personal identity) then you will have confidence. Because it is essentially about testing your abilities and understanding how valuable they are, which should I guess, create a good perception of yourself (as your abilities are part of you, although it can be argued that it isn’t as well) and there is where self-esteem comes to the game as well and develops your confidence for the whole of you - for yourself.\n\nHope it helps!xx \n\nENTJ- A, people mastery 
1	Honestly, I am surprised that your psychologist didn't help you out with giving you tips on what to do. \n\nMy advice, as simple as it sounds, is to believe that you're are worthy. Crazy but the act of just believing something is true can change your entire life. I had to go through this process when I was younger. I had to tell myself that I could do certain things and that I was a certain type of person. The more I told myself, the more I believed it. The more I believed it, the more I lived and became it. \n\nThe same can be for you. Believe in yourself, even when it's difficult and others tell you otherwise. You have lots to offer, it might take some time to see and believe what they are but trust me you do.\n\n&#x200B;
-1	> How to build up confidence?\n\nExposure and winning.\n\n> my psychologist told me that I lack to believe that I’m actually good and valuable, lacking on having a relationship because I just still don’t offer anything.\n\nWell maybe you don't ... yet.\n\nYou are not ready to be a father and protect your kids. You have no money, you can't box. You are small and have little life experience. You have no powerful friends that can protect you and no valuable skill to offer.\n\nThe same is true for most guys your age but that does not stop some of them from fucking. Why? Because a lot of them are dumb. They see boobs, their penis goes up and they will do anything to get laid. They are not over-thinking the intricacies of the universe.\n\nIf you are smart then you should look for a smart girl who is 1-2 years younger than you. She ought to appreciate your company ... hopefully.\n\nYou need to work on things you do not have - skills, exercise, etc. Expose yourself to situations that make you nervous and survive them. Being able to laugh at yourself on stage is a shortcut.\n
0	Do you often feel this way or is this a result of something recent happening?\n\nConfidence we supposedly exude. \nIt's one of our strongest alleged notable features.\nCould you perhaps be confusing confidence with something else?\n\nAm I the only one thinking this?
30	When you meet people do you also predict their life?	The one's that want to change their trajectory and have the balls to do it captivate me.  \n\nDo you guys do this too?
19	Yes, to a good extent. \n\nI enjoy learning about people's lives, their challenges, their strengths, their moments of weaknesses - essentially their story - **what, who, and how it made them the way they are today.** \n\nThe ones that rises above, no matter the story or tiny moments, are the ones I tend to appreciate more. **The higher the rise, the higher the appreciation.** \n\nP.S: The prediction is a way to fine-tune Ni. I'll call it a hobby at this point.
6	My best friend does this. He told me he dismissed me entirely as hopeless when we first met, as I was aimless and headed towards failure. And well, I did crash as expected but I got out stronger and determined, and that caught his attention, so he kept me around. Updates me every once in a while when he foresees a change of path or when he sees a bad habit of mine snowballing, which is cool even though I feel like a test subject in an ENTJ life-coaching experiment sometimes. 
13	You calculate them, assess their vulnerabilities and gauge their worth
6	Where I live right now most people are going to die from sugar, drugs, smoking and drinking before they are 70.\n\nA motivational speech by an ENTJ would save their sorry asses and turn them all into triathletes CEOs.\n
2	No but the more I get to know them the more easily I can imagine their hole entire future. 
2	This is freaky, specially makes you feel exposed. ENTJs have Ne critic which makes them conscious of other people's future and very responsible with their own (Ni parent). I never put it in that context.\n\nAlways believe I'm quite perceptive but I'm probably more worried about other people's future if at all. This fits so much really.
2	No but I'm going to start. Seems like a cool thing to work on.
2	Haha yeah, and sometimes we tend to be somewhat controllers on others decisions, because we like see the future
1	Yes, eventually after about eighty eight minutes
6	Cast aside all relationships and embrace your destiny	We are ENTJs\nCold passionate and calculating\nLove us or hate us we will win\n

1	At any cost sir. At any motherfucking cost

16	What causes anxiety for you?	I'm wondering what causes anxiety for other ENTJs. I know for me it tends to be the likelihood that I will fail at a task and not be able to accomplish my goals. I can also get anxious about relationships to an almost crippling degree.
19	When I feel I’m in a situation I perceive to be threatening that I have no control over. Classic ENTJ I guess. It comes out most when I’m flying. 
10	Irrational worry/fear resulting from deep seated childhood trauma and losing people dear to me unexpectedly and always in unpleasant manners. Has left me in a high alert state that is only subsided through meditation, lots of training and an unhealthy obsession with achieving all of my goals, both big and small. Anxiety is a bitch, but it’s a bitch who can be tamed.  Oh and 420
10	Being able to effectively parent an INFP child...
15	I get anxious when I'm not able to get what I wanted to done. Like when it's one of those days where you get e-mail after e-mail asking you to do shit when you already your day mapped out.\n\nI'm not nearly as flexible or open-minded as I should be when it comes to work, but structure results in insane levels of productivity and I wish I could take the insanely stupid requests from colleagues and shove them up their asses.
4	Loud noises when I’m trying to focus or concentrate. Repetitive noises are the worst. You know how some people like to turn the TV on for background noise? I can’t stand it. 
5	Group projects with assigned groups. I don’t procrastinate, but I’ve been stuck working with people who wait until the very last second to start and what do you know, their part is either unfinished or severely lacking. 
4	Not very flexible when my schedule has to change - I plan my days so I hate it when things change. I used to stress a lot about being good at my job but I’m feeling more confident these days 
5	Failing to get done what needs to be done in the timeframe I have given it. 
4	My INFJ daughter saying that astrology is better than MBTI typing.
6	When I'm around someone who is basic as fuck.
2	I think this has to do more with enneagram. I am very similar to you. I also think unexpected things. It has to be badly unexpected and very shocking. Unexpected moves. Like I said really big ones. But yeah. Unprdictable people. Can’t think of too many things right now. 
2	stores. maybe its the lights or all the stuff to look at. breathing techniques  work, in the nose out the mouth. It's still the most uncomfortable thing I do.  this is a recent change. as a kid/teen i loved walking around stores all day. 
2	ESFJ supervisor 🤪
2	When I’m at work, I often find myself frustrated and anxious when I have to depend on someone else to do a project. I guess it’s the fact that I can’t necessarily control what the other person does. Makes me sound like a control freak but it’s that mentality of “I should just do it myself” 
1	Not being able to get what I want done quickly and unreasonably hindered by people you can’t immediately out-maneuver, at the same time. Dead end situations. 
1	When I don't have enough time to do things properly. 
1	Feeling like my time is being wasted and I can't do anything about it. It happens a lot in my University where they shove you into a random political talk when I'd rather be studying (Venezuela)
1	Failing at life because I'm procrastinating my life away, or already have and it's too late
1	I get anxiety if I don't get work done lmao, everything must be caught up and perfect all the time, sounds tiring but apparently that's life xD

6	Feeling extreme anxiety working towards my goals	Hello fellow ENTJs, I'm an ENFJ. If it helps, my tritype is 4w3  (with a strong 3 wing) 7w6 8w9. Recently, I have been extremely motivated in reaching my goals (18, fresh from highschool!), from planning every day of my life, to taking the initiatives in finding opportunities and part-time job openings. In the past 2 months, along with a tiring F&B part-time job, I've taught myself graphic design, improved my people skills', appearance and way of speaking, regular exercise etc. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, I can't help feeling **extremely** anxious everyday. My shoulders feel "weak", my hands tremble and I feel really anxious. On the outside, I keep projecting a confident image but the inside is opposite. I constantly compare myself to other people on social media (I know it is everyones' highlight reel, but still...), and in my heart I really, really want to one-up them. I used to be extremely confident and outgoing till highschool, where I had horrible depression, intense emotional outbursts that drove away all my good friends. I have been betrayed by jealous 'friends' before, who constantly put me down while I was dumb, naive and tried to foster harmony. Since then, I have built up new, far more positive and supportive groups of friends. I had extreme social anxiety for 5 years and pushed myself everyday to get rid of it. Since then, I am able to make prolonged eye contact, talk confidently, assume leadership positions. However, inside I am quaking with self-doubt. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am doubtful I will ever be able to achieve my goals, I am extremely afraid someone will eventually betray me especially in the friendships, workplace (I know this is inevitable), I am afraid that my drive for harmony will continue to lead people to step over me. I feel so stupid being so idealistic and naive sometimes, especially since my true vision lies in Arts. I like to believe in the good of people and get extremely angry internally when it backfires. Last but not least, I **need** to be validated by people liking me, as stupid as it may seem. I get really upset when people do not like me, and need to find out the reasons why. (I know there will always be people who do not like you, but it is difficult for me to accept, unhealthy as it may seem) Truthfully, I get insanely jealous of INTPs/ISTPs/INTJs, who can do things their own way confidently.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny advice? (I am asking here because of the common Ni function we share, am really interested in seeing the differences between a Te-dom and Fe-dom)
5	I'm not going to tell you to compare yourself to others. I'm going to tell you to not RELY on comparison to find your worth. Or alternatively, realise through comparison that you're doing well, and hence stop being so anxious.\n\nNo compulsive desire is good. Your desire to one-up them/be liked by everyone is healthy until it makes you miserable. \n\nJust let it go. Seriously. Don't make these desires personal, because that's when they swallow you up. That's when you start getting miserable by ironically trying to be likeable, and you start hating things you love. 
4	My impression of you is that you are very intelligent and self-aware. Your honesty is brave, but you have to be able to identify when your brain is playing tricks on you and blowing things out of proportion. As confident as we all try to appear in life, everyone has insecurities. Fake it till you make it, and I do believe you will make it in time.  \n\nPhysiological manifestations of anxiety may be a sign of an anxiety disorder, which is essentially an overactive fight-or-flight response. You are the boss, not your reactions. Exposure-response therapy is the most effective treatment for social anxiety. You can try it on yourself, or seek a specialist to help you. \n\nI do not have the same emotional needs that you do, and have never craved validation or experienced jealousy of that sort in my adult life. I believe your fellow ENFJs may have better advice for you on that front. I will say that there’s no shame in having thoughts/feelings/needs that are irrational in nature, it’s how you respond to them that counts. 
2	You know what.. you should not give so much damn about your emotions. You're intelligent and self-aware. If you can't be successful, if you can't be confident, if you can't be whatever you want to be, then something is controlling you. Maybe it's your anxiety. Maybe it's your longing for validation. But what makes this all up is your EMOTIONS. You should control it  — Control it before it controls you. Don't be afraid to be ignored. Don't be afraid not to be liked. Fake it 'till you make it but do not resist everything including your feelings because it will end up hurting you more. Just like I said, control it, but don't resist. Be smart and confident enough to achieve your goals. Emotions are just there to guide you and make people understand you, not to control your destiny.
7	Drinking or staying sober?	I’m turning 18 soon(legal drinking age where I live) and I am not sure if I’m gonna want to drink or not. \n\nI am wondering what is your reasons for drinking or staying sober?
21	I stopped drinking because of hangovers fucking up the next day.
11	As a rule of thumb, I stop after two glasses, whether it's beer or rum.\n\nTwo important pieces of advice:\n\n* When you drink, stay hydrated. Alcoholic beverages dehydrates the body. So have a glass of water for every glass of something else. This will reduce hangover, sickness and hopefully stupid behaviours (fatigue & alcohol compounds, removing a bit of physical fatigue is not a bad idea).\n* Alcohol is the archenemy of memory. When you drink, whatever happened since the last time you slept is going to get blurry or forgotten (memory get "set" during sleep time). The more you drink the less will remain. Never drink after a day long of studying, that would waste all your efforts.  \n
6	* Hangovers suck\n* Bad for your liver\n* Pissing away your money\n* Useless calories\n* Encourages poor decisions\n* Negatively affects mental performance for multiple days afterwards\n\nAll for a “fun” night that you will barely remember, if at all, followed by a day of feeling like a vomitous salty squid with brain fog. \n\nI used to drink socially but as I got older the hangovers became more and more debilitating so I dropped the drink. \n\nIt does give a nice buzz and liquid courage, but it’s a lame way to socialize, so who cares? \n\nWorking out gives me a nice buzz and *solid* courage, plus a slew of health benefits and basically ZERO drawbacks. Life enhancer, longer lasting, I look fly as fuck, I get more positive attention, I have more confidence, more energy, food tastes better and I get an all around boost in physical and mental performance. 
4	The key is everything in moderation. Alcohol is great and may have health benefits in low doses. It gives you a buzz and makes you feel disinhibited. The problem like everything is it can become a vice. Healthy use of alcohol would be two drinks 2 or 3 times per month and never in dangerous situations like operating vehicles. I would definitely try it at least once or twice and learn to use it responsibly.
6	I don’t do any drinking or drugs. They do not work for a productive life. They are bad in my book. Drunk people means lots of them act weird. I haven’t touched a drop of alcohol or drugs in my life. And not going to do it. I won’t touch it. Well okay. I’ve had alcohol but most of that has evaporated because I’ve only had it cooked in food and when it’s finished there you know they’re not very drug like at all! I’ve had stuff like banana foster pudding and things with cooking sherry but that’s it.
2	What ever you do, don’t drink around your exes and her mutual friends because you will embarrass yourself. \nIf you’re gonna drink with people you don’t want to annoy drink lightly.\nIf you’re at a random club, drink lightly\nIf you’re with the boys then drink till you’re fuckeyed\n\nEdit you’re a girl ignore what I said 
2	1. Hard liquor first. Beer after you're already buzzed.\n\n2. Drink water.\n\n3. Loose lips? Just don't drink
2	Try it until you’ve “been there, done that” then reevaluate. 
2	I love to drink. I'm really into craft beer, so that's the main reason I do it, but I love to get a buzz going on weeknights, and then get decently drunk on the weekends. I just do it because it makes me feel happy (not that I'm unhappy otherwise), and I love trying new beers. \n\nIf you're gonna drink often, just make sure you eat a balanced, healthy diet, and drink a lottttt of water. Overtime you'll learn what you like, and what your body can and can't handle, so just try new things and take it slow.
2	I had my first drink when I was about 12. My father did not care. Older people around me would succumb to alcoholism or die when drunk (I grew up in a crappy place) but I never received the alcoholic gene. Hard liquor still tastes like shit to me and I don't hold the liquor too well. I did drink plenty of beer though throughout college and afterwards. Eventually I stopped because a) alcohol and crappy food would upset my stomach and that was not fun at all and b) I got tired of being around stupid people and being stupid myself. Seriously, being drunk handicaps you. Also hangovers do suck indeed.\n\nUnless you think you might get addicted, which is usually genetic, I recommend trying some decent alcohol in small doses. If you are Asian, Native American, Inuit or some other exotic ethnicity that doesn't have a history of alcohol consumption like Europeans do, you might want to stay away altogether. Even if you are Caucasian, you might still get addicted with lower probability.\n\nHaving tasted alcohol (after a long day or on a weekend so that it does not steal productive time from you), I would cut down on it or quit altogether. You re a lady and should not try to outdo the dudes when it comes to drinking. The alcohol when used properly can help you relax, but it can also worsen your athletic and academic and even sexual performance when it is used too often. It can age you a bit faster. What woman wants to age faster?\n\nTrump and kids do not drink. It gives them a edge over the competition - they have more productive time. Jocko also stopped drinking. A lot of overachievers do not have time for alcohol in their lives. You probably want to experience it a little bit for cultural reasons.\n\nDrinking is kind of incompatible with parenting. When you are pregnant or are raising a child, you are responsible for an innocent and fragile life. Drinking only makes it more likely that you will fuck something up. Little kids aren't smart enough to avoid risk so you have to be there for them and be sober.\n\nGet it out of your system, do not do too much of it and then just stop altogether. For maximum liver protection (alcohol does damage your liver indirectly every time that you drink) you want to consume something bitter like chicory root extract or dandelion root extract. Not only is it good for you, it is fucking delicious.\n
1	It's ok to have a drink here or there.  As long as you don't do it in excess or in too often of a frequency that is is a habit.  People DO do stupid things when under the influence, but ONE (true serving) should not throw you over to the point where you lose control of yourself.
1	No real reason to not drink at all unless you try and just don’t like it, try it and find you have a problem with stopping, or have a family history of alcoholism. I’m surprised at how many teetotalers and prudes there are among this subreddit. That said, 18 year olds tend to make poor decisions when they drink to excess, so be thoughtful about it while you learn your limits.
1	Don't drink, do you really want to lose control of your bodily functions and do something you'll probably regret tmrw?
29	If you want to be effective is a group-project, being a dick won't get you anywhere.	Face it. Unless you can brace yourself for the breach of unfathomable amounts of solowork, you must concede some points occasionally. Constantly getting your way on irrelevant things will slow down and destroy the momentum of groups.  \nWork to properly gain advantage, work where you are strongest. If the time spent arguing about which road is faster is larger than the difference in time between the roads, you end up being ineffective either way.
12	Water wets, fire burns.
7	Yeah. People tend to listen better if you’re nice. If you’re working with someone who’s just awful, don’t express frustration in an intimidating way, just tell them bluntly and calmly and make the entire presentation in Comic Sans from someone else’s account. 
1	Not a dick most of the time.  But when I do...
1	There’s a difference between using te and using te against people/hitting people with te over the head. Yeah, one is pretty neat the other just isn’t cool. Learn to keep te in check and use charm and persuasion. I can be very te when leading but leading and being a jerk, well there’s a clear line between the two. 
1	I'm a professional painter who works for different contractors. Was running a job that was in a time crunch. One of the slower guys asks to leave early to pick up his kid. No problem, except he left 200$ worth of paint and tools out in the sun, sticking me with the mess. The next morning, the other guys were waiting for me to ring his neck. Instead I was compassionate, calm, and respectful. Guy beat himself up for the rest of the week, and his performance actually improved. 
1	I knew an ENTJ in highschool, extremely unhealthy underneath though. He was really fun and funny on the surface when I first met him. In an important groupwork with his 3 other classmates, he single-handedly declared that he alone would do the whole project, because it would be more "efficient and effective that way" (LOL sounds like the typical ENTJ) When his classmate said everyone should pitch in instead, they broke out into an argument, with him SCREAMING at her and *throwing tables across the classroom.* I have no idea how they manage to glide along the project for next 7 months, but did not get good results eventually. 
1	I must intrude on your post. \n\nDon't be a dick as in don't "manage." Managing is trying to get people do something your way. It's an "okay" method as in it is a working way of controlling and getting work done especially when one has monetary or any other extrinsic power over the other. But that's all it is, an okay method, one that is especially popular in corporate America.\n\nBe a dick as in tell what you really think to the other person. Yes, don't butter someone about something that isn't good. That's manipulation: Don't manipulate through conceding. Instead, be charming, talk with the intent to help the team and I mean really help the team. Inspire people to do great work and doing great work means not conceding unless you are certain that it will in harm. Don't settle for mediocre if you know there is room for betterment.  \n\nBe willing to argue and fight your stance and do so with logic to defeat any argument that comes in you way. And be willing to give in when you logic is fallacious without any emotional attachment. Efficiency is crucial but more so is the execution. Don't just be efficient. Execute.    
1	What do you think is a good direction for a future market giant?	Something that's been on my mind lately(i'm an INTP by the way) is how one would become a competitor in a natural resource market...like steel. If you wanted to out-innovate them you are gonna have QUITE the task on your hands, as they have millions to potentially billions in resources that can hire people much smarter and who will have access to better research methods. It seems unlikely that you would outmaneuver a major corporation like this.\n\nThat being said, you should be able to play a sort of checkers. If I were to start a business of wrench production, then fridge production, then car production, then not only would my business have more funds to compete with but also there is a higher incentive to be vertically integrated than just a normal business. It'd also be easier to get into cars if you're already buying large amounts of steel for cheap(simply lower startup costs for businesses related to your current production line).\n\nYou should also be able to achieve this by working backward from some predefined long term goal but this long term goal is REALLY hard to define from me. It's like...there are so many variables I have no clue where we will be in 50 years. Right now I'm kinda just working backward from the ideal VR future and things people would do in that VR future. I.e. what are the components required to hook someone's nerves up to a machine and have them play a game. The program would not be difficult, but hooking their nerves up would be. Then what are the components necessary to make the components of the nerve machine ad infinum until you reach where we currently are with tech. Then just invest in the areas closest to the current state of tech and build the components slowly towards your long term goal(the VR machine).\n\nI think this is too far out though(maybe 100-200 years tops). 50 years from now what do you think will be the best investments and biggest market contenders? What do you think is the best way to achieve market control apart from a brilliantly over the top innovation. What resources would you want control over 50 years from now( Steel? Carbon fiber? Etc)?
5	As far as tech goes, I'd control think rare-earth metals and semiconductors. Besides silicon, there are so many more elements that go into chips and with new advances in computing and the upper limit of silicon efficiency getting closer, scientists are looking for different materials to trick into thinking for us. 
5	I think the most important technology in the near future is energy generation (clean). Probably nuclear
3	>If I were to start a business of wrench production, then fridge  production, then car production, then not only would my business have  more funds to compete with but also there is a higher incentive to be  vertically integrated than just a normal business\n\nThese markets are saturated and the entry cost counts in hundreds of billions. Not gonna "have more funds" before decades, in the best case.\n\n>It'd also be easier to get into cars if you're already buying large amounts of steel for cheap\n\nIt won't reduce the cost of the gazillion technology, algorithms and captors that makes today's car what it is. Steel is a trifle in comparison.\n\n>I have no clue where we will be in 50 years.\n\nNobody has.\n\n>50 years from now what do you think will be the best investments and biggest market contenders?\n\nNobody could even answer this question for next year with certainty, you know...\n\n>What do you think is the best way to achieve market control apart from a brilliantly over the top innovation.\n\nThere are strategy books on the topic written since the 50's. [Basically you differentiate (including niches), you do cheaper or you focus on a few things to do them better](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_advantage).\n\n>What resources would you want control over 50 years from now( Steel? Carbon fiber? Etc)?\n\nEnergy, food, construction materials... This answer was, is and will be the same as long as the economy runs.
2	Improving human mind. The source of all our tech. \n\nAnd invest in your self. Your self is with you no matter what the future. 
2	Wherever demand is...
1	Read about JTBD - jobs to be done- theory. It's less about "prediction" and more finding underserved markets you can really own right now. A lot of companies fall in love with the tech, but without a real problem being solved, or deep knowledge of the customer, it's hard for a "tech first" company, to get any traction.\n\nYou can knock an established industry off it's perch (like Uber did), but you gotta have a product many times better, have a good strategic go to market plan and grow fast. The other option is to create new markets. Which requires exceptional UX and sales/marketing on top of a killer product. In the long run, it's probably a better option, but may be very capital intense at the start.\n\nI look for problems over solutions (tech). 
3	Are you interested In fashion or would you consider yourself fashionable?	So I saw this post on the INTP subreddit (I think) and I was wondering what the ENTJ-view on fashion is. \n\nAre you interested in fashion? \n\nAnd if so, what kind of fashion do you prefer wearing?
7	Yes. I consider fashion to be an indispensable element of civilized society. I wouldn’t call myself particularly fashionable, but I like to look good. Mostly suits, gym clothes, and some casual clothes. At a later stage I’ll be building a travel wardrobe. Shoes are always relevant, and I love my shades. Haven’t gotten into watches though. \n\n\nMostly keeping it simple but with high quality materials and design. Brand can be a factor, though it usually isn’t. 
7	I consider myself fashionable (glamorous even), but not terribly interested in fashion. I often just recreate looks I see elsewhere that appeal to me. I have a sense of what is trending now, and have a finger to the wind of what’s coming. My INTP boyfriend isn’t fashionable at all without me, he couldn’t be less concerned with things like that (which part of me likes because he is so free from the confines of society, and that mentality rubs off on me for the better). There are times I use fashion more as a form of self-expression, but most the time I just want to look sharp, feel good, and be taken seriously. 99% of patterns on women’s clothing don’t appeal to me at all. My boyfriend absolutely hates corporate logos.\n\nContext and mood matters. What you’d see me wearing at a music festival is a lot different than how I usually present myself. I’m not over-the-top, but I do like to add some designer pieces just to wield influence over the superficial masses. Plus, they’re cute and quality. I love Chanel.
3	I like to look good/ presentable, but I won’t sacrifice too much on comfort. \n\nShirt/tshirt and chinos instead of sweats when going out the house.
3	I work in the fashion industry and have always been known to look well put together. I prefer to look glamorous and even overdress sometimes - makes for an interesting and good first impression and makes me feel good!
3	Haha! Not really. I am not ugly and unfashionable and just unpresentable. But I tend to be more about comfort. Not a big fashion or aesthetical person.
2	At home I'm in gym clothes.  Outside sometimes in gym clothes or slacks and shirt.
2	Comfort > conformity. Flexibility and privacy > self-expression.
1	I make myself presentable, but don’t really keep up with whatever weird stuff is trendy. If I had my choice, I’d wear all black everyday but my mom (ESTJ?) says no. \nI am uninterested in fashion more myself to wear because it all looks uncomfortable and isn’t as conservative as I would be comfortable with, but as someone who likes to draw, I take an interest in what colors look good together and what textures/ patterns clash in good or bad ways. 
29	Thematically what it's like when ENTJs and ENTPs join forces and decide to work together.	
2	Oh fo sho.
1	LOL OK
0	I don't get this... at all? 
3	Fellow ENTJs, what gives you fulfilment in life?	What fulfils you when you’re at your best? What fulfils you when you’re at your lowest?
10	Transcendent moments of human connection that are greater than the sums of their parts. This occurs often in music for me personally, but also in deep conversation, romance, and elsewhere. Any experience that is the result of beautiful human decisions, especially the ones that would have been impossible to predict, or ones that are unique to the individuals involved. Any time I am involved in a moment like that, whether I spurred it or am just witnessing it, I feel filled with meaning. Moments like this add to my consciousness, and they make me feel significant, like this current timeline would not be possible without the specific events that unfolded in which I played a part.\n\nWhen I'm at my best, I feel fulfilled after extended periods of "flow state." When I'm at my lowest, it's hard to find fulfillment. Significant relationships, like best friends, family, romantic partners can offer a sense of warmth to remember that they care for me. When I'm down, I try to remember that I am observing life from a point in time, and I think about where I was a year ago, two years ago. Acknowledging the progress I have made can help bring my spirits back up.
4	Bringing forth order and leadership (Te) aligned to deep spiritual truths and creative solutions (Ni) to impact the ordinary world in an aesthetically pleasing way (Se) according to my highest personal values and in my own unique approach (Fi). \n\nThe counterintuitive bit is that it only works as well as the weakest function in the process. \n\nRemove any one of those critical pieces and fulfillment is unlikely. \n
3	Meaningful work. Meaningful connections. 
3	Meaningful conversations.\n\nThinking and applying knowledge and being able to talk about them.\n\nBeing productive.\n\nLearning\n\nGetting stuff done.\n\nPlaying intellectual type games word games, trivia, and stuff of this nature.
2	Knowing my cause effects.
2	Giving birth to things.\n\nNot much. Remembering that there have been and therefore will be better days. Just trying to lose small and then compensating it by winning big.\n
2	When I'm at my lowest? Remembering what life is all about, being close to nature and seeing that my problems are trivial and temporary and that I don't need much to survive. I like to go hiking with a small group of friends, it's very grounding and takes your mind off problems.\n\nAt my best, I have these running streaks where it feels like everything I touch turns to gold. It's exhilarating and I keep bouncing off the energy from the last win and using it to get even better results in other facets of my life. At these times I'm my best self, my most outgoing, effective, and everything feels electric. I don't live for these moments though, they're sort of an unexpected bonus. 
6	Comprehensive article on Affective Eye Contact	[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6121038/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6121038/)\n\nEye contact is probably the most important non verbal communication technique.  I was wondering how much eye contact is most effective.  Found a nice article.  Thought I'd share.\n\n**TL;DR**   Although longer periods of eye contact may be disruptive for cognitive performance and may lead to gaze aversion (presumably to decrease cognitive load, e.g., [Doherty-Sneddon and Phelps, 2005](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6121038/#B37)), shorter periods of eye contact could, indeed, trigger positive affective reactions, thus leading to improved cognitive performance and facilitation of social interaction. A particularly interesting issue relates to the possible effects of eye contact on therapeutic change, via positive affective reactions. In the field of psychotherapy, positive affect has been suggested to play a role as a generator of therapeutic change by facilitating cognitive flexibility ([Fitzpatrick and Stalikas, 2008](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6121038/#B48)).
15	ENTJ's that love their job, what do you do?	
24	I'm a consultant and tell people what they should and should not do. 
19	I work in renewable energy as an asset associate. I make sure solar power plants are running as efficiently as possible because payments are tied to power production. I love looking at blueprints and energy data and figuring out why certain power plants perform to the degree they do. \n\nI’m super passionate about climate and the environment and I love being able to tie that into my work. 
12	Attorney. Toxic tort litigation mostly. I represent individuals who have been occupationally exposed or exposed in a rental to very harmful substances (asbestos, mold, silica, talc, etc.).  Mainly I do asbestos and sue \~40 companies for each plaintiff and litigate against them.  I get to argue in court, in depositions, in briefs, in memos, in negotiations... it's quite fun.
10	Im a psychiatrist and I study people and help them
7	I work in revenue operations at a quickly growing start-up. I lead projects that don't require dev resources, perform analytics, do occasional data entry/day to day functions, and try to make things as efficient as possible.\n\nI love to be constantly challenged, held accountable, and involved in new opportunities. I wouldn't say I'm passionate about the industry I'm in, but each of the above needs are met so I'm happy.
6	I'm a director of engineering at a software company.  We just had a successful exit, though, so we'll see what's next.  I might stay on or I might start something new.\n\nI love creating products that people love and can't live without and I love leading teams of smart people to do it.  
6	Real estate development. I love playing a part in (hopefully) creating sustainable and positive communities and improving the way people live. I love watching things come to fruition and obstacles be overcome and then knowing that I've changed the very fabric of not just the suburb but by virtue of the number of projects I do, the city is my tapestry when it comes to creating improvements in the world.

7	Efficiency vs Morality	I was having a debate with an associate of mine today over Steve Jobs, trying to make the point that his impact on modern life is unrivaled (figuratively of course, I know there's people who have had a bigger impact). He didn't code, but his leading skills were in a tier of their own, and he kept his eyes on the big picture. Because of him, Apple has become the most profitable company in history, and no one could rival his talent when it came to making technology appealing to the common man. He was amazing at getting the world to embrace the new, which is crucial since most people are cautious of technology by default, it seems. No one could have handled such a level of macro and micro-managing regarding an entity like Apple, and he single-handedly brought it back from near-bankruptcy, to become the greatest company ever. Apple has almost become a religion for the youth.\n\nBut my associate says all of this doesn't matter, because Jobs was an asshole of a person. He says his workers were increasingly disgruntled with Jobs' leadership style, and that Jobs' personal character nullifies any of his accomplishments. I say that his leading style was ***needed*** to produce such a high level of effectivity as it did, and his impact on the world crushes any significance of him not being a "nice person". \n\nIt's not just with him though, I've noticed it's the social norm to nullify the accomplishments of great historical figures just because they were "morally bad". To me, only losers concern themselves with morality to such a high degree, because they can't rely on concrete achievement as an arguing point. \n\nWhat are your opinions?
7	He did what he had to do and he got it done efficiently.  Morality is relative, results are reality.  He was the one getting shit done and left the discussion of morality to the sideliners, oh and your associate is probably using an iPhone lol.  Am I right?  
5	His leading style wasn't necessary to produce the results he's responsible for, nor does his character nullify his success. The accomplishments a person achieves go beyond their personality.\n\n>To me, only losers concern themselves with morality to such a high degree,\n\nThis is wrong. See Unit 731 and Hisashi Ouchi.\n\nEveryone draws a line somewhere, it's just a matter of tolerance.
2	I don't think this is a question of efficiency vs morality. It's a question of vision. Jobs had a vision that most perceived to be grandiose at the time. It's one of those things where, if you don't actually get it working for others to see, people may not "get" it. There are some things where you can "convince" people to get on board with but there are some things where coercion and being an asshole have to be the way to make headway. Jobs was not just convinced in his vision, he had to make it happen and if he would be branded as an asshole, I doubt he cared: To him it was the cost of implementing something so transformative. People can hate Steve Jobs but they can't deny the respect they have for his vision. In retrospect, getting your feelings hurt to be a part of developing something historical is not going to matter in the long run but history books will bring him up in a bad light anyways to morally preach right vs. wrong to their audience. I agree with you, without his attitude and his absolutely control over the micro details and macro vision, Apple would have never become the paradigm shifting company that it became.
2	Steve Jobs who didn't believe in showering and died from trying to cure his highly treatable cancer with fruit? I respect his accomplishments. Him? Not so sure 
1	His employees were free to leave and the Brooklyn communists were free not to buy Apple products thus bankrupting the company. Neither side did that.\n\nI would also argue that Linus Torvalds, an asshole that he is has done A LOT for this planet. You can do without a Mac or an iPhone but Linux is vital, even if you don't know it.\n
0	it's just two sides of the problem, that's life. You cannot pick both. No one is wrong here. Some choose harmony (Fe), some choose efficiency(Te). Both have ups and downs that the opposite doesn't have.
-1	Sacrificing morality for achievement is never ok. What good is it too be successful if everyone hates you for being an asshole? Besides, was he really that successful? His company is no longer the most valuable. The iPhone is losing polarity. Apple is making less profit with every passing year. A truly successful visionary creates a self sustaining company that continues to run even after they're gone (Sam Walton 😍). Jobs failed to do that. When he died, the people closest to him could only talk about how much they hated him. Is that the legacy you want to leave? How about instead, you be kind, loving, understanding, and self sacrificing? Leave the world a better place, not just a more efficient place. You can be both a great and a great person. Don't compromise on one over the other. Find that balance.\n\nI'm an INTP despite my post sounding like that of an INFP 😂
4	Do you believe emotions are choices?	I've had major mental issues in the distant past(20 years ago) that were only cured by the 'realization' that all of my emotions were a choice. However I've recently been confronted with some emotions that I can't attribute to choice (specifically love). It's extremely terrifying and it's kind of rocking my world right now. I'm curious what you other entjs have experienced or might have thought about the choice of emotions. I always thought it was a hallmark trait of being entj.
8	The choice is your reaction to emotions. Then you can condition yourself more or less.
6	Proceed with caution.
3	No I don’t think it’s good to trivialize emotions like that. I believe feelings and emotions are natural to us all. We just decide if we choose to think about them or act on them. I think minimizing your emotions is dangerous. But I think acting rationally is a better idea but you can’t stop yourself from feeling. You’re not a robot and will never be, humans feel and think and this is just natural. Even if you prefer to think, all of us have feelings, and very deep ones as well.
3	You can't train your mind to love someone, so if you found a person you want to share positivity about living with then thats great and I think you should pursue. I do believe we can train ourself to stay away from negative emotions though.
2	I think these types of addicting relationships are more hormone/sex-based than the love and wholesomeness that one needs from a partner. Of course, a great partner will have that physical chemistry along with compassion and eventually love. \n\n\nIf he's nice and you're comfortable (...and if it's legal...), you should bang. Sex while you're feeling this kind of energy is pretty excellent.
2	Confused as sh*t Help	I've been browsing through google chrome for the past damn hours to figure out my personality type and I still got nothing, no information that are accurately correct. I've been digging up my grave since in school, doing research doing test/quizes and sh*t. Now I get a headache 2 AM in the morning. I am suprised my Mom didn't kill me yet. After searching up for hours, a website said that none is accurate including Myer-briggs, people get 4 letters based on what they want to be and not what they are. Unless you got tested by a perfessional. \n-\nI got results like: Entj, Entp, and Estj but first of all, I do like being sociable sometimes with other people. I can be humorous and loud, hype with in with people like me and like but I moved from Brooklyn to Pennsylvania months ago but I still haven't accept most of it. I just feel myself kinda change here. (ENTP) \nAnd, I do not pick decisions just because I have to.\n--\nSecond of all, Idk what is Estj\n--\nThird of all, I think I am a Entj (Edit: or ENTP ;-;) and I keep getting different results. I want it to be sincere with the results. but I am the kind to be disorganized but I don't think that got anything to do with it. I personally is not as organized but likes to be organized type in between. I like to choose my decisions with facts and information to proceed. I don't get offended easily nor I am emotional but emotionless. I do not like inrelevent people proving me wrong dumb facts. (Actually made another instagram account to prove my friend that her fact is invalid and I dont care about how she feels about it, facts are facts)\nI usually don't like to be in charge or notice but naturally unconsciously I do order people sometimes or help people with work like do half half so he or she won't get tired or overdo herself with all the work. I have logical explanation to things, I like things my way. Sometimes I like to independent by myself, other times I like to be social with other people. I respect people but not ones who are wrong with facts and try to persuade people into believeing their nonsenseness. I only do things if I feel like to, I do not like to be forced or rushed. And honestly, I feel better and superior than other people, I do not know why but I always think I am better than dumbness around (Not trying to be rude lol) . Also, I have high level of confident  and couldn't care about what other people thinks. That's all. \nEdit: I am desperate that I am a Entj-a. ;-; I legit searched up things like "How to know your a ENTJ or not" and other stuffs. I can kinda relate to it. \n*Edit #2: I don't know but I also somehow feel kinda connected to ENTP. It's just so confusing. Is it me or what I want to be?* 
5	I don't know so I will guess based on your words.\n\nYou sound like an ENTJ who is attracted to your shadow functions (INTP is your shadow) but you are sure you are an extrovert which makes it impossible for you to be an INTP so you end up on the neighbor personality, ENTP.\n\nTo sum up: you're a highly curious ENTJ\n\nNow, go out there slave some folks!
2	I can try to type you if you’re really serious you can try coming over to r/nononsensembti and we have an extensive survey that you can fill out to try to parce it out for you. Don’t be so stuck to a type all types are pretty neat and n over s doesn’t mean too much honestly. Both great but different strengths. One does not mean special and the other ordinary. That’s not what it means at all.
1	Just hang out at the different subreddits for a while, you'll find your tribe 
7	ENTJ loops	Just pasting from a friend's pastrebin. Idk the source. \n\nThe Driver/10-Year-Old Loop \n\n"There are three ways an ENTJ experiences the loop, the echo chamber–like relationship between the Driver and 10-Year-Old functions. The way to get out of a loop is the same in all cases: focus on developing the Perspectives process. \n\nShort-term loop. \n"When stuck in an emotion and unable to get out, the ENTJ may get caught in a loop of aggressive behavior or “monkey mind” for a few moments up to a few days. In the first case, the ENTJ is reactive to the situation, upset, and unable to think things through. They may become violent and hostile, and even start to throw objects. Alternatively, when experiencing monkey mind, the ENTJ may become unsettled, restless, indecisive, and uncontrollable. They may feel an intense need to escape a situation. \n\nLong-term loop.\n Compensating for insecurities, the ENTJ will focus on their image. They will see superficial markers, such as the social clubs they’re able to gain access to or the cars they drive, as genuine examples of success. In the loop, the ENTJ will convince themselves that they are deep and able to see things that others miss, but in reality, they avoid introspection out of the fear that they are not enough. Superiority covers their fear of inadequacy, and the ENTJ may keep the people in their lives from meeting each other so no one has the full story. \n\nHabitual loop. \nA less intense loop than the first, and far less offensive to others than the second, an ENTJ may stay in a loop of self-indulgence for an entire lifetime. Eating to mask emotions, binging on TV shows, following the path of least resistance…the ENTJ will fully embrace the monkey mind, chasing whatever is interesting to them in the moment, lacking any type of life plan, and drifting from one thing to the next. In this loop, the ENTJ hides from their real feelings and removes any meaning from their life.
6	This made me feel like I'm in a habitual look, but really I just think life has worn me out.
3	How to resolve the loop(s)? That's the important part.
1	Idk about your guy's loop, but with INTP's Ti-Si loop, the solution is bringing in new ideas and information.\nMaybe you guys need to bring in new people?
5	Awed by the ENTJ talent in here	Have met all sorts of people. We meet to get organized and help each other out
6	Yo my ego can only get so huge
3	You should be part of at least one Mastermind in real life. They help a lot.
2	How do you propose?
2	Jung...How are you so unbelievably smart????	\> When Faust exclaims “feeling is everything”, he is expressing merely the antithesis to the intellect, and therefore only reaches the other extreme ; he does not achieve that totality of life and of his own psyche in which feeling and thought are joined in a third and higher principle. This higher third, as I have already indicated, can be understood either as a practical goal or as the phantasy which creates the goal. This aim of totality can be recognized neither by the science, whose end is in itself, nor by feeling, which lacks the faculty of vision belonging to thought. The one must lend itself as auxiliary to the other, yet the contrast between them is so great that we need a bridge.\n\n\>This bridge is already given us in creative phantasy. It is not born of either, for it is the mother of both nay, further, it is pregnant with the child, that final aim which reconciles the opposites. If psychology remains only a science, we do not reach life we merely serve the absolute aim of science. It leads us, certainly, to a knowledge of the actual state of affairs, but it always resists every other aim but its own. The intellect remains imprisoned in itself just so long as it does not willingly sacrifice its supremacy through its recognition of the value of other aims.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOmg Jung please....PLEASEEEE jerk me off harder. This is literally things I have written as deductions from his theory. Jung is so god damn brilliant it is unreal.\n\nImplications: Unhindered thinking becomes increasingly specialized until he no longer represents anything that matters to life itself other than the enjoyment to the subject. In other words, by continuing down the path of specialization into irrelevance, the subject arrives are the conclusion of the self's love of thinking itself.\n\nFor Te:heaping of empirical facts into infinity\n\nFor Ti:heaping of mathematical facts which no longer represent reality in any way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA feeling baby who has no thinking simply feels intensely. A thinking baby who has no feeling simply thinks.\n\nThinking inherently serves feeling, in the farthest breaches the feeling value attained is to the self purely(altruism doesn't exist so in all actuality all feeling is purely for the self, but some happiness of the self can be or possibly be intrinsically derived from the happiness of others. Perhaps them smiling is intrinsically beautiful to you).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSensation and Intuition give rise to thinking and feeling in the form of phantasy, derived from the intrinsic chasm which intrinsically exists between both extroverted functions and introverted functions(Te->infinity=/=Ti...Fe->infinity=/=Fi). Phantasy then is not a request for a change in information, but rather a feeling desire to achieve harmony between the self and others(as conflict is created by extraverted and introverted function differences). Phantasy is produced by intuition and sensing as an ideal goal in which feeling has found value, but relies on thinking to reach.\n\nTi and Te dominance is characterized then by a goal and enjoyment of reaching said goal\n\nFi and Fe dominance is characterized by an intense relatedness to feeling and an enjoyment of experiencing feeling(the ideal being to solely experience happiness).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFeeling is the end goal. But since more happiness is intrinsically the goal of feeling, and feeling goals cannot operate without thinking to influence its surroundings in the form of a practical goal, it cannot exist independently. The goal is then settled by intuition and sensing perceiving ideals which coincide with feeling. Feeling is not solely produced by perception functions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo put it more simply: Phantasy comes from perception functions, thinking serves fantasy in the form of practical goals, practical goals are chosen by feeling, and feeling without thinking can't achieve the phantasy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQuestions that remains: What are intrinsic strengths that arise from having a perception function as dominant and a judging function as dominant? I would assume a greater fortitude in seeking a goal, as a goal is not the primary drive of either perception function? Unless the perception function is only satisfied by the realization of the ideal(for extreverted functions?) I'm not sure. But marking the strengths of a judging dominant versus a perception dominant seems do-able(I have tended to label perception dominants as "creative" and judging dominants as "problem solving).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAdditionally, Jung writes "phantasies are also valueless since in the form of raw material they do not possess a realizable worth", i.e. without doing they are useless. To take it further though, if we extend where we are currently as a species, phantasies themselves are valueless entirely. In other words, thinking is useless as a subsidiary of phantasies(thinking achieves the feeling designated goal granted by phantasies), i.e. you arrive at thinking's uselessness in the long term(i.e. nihilism at "max happiness").
40	How does an ENTJ find a partner to love?	Being an ENTJ is very lonely.\n\nI cannot feel a deep emotional connection with anyone.\n\nThe main issue is that everyone feels stagnate and unwilling to evolve.\n\nI am constantly doing something, furthering or developing a current or new skill, and going down deep rabbit holes.\nBecause of this, who I am the next week or day changes constantly.\nI  learn and piece together a random collection of skills and knowledge to compose who I am.\n\nI find it odd how my peers waste time on their social media feeds, they have the internet, they never go out and search through to find intresting things. At the end of every day I always have a fascinating collection of images and some odd random information I learned.\n\nI get really bored with just about everyone as a result.\nI feel if I spend 5 minutes with someone, I kinda know who they are, and how they will react in any situation. That makes it boring. I want someone who changes all the time and subverts my exceptions sometimes.\nThey do have other parts to them, but they do not feel complex enough, not enough layers to them, to comb through and learn from.\n\nWhat is your advice to meet someone like me?
20	You're looking at people very shallowly.  5 minutes is a judgement of someone, you don't really, 'know' them.  Be curious, however realize too, that people aren't there purely for your own entertainment and use.  It sounds almost as if you want to see if someone is useful and if they aren't useful to YOU, then you want to write them off, people can tell when you are doing this, so you are very likely sending off these vibes very clearly to othrs. \n\nThe way you worded your last sentence, "What is your advice to *meet someone like me*?"  Why did you word it that way?  You make it sound as if you are someone that OTHER people would want to meet, and you are somehow at a higher status.  If you truly had an open mind you would have asked, "What advice do you have for someone like me to develop meaningful relationships?"  Your arrogance is showing.
13	If you teach me where to find female ENTJs, I'll teach you where to find female INTPs :3
10	Are you like...24 or so? Plainly, I think we take longer to develop emotionally than other people. You need to learn to care about yourself if you want to have a deep emotional connection to someone else. My guess is you subvert your brain thinking about who you are, why you got there, and how to fix yourself so you don’t actually have to think about it. Don’t drink, don’t smoke, don’t take on a new project. Take some time to be alone with your thoughts, even though it sucks, and actually process some of it. Just a guess.
13	Date someone in your Quadra (yours is gamma: ENTJ, INTJ, ESFP, or ISFP) and you won’t have communication problems. You share all the same functions, everything is natural and fun.\n\nIt took me way too long to realize this, so I’m saving you a bunch of wasted time. 👍
6	I found an amazing INTP online
3	Are you me??
8	INTP here. I want an ENTJ because I have all these ideas but no will to solidify them. I think an INTP would be a great match because I describe INTP's as "infinite people". I like to think we go on forever, inward, whereas, I hope ENTJ's go on forever, outward. To me it's important to have someone to take charge of life and real world situations while I guide them. Essentially "you be the captain, I'll be the compass" type of relationship. So maybe ask yourself what you value most in a partner, because you will never get it all. Is it intelligence? Kindness? Integrity? Compassion? Humility? 
2	I'm an Entp and all I can say is that make it a game. Gamify it. Ask a random stupid question that asks a person to make a decision that is indicative of what you want to find out. Ask why next. Then go and go and go.\n\nInteractions are boring if you make it boring. As a person who constantly feels bored, I suggest find a way to not get bored. Tho a forever love is kind of hard if you often get bored. Just look for interesting ppl don't look at their mbti but look at their interests. Interesting ppl don't always look or seem interesting the first time. Unless they're entps, then we're just naturally afraid of getting bored. 
2	If you are looking for partner whom will help you to expand, challenge you in totaly new ways and perspective, I’ll recommend you an INFP. I made huge progress on many levels important in the relationships in 1 year, more than I did in my past (boring/not challenging partner) for two decade.\nMy INFP found way to bring my soft nurturing side out and I’m relly enjoying it, I have feeling, first time in my life that I’m completely devoted to someone without any restraint and that is lovely.
3	I have dated an ENTJ, ESFP, ESFJ, ENFJ, INFJ, ESTJ, ISFP, and am currently now dating an INTP. You gotta know yourself to know what you want from others, especially in an intimate relationship. Communication is key. And so is being with someone who challenges you and feels strongly about you. \n\nDon’t confine yourself to specific types of people. You are a very complex creature and you should explore who you are as in depth as possible. Doing so will help you immensely with finding someone right for you 
2	Are you restrained by ideology? \n\nEx: You're a conservative and refuse to date liberals or vice-versa, maybe you're religious and refuse to date outside your religion...\n\n&#x200B;
2	Infj!!!
1	I read the first three sentences of your post and instantly thought: oh my god this is so true. \n\nI am still struggling and have still not settled with anyone I find to be a good match to spend the rest of my life with (I‘m turning 30 this year). So I can only give you my two cents on this: \n\nThe closest I came to find some sort of true fulfillment in personal relationships is with a person who wasn’t the same as me, rather an introverted version. He was an INTP btw, even though I believe that only going after a certain MBTI is ridiculous. \n
1	You have to keep trying and date people past what they show you on the surface or you’ll never have a deep connection. These things don’t happen instantaneously for the most part, they’re developed over time and mutual effort. Most people aren’t going to show you their “depth” early on depending on the age group you’re dating in. 
1	Everyone is complex and constantly changing. A lot of people, like INTPs, are private and keep that stuff to themselves. Just chill out and take care of yourself. Don't assume things about people's inner lives. It's ok to slow down and enjoy were you are in life. You don't have to be achieving something 24/7.\n\nI know this sounds ignorant, but y'all ENTJs should really try it out 😂
1	Haha interesting.  Thank you.  
1	I don't look for partners and don't date, I just do my thing and if I meet someone along the way who seems worth it I go for it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI met my current SO by chance, got paired together for a project and just hit it off. Not boring, not social media obsessed, brilliant, similar interests, very emotionally in tune, and now I'm going to keep him. :D
1	Jaja, our pace is hard to keep; I’ve seen descriptions that ENTJ’s find hard to get a partner.\nIn my case, I look for someone to love, and share my passions, to have common passion and intelligence, so that I can make that person the happiest person ever. I think you should get out of your ego, and go and find someone you find interesting and intelligent, that actually will stimulate intellectually, and love you as you are; it’s hard, but not impossible. Try meanwhile to develop yourself and get to be a very interesting person. Once a person told me: “Don’t go and haunt butterflies, until you find some easy and not so hard to catch butterfly, they are generally not good quality; instead, get a beautiful garden, with beautiful flowers, so that the butterflies come to you and you’ll have the ability to choose”\nI know sounds like making women an object but in any shaper form, this assimilation is intended to show it. It’s more to explain, that on your path of succes, having a goal, a carrier, having a great life, girls will come automatically, and want to be part of that awesome adventure you are in, being contagious about your drive and desire in life, trust me, you’ll make your partner happy and viceversa, because you are worth to get the girl of your life.
1	Adolescent female ENTJ here. I feel your pain. I feel almost the exact same way. One things that is I found has helped me is trying to spot the INTP's and INTJS. When you research how to type them, it begins to get really easy to spot them. I have been able to identify friends/ suitors this way. I don't know what kind of ENTJ you are, but I have found some of my most rewarding connections to be very intelligent INFJ's, and INFP's. Some of them can be really annoying, but when you find a unique one, they are amazing listeners, and are able to give really good advice. I find it really easy to read people, as well, and am able to judge them within our first interaction. What works for me, is doing things I'm really passionate about, and watching people come to me. It might be worthwhile to read the 48 laws of power, it might help. What are you passionate about? Are you in college?
1	You gotta find a type that loves you for all the things that make you an ENTJ, like, say, an INTP :D Seriously, before meeting and falling head over heels for an ENTJ, I thought I was asexual or something. You guys bring out the romantic side of me that I didn't know existed. 
1	Find an INTP, but they're really hard to find...probably because they're at home reading.
1	For me, dating has been the answer because I have new people to meet all the time. I don’t get bored and I feel like I grow as a person knowing others. 
1	During my "dating phase" I felt this extreme boredom when dating some people. However, I think that you can find interesting people regardless of their personality type.\nHaving said that, I'm currently in a 2 and a half year relationship with an ISTJ. We both love planning stuff (trips, holidays) and we are both extremely rational and, in my opinion, this works really well. \nHowever, I especially like the fact that he is extremely trustworthy and steady: I can always rely on him and I'm sure that he's loyal to me. In addition to this, ESTJ are extremely good at executing orders: I also have ESTJ friends and I love being around them, as they are as efficient as me.\n\n\nSo, to sum up, even if you feel like people are boring, I can assure you that, regardless of their personality type (ISTJs are depicted as the supreme incarnation of boredom), it's just a matter of finding someone who you think is interesting, according to your preference (for example, I admire someone who is passionate about their job).\n\n
7	Hello. ENTP here. I have a life goal that has constantly been at the back of my mind for well over 3 years now (maybe even longer). So i thought, "what better place to get advice on how to accomplish goals than from the masters themselves?" Do you ENTJs have any advice on achieving goals?	
11	If you’re a completer-finisher, you will achieve them yourself. If you’re not, utilise the people around you who are and offer value to that dynamic (don’t just take). 
5	Create daily habits that support that life goal. Do not deviate.  Track your accomplishments and milestones, even if they seem minor and celebrate them. Good luck. 
5	Sometimes big goals can seem too hurculean to accomplish, so many find breaking a big goal down into smaller achievable sub goals to be easier to accomplish. This gives you the chance to feel a sense of accomplishment along the way to the final goal, and make the goal seem reachable. 
3	Find the right people for the journey.  People who'll be realistic but supportive. I find my path to my goals falls apart more often over settling for someone on my support team when I can't find the right person as quickly as I wanted. I have learned to be patient putting together my team. 
2	Keep going at it until you complete it. 
2	David Goggins
1	Great Advice already!\n\nFor me I know truly if I will finish something before I start it, i also dont take on more things during say studying until I've finished what i started. Dont overburden yourself :)
1	Start slow, adding new healthy habits that will apparently help you reach your goal, then add on and on :D
8	What do you do when everything breaks, inducing yourself?	Things in my life have fallen apart in the past 3 months. \n\n* Got injured on the job, but Workers comp found BS reasons to not pay out (no lawyer would take the case either)\n* While I was bed bound, Work redesigned all the projects I was on\n* Was fired from work on Christmas eve\n* Injury prevents me from doing the Job I went to College for\n* Medical bills and Student loans have all but eaten away my savings\n* Unemployment are dragging their feet. \n* Depression and pain prevent me from working on any meaningful personal projects.\n\nI’m having issues finding a solution to this question: What do you do when everything breaks? Do any of my fellow ENTJ know how to redirect a life from rock bottom, or maybe a direction I can look for answers (that preferably don't involve divine intervention )? I’m not looking for sympathy, Just a direction. \n
4	For me? The first thing was to realize that none of it made me a failure, and this was probably the hardest thing to do. I was so sure I'd screwed up somehow, and the anger at myself eclipsed everything else. \n\nI think toxic positivity really is a thing, and does a whammy on ENTJs. We get so comfortable not feeling that when there's simply too much emotion to box up and stick in the mental attic, we turn all our external frustrations on ourselves, because if we're feeling, it's because we're weak.  We don't give ourselves room to feel anger, depression, self loathing... anxiety is pretty normal for many of us. \n\nThe first step for me is to actually look at myself and fix where I can, identify what I can't, and ask for help with the latter. List out what you need to survive, and add a few things you need to thrive.  Put them in order of importance, then look at resources line by line. Forgive yourself for needing help. I promise it's ok. 
2	Come hell or high water, stay calm.  Start with a To-Do list and start fixing the smallest issues first.  Go back to the basics like sleeping early, waking up early, creating a routine and start working on your To-Do list.  
2	What did you study in college and what was the injury?\n\n> While I was bed bound, Work redesigned all the projects I was on\n\nWhat does this mean and why is it relevant?\n\nIn the short term you could e-beg on the internet.\n\nYou could also try making a ton of stink on say Youtube in hopes that the video goes viral. Most of the journalists are liberal. Michael Moore ought to jump on your case. I'm only half-joking. You have to have solid evidence on your side though.\n\nIf you can type, you can probably code. That's what I do but I learned it relatively young. A lot of people work from home these days. Not all IT work requires a lot of training. There is also a lot of online marketing to be done for ok $ but I do not understand this stuff.\n\n> Depression and pain prevent me from working on any meaningful personal projects.\n\nCan you get on disability? There are a ton of separate govt programs out there. You can always get off them.\n\nAre you in the US? Protect your downside ASAP by e-begging in the short term and having govt to pay for your very basic needs. Then hustle for online gigs, preferably using cash payments. Once you have stabilized, go up from there.\n\nYour health is probably \#2 priority after solving the cash flow problem.\n\nDo not get addicted to painkillers. Maybe weed can help you. If so, save a ton of $ by growing your own. It is going to be legal in just about every state soon.\n\nYou have a bag of dicks stuck in your ass right now and you've got to pluck them all out ... one at a time. They need to be prioritized though.\n\nThere is nothing cool about giving up on life so you might as well pretend to be a movie hero who overcame obstacles.\n\nYou need a variant of https://www.huffingtonpost.com/matthew-ricketts/aviate-navigate-communica_b_3563570.html except that asking this question on Reddit was a smart move and technically it is communication.\n\nP.S.\n\n* Workers comp filed and rejected because 'pre-existing injury' and they 'can't tell i was hurt at work'.\n* I didn't know I had a pre-existing injury till after I was fired.\n\nWhat pre-existing injury are we talking about? How could you not know about it?\n
1	Capitalise on the internet and pitch yourself as a virtual worker (like a VA), freelancer or consultant which you can all do from home or in bed. Getting back up as soon as possible helps, when life has been unfair and it all goes wrong. Makes you feel empowered and confident that it couldn't "kick you over". I can't say i've been messed around by work as you, but i've had some awful work experiences that knocked me around, and that's when I decided entrepreneurship was for me and I discovered there's a whole world of people working from home who charge good money for their services.   \n\n\nI'm an infp, but I hope this practical advice helps. I definitely empathise with you \*e-hugs\* 
1	I would say get a long time plan. Do you know when you will be cured? If you do, take loans or any job from home you can. Don’t waste your time (although that depends on the disability of course). \n\nSo, if you know when or around what time you are getting well, start looking for options and maybe even call those future jobs. Tell them, “listen, I have this disability right now... is there any possibility in getting there a job when I am cured in....).\n\nThat’s about all I can advice, but remember, do not waste your time. Regardless (almost) of your illness, there must be something you can do.\n\nOh, and also, of course, do whatever you need to get well. This is your life and yours alone, so if you want to make it good, you have to put effort.\n\nFurthermore, there is nothing wrong with getting an illness. I myself was in a death-risk one and still am living my life normally just two years after it happened. It’s just a normal incident, anything can happen to anyone; that’s out of our control. But what IS in your control is what you do about it.\n\nAnd also, about the jobs and them firing you, I don’t really know what exactly happened but - TOO BAD FOR THEM, they lost someone they shouldn’t have lost. And in any case, this can be the opportunity for you to take an even better job with a better salary and more fulfilment.\n\nOh yh, and I would suggest, talk to people who have gone through the same thing as you and how the overcame it (although normally they don’t give any good advice, but at least it’s good to socialise).\n\nFinally, don’t worry, this things happen but there is a lot of beautiful things in the future waiting for you - and only you can make them happen.
1	Turn your major into a niche. Become an expert on one or two big problems people have in the niche. Find these people, one by one at first, using phone and internet and help them solve their problems. Learn everything you can from the process. Acquire testimonials. If you have the funds, invest in marketing and develop a personal brand as the visible expert in the field. Make sure your cost to acquire a new client that needs your consulting services is less than what they pay you for the solution. Keep reinvesting the income into improving your marketing. Keep connecting to more clients and continue to master your niche. When you Improve your expertise, you improve your service as a consultant. Very straightforward. If you build enough momentum the engine will keep running and you will have more wiggle room to scale your consulting agency and turn it into a personal media platform, where the cost of entry is low for potential clients to get to know you and the value you provide, at their own pace and on their own timeline. Use your experience and expertise to develop an online course that provides your niche with a framework to solve their own problems. Set the course as a premium product for those who really need the extra help. Hire someone to close for you while you continue to invest in your superior expertise and wisdom in the niche, invest in your marketing and scale further by training “coaches” or “leaders” in the community who can assist all new potential clients with the online training without you needing to be there. Hire someone to run the company while you step into the next phase as a Celebrity Authority in the community and host events where you pass on your wisdom, do public speaking, write multiple books, etc. Whatever interests you most. At that point you’re probably making 6 figure income (or more, if you’re into that). You can retire comfortably if you invest your bonus income wisely. \n\nWhat you don’t know, you can pay to learn. \nWhat you don’t need to know, you can pay someone else to do. \n\nAbove all, commit to increasing your clarity just a little every day. 5 minutes in the morning or in the evening. Clarify what you need, what your goals are, what interests you, and the challenges you face. \n\nWhen you can describe your goals with great specificity and conviction....well I’m sure you’ve been familiar with that kind of headspace before! It’s just a matter of getting back on the horse. \n\nI’ve been rock bottom, man. I kinda started there. \n\nI’ve suggested an option for you to become an Internet consultant. It’s one of those kinds of opportunities where continuing your self education pays off Big Time. It’s where having a strong sense of clarity about what you need, what you want, what you like and what you must face positions you to lead others who are similar to you. It is rewarding work if you do it for the right reasons, and has long term viability that very few college degrees can ever promise, if they offer anything at all. It also is a way for you to get more value from what you studied, because it gives you a big head start and there is no pain about lost time. \n\nSolving One problem for One person can be evolved into a world-class skill if you work harder smarter and NOBODY has the unique experiences you have. Hence becoming a Visible Expert via your Personal Brand. Social media is very conducive to this. It also helps by making it easy to form communities and groups and targeted marketing, perfect for an ambitious expert consultant in ______....well you know your niche. It’s you, the problems you’ve solved in your field, and especially what most ignore, neglect or don’t know how to solve. \n\n\nUp to you what to do of course. I’m not an internet consultant, full disclosure. I don’t really have a niche, so the system won’t work for me. I never specialized in anything until recently and I went for developing a different high income skill. \n\nConsulting is a great high income skill if you have a niche. \n\nI’m a high ticket closer. Another possible option to look into. \n\nIf you like writing and have a way with words (and even if you may not) Copywriting can be pretty lucrative (bonus if you can corner a niche you love to write about!)\n\nProgramming is a high income skill, but to get it there you still need to learn the consulting skill. So that’s something to keep in mind. \n\nPublic speaking and event hosting are some more examples of high income skills. I don’t know as much about these. \n\nI recommend anything on the internet, anything that requires (and is missing) good leadership, improving communication, or anything using your powerful analytical skills (Te) and deep archetypal insight (Ni) to impact the world (Se) according to your authentic values (Fi). \n\nI apologize for the disorganized response, I’m a bit pressed for time so I’m just unloading what comes to mind that I think might be useful or helpful somehow. \n\nYou are experiencing a wicked problem in the system. Nobody should have to find themselves in such a situation. But who will do something about it? I think it’s obvious that major problems are solved by the people who suffer from them the most. Maybe that’s a good thing...I don’t really know. \n\nBest to you. \nKeep going 💪
1	Relax dude, in an infinite(Or at least really really large) world I'm sure there's something you can do. A little more information would go a long way though. What did you study in college? Do you have any hobbies or such that you are good at? What injury did you get on the job? What was the BS reason that was given to you?
4	How do I approach an ENTJ? (INTP asking)	Hi everyone. I've read that our types are  compatible but I've never really met one of you guys to test it out. Here is the next best place to find you, so I have a few questions that I can't seem to figure out on my own. Please be gentle and objective.\n\nHow do I spot one of you in the wild?\nHow do I approach one of you without turning you off?\nWhat turns you off anyway?\nWhat would you look for in a relationship?\nY
11	What turns me off the most I would say is incompetence,  when a discussion of ideas becomes overly emotional, or when I can sense someone backing out of a discussion for fear of saying anything controversial.  I like people who have the balls to put their ideas on display, but more importantly, people who also have the ability to defend their ideas from criticism and demonstrate they have actually put some thought in to where they stand.  I also love it when people aren't afraid to challenge me and my ideas and try to find flaws in my thinking.\n\nIt's hard for me to say how to spot us in the wild, I havent met many other ENTJs, but when it comes to approaching us, just be sincere I would say.  Avoid meaningless small talk as well.  I dont give a shit what you think of the weather, or about the Oscars.
3	As a general rule, I’m friendly and approachable. I do like people despite my lack of initial conversation. I think personally what I can’t stand are questions about ‘the weather’ or how my weekend went, I struggle with the mundane and want to know more about the other person first. If you’re interesting, or funny, I’ll find that out pretty quickly and give you more of my time. Introvert or not :) 
2	I’m adding a contrasting voice to the comments I’ve seen here so far. \n\nI don’t mind small talk. Building rapport can be sketchy and it’s a neutral talking point to get a feel for each other. I LOVE the sky, so I’m always looking at it (Se) and it affects how I feel (SeFi). So questions about the weather are fine by me 😏. But it’s become such a cliche icon for boring conversation that nobody really wants to talk about it anymore. \n\n———\n\nMy advice for approaching an ENTJ is to know exactly what you want from the interaction and then just come up and say it to your ENTJ. Yeah we can read between the lines and decipher all of the implicit meaning of what is said and what is not-said, but who has time for that? 🙄 Straight up, honest and sincere is the way to go. \n\nAnd if you’re looking for an ENTJ life partner, the nonverbal communication always develops over time, as you establish the set of memes you both readily understand and can use to communicate. All the more important to be straight up, honest and sincere in communication at the beginning. 
1	Subtle and engaging 
1	"Gentle"? From an INTP? Are you a girl? I(ntp) am put off by this "gentle" let alone my shadow beasts.
1	[deleted]
1	I'm a straight shooter, so someone with clear intention is the best approach to me. 
1	•How to Spot: Go to a college classroom (Tech or Business careers) the most awkward yet respected (also intelligent) and with great leadership/body language skills... That’s your ENTJ (88%sure, 12%:may also be an ENTP or ESTP)\n•How to not make us run away: Be yourself!!! and challenge us with rare ideas with some need of problem solving.
1	We as ENTJ’s like challenge; if you once for all offer yourself as super available, we’ll get bored because of your easiness to conquer. Instead, if you tease, and show as you aren’t as available, and you are loosable, and not available 24/7, It’ll caught our attention, and see in conquering that person as a new goal in mind. We are tough, we don’t like easy or no effort stuff. Idk if you’re a man or a girl, but if you’re a man and you want to approach an ENTJ girl, try to be super natural, just showing interest, being high value, but being able to loose if they don’t hurry up. Imagine this, you offer yourself on a gold plate, either she receives it or not; if she accepts you and gets your attention, good for you, but if she is just not that into you, don’t loose your time and move to the another one; there’s nothing more exhausting to any person in the universe, but mostly for we ENTJ’s to be chased, we get soooo overwhelmed. It isn’t that you’re unattractive, or somehow low value, it’s just that there isn’t chemistry enough to get into something; you aren’t her type man.
1	I guess you can find us throwing people with facts 80% of the time lol
1	With me you have to be super engaging (as a female ENTJ) and really fun to be with. Show interest for me and I will show interest for you - It’s a give and take for me. Also, show me you are intelligent (of course don’t brag) and just be yourself and let your charm come through. \n\nOh, and also, be able to respond to everything I say, because if it’s only me pulling the conversation, I will become bored

9	Question from an INFP	One of my best friends in an ENTJ, which has caused us to have some trouble in the past. However, we've both grown & matured as people, & generally get along pretty well now.\n\nHowever, I wanted to ask all of you ENTJs if there's anything that inherently annoys you about INFPs? I want our friendship to continue to go smoothly, & would attempt to change any annoying habits you've noticed in INFPs around him. Anyway, thanks for your replies & hope you have a great day!!
13	I like the username.  \n\nEmotional without taking actions to solve the problem.  
13	As far as INFP goes, the "Manic pixie dream girl" stops being cute very quickly.\n\nAlso sulking. Nothing annoys me like sulking does.
10	Making requests or bids for attention in an indirect or non-specific way.
8	playing the victim card 
6	I think I have encountered and been in community with both healthy and very unhealthy INFPs. The more healthy INFPs I know are people I look up to greatly. The advice I would love to give to unhealthier ones pertains to how oblivious they are to how their action/inaction affects others. I have known a couple in particular who don't recognize the hypocrisy in their expectations of others. They can let little things bother them but don't afford others the same idiosyncratic accommodation. So, I don't know if this applies to you, but if you encounter friction with other people -- and especially your ENTJ friend -- take extra time to consider the possibility that you might be more responsible for the friction than you realize.
6	As someone in a relationship with one who has known several healthy and unhealthy INFP, what's most annoying is how common it is for them to have poor emotional intelligence. INFP and ISFJ score lowest in EQ and it holds true in my experience that they tend to be lacking when it comes to relationship management, self-management, social and self-awareness, etc. When they aren't, they're great.\n\n They can cause friction with others, often lack skills when it comes to dealing with emotions. At times rely on others to help them in areas they're lacking, but aren't good if others need them whether they care or not. Sometimes won't see how they've messed up and blame someone else for it, but yet still feel bad that it *is* messed up, and have little idea how to practically solve it. Or annoying blame *themselves* past the point anyone else even cares.\n\nOften disorganised and bad at doing what's most efficient or practical with their inferior Te being really poorly developed (causing them to make poor judgements without realising it), and can easily get hypocritical and have expectations of (and criticism of) others they don't do better with themselves (like u/blahprath says).
1	A bit more technical, but INFP have Fi dominating over Te, and ENTJ has the reverse, Te dominating over Fi. \n\nI believe that in a healthy relationship this could be a wonderful combination. However in most cases I’ve encountered it, the flip flop causes a great deal of miscommunication. \n\nI recommend connecting your extroverted perceiving functions first. Use Ne to highlight your ENTJ’s Se experiences when you are having fun together. The more you can get your ENTJ to relax and enjoy Living In The Moment, the closer you will get to their least conscious function, Fi. \n\nYuuuuup. That’s the INFP’s most conscious function, which can really, really suck if you push the wrong buttons your ENTJ might say goodbye and never look back. \n\nSomething else from the flip side, Te. If you can learn to appreciate the “brutal honesty”, you will improve as an individual and develop trust and respect between each other. If your ENTJ has to walk on eggshells around you it is only a matter of time until they grow weary of you. \n\nPerceive together. Ne-Se, when you’re leading the fun. ENTJs like for someone else to take the lead once in a while too 😏. Ni-Si could work too, though I’m not familiar with how that kind of dynamic would play out. Maybe you reminiscing about old times and letting your ENTJ weave a yarn about it? Or writing a fictional alternate history together, if that’s your cup of tea. \n\nThe important part is, do whatever is fun for both of you and let those moments of connection be your anchor for the times when things aren’t going so smoothly. 
1	1. Laziness\n2. Bad planners\n3. Poor communicators\n4. Sometimes, I don't want to talk about my emotions with you\n5. Non-confrontational\n6. Don't understand why ENTJ's get angry so quickly\n7. Getting drained really quickly, and then not talking when we hang out\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry these are super duper blunt. The INFP I know is quite immature, and I don't know you, but these are just some things to keep in mind.
8	Hi. So just out of curiosity, what do ENTJs mean by winning?	
13	When nothing has authority over me.  
7	Benevolent domination.
3	Being right.
4	Just out of curiosity, what are you talking about? 
3	Two chicks at the same time.
2	Winning is getting the result I want.
2	Being the best, at the top and commanding everyone beneath
16	Why arr ENTJs so formal online?	I'm a big fan of watching tv shows and then trying to type all characters in the show. The one type I consistently get tripped-up on are the ENTJs. Because truth be told my ENTJ aquintences are all coworkers on their best behavior. As well as people I bump into online. But what happened to the brash, sassy, sometimes delusional, sometimes overly arrogant and cocky leaders who **do troll people irl**. At least online you all seem so "put together".\n\nI'm wondering about some traits that seem to show up in certain characters that tend towards significant confusion for me. Namely where there are the ExTx traits. ENTJs seem to have similar shared traits to ENTPs, ESTJs and ESTPs. But for whatever reason the level of sassy humor seems to fall behind these other three types in practice.\n\nWhat I mean is that I don't see many meme posts in r/ENTJ. I rarely see people labled ENTJ giving any sort of creative answer or quip. And the discussions here seem pretty tame for the most part. \n\nNow I'm not saying that you all should be joking 24/7 or calling each other rude names but I was under the impression that there was at least *more* underlying cocky or even arrogantly playful attitude within the ENTJ with their tert Se.\n\nSo I'm wondering if anyone noticed this and finds it peculiar. And two, do you guys think that in general you're more dull online than you are in person? I mean for the type that is **consistently considered to be a leader of men** (second only to ESTP) I would expect more personality than I see here (no offense to any of you)\n\nThen I figured that perhaps the ENTJ Se is just something that doesn't manifest itself via text or gets too many downvotes and buried most of the time. But honestly whenever I see a buried post it's never a Te-DOM. And people downvote those who speak against tye group or are too blunt/rude. But for some reason it doesn't happen with you guys.\n\nNow I'm sure you all know that INTJ forums and ENTP forums are a bit of a cluster and have an abundance of personality and edginess. Good for you r/ENTJ for not devolving into that sort of shitfest. But I almost never see bad apples among this group and if there are it's generally some downvoted INTJ or xNTP making some kind of controversial (or just plain dumb/trolling) statement.\n\nAnd I can probably say the same for ESTJs. It's no nonsense. Yet, going back to my original point I can think of some ENTJs at least in fiction who would certainly be downvoted if they had reddit accounts.\n\nJust off the top of my head:\nOlenna Tyrell\nDennis Reynolds\nEric Cartman\nNick Fury\n\nSo this got me wondering...are the ENTJs and ESTJs just on their best behavior? Are you guys trying to respond to comments in ways that ensure upvotes? If you disagree with someone's comment do you just ignore them? It seems like the modus operendi is only respond when you know your comment makes sense and isn't controversial. \n\nYou may argue this is rational and pragmatic. And 100% I agree. But my understanding has always been that Te-DOMs love their debates and like to critique and make jokes, **even at the expense of being likeable whereas the Ti-DOMs keep the peace due to their Fe** You see all the ExTx do this but for whatever reason online the Te users just opt-out. Thoughts?
39	Being an ENTJ is horribly isolating.  No one in real life gets you, the Te is horribly offputting for people, so you spend all day controlling it so you don't offend someone you need later. You're always asking "did I accidentally asshole this convo or are they just having a bad day" or trying not to say "the reason I don't like you is you're a lazy shit who can't ever do anything right." The real world is a minefield of potentially pissing people off, and humor maybe helps us avoid a few. \n\nThis forum is, for many of us, the ONE place we make sense to other people. If we have a serious ENTJ moment, it's understood and doesn't traumatize/offend anyone.  We can actually let the Te out for a serious stroll in this forum and it's a damn relief. 
21	ESTPs are leaders of men? Are you exercising your humor in this post? \n\nI think you’re serious about your claims, and if that’s the case, then you jump to conclusions without having a holistic view of the phenomena. I don’t think you’ve mastered anything in your life yet. If you had, you wouldn’t make such strong claims without backing them up, or without a qualifier. \n\nFor instance, If you had said - “I think ESTP can be great leaders”, you’d be taken more seriously.  \n\nThere’s your brash, abrasive, arrogant response. 🙃
8	Why do ESTPs talk too much?
7	Imo the humour of ENTJs is very dry and quick whereas memes are usually a little cheesy and brash. \n\nI’m an ENTJ and if people tell me I’m funny it’s usually after an offbeat or irreverent comment, which is rarely how you’d describe a meme.\n\nMy ex was also an ENTJ (apparently - though I suspect ESTP that’s misdiagnosed) and he would only ever use humour as a putdown or to make himself superior, so maybe the isolation that the other comment accurately described can sometimes push E_T_s to use humour as a defence?
4	I mean I wouldn't mind if others posted relevant and funny memes in here. 
4	On sites like forums and reddit I tend to write way more formally than I normally do since I use them for discussion when I'm bored and have nothing better to do, and to lurk and read whatever I see that looks interesting. I tend to argue with people if I see something I think is incorrect, put thought into what I write, etc. I also generally enjoy debating, writing formally, and so on to begin with but obviously there's not many outlets for that sort of thing unless you do it for a living or enjoy acting like an asshole (or both).\n\nIf I wanted chit chat, memes, or to joke around, I'd hit up friends rather than post somewhere like here. I don't consider myself very serious or formal at all, but I just don't care that much to let loose on a place like reddit around strangers. mostly sounds boring and pointless to me.\n\nSometimes I make quips replying to people, but I rather link a friend the post and make it, + then I don't have to pay attention to the overly sensitive rules most sites have these days. If you let Se out it gets you banned easily. I've been warned and told it's "insulting" someone and to even call them *ignorant* (how harmless is that?!) and explain why, let alone express the sarcastic remarks, dark humour, or "offensive" jokes I think of.\n\nand on a place like r/entj you'll get selection bias. Almost all the threads are serious, and often non-ENTJs asking for advice or talking about work, there's not very many "creative" or less serious threads. You get a thread like that ENTJ appreciation post the other day and it's just a non-ENTJ saying how much they like *working* with ENTJ lol. Maybe if people stopped treating us like we're so serious and expecting it, and encouraging the stereotypes, we'd have more opportunity to go against it.
9	Let’s try this. An ENTJ inherently sees other people’s flaws and often he/she believes that people should be always seeking to perfect themselves by all means necessary. Online, we have time to think and to scrutinize. people often welcome the analysis and scrutiny because it’s about serious discussion. We move the conversation forward. \n\nQuips and funny comments are great and all, but, the typical ENTJ will see a person who’s contributed those quips as nonsensical, unable or incapable of contributing something worthwhile (due to our experiences with seeing that same flaw in many people) or as someone who doesn’t care to help the subject along. We, typically, believe that learning is a worthwhile pursuit and those who don’t care to achieve that are particularly waste, and awaiting natural selection to pick them off.  \n\nI as an ENTJ am usually pretty serious in general. I love to laugh and I have an incredibly wide sense of humor from deadpan to utter morbid as fuck. But, if I’m not queued up to play around, and instead start with something of interest to me or something that I want to gain some insight in, I will not generally make those type of comments you mentioned before. Get me in a row where we make fun of each other or making up jokes or stories, I’m game. But start me in a conversation of interest, and I’ll put that aside and get annoyed at others who try to distract the conversation because I’m dead set on getting the information I want. \n\nSo it’s not that we parade ourselves on reddit as being serious all the time, or that we can’t or don’t like to joke around. We insert ourselves into conversations we are genuinely interested in and we love helping others to achieve the same insights we gain or sharing that even, like I’m doing right now. \n\nIf you want to talk about other MBTI’s, you will need a lot more experience with them, and correctly identifying them to boot, before you start to compile your own conclusions. I have a group of friends that love the MBTI and we share our thoughts and conclusions with one another constantly. We are ten in total, and each of us are a different type—we met online. From that we’ve been a little better at typing others and keeping the temperaments separate but we’re still far off from getting it perfectly down. \n\nTo correct your ESTP mishap, ESTP’s tend to be very showy. They like to perform for others to then gain their admiration, respect, and in somewhat more observable cases, attention. They quickly seek loyalty from their acquaintances and try to protect an image that they care to mold and shape for themselves. Now, this could be a reason for why you’ve typed some an ESTP as someone who likes to take charge, but that’s not nearly what’s happening there. They’ll usually act out enough to give you that idea and then they’ll move onto the next person they want attention from to think the same of them as you do, but they won’t actually perform in that way for themselves. If there’s no social value in acting, there’s generally less incentive for the ESTP to act.\n\nAn ENTJ on the other hand is not focused on the attention and almost always act on self-interest until more emotionally matured, after which an ENTJ will focus on the benefits of others so that both the ENTJ and the other are benefited. \n\nSo, as a direct answer to your question, and if you thought TL;Dr fuck yourself, we’re not formal, our way of speech online is just direct and to the point because we want information returned to us in the same way that’s just as easy to access and comprehend. 
5	Of all types, we're the closest to the prim and proper English Tea Party scene. 
3	" modus operendi is only respond when you know your comment makes sense-"  \n\n\nThe only thing that really jumped out at me.   \n\n\nDo you make comments that you know don't make sense? 
3	I haven't read any other comments, but I will just say that it is *EXHAUSTING* to attempt to educate every goddamn moron I meet irl, not to mention online. It's a big waste of time, especially if I've already debated their viewpoint with someone else. And most people cannot help me evolve my argument, because they get stuck on things I deem unimportant (like "how it's always been"). \n\n\nOk for instance, before gay marriage was legalized, I gave a persuasive speech that marriage should no longer be recognized as a "thing" by the government, and rather we should recognize all elective domestic partnerships as having the same rights that married people have now.\n\n\nSo a mom and daughter that have lived together for over 50 years can share health insurance and stuff.  Anyways gay marriage is legal and that above argument is therefore uninteresting, but when I would try to explain it to people, they got so upset. I told them that they could still call their partnerships "marriages" and they would still sign a document, it's just that that document would be inclusive of other types of domestic partnerships that may need the same rights.\n\n\nAnd no one understood. Ever. \n\n\nAnd so after a while, unless I hear a truly unique position, I just won't respond. It's not worth my energy to debate a possible Russian operative. \n\n\nAs for the art and stuff, I mean I see rooms in r/AmateurRoomPorn that I am sure are ENTJs. I have a painting I'm working on right now, but I don't feel very motivated to post it here because, while it might be just "nice" to see art here, my brain is looking for *ideas through words*. I wanna read about people, and I assume others with my type are similarly inclined. We are comparing and contrasting our experiences, while also giving each other life tips and generally trying to be helpful and caring. It seems like a warm community to us, but yeah we could decorate. 
1	We are known by having good sense of humor, but when we are on serious mode, we get super annoyed when people don’t get serious. \nWhen I’m arguing about some serious topic, and suddenly someone gets a joke off, I just make eye contact of “Wtf dude, get serious”, and sometimes people ask me to not be so serious in life but i don’t care, that’s us.\nThough, when we are on our chill mood, we don’t take life seriously, like, nothing. I’d agree saying that ESTJ’s are much more serious and nonsarcastic than ENTJ’s, they just don’t have that flirty or charming vibe that we ENTJ’s have.
1	You guys aren't really formal if you're talking with someone you're comfortable with.\n\nJust my 2 cents.
3	Freedom Not to Act	
1	If you are going to brainwash people, then shorter clips like this one would do better.\n
10	Outside of video games and board games, what do you like to compete in?	I'm looking for predominantly intuitive areas of competition that involve problem solving and analysis. Video games are great...so great in fact, that I got nerve damage. So now I can't play them.\n\nBoard games are next. Is there any other competition based activities similar? ENTJ and INTP are very similar in what they enjoy, so I'm wondering what you enjoy competing in. Maybe something a little more movement based/bodily?\n\nOf course there is always the competition of the marketplace too.
16	Dick size and income, of course.
8	Wait do most ENTJ’s like games? I swear I am an ENTJ and I agree with you guys on almost everything except this. I’m not competitive with things that don’t hold any long term value. I couldn’t care less about winning games and I often times don’t even start the game!
4	I know you said video games but I don’t know if this includes the competitive scene, as in eSports. I am into competitive Smash and take it very seriously.
3	I do GORUCK events, team based endurance events, which teach practical leadership and problem solving under stress. \n\nThat being said. Not exactly what you were asking for, but it’s one of the many things I do. 
3	Sup Frank
3	Magic the Gathering and debating.
3	Chess is fucking amazing. I'm always happy to introduce more people to this fabulous game. I especially love mentoring others into becoming better players because it seriously helps me improve as well.\n\nKeep in mind that I'm only an intermediate strength player, I have a long long way to go, but I'd be more than happy to teach you chess.\n\n
2	Cash, money, hoes
2	It’s more our intuition.  If your boss looks like a tool and then acts like one, and is just there to fill a role for their image instead of getting the job done.  That will get under my skin.  At that point all respect goes down the drain and that person means nothing to me.
2	For Board Games, i would destroy anyone in Monopoly. Otherwise I love having debates about life, politics and technology
1	Advanced Badminton because it's as if you combined chess into a sport. Been playing for 7 years and became a coach.
1	basketball, debates, videogames (videogames come in many shapes and sizes.. u can play turnbased - not sure what the nerver damage limitations are)  
1	Sword fighting 
1	I once was in a high level training program and was forced to take this mtbi test (didn’t know what it was at the time).  I answered as less aggressively as possible because I didn’t know what they were looking for and I didn’t want to raise eyebrows.  I got INTP lol.  I fooled them because I fucking hate authority.

I will and have blocked people I think are trolls or who cannot face any sort of civil discussion.\n\nI want my views and opinions challenged as long as it's in a respectful manner (and depending on the situation, even if it's not).
1	 > i think people can change\n\nThey can but many do not, and you can't force them. People inherently change as part of life, but you can't control how. You can try to influence by presenting perspectives and facts and just hope for the best. At the end of the day, you can't force thoughts into the other person's gray matter. And if they don't want to actually listen to what anyone is saying, your words won't change their mind. \n\nI do agree though, we'd all do a lot better on social media if we stop in-fighting and focus on presenting well defined goals that groups can agree on. So much of the gross and petty behaviour online in 201X is two groups both claiming to fight each other, but are actually fighting strawmen that hardly exist with a nameplate of the other group hastily glued on.\n\nEdit: PS, the block button is your friend. Don't block someone for disagreeing, but readily block anyone that wants to spit venom or argue. Arguing gets you nowhere, discussion is progressive. Changing someone's entire outlook on life or personality/instincts is beyond the scope of your ability. So, block and move on.

35	ENTJ appreciation post	I‘ll be sharing my experience with an ENTJ in the following. I‘m an ENTP myself.\n\nWorking on a project with an ENTJ is the best experience ever. And I think the combination of ENTP and ENTJ can really be a **powerful** one.\n\nSo here‘s the story:\n\nI was worrying about something, and told my ENTJ friend about it. She gave me advice about what we could do about it. I found the idea quite good, so we started brainstorming about it. Within 15 minutes, we had already come up with an extremely good strategy &amp; plan. She was kind of giving an outline to the idea, and I was elaborating on every point she was making with my ideas. The more we talked the better our plan got.\n\nAfter everything‘s been said and done, I would usually forget about it and don‘t take it seriously enough and postpone it to next year or so. But then she actually told me „So when are we going to meet up?“. I was shocked, since usually I don‘t ever get to that point. I thought she‘s talking about starting in a few months after our semester is over or so, but then she asked me „How about next week?“. I found it quite crazy, but since I was pleasantly surprised I agreed. I mean why not?\n\nSince then we‘ve been meeting up every week, and unlike every other person I‘ve been working with up until now, I don‘t have to be the one always reaching out first and having to get the other people‘s asses moving and the only one contributing with value/input. She was equally dedicated as me and it went extremely smooth. Since usually that part exhausts me the most, that‘s why I avoid working with others.\n\nAlso usually with other people, I‘m the only one generating ideas and trying to make some progress. But with her, we‘re equally involved in making good progress every time, and she also contributes with amazing knowledge and gives my ideas some sort of structure and suggests ways to implement them, which I never got from other people.\n\nThe only downside where I felt the difference was, when she brought an outline of a previous project, and told me we should stick to those instructions/structure. I found that limiting, since I think one cannot freely brainstorm if we have to stick to a plan. I suggested we brainstorm first, then bring some structure to all the ideas. She then went along with my opinion. But that‘s about all disagreement there ever was. We now have come up with a plan for a project which will continue for probably 30-40 years. Since we elaborated so much on it that it became quite a serious idea. \n\nConclusion:\n\nI love working with her. It‘s amazingly productive and not exhausting at all. We‘re making lots of progress every time and we‘re both giving equally much and qualitative input when we discuss about it. None of us have to drag the other along.
17	It’s what we do. You ENTPs aren’t too bad either
15	Dang where can I find myself an ENTP? 😏
8	I Love ENTPs, you guys are awesome.
7	Working on a start-up with an ENTJ. The ENTJ-ENTP combo is lethal, together we are invincible
4	I’m an ENTJ married to an ENTP. It works. We’re a good team.
3	Glad to hear. :) 
3	My right hand man is an ENTP and we come up with solutions on the fly.  It's very rewarding.  \n\n\nIt's because they complement our TeNi with their TiNe.  
1	ENTPs are great in bed
5	What is the comparative advantage of diving deep(Ti) vs patchwork	I've written a post here about INTP problem solving:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/aqp7o9/an_explanation_of_intp_problem_solving/\n\nInside the comments I explain it more simply as well for someone who didn't understand.\n\n\n\nWith these posts in mind I would ask: what is the relative advantage of diving deep into cause and effect vs doing surface level patchwork?\nTo explain this a little better imagine you have a system of:\n\nA->B->C->D with "->" representing "causes."\n\nFrom this system I want high amounts of variable D. If my input is low A then it causes high B which causes low C which causes low D. \n\nIf my input it high A then it causes low B->high C->high D which is good.\n\nMy question is that even if A is the fundamental causation factor, it doesn't necessarily imply that the cost of "fixing"/altering A will be any higher or lower than the cost of altering any of the other middle variables. So yes, fixing A will cause all of the other variables to fall into place, but what if fixing A costs millions while fixing its biproduct "amount B" costs only hundreds? In other words, while yes within "A->D" A is the problem input, it doesn't mean you can't alter B or C or even D more cheaply than A.\n\n\n\n\nIs diving deep simply allowing someone to have these options available which increases problem solving capabilities?\n\nI compare it to Te because I have heard Te can be VERY good at temporary patchwork solutions on the effect variables within a cause/effect system.
3	You're basically talking about law of diminishing returns.  However time is a major factor IRL situations.  How much time should you allot to fixing this issue?  In competitive environments, one can only choose the best option within a time constraint and thus it may look like patchwork.
3	Yeah I like INTPs, the meticulousness, the robotic nature, detailed solutions, and no need to cater.  A dream come true.   
2	Hoo lucky you! Someone already went through all of this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n INTP: Logic of anti-synthesis, of finalized stable systems. Finding the counterweight, the opposite pole. Isolation of "pure", non-overlapping parts. Anti-conjuction. And-not function. Denoted by upwards arrow ↑ \n\n ENTP: Logic of isomorphism, analogies, transfer of structures from one area to another. Lets denote this logic function with sign of identity: = \n\n ENTJ: Logic of choice between two alternatives. Mutual exclusion. Risk, which leads to success. The logic of finding a way into oversystem, formation of emergent properties. Or-or logic. Strict disjunction. Lets denote it with <+> \n\n INTJ: Logic of parallel progression. Branching. Disjunctive logic that separates the opposites. Logic of safeguards, of spare exits. Lets denote this logic with sign / \[Disjunction: The statement A / B is true if A or B (or both) are true; if both are false, the statement is false.\] \n\n&#x200B;
7	Developing Intuition? A social weakness as extroverted?	Found this:\n\n“What could cause a naturally confident person such as an ENTJ to feel a sense of low self-worth or self-esteem? When it happens, it’s the result of their strong personality traits backfiring on them.”\nAnd this:\n\n“Although ENTJs have the “N” (Intuition) personality trait, they take a very rational and logical approach to life. They prefer to rely only on concrete facts, even though they have the capacity for intuition. They use their intuition to come up with new solutions or imagine a better way of doing something, but they don’t trust their gut instincts.\n\nIf you have not developed your intuition, you risk making decisions too quickly, before you have a full understanding of the issue and all possible solutions. Oftentimes, ENTJs believe that their view of the world is the only correct one, since they arrived at it via their logical, rational thought process.\n\nHowever, ENTJs who develop their intuition will greatly enhance their capacity for leadership, awareness, and change. When ENTJs learn to trust the quiet voice in their heads, they are more able to include input from others into their decisions. They develop a talent for addressing social issues and helping people get past difficult life situations because they are more aware of the needs of others.”\n\nWhat do you think about this? I felt identified when the text presented the lack of intuition on life approaching. How do you think I can develop this?\nI’m frustrated, because I feel socially awkward with people I don’t know; feeling weird and uncomfortable; I believe this is what this talked about, developing intuition and trusting gut instincts; basically trusting your instincts. Do you think this is the case? How would you develop it?\nThanks!\n\n\n
6	"Oftentimes, ENTJs believe that their view of the world is the only correct one, since they arrived at it via their logical, rational thought process."\n\nI agree with this however we believe that our views are the only correct one because we have also added our intuition and analytical process with this, just like any xNTJs.  Our logic does come first, **however that doesn't mean our intuition is any weaker**, just the sequence.\n\nYou feel socially awkward because the people you're surrounded by haven't intellectually stimulated you and therefore you think you're wasting your time there.\n\n&#x200B;
1	just wondering how ENTJs would respond to this	[u/throwaway3n1p](https://www.reddit.com/u/throwaway3n1p) and I are currently working on gathering answers for how thought processes work in different MBTI types. This is just out of curiosity, not an attempt to stalk you according to how you think of grave crimes. All replies are appreciated!\n\nIf we count judgments of *moral obligation* out of the equation, \n\nQuestion 1: How is murder logically fine?\n\nQuestion 2: How is murder logically wrong?\n\nNOTE: Feel free to write down whatever thought you have, whether it is emotional or just plain retarded.
3	What kinda murder we talking about ? Police killings, abortions, death sentence....?
3	1. First define murder. I would look up legal definitions from my own jurisdiction.\n2. Think of situations in which you might think murder is justified: i.e. self-defense, war,  euthanasia, capital punishment (abortion depends on how you define a person). \n3. Look for case precedent, consider influential arguments for each. \n\nI personally think that allowing subjective justifications for murder would lead to more murder. People are very good at justifying their decisions, so it's good to have external boundaries in place to preserve life. I could logically justify most types of killing, so it's better that I don't, if everyone did that we'd end up with The Purge and vigilante justice. This is why society decides upon an agreed-upon code of conduct.
2	It's logically sound of the logic is sound. This doesn't make it right. \n\nThe good of the hawk isn't necessarily the good of the field mouse. 
2	I think you're conflating logic with morals in this instance. I'm not sure if one can answer either question using logic. Pure logic = if A cannot exist without B, but B cannot exist without C, then logically A also cannot exist without C. \n\nTo function properly in society, we are taught murder is morally wrong in most circumstances. Murder as fine vs wrong is just a social construct based on morals - morals that have shifted and changed across different societies over time. Not sure if logic fits in here. Maybe I am overthinking?\n\nSo, to answer both, I suppose it is simultaneously logically "fine" and "wrong" at the same time, if you look at it through the lens of morals and ethics (i.e. it is logcally \[i.e. morally\] fine to murder one person to save hundreds of other people, but murder is logically \[i.e. morally\] wrong in most circumstances).
1	Is the study for scientific and educational purposes or just for fun? Cause if it’s the former then someone could really come for the legitimacy of the study. \n
1	I'm proud at the fact that this thread only has rational replies.
1	Ehhhhh what kind of question is this. So basically murder is logically not fine due to you getting yourself in prison and a sentence but I guess it's fine if it's the person you rlly hate LOLL
7	Figuring out an ENTJ's motivations	I'm a (male) ENxP and, true to my type, I generally have a good grasp of people and their motivations.\n\nAt my office, a high ranking ENTJ exec recently pulled me aside after I worked closely with him for a day or two and *lavished* (really, he pulled all the stops) me with tonnes of praise, then offered to mentor me.\n\nI was dumbfounded because I didn't expect that high a level of praise. And after such a short time working with him, how would he be able to develop such a strong opinion about me? I'm also super low ranking compared to him so I have no idea what he wants to get out of this relationship.\n\nI felt like something is off, or I am missing a vital piece of the picture.\n\nSince you guys know more than I do about ENTJ behavior I'm wondering if I can get at least some insight or at least ideas to what he might want. He is notoriously charming yet direct, and he is very strategic in dealing with people - and I think I've somehow become a tiny piece of his grand strategy.\n\nSo what do you think his motivation/reasons for trying to win me over might be? Or do you think he's actually being genuine - nice as that might be I still have no idea how he came to such a strong positive reaction on my character within such a short time frame. Better yet should I just directly ask him? Or should I try to find out based on my own network?\n\nI know I sound like a paranoid shit but I am really really confused about what he wants and where he stands. I'm also quite new to the corporate world so I'm trying to figure out how people tick here. Thanks.\n\nUPDATE: I had a self image crisis which caused the doubt. This guy is fucking amazing and all the good stuff you said is true. 
15	Congrats protege.  You won his respect somehow.
15	I can usually pick out who has talent and who is a waste of my time pretty quickly. When doing corporate training, I could tell you if it was a good hire or a crappy one by the end of the first day. I picked my star talent quickly, and invested in them immediately. \n\nHe saw something in you. Take it as the compliment it is, because few interest me, even fewer are ones I'm willing to mentor. 
8	He sees potential. I can spot talent pretty quickly, but talent will only get you so far without technique. Take his advice, he will probably put your name forward for roles, and put you on people's radar for opportunities. If I like someone I'll take them under my wing, I'll promote them to others, get then help with their projects and push them towards their goals. What I get out of it is seeing them flourish, and getting to say that I picked and trained a winning horse.
1	Yeh it's hard to tell with them. Just don't make any Te related mistakes and you should be fine. 
1	It’s very rewarding to me when I have the opportunity to mentor someone. I would be personally very grateful to have a mentor at this point in my own career, As long as there’s no ulterior motive- not trying to date me or anything 
1	I'll play the cynic here. I am guessing you're a ENTP. First of all, ENTJ's have a natural talent for spotting talent. Within five minutes of meeting someone, we can basically read them. ENTJ's have trained their whole life to read people within minutes based on their actions, clothes, mannerism's, speech patterns etc. To be quite honest, sometimes ENTJ's are refreshed by low ranking people. They have good ideas, but don't have the bullshit. This sounds kind of horrible, but ENTJ's like to mentor people, for their own narrcasistic benifit. He might be trying to be nice, or he may be nice to you, because he needs to look kind, to somebody else. ENTJ's hate bullshit. If you're really curious, just ask him. But always appeal to his ego. Don't try to find out behind his back, ENTJ's know when somebody's trying to dig up info on them. Even if he trying to trying to use you, just go with it. He might have some good stuff to say.
-4	NTJs dont care about existing status much. People are non-linear. Some can produce 10x the results.\n\nI think you should tell the guy straight up that while you appreciate his willingness to help, the praise came across as over the top. That you are not used to that. That you would be happy to continue providing good value to the company, but you want to do it whilst playing by the same rules as everyone else.\n
3	Tips for ENTJs to learn math?	I am a typical ENTJ. I personally love subjects like law, economy, psychology and languages. However, English is not my first language (actually, I am a beginner in English learning), and I am going to need to choose courses for university. I want to push myself to learn math, since this is the easiest way for me to achieve the status I want in the future. I am currently facing tons of problems in learning math, and most people cannot understand my unique way to learn math and the problem I am facing. Many suggests me to do as much exercises as I can, but I think overload practices kills my creativity, thus negatively affect my mark. Also, I feels like I have no trouble in comprehension, but I am always lost in doing massive calculations. So, do you ENTJs have experienced such situations? Do you have any tips for improving math marks? 
7	Math tripped me up until calculus. Suddenly, I could put it in terms of physics and then I was fine. Practical application made sense to me, but math for the sake of math drove me clear up a wall.  It's not that I struggled so much as I found it a pointless waste of time. \n\nTry to put in real-world terms with a practical application. It helps give those massive calculations more relevance. I also break down EVERY step of the individual problem. \n\nWhich math are you taking? 
3	If you are comprehending the logic fine, and losing your way through very complex equations, the best trick I've found is to make a map as you go. You want to write notes to yourself as you go. Similar to "show your work" when you were a child. Don't let any of it be work in your head. So in a calculus problem, I will write out what every variable is and what I'm trying to find. I will what I'm doing in every step. If I need to at some point replace something with a standard identity (say that cot(θ) = cos(θ)/sin(θ)) I write that next to where I replace. Then you can't get lost, if the answer stops making sense you can easily find your mistake and back up to there. You can't find your mistake if you made it in your head five minutes ago.\n\nBut also, while the logic, creativity, and intuition for higher math may be talents (which I believe we tend to have) computation is a skill. If you don't do the exercises, and lots of them, you have just as much chance at succeeding as in learning to play the piano well by looking at one, reading some music theory books, and then saying "yeah, I totally get how that works". You have to practice.
2	Use video tutorials like Kahn academy or books with answer solutions with step by steps like Chegg.
1	I almost failed Pre-calculus in high school... Calculus was easy. I got a 5 on the AP test and also barely passed the class(knew I was going to cc so "fuck it"). I studied for the AP test for 4 hours the night before. The one thing that I remember that triggers me from precalc is partial fractions. I'm still confused by it today.
1	I don't understand. Can you elaborate on how doing more exercises is detrimental to you? People advice doing exercises for understanding and applying what you have learnt in class. First you get the jist of the topic and solve basic questions. Then you work your way up to tougher questions. Eventually, math problems will start to get really creative  so you gotta make use of two or more topics you have learnt to solve them.
1	I'm like you, English is my second language and never really understood math even though I got As all the time. How I did it? I just figured out how to get an answer by memorizing solutions. Always set of questions in academia. I figured out the pattern and never cared understanding how to do it. As soon as I read a question, pull out a solution from my head, and output the answer.
18	The sandwich technique	I really like Toastmasters. You get a good amount of opportunity to practice speeches and leadership, and you get a nice little certificate saying that you're competent. Who doesn't love that?\n\nThat having been said, the Toastmasters guide to conflict resolution is generally full of advice on how to wimp out of confrontation. They are generally less than direct, and usually feel a bit trite. \n\nNevertheless, there are little lifehacks that we can learn that make our criticisms more palatable. One such technique that you might be interested in is the "sandwich technique."\n\n~~The idea being that if you bribe someone with a sandwich, then they'll have no choice but to agree with you.~~\n\nBy sandwiching criticisms between compliments, you catch their attention, trick them into accepting your criticism, and leave them feeling happy again because of the compliment.\n\nI like your haircut,  \nYour work was shitty today. \nYour shoes are nice too.
10	The problem with the sandwich technique is that its so obviously contrived. Sometimes things are bad and it's both kind and helpful to the other person to just point it out. Imagine a teacher/TA/lecturer writing feedback for an obviously bad assignment:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n"Thank you for handing your assignment in on time. Your arguments were irrelevant and a thesis was lacking. You're handwriting was nice."\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think it's just better to preface criticisms with a simple "Hey, I'm not trying to cut you down but here's what I think you should improve on." It's a lot more genuine and you're not trying to "trick" people into feeling a certain way about you\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S. I'd totally take a sandwich bribe ;)
9	People say they can see through this, but we are all so much more gullible than we want to believe.\n\nDuring your formal evaluation, you're expecting to hear the sandwich and so you hear it.\n\nBut as a group, we ENTJs don't engage in meaningless social niceties. And the problem with that is that those niceties exist for a reason - that is that other people really hinge on them. Softening your criticism is important, and the bigger the criticism, the more you need to soften it. \n\nAn example I learned was bringing in cake to work. Every time I do this, everyone loves it, and they're much more tolerant of my not-giving-a-damn-about-your-bullshit.
7	It's all in how you phrase it.  "You excel at x, and I think we can build on that success by working on y. As a bonus, working on y will also build on your strengths in z." 
4	Also known as the "Shit sandwich". Are there still people who don't know this is a thing?
3	This is genius. Should I join toastmasters?
3	It's also known as the, "shit sandwich."  I was forced to try this technique at my last workplace dealing with two particular people (ESFJ and ESFP) who could NOT take ANY feedback at all, even when things that went wrong were blatantly their fault, they acted as if they were so mystified as to why and of course refused to take responsibility for it.  I think that others were aware of the technique and understood what I was doing, but it was bc ALL of us were just sick and tired of dealing with the two whose focus was always based on how, "nice" people were to them.  If the message was not delivered with sugar sprinkles and rainbows they'd get really bent out of shape and vindictive.
2	It works wonders. 
2	An ENFJ friend suggested something similar to me and I think you might like that one, since it's less about empty compliments and more actionable: *Continue, stop, improve.*\n\nSo one thing the person does really well well (or a compliment, if you find them completely useless), one thing they need to stop doing, and one they show potential for and should work on.\n\nYou only need to compliment them once (which can come off as contrived), but the "improve" part will come off as positive to the receiver even though it's technically criticism.
1	I am also a Toastmaster. The sandwich method is great, but in a longer discussion you can layer criticisms between compliments and positive feedback like layers of a cake. Great feedback tool.
1	Hahaha! I just don’t know about it much of this is really not my thing. I don’t need toastmasters to tell me I have leadership skils or speak correctly. I can already do this! Hahah!
0	Why not Trump technique?
21	Do you gain more energy around people or alone? ENTJs	The only difference between us and INTJs is the primary cognitive function that is used first, but the cognitive functions are the same.\n\nENTJ: Te – Ni – Se – Fi\n\nINTJ:  Ni – Te – Fi – Se\n\nThe point is both INTJs and ENTJs have external thinking capabilities and introverted intuition.\n\n**This doesn't tell us where you derive your energy from.**\n\nI am very curious to hear from you guys because this would explain a lot about myself and things that I have read in other people's posts.\n\nI personally derive my energy from being alone whether in the office, or at home, or out in public.  I have a few close friends that I do enjoy stimulating conversations with.  I hate group activities unless it's for a specific goal, then I end up leading.\n\nIs anyone else like this?
20	It depends on the people and situation. My friend has told me that for an extrovert, I say that “I hate people” a lot. And there is a pretty popular ENTJ meme floating around that says that we get confused for introverts since we hate hanging around idiots.
15	Popping in just to comment on the theory. Which is, that you gain energy when you are able to use your dominant function. \n\nTe demands intelligent and useful thoughts from others. If you can’t get that from the people in your environment, you may very well end up preferring books or other activities in solitude. 
14	I think it’s more about the stimuli for me. Overstimulation in that environment can send me haywire, but if I’m somewhere quiet and the energy is built around the people, I can be there all night. 
7	It really also depends where I am with other people. If it’s a loud party with music you can’t hear over, then yeah, I think I’d personally do better alone. But maybe at school or a calmer social gathering I could do well. 
5	Depend on type of people we are  around, if i have to play very formally i would better be alone than be a strict robo. 
5	Both
5	INTJs are Ni - Te - Fi - Se. The patterns in MBTI always rotate extroverted and introverted functions. This is important to correct because it suggests that INTJs may be more in touch with values/moral code (and creates the NiFi loop that unhealthy INTJs often find themselves trapped in).  \n\n\nTo answer, I identify with you somewhat. I like to work alone, but I definitely am more energized by people. I'm happier with people but I think I'm less efficient, so I try to balance that as best as I can. So far my solution is to spend a significant amount of my free time with friends doing a hobby so that I can benefit from the energy for solo academic study/work. I don't know if this is cheating but it's worked well so far. 
3	Both. In places with lots going on i can feel my batteries draining but the same happens when I’m alone for too long 
3	Like most comments, my answer is both.  I work in an entertainment type field and need other peoples energy to preform well. But it takes a lot out of me. I often come home drained.  When I'm home with the family I have a good  balance of energy  But when I'm alone during the day I find myself being lazy with very little energy or motivation. It's like I need my kid and husband around so I can feed off their energy. Its odd.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo in social settings things get crazy. I don't like loud place because I overstimulate easy. It's also hard to hang out with small groups. I drawl from them and some people I just can't take. Like my best friends husband. His energy is sky high I can feel his energy run through me. I have to take extra deep breaths when he's around. I  like a  chilled out vibe. 
3	Around people. Large groups of people are great for me, I love feeling all the energy.  When I was young (18- early 20's) I loved dance clubs and raves so much! Then I started wedding planning large weddings, running large groups of volunteers (50-75 people), and volunteering for large projects (like Habitat for Humanity). I prefer upbeat, positive environments. Great concerts (esp. outside cause nature makes me happy), art/wine walks and all that kind of stuff is enjoyable for me with all the positive energy. Being with people definitely give me energy but I have to be careful of negative emotion. Protests, emotionally difficult meetings, my kid's school functions with other parents and other emotionally charged situations are very draining for me and I will need alone time after to cope. The last few years there have been some difficult times and I've found I needed more alone time than ever. On the flip side of that, I'm so glad I finally understand that I gain energy from other people; for a while I got stuck in a downward spiral and kept myself away from people until I felt better. But I just couldn't get my energy back up and was floundering with no idea what was wrong. Read on Reddit about the energy gain/introvert/extrovert thing and bazinga I'm back baby. 
2	I posted a similar question a few months back. For a moment I confused myself with being an introvert as well because gatherings, networkings and parties just drain the shit out of me. Furthermore, I enjoy my alone time reading books and working so much that I don’t bother hanging out with people. But then again, a number of introverts answered my questions and shared their perspectives: they can spend weeks without talking to people, something which is unimaginable to me. So my guess is that our extroversion is usually under-estimated: we don’t see introverts often because they spend most of their time at home, and in social contexts, everyone tries to show his extroverted side. You can also check our description on socionics. I was amazed about how much I resonate with the description.
2	I think you are asking the wrong question. It’s not whether or not there are people, but rather, what are those people doing?\n\nThere is a massive difference between leading a team for work, or to complete a project, in which case we can work tirelessly. (True if it’s a solo project as well) \n\nVs. frivolous social occasions, if I don’t have a specific reason to be there I’m still amicable, and if I have lots of energy I can be very charismatic, but I find that much more draining. \n\nSimplified, are the people feeding my Te? (effectiveness). No? then they are draining. Yes? I can go all day, all night, and still keep going. \n\nAlso INTJ cognitive stack is Ni Te Fi Se
2	I work in a very people-oriented industry. I find this exhausting.\n\nI have also worked in a very data-oriented industry. I found the lack of interaction exhausting.\n\nWhere I get my energy is different question to where I want to spend my energy.  As it happens they are both more E than I.
2	I need both; if I get too much stimulation in a week or day, I'm gonna want to sneak off on my own to relax and unwind.\n\nI don't have a ton of close friends; with the ones I do have, I get a lot of energy out of their company. I also am energized by motivated, hard-working people I meet on campus.\n\nI don't hate group activities (I'm on an executive board for a student organization and I volunteer in a large group). BUT, I hate the people that don't have that ambition to succeed, whether it be for a group project in a class, a student organization, or whatever. I just think that if you do something, there has to be some sort of an effort. I mean fuck, 75% it if you're not gonna give 100%, but don't just give 0%.
2	In my case most people think I'm an extravert, but there's some who see me as a weird person, not to say they're antonyms but to point out that some see me as a wacky extravert.\n\nRegarding your question, I feel like I get most of my energy by being alone, with some exceptions. Thing is, I don't really enjoy partying or spending time with people I don't know. That being said, I get a lot of energy when I can spend a quality conversation with 1-2 people, even more than by being alone, it's actually one of the things I enjoy the most too. \n\n  \nWhen I was in junior year I remember spending a lot of time talking to girls, and I enjoyed it so much I crashed my grades lol. After learning my lesson I kinda went back to my former self.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSummarized, I'd say my energy comes mainly from me being alone, but depending on who's around me, I can gain even more energy from being around others.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
2	I’m putting order back into my life and that’s doing the trick.
2	I always have a moral debate with myself if I'm actually an extrovert or not. When I meet that one rare person, I am able to exchange ideas with them, and I get to fully savor the gained energy when I'm alone after talking with them. It's like they fuel my mind, and I take what I need from them, to process what they said, and come up with new solutions. However, these people are truly rare. I mostly find people lagging and draining. 
2	Around people sometimes myself lol
-1	Erm. Did you see the first letter in entj it’s called e! Yes. E n t j that’s right. So yes I get more energy with people? Maybe that helps?
3	Survey on personality and Flirting behaviors	Hey I am a doctoral Student at a University in the South. I am studying flirtation behaviors, specifically trying to catalog specific flirting behaviors taken from several experimental studies. I was wondering if I could post to this community as it seems relevant to my topic. Thank you in advance for taking the time to take the survey there is an opportunity to win a gift card if the entire survey is completed. You can back out at any time.\n\nHere is the link to the survey\n\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JMQP5PJ
3	Please post back when you have the results of the raw data!
2	Please write out your theory how entj might be different. 
2	That's a long ass-survey.\n\nI think you'll start losing validity by around question 140, but you'll lose a lot of it by question 210.
1	There’s no reference to entj
1	Did it! (ENTJ) Entered my reddit username for the giftcard. DM me if I win. 
12	High functioning successful ENTJ needs friends	I'm male, middle aged, a doctor, very smart, highly successful but I suck at relationships. I'm even physically fit. Anyone want to be my friend lol :( I guess I'm too driven and insensitive!!!
14	Welcome to being an XNTJ... work on being more sensitive. You only get what you work for in life i.e. good diet plus gym keeps you fit, working smart and hard gets you ahead in your career, being sesnitive to otjer people gets you connected with them.
7	Be my friend. I want you.\n\nCurrently on an ENTJ binge in my life, literally seeking and absorbing into my life any of you I’m fortunate enough to find. I’ll probably reach social capacity at some point and slow down, but I’m nowhere near that now. I heard you guys are supposedly the highest in all types of compatibility for an INTP, so I am currently verifying that theory personally. So far, it’s dead on. \n\nMe - 26 years old, entrepreneur. Just went to hell and back over the last 2 years, with me bankrupting my first business by overaggression, losing everything I built and worked for, causing nearly a million bucks worth of economic damage, and losing my 2 year old daughter to her mother taking her and moving to a different state after 5 years of living together when I could no longer provide economically. Filed Chapter 7 and started my new business. \n\nPhone, Skype, emails only, I’m fine with any. My account’s not anon, but I leave it to you whether to remain anon while talking. Also, you play dota, cool, I’m plat trash in League of Legends. Also, I used to be pre-med, and my best friend just started residency. \n\nI hear Fi couldn’t care less about other people’s feelings. Good, because Fe doesn’t care about my own feelings. So no time wasted there. Only rational perfection. 
4	I feel like just being insensitive wouldn’t limit you completely. What else is going on? 😋
3	Befriends with ENTPs we go with everyone 
3	Hey!\nI (26F) am also a high functioning ENTJ! I decided to go the engineering route though.\nIt was really hard for me growing up because I had (still do) a very different way to see/think  things. Throughout the years, traveling and meeting more people, I gathered data on social norms etc and it's been working out really well. Take the time to know yourself and how you interact. It will greatly improve your social/relational skills :)\nDon't hesitate to DM me if you have questions,  I always enjoy making friends.\n
2	study vulnerability. especially when you get triggered. read some books, the conflicts are endless   \nalso understand what attributes and values you seek in a man, so you get virtue around you which makes it easier to *behave*
1	Well I'm probably you just like 10-20 years in the past?   \n\n\nCurrently a med student. Feel free to HMU
1	Sure INTP, pre-med, any tips ?, and did you meet any other NT/NF doctors ? 
1	I don’t know if you’re entj but okay. Hahaha! I am one confirmed pretty much professionally so feel free to send me a message?
1	Yeah ok. You sound alright. Let’s be friends 
1	I’ll be your friend! \n\nAlso- smart to post in the F subs - they seem to know all the people. Getting an F best friend would probably do more for you than we ever could!
1	Are you fine being friends with a ENTJ a decade away from your age LOl
17	ENTJ Personality Type Description	
3	AMAZING. First really great breakdown i’ve watched 
3	Solid video, I like the social examples and the equal positive and negative elements discussed outside of "good leader" "hurts peoples feelings"
2	We use introverted intuition lol.
3	i really like that thumbnail with his pursed lips and joyful eyes.\n\nvery enticing and makes me want to click!
0	I am sitting here like "yup, yup, yup, whoa feeling personally attacked here, yup, yup"
0	One of the few people who have touched upon how Te and Se look alike (evidence, rationale), but how despite that, the N "appears" in NTJs (Te/Ni users). 
0	"Quite nice, if they need to be"  made me chuckle\n\n&#x200B;\n\n"Overestimating"  can see that.. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNice video
9	What do ENTJs do for fun?	How do we incorporate more fun into our lives? What do you do to lighten up?
34	Lord that’s the million dollar question. 
9	I think doing what I'm passionate about is fun. Music is my favorite thing, so I try to play music every day. I also like to write, so that is fun to me. If I'm able to create until I'm mentally tired, I will feel fulfilled. Creating is often fun and interesting. Even if the process of creation is painful, the feeling of fulfillment afterwards is more rewarding than fun. If I feel fulfilled, sometimes I don't even need to have fun. I can just meditate or stretch to relax after a long day.\n\nI recently got into podcasts as well, which has made chores and busywork more enjoyable.\n\nBeing with people you like is fun. In my experience, it is hard to find people who I really click with, but those few people are typically really fun. I will often participate in their hobbies, like bowling, disc golf, hiking, because if it's fun and meaningful to them, then it's the same to me.\n\nI like music, so going out and seeing local live music is fun to me. In particular, live jazz will always be fun and interesting because of its emphasis on improvisation and the tension and emotion that goes along with that.\n\nSex is fun.\n\nIf it's a week night and I don't have anything to do, I'll play video games for an hour or two. Strategy games like XCOM and Darkest Dungeon are fun to me, and I have enjoyed playing Apex Legends recently. Reading is really great as well, if you have the patience for it. After those initial 15 minutes of struggle, I find I can really get absorbed in a good book, whether it's an autobiography, sci-fi, fantasy, satire, classic lit, etc. Listening to full albums or other longform music is also one of my favorite things. If I have a lot of time to kill and I really need to decompress, there will be weed involved with any of these downtime activities (judge me bitch).\n\nHope you find some time to have fun, OP! Carve out time for yourself if you have to!
6	For me:  \nI genuinely enjoy working at my job. I enjoy playing with my kids.\n\n  \nOther hobbies:  \n\-Photography  \n\-Baking  \n\-Running   \n\-Shopping\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI guess I do generic things that everyone else does for fun.
5	I balance what most consider to be leisure 'fun' with things I feel I 'need'to get done and at the end of the day what brings me the most satisfaction is progress and "getting shit done".
4	Read, gym, and meditate. 
3	Win
3	I too love my job like most people here, but I wouldn't say it is *fun*, although my job and most 'not fun' things I do in my life are very much satisfying. Things I consider *fun* are most of the time very unproductive and it doesn't make me feel satisfied in life, but yet, somehow, it is worthwhile. Things I consider to be fun: music concerts, theater shows, visiting theme parks and zoos, going to the movies, building a pillow fort in the living room etc. etc. \n\nThe real question is - in my opinion - if you are someone like me for whom 'fun' is mostly 'unproductive' and therefor 'unsatisfying' (but enjoyable nonetheless!): how *much* fun do you incorporate in your life at the expense of productivity? What's the right balance?
3	Simulate murder with my friends in our pajamas... or as others call it, jiujitsu! Also, strength training, collect vinyl, a lot of DIY projects, and work on my car. 
3	...Fun?
3	my coworkers and friends have told me I am probably one of the dumbest smart people they know.  I've written a lot of very complex, software that is on millions of machines, and am working on my 4th startup in 15 years.  I basically go hard like crazy at work trying to make things happen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn the weekend I may be at a concert dancing while either drunk or high, watching absolutely stupid stuff like , fast and the furious move level dumb.  I have found shutting it all off , really helps recharge your crazy ambitious go getter attitude for when you are trying to get ahead / crush / eliminate the competition.  Its a good balance.
2	I think finding things we like to do is definitely essential. I do a lot of reading and research for example outside of work and school. This for instance. I like community service for example I am part of the greeting staff at my church. I also debate politics and read the news for fun. Find someone to talk to that you can handle a discussion with on something like political topics or current events. I play with technology and different apps and just how they can all be used.\n\nSocial media is a large part of fun as well. Having a bit of a social life in real life, making friends and talking to others. I also do quite a bit of talking to friends online having friends all over the united states is definitely interesting.\n\nI like playing word and trivia games.\n\nCollecting music and music trivia stuff like this.
2	I just opened my phone to do *something* with my time because for the first time in a long time, I have time to do *something*.\n\nI came to Reddit, came here, and then I see this question. And I realised I'm fucked.
2	It took me until I was 23 to start really having fun, and I'm 24 now. Before then, outside of a vacation every so often, I was grinding during the week/ resting during the weekend. \n\nNow I frequently go to concerts and comedy shows and all sorts of events in my city. I take dance and fitness classes almost every weeknight. I've gotten comfortable with going to things alone if I don't feel like interracting and just having a good time with myself. I like the experience of feeling "silly" and don't think we should just reserve that for childhood

1	What fun ?
1	For me, I find ‘fun’ in the small spaces between work doing things like watching complete and utter garbage TV (do other ENTJs do this??) reading/having some decent quiet time, walking, music and playing games with my son. He’s into Lego at the moment, perfect! \nBut for me, work is also fun. So win-win. 
1	Browsing through the internet for fun but likes to correct idiots with facts in the internet too
26	How much does your childhood play into your ENTJ personality?	In my case, I had a...less than stellar childhood, to put it simply. For a lot of it, my parents were emotionally abusive toward one another in front of me; they even turned on me a lot of times too. They won't even own to the fact that they fucked up... \n\nThere was a period of time where it seemed like nothing I did could make them proud of me; when I was a sophomore in high school, I was named the fourth chair for the violin section (out of 15 people). I didn't even get a "congratulations" from them; they yelled at me about how a kid who was younger than me got third chair. \n\nI dealt with undiagnosed ADD from when I was born to when I was 18; even when people were cunty to me because I was an impulsive and moronic kid, I didn't sit and moan and bitch about it. I took it all on the chin and kept moving.\n\nThere's gotta be something there that built my personality. Anybody else have things similar to this?
22	I think it's a mixture of genetics and extreme childhood expectations.  
16	Hi ManSoldWorld, I have heard a few times that ENTJs (and Enneagram 8s) tend to have childhoods that were extreme. \n\nTo add ancedotal data, I also had a really sh\*tty childhood. In my case there was frequent physical abuse, child protective services involvement, and my dad is still on my hometowns most wanted list. I grew up really early and always had to be independent. I struggled to connect with people into early adulthood. \n\nNow I really like what my personality has become even though conditions were extreme and negative to get here. 
7	wow surprised to see so many ENTJs with crap childhoods here. I wonder if the way the post is titled, its specifically drawing those of us who would confirm the theory into the thread. \n\nI also had a crap childhood, my parents loved me but I was never enough for them. I was always getting scolded and criticized and hardly ever praised. And when I bring this up to them, I just hear "do something worth praising". It has seeded a deep sense of inadequacy in me which drives a lot of what I do and how I behave today. A lot of approval seeking behavior, etc etc.\n\nWhile I do love who I am, I hate where I am. But anyway let me know if you want to talk about this more. 
5	Had a pretty normal Childhood, no abusive shit or else.
3	My dad was in the army, I went to 9 different schools growing up, always the new kid, the nerd, kind of chubby, not very girly... got teased a lot, didn’t have many friends, ate lunch in the bathroom... now people don’t recognize me by either my looks or personality, I am totally fine with my own company, and I connect with people very easily.  I totally attribute my personality today to the conditions of my upbringing.
3	Smooth seas don't make for great sailors...
3	This is thought-provoking. 
3	Honestly...a lot. I'm firmly ENTJ, 8w7.\n\nI'm the youngest of four kids, with the other three being extremely similar so I had to do everything faster, smarter, and better just to keep up or even just to get some attention.\n\n>They won't even own to the fact that they fucked up...\n\nI've felt some resentment towards my parents/family like you feel here where I just wanted them to admit some wrongdoing. However, over the years and with lots of therapy, I've come to the conclusion that I am proud to be who I am (ENTJ) and while it may have hurt growing up and may be lonely sometimes as an adult, I think every personality type (and thus every human) have aspects of ourselves that we struggle with. And as ENTJs, we are maybe the best positioned to actually make peace with our past, and use it to our advantage.
2	I highly doubt that any childhood difficulties (bullying) played a part into my being an ENTJ - I've always been like this, though it has likely made me more cynical and skeptical.
2	I don’t honestly know I don’t think it has to do with it too much. I think in a sense it has more to do with how you develop as an entj. I don’t think crappy childhood makes entjs. I think we do better dispite of them but it doesn’t make us. No. 
2	None? Personally I raised myself because my parents had absolutely no idea how to be parents. They provided a stable home environment and money, and nothing else. So I guess... my childhood wasn't extreme in any way, and probably didn't affect my MBTI type that much
2	I don't think type is determined by trauma, etc. Not by genetics...\n\nIn socionics, though, they say your Super Id block, corresponding to the 3rd and 4th function (in the mbti stack) is affected in its use by your environment/childhood. \n\nSo your SeFi for you ENTJs.
1	Childhood traumatic experiences unlock the Sharingan in us. 
1	It didn't. Interesting topic, however. 
1	I had a good childhood. But I can never understand how I turned to be an ENTJ.\n\nMy life at home was better than life at school. I always ended up being bullied in school. I'd be friends with people who didn't have friends because I felt sorry for them. Or I would be friends with someone the popular group hated and then eventually I'd be the outlier. Ended up being bullied. I had to get transferred to a different highschool in my first year because my mother picked me up one day with a huge 3 inch bleeding cut on my face. My mother was/is very alpha and dominant. I was reserved but very passionate and still am this way. I think I just hated highschool. When I graduated highschool and met some friends a few years later in University, they kept telling me I was incredibly popular in highschool. TBH I always though I was reserved and quiet. So this always suprises me.\n\nI did have a strict upbringing but my parents distributed my time to a range of sporting events. My parents were the generic Arab parents of general yelling and hitting but I think Arab children have strong characters and we all get past it lol. Every Arab child remembers getting hit with some shoes and wooden sticks. I was quiet and reserved in school. I didn't have an interest in people. I've always loved the news and foreign relations from I reckon the age of 8. I took part in team sports and extra-curricular acitivities and started working from the age of 14. Sports is fun but I was the only Arab girl in a group of White girls. They'd do all sorts of things because they didn't like my identity, move their bodies to cause me injuries, if I was throwing a lay-up in ball, they'd put their legs up so I'd trip, throw dirt in my water bodies. But I never said anything. So I get surprised why I turned out to be this alpha woman today.\n\nI think this is when I changed; and I changed because of one man.\n\nWhen I got a pretty cool office job at 19 while studying full-time. I met the 60 year old CEO, a  6σ blackbelt. He worked in civil, mechanical and chemical engineering facilities worldwide, in europe, asia, middle east, australia and canada (this organisation wasn't in engineering though). He really changed my character. He threw me into quantitative thinking and the power of logical thought and rationality. I was able to systemise my thoughts. I grew intellectually and emotionally underneath him. I cringe when I think about it, but I would sometimes go to his room and ask him a question. He would talk to me all the time. We have a great mentor-mentee relationship. I became very confident. At the same time, I was already articulate and taking charge in many situations but I think it just became more definite? When I first met him, he'd look at me and say, "you, you are a catalyst for change. you will be a leader one day. I see it".\n\nI took lead in projects later on outside of work. The CEO, even though he wasn't my line-manager, got me to work on a major task with international benefits by communicating with particular national stakeholders. It was just a test. I think he was trying to let me learn about myself, and he was learning about me too. I was able to influence someone using particular behavioural and logical technqiques to lodge an international program like it was their own idea. Both the CEO and I wanted this program but it had to come from the national team. I'm quite likeable and have a thing with clicking with older or mature people. It worked out. But I got very scared at what I did and considered it manipulative and that was a long time ago and I never did it again. I work again in leading teams on a small basis for very short-term projects. I have a friendly and warm leadership approach. I believe everyone has a gift and has potential. I've trained people. Faciliated workshops. I guess I've changed a lot. I'm confronting. Easy to talk to. Reliable I guess. Something he told me once was, "eye contact is your weakness". And we worked on that for a few weeks. \n\nTo answer your question, he, he was the person that built my personality. I think he saw the pot with all the ingredients and he kept mixing it until separate capacities fuelled to become a single entity.\n\nDid you have an older person in your life that could've influenced you? Perhaps a mentor? A teacher? A boss?\n\nAn external experience/individual in your life may have supported you to recognise your internal abilities?\n\n&#x200B;
1	I don’t really know, i have older siblings and my parents had a lot of dinner parties I had to sit through. I guess I learned about adult mistakes and adult speech quickly....i don’t know maybe that propelled something 
2	"Selling" Ayn Rand's Ideas	
2	I use to be a fair bit in to radnism or Objectivismm. And use to play in that ball game. I am a conservativve for whom observing politics has taught me a fair deal.\n\nThere is a point I never got the logic too. I think the way she is describing love doesn’t work.\n\nI think the idea of owning your husband or wife is an interesting notion for sure. I have always thought that her concept of what romance and love is has always been a bit odd. It seems very unrealistic and very much like she doesn’t know what a relationship is.\n\nFor me, Objectivism is a non-solution. It has some interesting libertarian ideas in there for sure. I think that it focuses too little on how actually the world works. It comes off as to animalistic in a sense. I think the fact that the end result is this pure self-interestedness and that ultimately drives everything is to simplistic. It is just not how it works. I think it is too irreligious and also don’t realise that capitalists goal can be a bit more realistic then that.\n\nI also think the government structure is a bit to simple in randism idealism can’t work in the united states. Yes, I am a conservative. I agree that there needs to be a smaller government. But what she believes is basically this nonexistent government who only keeps laws, and keeps the police force alive. Enough to defend the country and that’s about it. The more I study politics and why it works that way it seems absurd. There are many departments we can trim the government for sure, but to have the extreme of let’s just basically have such a limited government, that it is almost an anarchy doesn’t work either. What about the factors that this is a large country with a huge population. And government has been growing even during the 19th century for a reason. I think many of the offices are necessary to fulfill the duities of this country’s needs. I think that we have seen that the lack of these systems have caused issues. the truth of the matter is everyone in the united states whether they are conservatives or liberals have issues they run to the government for their solutions. So there have been some. I think cutting large parts of the government is going to cause issues and havoc. For instance the FDa. It is important to check food sanitation. We have had such good results with markets and safe food practices because of such heavily checked and regulated food industry. The government hhas no business teaching you what to eat, but because of their regulations food sold in the united states and served in the united states is clean, and safe generally. If there is a problem there have been many times where it has been caught and contained and situations handled. Now imagine if the government was as small as rand has imagined it. Many of these useful services that is provided will not be provided anymore. Should we mention drugs are sold more safely because of the fda? I am not talking about the black market. Those drugs are not subjected to the fda and not even known by the federal government. I am talking about medication. The fact that many of these medication is now controlled and made sure to be of a high quality and safe is another service the government provides.\n\nAlso even if it is not going as well as possible the truth is that there are laws to govern civil rights. Is anyone here disabled. In rands government the ADA is not allowed and neither is much of this progress we’ve made in the courts concerning civil rights of other minority groups. Integrated universities, the rights of a woman to vote and work. It’s funny because the women in her book are powerful. We have to remember that if we had not had court systems which helped the civil rights revolts of the woman’s movements first and second wave feminism. I don’t know how far it would have honestly gotten. Much less have anyone run a company like dange Taggart. That is wishful thinking. \n\nI think yes many department can be shrunk to some degree but to have such a small government as rand wishes for is dangerous. I think it is especially dangerous with such powerful nations and enemies around the globe. It may have worked in the beginning of this country but honestly, this is why the government expanded, because they found that it wasn’t pragmatic.\n\nI think idealism is interesting but as a intuitive we have to be very careful with our intuition. There is indeed a dark side to it. 
4	Fuck Ayn Rand and her infantile pseudo-philosophy. One would hope that people would outgrow such idealistic and selfish points of view.

11	INFP here. My ENTJ best friend is upset at me and I want to send him this message. Does it come off crazy to you?	I posted in the INFP subreddit but I figured it would be wise to post here too, given that my best friend is an ENTJ. \n\nPlease give me your honest thoughts. Is this too long winded and intense? If so, what are some ways I can get my point across more effectively? My best friend is upset at me due to complicate reasons. We were long distance but had somewhat of an intimate component to our ‘friendship’ that felt romantic at times. However my main motive is just for him to feel comfortable being my best friend again because he truly was mine.\n\nThe message is as follows:\n\nNo matter how physically far you were, you always felt so close. Human emotions are volatile, but human bonds are hard to break. We are more than our emotional reactions. I don’t want to lose something I know is real to such fleeting forces. \n\nI know I hurt you and it has become ingrained in my purpose never to hurt you again, nor to expend energy on those who don’t deserve it. I’m hurting because I’m afraid I’ve lost my best friend. Lately I’ve been looking at the bigger picture. We are so much more than two physical bodies, a brief fling, or a complicated friendship. We are souls that are here to learn from each other, grow, and heal the world through our inner healing. We have both helped each other in different ways and I know we can continue being that for each other despite this hiccup. I know this isn’t a comfortable discussion but no growth can occur from a place of comfort. We can get past this.
49	This is the most INFP apology I've ever read lmao\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's a bit much for someone who is potentially mad at you. Makes it seem like you're placing blame on the universe and the circumstances. I would make it more concise and say "I'm sorry about how our current relationship stands. You were my best friend and I miss that. I know it might take time but you are too important to me to let go of your place in my life. I just hope we can move past this and go back to the way things were."\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMuch more concise yet you still get to insert your feelings the way you like.
31	If I was mad at someone I think this would just piss me off even more.
14	Look I'm just 1 person who knows nothing about you, but as an entj, here is my reaction (as a reader). Bear in mind - I'm just chillin on my couch and not emotionally invested. I don't know your situation, I i won't try to read into it:\n\n1. I stopped reading your message (I went back and reread it) \n2. This sounds like a problem with you and not me. It sounds like you need the reader to support you, not like you're apologizing, or accepting something that went wrong, or even explaining. It feels like begging. It honestly is really not engaging.\n3. You sound like an infp. Words have weight. Many words have little meaning. Be clear, be consise, limit it to 1-3 sentences. I think of it as a courtesy to the listener by the speaker. It's confusing and loses its weight when you go on and on about something that's already not landing well. \n4. I mean yes you are absolutely saying a lot of things I appreciate and understand, but it sounds more like you rationalizing this to yourself, not doing something for the me/the reader. Saying "we can get past this" and "I need you to x" is a huge turnoff. My perspective, you are having some problems and asking this person to fix it for you. It also reads like a speech in a grocery store romance novel. \n\nI can totally empathize that you're having a hard time, maybe this person is too, but have you considered thinking about the other person? The other person's perspective? \n\nHere's my "edit" - basically, apologize for whatever exploded (if that's the case, you also don't need to excuse any wrongdoing of his but accept and identify how you've contributed to the situation - that's important (or accurate)), explain that he's important to you, and (importantly!) *ask* to reconnect. Don't demand it. Finally, be a good friend - you want to be good to him, not use him because you're codependent. Express that. \n\n"Hey - I'm sorry things have gotten out of hand between us. I'm know I... (insert brief apology, e.g. I lost my temper and started yelling). But I just want you to know how important you are. You've had a profound impact on my life. I hope I make your world better in the same way you do for me. \n\nThis is difficult for me and I probably overreacted, but I get that you're upset too. This isn't just about me and I want to do the right thing for you. If you want to talk, I'm listening."\n\nAlso... Don't lecture an entj on emotions. Just don't.
23	Ugh.
11	I can only speak for myself but this a lot. Just send a straight to the point apology that lets them know that you miss them. Sometimes less is more.
9	"I'm sorry for \[insert transgression here\] and I hope we can move past it"  This is usually all that needs to be said as far as I'm concerned.
9	>No matter how physically far you were, you always felt so close. Human emotions are volatile, but human bonds are hard to break. We are more than our emotional reactions. I don’t want to lose something I know is real to such fleeting forces.  \n>  \n>I know I hurt you and it has become ingrained in my soul’s purpose never to hurt you again **(can you guarantee that? I don't think so.)**, nor to expend energy on those who don’t deserve it. I’m hurting because I’m afraid I’ve lost my best friend. Lately I’ve been looking at the bigger picture. We are so much more than two physical bodies, a brief fling, or a complicated friendship. We are souls that are here to learn from each other, grow, and heal the world through our inner healing. We have both helped each other in different ways and I know we can continue being that for each other despite this hiccup. I know this isn’t a comfortable discussion but no growth can occur from a place of comfort **(Don't put this here. Seriously)**. We can get past this. I just need you to believe in me like I believe in us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy problem with this whole apology is the lack of responsibility and owning up to **your** part in it while quickly trying to brush it all away with blaming the universe, and justifying what you did. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nReally doesn't come off as genuine. Though I can see an ENTJ possibly being okay with it, but it isn't a healthy way to move forward. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou've hurt your ENTJ friend, and instead of making it better - **you're asking for more.** 
4	Waxing poetic makes this seem like self-indulgent theatre,  when what you need is a simple, humble apology. I see an acknowledgement here, but no "I'm sorry, please forgive me". 
7	It’s a bit condescending.  \nThe best apologies are short and real.   \nJust say, “I’m a dick and I’m truly sorry”.  \nMean it.  \nThen, stop being a dick. 
2	It would be better to call and talk. But given the level of precautions you have been taking you have messed big time and this will just push it. 
2	Do you still need advice on this. If I am upset at you I’ve probably stated why. There’s a solid reason. I guess I would send you back a message that would read as the following.\n\nI am wondering if you understood the core of the issue here as to why I am upset at you. I stated (said reason before). These are some interesting thoughts you have but I think you need to try to understand the issues at hand.\n\nI would elaborate again. I usually deal with problems usually swiftly usually get addressed that day so I don’t know why it would carry on to the next.. with me I would assume you didn’t reply to my last message so I would probably say something like did you read my last message I have been trying to resolve this problem with you can you please respond directly to that please?\n\nCan you tell me here or message me as to your problems with this person maybe I can try to help in more detail? Why is he mad at you?
4	ur vocabulary sucks. use pragmatic terms, not poetic metaphors
4	>it has become ingrained in my purpose never to hurt you again \n  \nPretentious to an autistic degree.
1	But what did you DO?\n\n&#x200B;
1	Just keep the last sentence.  "We can get past this."
1	ENTJ's hate nothing more than weak emotional messages. You are giving him the pass to unfriend you. 
1	As an ENTJ here's honestly how I would react:\n"Wtf is this"\nJust being brutally honest.
0	Not crazy. I like how clear you are. Consider excising everything past “... we can continue being that for each other.” The emotional message you’re trying to get across might be compromised by the more detached/impersonal language used in the last sentence or two.\n\nEdit: spelling
21	How do you beat procrastination as an ENTJ? Please help!!	I'm a sixteen year old ENTJ and a sophomore in high school. I'm extremely ambitious and I seriously love learning, but I have a huge procrastination problem. When I'm working on something for a class I'm passionate about or a project I'm leading, I can work tirelessly for hours with complete concentration. However, when faced with something I'm not passionate about or uninterested, I physically can't get motivated. I also have a huge fear of failure. This means a HUGE procrastination problem. To make this worse, my battle with procrastination is very unique. While most procrastinators are slackers and procrastinate because they simply don't want to work, my procrastination stems from my intense fear of failure. Often times I can't work because I'm too scared to fail. My school is hard but the coursework isn't challenging and I take extensive notes; so I know I can succeed, but I still struggle with getting motivated and being able to do my work with optimal effort and receive the grades I want. Does anyone have any advice or means of getting motivated and getting shit done? I need help asap so thank you :)
13	Avoidance due to anxiety. Super common. Lots of good life hacks for this one. \n\n* Commit to 5 minutes. You can go back to video games after minute 6 if you want, but commit to 5 minutes. Repeat as necessary.\n\n* Get interested. Relate it to something you care about, or get someone you care about to help you.\n\n* Up the ante. Set a deadline, reward success, and make failure hurt.\n\n* Realize that you don't have to do it. It's an option, and you're ignoring that option. Acknowledge it, accept it, and consider the value that "doing it" brings to the table. Chase after positives, or decide it isn't worth it.\n\n* Confront your feelings, give them names, and figure out why they're there.\n\nAlso see if you think your problems may be ADD or ADHD-related. It's over-diagnosed, but if you have it you may not need medication to manage it more effectively. 
9	1. Make a list of what you need to do\n2. Make a list under those titles of the steps you need to take to accomplish it.\n3. Allocate time slots/time spent for each step.\n\nMake everything into a game (or whatever you find enjoyment in).
18	**1) Create specific goal:**\n\n\- Bad: Start working out\n\n\- Good: Run 18 miles a week over a 6 day period for 10 weeks. \n\n**2) Focus on goal.**\n\nThat is it. Even if something is uninteresting I find having a defined goal is enough to stop procrastination.
4	I shared a similar problem when I was your age. The best advice I got is not to stop procrastinating, but to procrastinate smart. Procrastinate in a way that makes you more pressured to do the work, but not so pressured that you're overwhelmed. Take this example: you have 2 weeks to write a 4 page paper. You know that it will take you at least 6 hours to complete, and you can give at most 2 hours per day to it. I would wait and start work on the paper 4 days before: 3 days to work and 1 day to be flexible and to review/edit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nENTJs have a tendency to be planners - use that tendency to your advantage. Plan out your time like this, and I think you'll see huge success. Also, a large, physical calendar on my wall/desk has made a huge difference in my organizational abilities. LMK if this helps and feel free to ask any questions.
3	I think that’s a pretty typical thing for 3s and entjs to do or if it’s in your stack. I usually prioritized what I feared most and got it out of the way first.\n\nI would think that I’ll pass over that I would fail. Keep those thoughts out of your head. Have a more can do attitude.\n\nI am a 3 by the way. So I know what that feeling is I fight the feeling quite often.
3	The thumb rule of overcoming a 'fear of X' is to bloody well do X. If you fear failure, go out of your way to fail first. Just condition your mind that the first attempt will be a failure.\n\nHow will your brain fear something if it knows it's around the corner? You wouldn't be scared during a horror movie if I already told you the plot beforehand.\n\nSomewhere along the line, (you won't even notice) you have already started the task and the momentum tides you over. \n\nThese days when I sit down to study I almost ensure that I get my math wrong or write some gibberish explanation. It's hilarious but thereafter I just get on with it.\n\nI know this advice comes across as too strong but it worked for me.
3	What happens if you fail?\n\nIs failure a bad thing?\n\nHave you ever failed, in your life?\n\nI'm guessing you haven't, or at least not much.\n\nElon Musk, Warren Buffett, Bill Gates— all of these guys ***failed***. Multiple times. However, the amount of times they got back up was one more than the times they failed.\n\nWhat separates most people from them, isn't an inability to fail. It's the ability to keep trying.\n\nIf you want to succeed, shift your mindset from "I can never fail" to "I can never stop trying". Because, trust me, you're going to fail. A lot.\n\nI look forward to seeing progress updates. You've got this. 
3	Think about happy you will feel when you succeed. Work towards that. \n\nTake some time off to relax though. Don’t burn out 
2	Kung Fu or Karate. 
2	Is it just fear of failure, or have you been pushing so hard you burned yourself out?  I found that, for me, fear of failure and anxiety tends to dramatically increase when I've worked myself into burnout. 
2	Ehh, I am a 14 year old ENTJ often said to be "Too mature" but I guess I can sent some tips for other Entj's who procrastinate a lot or stressed. ☆\n--\n1. You can try to confront yourself and make yourself do it.\n\n2. Watch YouTube relax yourself, put on music and get in the mood.🎳\n\n3. Try to prevent yourself getting off tasks, get confident and sober yourself up.🥋\n\n4. Ask yourself do you want to be successful? Do you want to improve and do better?🤺💓\n\n5. Don't fear failure but fear of not trying, don't work yourself out, release the intensity.🙅‍♀️🙅‍♂️\n\n6. Eat some food, drink water! 🍐🍵\n\n7. Relax yourself from too much stuff going in your head, organize your thoughts.☕\n\n8. Take deep breathes ⭐😤\n------\nHope it helps! :^) ☆☆☆☆
1	This is classic.

57	ENTJ emotional behaviors	In my years of lurking/modding here, I've seen some trends that resonate among us. \n\nStereotypically, we're paradoxically both cold and understanding. Fearless leaders with terrible anxiety. Incredibly popular, but devastatingly alone.\n\nI've noticed that people with ENTJ tendencies tend to do four things:\n\n* Adopt technical skills quickly, especially when they have a wide perspective\n\n* Become more enthralled by technical things than by people, but still get energy from people. Learn people skills slowly, and fuck up their way up to proficiency (fake it till ya make it)\n\n* Develop serious anxiety issues due to constant social fuckups, but either power through them (and have them still) or actively try to die a little inside. Emotions are a tricky subject because loneliness is a major source of literal, actual, physical pain. \n\n* Look for the top, and ignore or underestimate all of the people, skills, and hard work that they need to do to get there. This leads to unearned arrogance and selfishness, which can be a serious liability.\n\nMy point is many of y'all need therapy. We all bottle up emotions one way or another. But you don't need to raw dog reality by yourself. \n\nFind a professional that you respect that your insurance will take, and just talk through your emotional problems. Anxiety is a bitch, so make it your bitch.
16	I've got anxiety but it's a weird kind that I'm not even sure is really happening when it is. I'm trying to say I don't have anxiety, but I look back often and wonder, "did I have anxiety?"
9	I feel obliged to remind you all while we're on a typology forum that your enneagram is not just something you write on your tinder profile. It holds the keys of your personal happiness somewhere in there.\n\nIf you're 3 and your fear is to be worthless than learn how to fail. Start things, all of them and fail at them miserably. You're an image focused type of guy? Then make a clown out of your self. Hell play the whole circus.  A fear is just that at the end of the day. Eventually along all of your failures you'll learn that it's not the end of the world. That it's part of a process. And that it doesn't hurt all that much.\n\nDon't wait for the tsunami to hit you from behind rather and go face the tides until they're nothing but steady and predictable waves if you want a picture. \n\nSome of you practice stoicism. Well that's basically what it is. You make yourself tough so that when shit comes your way, you don't fall on your knees like a little bitch. \n\nI might add that as a 3 your point of disintegration is 9. You lying around, spacing out, doing nothing is no bueno. You'll loose yourself a lot quicker than what you may think. \n\nYour point of integration is 6. That's when you learn how to work with your team. That's bueno. Do it.\n\nBe the Naruto of your story. Good luck champion. 
7	>My point is that many of ya’ll need therapy \n\nSo everything leading up to that was just you buttering us up for an intervention, huh. Seriously tho, I agree with the sentiment. Most people in the world could use it.\n\nI don’t experience constant social fuckups, my anxiety (both healthy and unhealthy) arises more out of a perfectionistic drive. A lot of people these days are extremely hard on themselves for things that weren’t actually a big deal and/or things they cannot change, and an excessive fear of those experiences is pretty much the definition of social anxiety. I recommend finding a specialist in CBT, as it is the most effective form of treatment for this.\n\nOne useful technique for when your mind is blowing painful/annoying experiences out of proportion goes as follows: create a mental image of the event, then shrink it down to the size of a pinpoint in your mind- because that’s how much space it should be occupying. 
7	The existential anxiety you refer to is your intuition and logic trying to tell you that you're wasting your  time.  And you're not being completely authentic to yourself.  Find some more productive activities like going to the gym, I go twice a day and that existential anxiety and loneliness has gone away.  We are driven people 24/7.  \n\nSecondly if you're going to go out to places like bars (you mentioned feeling anxiety in your other comment) you need to be direct and network as much as possible and get numbers when you're there.  Otherwise you will feel anxiety if you start feeling it's not worth it being there.  We don't think like others and "hanging out with the bros" is a means to an end. Don't kid yourself that you're there to relax.  \n\nAnd lastly, the anxiety is there because you have way more potential than you're owning up to.  I.e. there is something in your life that you truly feel you can improve on and have not done so.  Dig deep and find out what that is.\n\n
5	I relate to all of that. In therapy. Do recommend.
5	Jordan Peterson is my free online therapist, which helps.
3	I’ve never felt more understood by a Reddit post...damn
4	I know it sounds really dumb, but knowing other people are going through this helps.  Someone messaged me because they hadn't seen me in a few days and just wanted to make sure I was ok.  I'm in my 30s, and no one has EVER just checked in to make sure I was ok until last week. It is insane to me how much that tiny little thing meant. And then I realized someone cares enough to want to check on me, and how do I handle this? \n\nI tried explaining the loneliness to someone once, and the response I got was, "But you're so popular! Everyone wants to be in your orbit." You can't explain that you didn't understand people and never fit in as a kid because of it.  Because you never acted out and were always the star student, the adults gave you credit for being mature even though you could never fit in with a peer group. And never fitting in means you ended up with the adults, so you REALLY never developed social skills.  What they saw as maturity was actually developmental delays that the adults never thought to help you with.\n\nOdds are you're a young adult by the time you understand WHY you were an outcast as a kid, but you're so socially behind it feels like you'll never catch up, so you throw yourself into being successful.  Suddenly people want to be around you, and you don't know what to do with it. You missed the entire part of childhood that's about building friendships (most of my friends through school years were fellow outcasts). And the leap from outcast to "it girl" is... What the fuck do you even DO with it? All I wanted as a teen was to know what it is to be popular. I'm surrounded by people all the time, and the more people end up in my orbit, the lonelier I get. \n\nI never know which friendships are genuine, and who just wants something from me. Outside of family? I can count on one hand the number of honest, close friendships I have. 
3	I must admit I have messed up once or twice on the social fuckup scale. What you said is totally correct, I don't think I have been able to forgive myself completely or have my own closure, so "actively trying to die inside" or pushing through it rings true. Others have forgiven me, but I am "perfect", and as a child I was told not to show emotion (dad yelled at me whenever I cried or shown any negative emotion). So basically I have always repressed emotions as a result of childhood. 
2	Im trying to quit therapy but I’m not sure how it’s gonna go. 
2	But what if you're too busy winning to have anxiety???
1	Have you ever thought about how in the grand scale of things in the universe we're nothing with all that we'd achieve will be for naught when we dissipate in 100+ years. We've been born in a period where the percentage is still a whole number in humanity's 2000+ period of intelligence in that we still haven't seen the full extent of humanity's potential. For all we know we're heading into a society akin to The Culture and we've missed it by a few percentage points by being born in an earlier period than optimal. That's the type of anxiety I get, alongside with what it means to be useful in your lifespan. I need a therapist with some gin. 
1	Oh lord much of this is true for me. I definitely need therapy but have never been. The only time I came close was offering to go to save my relationship. My anxiety is a monster.
1	"Incredibly popular, but devastatingly alone." Couldn't have agreed any more my friend- my problem isn't that I am not in a social circle but rather that I am in every single one of them. Last 4 weeks I felt lonely for the first time in a long while. I became so good at talking it was almost like an instinct, I didn't even care about hearing people out. My body almost on its own crafted responses and I watched my body talk in almost third person for ever interaction.\n\nSame agreement goes for  "we're paradoxically both cold and understanding." I can feel emotions of others in a profound, grasping manner but at the same time be so rude that I would be considered a "dick/a-hole".\n\nI disagree with  "Fearless leaders with terrible anxiety" since I personally don't feel like anxious, merely fearless(almost to a dangerous extent but not completely). I rationally tell myself that if something isn't in my control I mustn't worry- my work should speak in itself and if I fail, it is a collection of all my errors which can be fixed. I do dislike insecurity but believe that it is my control what happens next.

4	ENTJ emotions and dating	As an ENTJ what are your experiences with heart break? Almost a year ago I was in a relationship with an INFJ male that ended rather abruptly, though not entirely without warning since intuitively it seemed like our relationship wasn't going to last as long as I wanted it to last. However, I also have realized that I have an almost absurdly high desire to think that people can work out anything as long as they are able to do the dirty work to figure things out.   \n\n\nI did, however, see some extremely weird behaviors come out towards the end of that relationship.  \nFirst, I cried an insane amount, so much that it freaked me the heck out because I don't cry over anything.   \nI also realized that despite the norm that ENTJs think emotions instead of FEEL them, I actually FELT every possible emotion over the course of my relationship with an INFJ and I'm not sure if it's healthy for an ENTJ to have that much feeling--it definitely was not typical ENTJ as far as I'm aware, but I have not been able to figure out quite what was going on at the personality level.   \n\n\nI do know my ex slacked off more than I would have liked when it came to working through some issues, and eventually it brought out a tiger in me and I was basically ready to attack anything and everything--it was very weird. It was almost as if I was perceiving him as the biggest obstacle to our relationship because I was doing a ton of research and studying to try to see if we could find common ground and he mostly seemed overwhelmed by the sheer amount of dedication to making something work, though part of that could have been the ENTJ/INFJ combo.   \n\n\nAnyway, tell me what you discovered about your emotional make up when you dated or were in a relationship with a very different personality type--if you want. :)  \n
6	I don't think you had more emotion than an ENTJ should have. It is unfortunate but what probably happened is that all of your feelings came to head at once. It can be scary to feel so many emotions all at one time, especially when you're not used to it. \n\nI am sorry about your breakup and that it left you feeling the way it did.
2	I’m an ENTJ. Your experience is similar to my own. I was (and am) also in a relationship with an INFJ male. The problem on which we couldn’t reach an agreement was an instance of infidelity on my part and it resulted in our separation. I tried to find common ground, offer assurances and therapy for my fuckup but the next half year was a toxic hell. We eventually started speaking again once I was adult enough to own up to my mistake without any blame at all for his reactions, and we have been back together for four years and couldn’t be happier. I learned that I was thinking too much, not feeling enough, and almost lost my soulmate because of it. It became a contest of who was more wrong because of his terrible reaction to what I had done, but I eventually snapped out of it and realized that was unfair because none of it would have happened if not for me. Anything can be worked out... but you both have to be willing to try. There is nothing preventing ENTJ/INFJ from having a happy and healthy relationship if they both work hard enough and don’t expect things the other can’t give. I’ve had friends tell me we’ll never work because of our types but, other than me fucking up, everything was perfect. My fucking up had zero to do with types as every type does it. To this day I believe it was an attempt to sabotage because I was so anxious about the relationship.

1	(Warning: INFP not ENTJ) - It sounds to me like you finally hit "emotional overload" and it just all came to a head. Like, it was all too much for you to handle and finally your brain just dumped all of those feelings on you, but since it doesn't happen often to you, you weren't entirely sure how to respond. Your normal coping skills were just not cutting it in the face of the situation. Make Sense? What I'm really getting from this is that you felt an intense emotional frustration that you tried so hard to fix this, but you felt  your ex just bowed out. Sounds incredibly frustrating and heartbreaking to me. Understandable that your brain would hit full emotional capacity and you'd act differently than normal.
1	I dated an isfp. And it was an interesting experience to say the least. I am not a really emotional person and dating isn’t really my thing. I dated an esfp and then an isfp. I broke up the one with the esfp which I am friends with still. The isfp told me he was done. My ni was telling me this wasn’t going to work. I wanted it to work desperately. He was a pretty immature isfp. In society’s standard he was also you didn’t need mbti to tell you he was interesting. I guess I was sort of mothering marshalling him for the very longest time. Haha! People actually asked me why I dated him. Haha! It’s like I expect better of you. Haha!\n\nBut I think it was this want to care, this shock and numbness which was overwhelming.
1	I personally think the INFJ/ ENTJ combo is really great if they’ve both had time to mature and are ready for commitment. My ENTJ guy balances me out. Maybe infj isn’t the problem it just wasn’t the right infj for you <3
34	ENTJs sexual gods. Thanks.	Just came to say that after sleeping with a second ENTJ, you guys are literally the best at it out of all the types, like ever. You might be full on but that translates well into the bedroom. That is all. 
21	So this guy must be your 17th 
14	Life tip for young men: 99% of guys won't ever admit they never learned to make love, and hence won't learn anything about doing it well. That means a big share of guys are counting on natural talent while there is valuable material out there teaching you how to please and enjoy your time with a woman, a thousand different ways.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n"There are two things a man will never admit he cannot do well: drive and make love." - Sir Stirling Moss
14	As the long term partner of a female entj, I have to agree. She is forward and open, and shares herself with me in every way. It is as though there are no boundaries between us. And I really appreciate how hungrily and unabashedly she goes for my chicken wings. OOOWWEEEE!!
7	Can confirm, turned professional.
8	meanwhile, a month ago... "[Why do ENTJs rub me the wrong way...](https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/a8u9o7/why_do_entjs_rub_me_the_wrong_way/)"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe wonders of hatefucking, I guess.
3	Aww shucks\n\nIt's nice to be appreciated
5	What's your type?\n\nOh and please describe what you like specifically. Dating an INFJ currently and we are slowly getting more serious. 
1	Another one bites the dust.
1	Ok I just wanna stop by to say I don’t know if they’re as great as they think bc foreplay doesn’t seem to be on the top of their priority list lol

6	Unrequited love	Anyone have a solution for this? Please?
10	Will excessive exercise fix it?
9	\n> Anyone have a solution for this? Please?\n\nOut of sight - out of mind.\n\nIt is a numbers game. Go on 100 dates. Spend a month on Tinder or a year on dating sites.\n
5	An INFJ friend (master of the door slam) gave me excellent advice when I was fixated on a man I needed to forget. Infatuation is essentially a chemical addiction. Your brain is giving you a little kick every time you fantasize about that person, and you need to wean yourself off. She literally told me to put them out of my mind when I thought of them. Forcibly avoid thinking about them and considering them at all, turn your mind to other things. It's amazing that this actually works, after five years of a fraught emotional relationship I no longer feel anything for him after just a couple of months. Now I see him as so unexceptional I don't know what I saw in him in the first place. Give it a try.
3	This wasn't the one for you. Someone who values you will return the time, efforts, words as they are able.\n\n  \n\n\nKnow your worth.
2	I have a great boyfriend and still crushing on this same man for over a year whether I see him or not. I have dreams about him. It’s totally bizarre and insane and illogical.
2	Could be birth control pills messing with your brain chemistry. Its crazy that you cant expect the dude to wear a rubber every time.\n
2	I feel like I’m on the verge of working it out and can’t quite get there.
2	Yes! I listened to [this meditation](https://soulrises.com/meditate/12-minute-meditation-to-relieve-sadness) twice, sobbing in the car, trying to get it together before going to pick up my daughter from afterschool. I realized that all the things I love about him are \*in\* me already, or how could I appreciate them. I realized that he is just the lesson. I listened to this meditation twice, and picked up my daughter and we went home and had a joyful evening at home. Obviously, I had to do more meditation over several weeks, but I swear to you it will heal you if you give it a chance. <3   \n \n\nAnd, from Rumi:\n\n“Stop acting so small. You are the universe in ecstatic motion.”\n\n“The wound is the place where the Light enters you.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
2	Any reasons? A way to get closure?\n\nMaybe a good reason was they didn't want you and going for someone that doesn't want you is stupid. How'd your rest of life look like? Crap!\n\nBur even without negatives: cleanse yourself from them i.e. pictures, contact anything and assume they don't exist for a while and in the mean time do things that make you happy, be with people who male you happy and just let it go.\n\nYou know there are a million people in this world and many of them you don't love and you have a right to decide that and similarly those people have a right to decide too. It's just as simple and nothing personal. The only time it really sucks is when you're a little blindsided.
1	It’s not working.
1	I don’t think that’s it. I think relationships are inherently flawed. I need to find some as semblance of peace of mind because without it I am not living my best self or stepping out of my comfort zone.
1	Somebody has this figured out. There’s a book out there or something that has a road map to fixing this. I can’t seem to find it though.
1	It’s a simple solution. I move on. If he wanted to go out with me, he would ask.
1	Thank you
1	Bull shit only 5% of the population is experiencing limerence. I am trying to detox from feelings and every darn song on the radio is secretly about this guy that never asks me out. I sent him a text at lunchtime and then had to disconnect my stereo. If 5% of the population is experiencing limerence, then 70% of the population is with the wrong person and in denial, and 25% of the population is either healthy or incapable of experiencing love. Screw you radio.

2	Increasing Human Energy: Where we fit into the world.	How do ENTJs fit into the world?  Why do we have this deep seated burning desire to succeed?  We are the human powerhouses and it's important that we hone our skills.  But why?  Is it an evolutionary advantage for us to be ruthless individuals stopping at nothing to win and how does this translate to the whole?  Why do we have a need to always bring our A-game? You're probably already doing great things but just incase you feel confused as to why you have this deep urge and desire to succeed while nobody else cares or understands you.  Hopefully I can bring forth more clarity for you fellow ENTJs who want to turn it up a notch or early ENTJs just trying to learn who they are and develop.\n\nIt all comes down to what Tesla describes in his book "The Problem of Increasing Human Energy".  Here is the excerpt I urge you to read.\n\n\[See *Nikola Tesla: Colorado Springs Notes*, page 334, Photograph X.\] \n\n^(FIG. 1. BURNING THE NITROGEN OF THE ATMOSPHERE.Note to Fig. 1 This result is produced by the discharge of an electrical oscillator giving twelve million volts.  The electrical pressure, alternating one hundred thousand times per second, excites the normally inert nitrogen, causing it to combine with the oxygen.  The flame-like discharge shown in the photograph measures sixty-five feet across.)\n\nWhen we speak of man, we have a conception of humanity as a whole, and before applying scientific methods to, the investigation of his movement we must accept this as a physical fact.  But can anyone doubt to-day that all the millions of individuals and all the innumerable types and characters constitute an entity, a unit?  Though free to think and act, we are held together, like the stars in the firmament, with ties inseparable.  These ties cannot be seen, but we can feel them.  I cut myself in the finger, and it pains me: this finger is a part of me.  I see a friend hurt, and it hurts me, too: my friend and I are one.  And now I see stricken down an enemy, a lump of matter which, of all the lumps of matter in the universe, I care least for, and it still grieves me.  Does this not prove that each of us is only part of a whole?\n\nFor ages this idea has been proclaimed in the consummately wise teachings of religion, probably not alone as a means of insuring peace and harmony among men, but as a deeply founded truth.  The Buddhist expresses it in one way, the Christian in another, but both say the same: We are all one.  Metaphysical proofs are, however, not the only ones which we are able to bring forth in support of this idea.  Science, too, recognizes this connectedness of separate individuals, though not quite in the same sense as it admits that the suns, planets, and moons of a constellation are one body, and there can be no doubt that it will be experimentally confirmed in times to come, when our means and methods for investigating psychical and other states and phenomena shall have been brought to great perfection.  Still more: this one human being lives on and on.  The individual is ephemeral, races and nations come and pass away, but man remains.  Therein lies the profound difference between the individual and the whole.  Therein, too, is to be found the partial explanation of many of those marvelous phenomena of heredity which are the result of countless centuries of feeble but persistent influence.\n\nConceive, then, man as a mass urged on by a force.  Though this movement is not of a translatory character, implying change of place, yet the general laws of mechanical movement are applicable to it, and the energy associated with this mass can be measured, in accordance with well-known principles, by half the product of the mass with the square of a certain velocity.  So, for instance, a cannon-ball which is at rest possesses a certain amount of energy in the form of heat, which we measure in a similar way.  We imagine the ball to consist of innumerable minute particles, called atoms or molecules, which vibrate or whirl around one another.  We determine their masses and velocities, and from them the energy of each of these minute systems, and adding them all together, we get an idea of the total heat-energy contained in the ball, which is only seemingly at rest.  In this purely theoretical estimate this energy may then be calculated by multiplying half of the total mass is that is half of the sum of all the small masses with the square of a velocity which is determined from the velocities of the separate particles.  In like manner we may conceive of human energy being measured by half the human mass multiplied with the square of the velocity which we are not yet able to compute.  But our deficiency in this knowledge will not vitiate the truth of the deductions I shall draw, which rest on the firm basis that the same laws of mass and force govern throughout nature.\n\nMan, however, is not an ordinary mass, consisting of spinning atoms and molecules, and containing merely heat-energy.  He is a mass possessed of certain higher qualities by reason of the creative principle of life with which he is endowed.  His mass, as the water in an ocean wave, is being continuously exchanged, new taking the place of the old.  Not only this, but he grows propagates, and dies, thus altering his mass independently, both in bulk and density.  What is most wonderful of all, he is capable of increasing or diminishing his velocity of movement by the mysterious power he possesses by appropriating more or less energy from other substance, and turning it into motive energy.  But in any given moment we may ignore these slow changes and assume that human energy is measured by half the product of man's mass with the square of a certain hypothetical velocity.  However we may compute this velocity, and whatever we may take as the standard of its measure, we must, in harmony with this conception, come to the conclusion that the great problem of science is, and always will be, to increase the energy thus defined.  Many years ago, stimulated by the perusal of that deeply interesting work, Draper's "[History of the Intellectual Development of Europe](http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/diglib/books/A-E/D/draper/draptoc.htm)," depicting so vividly human movement, I recognized that to solve this eternal problem must ever be the chief task of the man of science.  Some results of my own efforts to this end I shall endeavor briefly to describe here.\n\n**TL;DR**   "Man, however, is not an ordinary mass, consisting of spinning atoms and molecules, and containing merely heat-energy.  He is a mass possessed of certain higher qualities by reason of the creative principle of life with which he is endowed...What is most wonderful of all, he is capable of increasing or diminishing his velocity of movement by the mysterious power he possesses by appropriating more or less energy from other substance, and turning it into motive energy."  **Tesla is not just referring to velocity as a physical speed but metaphysical speed of the progression of mankind.**\n\nIn conclusion why is it so important that we always bring our A-game? **To fulfill our existential purpose.  That is to move the human race forward,** and as ENTJs we are all about leading and efficiency.  We're perfect for the job.\n\n&#x200B;

8	ENTJ stuck in pointlessness	Hello\n\nI am here, 20yo, to describe my situation and try to see if anyone here has any experience on how to get out of this struggle.\n\nI used to be a younger wannabe successful entrepreneur, and had projects and ideas but nothing truely came out successful. Then I had some mentor that totally changed my approach and had me learn many new stuff (I'll forever be thankful for this and will definitely return the favour) but this hasn't brought me anywhere.\n\nNothing, from personal finance to physical health, stamina, and actual skills have improved during these years. I'm yet to be ready to achieve anything (so far out of a dozen of projects, none came to fruition)\n\nOnly failure, reliance on someone else's will and passivity has been the new things that came into my life. I'm saddened and desperate for a solution, to regrow something resembling talent, will and confidence. \n\nI haven't been listening to myself during these years and knew i could have done so much more if this hasn't been the case.\n\nWhat do you guys see in this, and what would you propose me to do?
10	Failure is part of life and very normal. You only become a failure of a person when you give up and stop trying.
2	Invest in yourself (read, travel) and chase novelty (pick out a new industry, a new job, new hobbies and activities).  Can't tell you better, that's what I am doing since high school (though I studied in university) and so far it's broadening my knowledge of myself and the world, aiming to a point where I'll be able to create something by my hands and make it grow. Personal example: currently positioning myself for a job in a foreign country and in an industry I have yet to discover, and passing time by learning about ice hockey, Magic The Gathering, and blockchain. Reading LOTR also. Just constantly broadening horizons, learning stuff.\n\nFor mental and physical conditions, the Four Horsemen of Well-Being : eat well and reasonably, sleep tight, exercise, meditate every other day. Get at least 20 minutes of exposure to the sunlight per day (even if cloudy) so you get vitamin D in your metabolism (betters mood, harmonize emotions, regulate sleep).
2	Have you read any books on psychology? Positive psychology is totally worth learning about and can improve your well-being simultaneously! Let me know if you want specific ideas or examples. 
1	Don't give up.\n\nHere is a start. Follow Dan Lok, then Dan Pena.\n\n[How To Become Rich - 3 Steps For REAL + LASTING Wealth - with Dan Lok](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qY7xzGUYIhY)\n\nIt should give you ideas.\n
1	What exactly are you trying to achieve? \n\nIt is unclear. \n\nIf your aim is unclear, then the feeling of pointlessness is more likely. \n\nThink of it as not placing the coordinates in your GPS. You'll just end up going in circles. \n\nThe amount of failures any individual has doesn't equate owing of success. \n\nWhat makes you, you, is how many times you can stand up from failure. \n\n1. Stop counting your failures and see them as lessons. \n\n2. Define clearer goals. \n\n3. Define mini/daily goals. \n\n4. Set milestones. \n\n5. Define a measuring system. \n\n6. Keep reconfiguring your approach after every lesson. \n\nEventually, you'll get there. \n\n
1	Find something you can be passionate about you can do and not be uninvested in. University is good indeed. I think ntjs can easily do university.\n\nI know the stereotype is business, ceo, start a company. But that’s a stereotype. Not all entjs are that way or so inclined. Maybe you’re destined for some other fields. I know about one who’s very popular and successful who is a christian apologist. I am studying to enter government work and to hold offices. Find your fit.\n\nMaybe it’s really not to own a venture or a business. Maybe that’s just not it. Maybe that’s not for you. I’ve thought about it a few times I know this guy who is in to it and wants me to as well. He’s some sort of unhealthy lonely something need to think about it more. But the point is maybe it’s not for you. As it isn’t for me. I’ve thought about it but seriously start a business. Maybe not me, work in corporate as a manager I just... don’t know. I am really happy where I am now I think. Could be wrong but I hope I am right.. 
1	Spend more time on reddit.
1	Are you attending college? Get a college degree
0	(Probably) Stupid 'CAN I BE ____ AND ENTJ' question	I have always been more of a 'stand at the back of the group' person, I strategise well and I want others to implement my strategy to succeed, but no one ever fucking listens to me and I'll feel anxiety if I speak to a large group. \n\nI'm good with smaller groups but for the ones with more than 25 people, I'll never be good at being in charge of them. I don't have a commanding presence and people always elect ESXPs as the leaders but most people on here state that you generally get good support when you lead.\n\nI'm considering INTJ now, I know that typing is based on functions, but this has been a trend that I've been noticing and I can't not avoid it. Thoughts? 
3	Yeah, probably intj. Then entj. I think most of us don’t like standing at the back of the group.\n\nCan you relate to ni and te?
3	Based on the other comments, you’re probably just young and growing into your abilities. Socialising won’t come naturally all of sudden, so you have to keep making small efforts to improve at networking and meeting people, but you’ll eventually learn to love it.\n\nI was like you and always watched before doing. Sometimes for too long and I’d miss good opportunities to dive in and just have a first attempt and see where that got me. Eventually I learned to be okay with making myself look silly and that has done insane shit for my confidence.
12	How do I help my ENTJ BFF (INFJ M 30)	He's 30, male, and the most determined human being on the face of the planet. He's been insanely stressed recently. He just bought a condo, and even though there is no timeline for when he needs to finish decorating/furnishing he feels like he's behind and it annoys him. He hates his job, has been in tons of interviews lately for a new one and always gets to the final stage before being rejected. He's a serious mess emotionally, but he won't slow down. Sometimes he'll just stare at his phone for a half hour and then declare, "There, 15 more jobs applied for"  \n\n\nHe'll talk to me for extended periods about his problems, saying the same things over and over again. I'm more than happy to just listen, and he says it helps. I support him in his evaluation of his circumstance and encourage him, reminding him of how capable he is (seriously though, his stamina is remarkable). Ultimately I want to do something more, what could it be? Even when he's complaining and telling me how awful he feels he's smiling. I'm used to letting my NFP friends cry it out, but that's not his style.  \n\n\nAny suggestions on what else I can do to support/uplift him? 
14	Be there to listen and occasionally encourage. We typically work through our problems in our mind and just need a trustworthy ear to vent to. If he goes too far(which most ENTJ’s don’t) that’s when you slap some sense in him. He will bounce back. We always do 
10	We ENTJs get caught in these loops. On the one hand they are productive and earth shattering. You can bet he will eventually find a big job. On the other hand they are destructive and we forgot about what is important. Take a leadership role. Help him to take a break from the loop. Tell him to turn his phone off. Make him do feely perceptive things. Take him painting or to a salsa dancing class. Make him get out of his comfort zone.
5	This cracks me up because I can relate.... If I'm being honest, I'm the most happy when I'm chasing something or working towards some goal. It's a stressful and overwhelming situation to be in, but the payoff is going to be a phenomenal high. Don't let him lose that perspective. We like to talk about our goals and future, we like to bounce ideas off of other people. It's not necessarily a cry for help. I think that what you're doing now is perfectly fine, just let him ride it out
3	The best thing for him is to get into a position where he's in control. Help him start a small business? Or conmect him with entrepreneurs? This depends on his skill sets though.
2	Tell me more about your friend. \n\nWhat kind of jobs is he looking for? \n\nWhat are some of his repeat problems?\n\nWhat is his greatest pain/passion?\n\nWhat was the motivation for buying the condo?
2	nothing conceptual, as you have zero perspective. take care of the material stuff and emotional stuff.   \naka in an interraction his input 90%, your input 10% conceptually. which mostly would be a few questions about feelings to move things forward, or rephrasing and other listening strategies  
2	I think that someone has sort of covered this, encourage him to slow down.
1	Interesting post. During one of my most stressed times recently, an ENFJ helped me out immensely. I don't think there was much he physically/actually *did* other than spend time actively listening to me complain/whine/rant/stress, but his positivity was infectious, his optimism was extremely uplifting and **that** was what mattered.\n\nIf I have to summarize in a way that absolutely doesn't do his charisma justice, it was a lot of positive messages - things might suck now, but all bad times lead to great ones / examples of how hard work pays off / stories of famous, wildly successful people doing through tough times and struggling/failing. \n\nFi tends to make us dig ourselves deeper and deeper into a ditch. If it's being negative, we can't stop the spiral. What really helps is to "trigger" our Ni again so we remember there is a bigger picture, and then an even bigger picture beyond that. Then, Fi gets rewired into positive/motivated feelings and our Ni+Te can take care of the doing parts (they're very good at it, no worries). \n\n*Don't be afraid to tell ENTJs how to feel*. We take stuff at face value.
1	To me what would help me the most is straight up constructive advice. \n\nTell me what I’m doing wrong, tell me why it’s happening this way and suggest me a way to tackle the problem.
12	How to get out of this Fi stuff	This is one of my worst days. I'm stressed out with work, none of my friends respect me enough to listen to what I have to say, none of them believes in what I can do (I'm starting to doubt myself now), and my ISFJ friend continuously fires morally degrading comments at me or sometimes ignores me when I talk to her. She's the only person in the class I can talk to well, and I don't have the energy to interact with new people anymore.\n\nWorst of all, my messed up emotions decided to appear and I had a breakdown in the restroom. I cursed really loud in class and got called out by the professor, and another two in other classes. I felt useless, stupid and inferior to everyone.\n\nThis all happened after a really bad dream saying how I killed my family and that I'm going to have really bad luck soon. I'm paranoid about everything and emotional over every small fuck-up.\n\nI know this may not be Fi, but I figured that someone here may know or experienced something like this. Anyone had this once? 
10	1. Limit/stop the exposure with your ISFJ. She's doing nothing for your mental/emotional health right now. (This helps the spiral)\n\n\n2. Take a breath. \n\n\n3. Talk to someone you trust/can feel safe without judgements and/or someone that will actively listen. (This allows you to feel deeply how you feel and so you can move past it)\n\n\n4. Take another breath. \n\n\n5. Identify how you got to where you did. Work on preventative strategies. (Re-engage your Te)\n\n\n6. Take a breath. \n\n\n... If it doesn't work. \n\n\n7. Tire yourself physically and channel your emotions into something physical. (engages Se and endorphins as bonuses)\n \n\nDon't be so hard on yourself. Find someone to have a laugh with. \n\n
8	1. Avoid the ISFJ.  Next time she throws bs at you cut her off by walking away.  They're good at gaslighting, effectively removing all your logic and intuitive thinking.   Realize what they are throwing at you is nothing but emotional triggers.  They are the epitome of Brownian movement.\n2. Hit the gym asap.
5	Jesus ...this is happening to me rn .i know how you’re feeling. it sucks to feel useless
3	Maybe you can try some mindfulness practices. Emotions can exaggerate things out of proportion and devastate someone so these practices should help you calm your nerves a bit. Since you say that you're stressed out, I'd say you need to catch a break too. 
2	You need sauna
2	It sounds to me that this is far less about your cognitive functions and more about the fact that you're surrounded by people that aren't good for you. I read through your comments and since removing these toxic people isn't an option right now I suggest coming up with a strategy to deal with the toxic behavior that is having a damaging effect on you. \n\n>I'm stressed out with work, none of my friends respect me enough to listen to what I have to say, none of them believes in what I can do (I'm starting to doubt myself now), and my ISFJ friend continuously fires morally degrading comments at me or sometimes ignores me when I talk to her. She's the only person in the class I can talk to well, and I don't have the energy to interact with new people anymore.\n\n1. For stress at work I recommend doing something to channel that stress and get it out of your system. I deal with this problem through exercise (healthy use of our third function, Se). Even just going outside somewhere where you can have some time to collect your thoughts and tap into your Ni can also be incredibly helpful for this. \n\n2. If your friends don't respect you enough to listen to what you have to say and don't believe in you? Then they are *not* your friends. End of story. Never waste your time on people who don't respect you, it'll save you a lot of grief in the long run. \n\n3. This ISFJ is a nasty piece of work. As another person here astutely pointed out, toxic ISFJs tend to gaslight people and I can tell this is what she's doing to you. Given that she likes to fire morally degrading comments at you, you have a few options but what I recommend is the good old fashioned silent treatment when she starts up with this nonsense. ISFJs can't stand being ignored when they get up on their moral high horse. If you stop giving her the reaction she feels entitled to? She'll cut it out eventually though she'll sulk about it for sure, and quite possibly embarrass herself by throwing a temper tantrum (if this happens, absolutely do not react and get away from her ASAP, preferably by suddenly becoming violently ill). Anything you say to her about it will be like throwing gasoline on a fire. Sometimes the best response is no response at all. Also, by taking this route you'll also be giving her a taste of her own medicine seeing as she also ignores you for no good reason. \n\n4. You're not stupid, useless, or inferior to everyone. That isn't how life works. Remember this: the only person you're ever truly competing against is yourself. 
0	Am I an ENTJ?	Hi everyone.\nMy test results are ENTJ, in some ENTJ with Loop.\nWe know that the tests are not completely reliable so I have studied the various functions, I have made my own idea and now I write here to get some confirmation.\nI am 23 years old, I did Scientific High School because as a child I wanted to be a doctor, but after seeing that the hospital is not my environment, probably lack of empathy, I opted for Business Studies.\nI have made this choice because I am interested in the "position of control and power", have more knowledge because I am mainly interested in starting my own business, or, if it goes wrong, being hired to play a senior role (if you have thought of the CEO congratulations you’re right). \nAlways aim to have a main role in a group, organize, say what to do and I can’t stand that others are too relaxed, slow or don’t take things seriously, but at the same time I also know how to be humorous to ingratiate them.\nI tend to be among the most organized and I want things to be done with principle.\nPrinciple that often turns out to be my point of view in fact I tend to do things “on my way”.\nYes, I‘ve been defined arrogant or as a "I do everything" or "what I say is law", and I don’t like others told me what to do.\nDespite this I like to discuss ideas and theories, but I always tend to the pragmatic side of the thing and hardly change my mind if I'm not totally convinced.\nA black or white situation.\nI am quite "future oriented ", but at the same time I’m interested in the present moment and act for what I want.\nI make decisions quickly, but if it’s very important, I prefer to have as much information as possible.\nI’ve been called selfish, unable to put myself in others shoes, I'm not good with my emotions or those of others, but I'm ready to help when you really need, even without being asked.\nWhat makes me doubt I really am an ENTJ?\nThe procrastination in the study: I ​​have always done and I continue to do it at the University.
5	What makes you think internet people will be more reliable than the test?
2	You claim to have problems with empathy, arrogance, and selfishness. I've been in this frame of mind before, myself. It's possible that you're an ENTJ that's on the underdeveloped side.\n\nA note on power.\n\nThe more power you have, the less control you have. That control is all happening on the ground.\n\nYou need good people skills, you need to know your business, and you need to know your competition. Developing empathy (or at least good sympathy) helps build these skills.\n\nAs you mature, slow your roll and develop some humility.
1	It does come off as a stronger Te and a lower Fi. \n\nHow did you cancel out ESTJs? \nHow do you perform under stress? \nWhat happens when you're under stress? \nWhy do you procrastinate? 
1	Take the test again in a few months. Continue to do this. 
0	ESTJ?
6	Trying to figure out my career path and I need some input from my fellow entjs!!	I am 24 years old and here are my past experiences:\n- market research analyst + business analyst for my university’s finance department\n- lead market research analyst for a marketing club\n- 2 research assistant positions\n- Volunteer work: (1) I have worked with children with autism as an assistant to an occupational therapist (2) I worked as a playground specialist: I promoted problem solving methods and played a few sports with kids K-6  \n- I have tutored kids K-6 \n\nI would say I enjoy being a market research analyst but I also really enjoy working with children. I would say one of the happiest moments of my life was when I volunteered to teach children with autism the basics (write, read, pronounce words, use scissors or anything that was difficult for them to grasp). The issue is that the pay isn’t that great and I know most people would say do what you love because it wouldn’t feel as if you’re working a day in your life... although I do need a higher salary to support myself financially. Here are my options: \n\n- Entry level market research analyst salary: $45-$50k \n(No extra schooling or certification needed) \n\n- Applied Behavioral Therapist: $12-16$ an hour.. \n(Need a certification) \n\n- Occupational Therapist: average salary - $75k\n(4-5 years of school) \n\n- Psychology Teacher for High School Students: $55k\n(Need a license to teach + certification) \n\nChoosing the market research analyst position is definitely the best option in terms of salary although I’m not sure if I’m extremely passionate about market research.\n\nTLDR: Not sure what career path to choose. The best pay with no schooling necessary: Market research analyst although I’m not sure if I’m passionate. I enjoy working with children although the pay isn’t that great unless I obtain a master’s degree which would require an extra 4-5 years of school..SOS \n
3	You're at the start of your career path. Do what you love for now and see how things pan out in a year or so.\n\n  \n\n\nSave. Put a little something aside now and make a habit of it. Live within your means. There will be time for you to advance your career and earn more money.
2	Make 3 lists.\n\nList a: A list of all the activities you enjoy\n\nList b: A list of things you are good at / current skillset\n\nList c: A list of jobs / business ideas resulting from combining each item in list a with list b.\n\nThen sort list c in descending order for highest expected income, or whatever other metric you choose (i.e. timeframe, suitable locale, realistically achievable etc.)\n\nSoon as youve done this it will become pretty clear to you which path(s) to follow. But be warned: try to focus on one or two outcomes only or you will overwhelm yourself and just wheelspin. Common entj issue.\n\nMake sure your list a and b are as exhaustive as possible and go wild, dont hold back or reproach yourself for any ideas, you might very well surprise yourself with the ideas that come out of that.
2	Why not combine your passion for research with helping children?  For instance, get a job at the National Institute of Health's (NIH) NICHD.  One of my friends from college interned there, and she basically ran studies on children playing.  The parents would drop their kids off for free childcare, and psychologists would study various aspects of how the kids interacted with one another.  Just one example of the many studies they ran.  After working there, she ended up getting her teaching credential and taught elementary school.   \n\nOne of the benefits of working for the gov't is great retirement and other long term benefits, like federal holidays and vacation/sick time/step raises, especially if you plan on having a family (or whatever floats your boat).
1	Medical doctor / child psychiatrist\nOr\nPhD psychologist\n
1	Keep doing what brings in income. I would then suggest that you pursue your interests (working with kids with special needs) in a way where you could do more. Example, starting a small organization of people that find joy in working with these kids. You could build up this into a fully functional nonprofit and feel accomplished as an ENTJ. \n\nThis is my hot take as an ENTJ with ambitions.
1	All sound like crappy options at least to me. I write code for a living and I don't need any of the stinking papers though my BS degree did help. Ugh, why can't you just teach? What a retarded system. Maybe work for a private school or teach kids of wealthy clients?\n\nAlternatively:\n\n1. Start a YT channel.\n2. Find a husband who brings real money as in > 100k\n3. Make love, make kids\n4. Do what you love\n\nAlternatively:\n\nGet a well paying (as in 100k+) job at a hedge fund. Make your own babies. Pour your heart into motherhood.\n
7	Jet's MBTI - Cast Podcast	Hey Reddit, my name is jetplane48 (ESTP 7w8 sx/sp) and I am starting up a podcast in relation to MBTI. Fundamentally, the goal of the podcast is to educate the viewers of several Typology systems through a series of one-on-one's with others who are interested in the same topics. I have been conducting interviews for many years (MBTI related) and this is just an extension of that, however, I want to discuss topics that the audience wants me to cover. Naturally, I'll come up with my own material but I would love to explore topics that others have in mind. I am busy with school for the next few months but when I finish, the goal is to eventually be more consistent with these podcast uploads if this turns out to be popular enough. I'm very excited to get this started, and let's see some questions!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAR20eDTSOg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAR20eDTSOg)\n\n&#x200B;
1	When you finish up school and are ready to burn some rubber hit me up. 
7	What is your enneagram?	So what are your folks ennegram here?\n\nI am a 3w2 351 so/sx\n\nI am wondering how many other 3w2 or even 3w4s there are here.

1	 **8w7** 
48	The Super ENTJ: Trick list	I was curious what other ENTJs learned through their growth and development.  Please share your insights.  I've listed a few of mine.\n\n1. Stay reserved.  People already are intimidated by you, when you argue with someone it will crush them.  Use silence and body language more often than words.\n2. Focus on one goal that matters most to you and let that be the basis of everything you do, never forget the main goal and see how everyone fits into that one goal.\n3. Read as much as possible to equip yourself with knowledge and strategy.  Especially The Art of War by Sun Tzu.\n4. When you interact with people, realize that everyone has a skill and admire that skill when you speak with them.\n5. Stay sober, you have way too much confidence and have no problems being sociable and you're too focused on goals to be distracted by drugs or alcohol.\n6. Hit the gym everyday.\n7. Meditate on the goal you want to achieve and envision it coming true.  Usually I do it throughout the day, but it's most effective when I dedicate time towards it.  There is always an answer to a question after these meditations but I can never seem to put into words the question or the answer, it's abstract.\n8. Spend time in nature to fulfill some emotional need that we lack from human interaction.  Again this one seems like a waste of time before getting there, but once you're there you understand there is some part of you that is missing, the Sensing or Feeling side and nature takes care of that pretty well.  Especially basking in sunlight.\n9. Sometimes doing nothing and/or walking away is the best move.  "If it is to your advantage, make a forward move; if not, stay where you are." - Sun Tzu from The Art of War.\n10. To-do lists are your bread and butter.  Check them off on the reg.\n11. Minimize, simplify, and consolidate as much as possible.  You have lofty goals and not enough time.  It's as simple as deleting phone numbers, downsizing your wardrobe, getting rid of unnecessary monthly subscriptions.\n12. Delegate often.  We are tempted to micromanage everything (because we're so god damn efficient) however your employees will hate you for it and this will cause disturbance in the harmony of the team, which will effect the bottom line and the quality of the product or service.\n13. Master learning the other MTBIs in order to recruit the right team players and communicate more effectively.  Also can be used to help others achieve their goals.\n14. Use your NT to hone in on indicators of emotions because you obviously cannot feel them as much as others.  But to get by and not come off as some cold blooded ruthless asshole, you can learn to react and set someone at ease by using logic.  Making people feel good helps you in the end and you gain more support to further your cause.\n15. Good work needs to be inspired, encouraged, and nurtured.  It doesn't hurt but actually helps saying "Thank you" or "Good Job" just a bit more often.\n16. The last and ultimate one is to accept that it is lonely at the top.  Realize that YOU are your own audience.  Your job is to lead and move your cause forward.  Relaxation is when things are going according to plan.
18	Listen to listen, do not wait to talk. Assume the other person knows something that you don't.\n\nGoing to reinforce the gym part too.
8	I’m a young ENTJ. This is like gold to me. Great post!
5	The number 4 is a very powerful social tool that many ENTJs seem to never have discovered.
6	Entj 3w2 here.\n\nControl your power and learn to control your te. Use charm instead of power.\n\nTalk about others rather then your own interests and topics. Ask them what they are interested in and talk about it.\n\nVolunteer build a base.\n\nLearn to take charge when delegated to you. Earn your way up. Ambition is good though. Ask for more opportunities.\n\n\nHoney is sweet so use it. I don’t mean that literally. Be nice to people. And you’ll get what you want. Be humble about yourself. If you are not you end up like r/iamverysmart not cool at all.\n\nBe able to do some self reflection, it is healthy, have time for yourself.\n\nLearn to mentally organize and keep a list of what you need to do.\n\nyeah.....
4	All of these are great. I may need help with letting others in however as I am a sp/sx 8w7/ENTJ.\n\nI distrust others, push them away, and I suppose it is the incompetence and the lack of payoff from allowing them to funnel my emotions until it spills everywhere (so to speak). \n\nBut that’s why I add this:\n\n16. Remember that 9 times out of 10, people want something and they will hurt you to get it. 
4	14. Figure out your Enneagram as soon as possible.
7	I agree with all the above 1000%, especially the gym part. Over the past 2 years, I have recently been more consistent with working out and it has only done wonders to my productivity. The benefits flow well past the physical/health aspect, into the emotional, social, and mental as well.\n\nFor ENTJs here that still have not made this a part of their lifestyle, all i can say is this: the sooner you break that barrier keeping you from working out consistently, the sooner you can reach that new, better, higher level of you.\n\nJust my $ 0.02 :)
2	Completely agree with this; Started doing number 6 about a year ago and I feel incredible, I have so much more energy and feel like I can conquer the world. \nI would add; Reflection - spend some time each day or week to reflect on the actions you took and their outcomes, understand what went wrong and how you can improve on them. \n\nBonus point ; - Routine - my old house master at school would always say “Get into your routine & stick to it”. Years after finishing high school and into my first job I still follow this principle and it does wonders with getting things done. Switch it up every now and then so you don’t get bored
7	What is your view on ESFPs?	Hey! \n\nSo i was wondering....I have this ESFP friend and the more I get to know her the less I like her.\nShe is really cold sometimes and hurts our ISFJ friend on a daily basis. \n\nBut at the same time she is hurt sooo easily.\n\nFor example: I was talking to a person and she apparently said something to me but I overheard her.\nAnd then she got really sad and said that I ,,ignored" her on purpose and stuff like that.\nI apologized over and over but she didnt seem to understand.\n\nAnyways, now to my questions:\n\nDo you have ESFP friends/family?\n\nIf so, what do/dont you like about them? \n\nHave you had similar experiences?
6	ESFPs like shiny, flashy stuff (and people). They are usually people-people (waaaaaay more extroverted than me) and will 100% use people for their own ends. They may not admit it, but they will always assess how their friends/lovers/etc make them appear to the outside world. They are not particularly honest and are good at recognizing what outcome would make them look best. They tend to have an incredible, soothing bedside manner when they decide to put their mind to it (I've known ESFP doctors). They are highly sensitive to criticism of any kind, but they eat up compliments also. Their mutual love of biology/animals makes them pretty interesting to talk to.\n\nI'm curious why this ESFP is freezing out your ISFJ friend - ESFPs are very social and aware people so I suspect it's intentional. On the other hand, ISFJs can be a little overly sensitive to not being trusted/part of the group... And finally, maybe they are playing tug-o-war over you: your time and your attention. Especially since they are complaining about each other to you.
5	My mom is an esfp...fucking sucks I know.
3	Depends if they are healthy or not. I tend to get along with them, but I usually hang out with them a few at a time. I think ESFPs are good if they are mature.
1	lowkey shitty people, but love them. bring out the best in me
22	Realization that I am not that special.	I used to think that I am special because of large amounts of domestic violence and being unloved as a child.\n\nBut today I realized that my functions are TeNi and not NiTe, so I am ENTJ instead of INTJ. Although both are about as rare, I used introversion as a cope with nobody wanting to talk to me as a kid. I always dumped weird scientific shit on other people and makes sense why I am emotionally neglected, because nobody can handle a person like this.\n\nSo I guess I have to swallow the hard pill that I am actually less than average, as opposed to being more than average.
12	What dude, because you are NOT special it means there are others like you. 
10	I hope you know now how loved you are! And if not, that you come to discover it. It is a monstrously Herculean trial when parents have abused their role in showing one what love looks like. 
3	> So I guess I have to swallow the hard pill that I am actually less than average, as opposed to being more than average.\n\nIs that so?\n\nYou are not special because you are a mortal bipedal mammal just like the other 7 billion, but maybe a little different.\n\nYour brain is small; it can easily fit in a medium size skillet and it draws a meager 100 Watts of power, which is like 3 energy efficient light bulbs. Just like the light bulbs, your brain is not even "on" all the time. A freaking toaster will put you to shame.\n\nThe universe on the other hand is infinite and the exponential complexity that we are surrounded is tough.\n\nIn other words - you are dumb, I am dumb, we are dumb. Nobel prize winners are dumb. You probably are not going to be the smartest or the richest or the wisest person on this planet. The odds are way against you.\n\nSo you are not special in that regard.\n\nIn terms of loving yourself regardless - you HAVE to work at it regardless of how un-special you may be. The internet is full of advice - mostly bad but also good. Get after it!\n\nIf you don't help yourself, nobody will. You can use assistance but you are an author of your life. Less so in the beginning but then you gradually get a lot more control over it. Also depends on how consistently you work at it.\n
2	We are smaller than small. In the grandness of everything. The fact that we are as advanced as we are is pretty special. You are special because you are you. No one will every be you.  \n\nI had a interesting childhood. I used to think I was special for that. But everyone has something interesting about them.  I’m no more special than you.  We are all the same.  This understanding helped me love others more and to stop being so narcissistic. \n\nRemember you are special bc your human not because of your experiences. 
1	I don't think I understand your predicament very well. You thought you were special because you identified as an introvert? 
1	Nothing is special and nothing is unspecial. You choose your destiny for a big part of it. A genuis can waste their talents by being lazy and stuck in their heads and yet someone who hones their skills can beat the odds and surprise ppl. It's all about what you will yourself to be.
1	Meh, I'd say that this self-realization alone makes you better than most of Humanity. Good work, Dude.
1	I think one of the strengths of being an entire is that so many of us come to the realization that we're not "special", but that we have a drive to become special. We're driven to become leaders and take a leading role in our lives and environments.\n\n
1	If you’re using the functions, consider that your introverted ‘depressed ‘ state may have been intp mirror (esfj inverse).  Or isfp which is the inversion of entj.\n\nIf you really believed yourself to have been accurately typed as an intj... you could consider the mirror and inversions of those related types.  So that would be esfp inverse, entp mirror or Isfj inverse mirror .\n\nIn terms of the cognitive functions however, entj and intj reference separate quadrants.\n\nEntj vs intj? - drink some caffeine.  \nAre you still ‘introverted’?  - probably an entj.\nAre you much more extroverted (and humorous)?  - probably intj.
1	I know what you are talking about I am an entj 3w2. In my teenage years i thought I was oh so special.. I relate a lot to young voldemort. Haha!\n\nBut I suppose being in the real world long enough tells you that being a entj or even Ntj or nt type doesn’t really honestly mean you’re special or whatever. It’s a stereotype. I have my talents but so does everyone else. . Even my ESTJ professor. Or this ISTJ computer guy I know. It means you have ni and te. Forget the stereotypes understand yourself. Actually being humble has done me a lot of good. I work best as a 3 that way. It doesn’t mean I am not ambitious but I am not boastful or try not to be.\n\nWe have our gift but that gift is not any more or any less then say si and fe. So yeah.
7	I just want somebody to understand me.	Hey everyone!\n\nSo...lately Ive been thinking a lot about my friendships and such....and I realised that there is literally no one in my circle of friends that really ,,understands" me.\n\nIve faked a good amount of personalities in my life (even though Im only in high school).\n\nNobody except  one person (that isnt family) knows/knew almost my ,,real me" and that person is/was my INTJ best friend. Unfortunately we decided to go our seperate ways now that she has a boyfriend.\nIts really frustrating that I could/can never be the person I actually am....if I am (or try to be at least) people say Im ,,intimidating and rude" and I just dont get it....I get along with a lot of people but only because Im just TRYING SO HARD to be someone Im not.\n\nI am really looking for a genuine friend that I can be myself around and that I can just have debates with without having to fight...somebody that challenges me and my intellect but its so hard (especially at that age).\n\nIve never talked to anyone about this (except my mum) because no one would understand why. \nI expect them (especially my current ESFJ ,,friend") to say something like ,,just be yourself".\nWell guess what I tried and NOBODY liked me. Of course Ive changed as I got older and there were two people that really liked me the way I was (said INTJ friend and my former ENTP friend).\n\nI dont even know why Im writing this but I just want to put this out there and...I dont know....motivate you to maybe share your own stories or experiences or maybe even some tipps.\n\nHave a nice day!
5	\nTo optimize your frog kissing strategy, more info is needed.\n\nAbout what age?\n\nAre you a student? A professional?\n\nAre you looking for female or male friends? Honest question; no agenda there.\n
3	I read in the other comment thread that you are 16 so my tips to you is: instead of “be yourself” try “become your best self”. \n\nEvery day, for 5 minutes, work to increase your clarity. If you can do it twice a day (when you wake up, when you go to sleep) do it. \n\nImagine who you want to become. The very best version of you. And then focus on becoming that person. \n\nTough love - most of your childhood friends do not accompany you on your journey of life. Give it 10 years and you might not even be talking to a single one of them anymore. \n\nThat’s fine. Starting in the same place doesn’t mean you’re going in the same direction. \n\nFind people who are going in the same direction as you and become allies. \n\nMaking friends takes a lot of work from both sides. So it’s better if you’re working towards the same goals and if you both have strong reasons WHY. \n\nI’ve told you all this and it may or may not help you. The only way for you to find out isn’t to just read this, but to go and implement it and see for yourself. \n\nThe first and most important step is clarity. Get clarity, and you will know what you need to do. \n\n😎🔥🔥🔥\n\nKeep going! Taste victory 💪
2	INTP.\nI'm down.\nThe rare chances I get to talk one on one with an ENTJ is always fun.
2	You’re welcome to message me.\n\nI am an entj 26. And I know what it is like I describe me being younger as a young voldemort. Hahaha!\n\nHigh school is certainly no fun, university..... yeah, not really. I am still in it it’s my 8th year.\n\n\nBut my advice is this, do you know anyone older? I would aim for friends who are oldre. I never got on with anyone my age, I still don’t there’s a few more now I am 26, but a majority of my friends are above 40 maybe even 50s. I hang out with older people. I built a large internet base as a teenager and just never liked most of it. I did it because I was lonely. But find people who can except you. I always found company of older people to work as I said.\n\nI would say try to work on controlling your te. That’s really important. I have a lot of te and it’s really noticeable but I am really controled with it. Often sweetness will get you what you want. I am a 3w2 though. So yeah.\n\nDon’t worry about people at school that much, make your friends with older people, around the neighborhood and beyond. Just say hi and talk to them. I found that I always related to topics of those people who are older.\n\nAlso, I would say that talk about what people want to talk about and talk with them and add in your own topic as subtopics. But find people with similar interests as you.
1	Once you realize you are your own audience, things will click for you.  
21	How to deal with being intimidating as an ENTJ female?	A very close friend of mine told me that I can come off across as really offensive with my jokes (my humour is incredibly dry) and while my friends get it's just my sarcastic nature, apparently I can come off across as really scary and intimidating. I'm honestly very used to being told I can be intimidating at first, but for some reason, hearing it from a friend of mine worried me.\n\nIn college, I'm always in a situation where I'm managing people and it's a little worrisome to know that what I thought was me being more casual and personal with my team by joking around could've been taken as me being offensive to them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo fellow ENTJ females: What's a few main factors or traits of your personality that you realise is what people can find 'scary' or 'intimidating'? How do you work around that without compromising yourself?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
16	30f and I got this same feedback from my bosses and peers since 22, until recent years.\n\nWhat I did was alter my value system so that I truly 100% believed the way I make others around me feel is high priority. When you change your internal value system your personality will change to reflect that. \n\nAs a result these are some of the things I do more now: \n- Remember people’s name and use it. \n- You are probably awesome at a lot of things. When people seek you for advice go the extra mile to help them. Your goal here is to balance your personality by earning a reputation that you are super helpful and selfless. Aggressive but helpful people are often liked. Plus helping people is good and doing good makes you feel good.\n- Unless you know your peers love to do it, stop arguing for the sake of arguing for stuff that doesn’t matter. That way when you actually stand for something it will seem more like the thing is important and less that your personality is aggressive. \n- Take mental note of what the person you are talking to values and use that to find common ground. As an ENTJ trying to sell might come naturally to you. \n\nSorry it’s shitty, but recognize you are female and social rules are working against you. You’ll have to bend a bit if you want to not appear aggressive. I dress pretty and deliberately look feminine for personality balance.\n\nThis being said, I did the above and still feel that I’m very true to who I am. I am still a take-charge & get shit done lady. \n\nI see the modifications as signs of maturity and have been really rewarded by them. 
6	ENTJ male here, also college age.\nPeople find me intimidating also. I struggle to form friendships if the person in question is not equally commanding and confident.\n\nOlder people tend to lean towards young entj’s for assigning responsibility and opportunity, whether it be job opportunities or positions of power.\n\nOn the downside my friends/colleagues go wide-eyed and recoil into their skin when I disagree or push a point.\n\nI have a fix however!\nYou can harness the efforts and abilities of those who are shy and nervous.\nOffer them praise and use your dominance in an audience to set the stage for those who are shy.\nOffer them encouragement when they begin to faulter or freak out.\nOnce they are finished what they are saying or doing, let them know it is great that they voiced their thoughts and ask them why they think this or how they can improve or incorporate them into the outcome.\n\nThis has built many of my friendships.\n\n\nI must ask something of you now,  how can I not intimidate women and allow myself to relax and enjoy them?\n
3	Let empathy overrule efficiency once in awhile. I know it hurts but it’s like ripping off a bandaid. 
2	Why does it matter if you're a female or male?  Both male and female ENTJ's have this issue and so I'm going to go ahead and answer this for you.  The key is to learn each person's characteristics and how to communicate with them in their own way.  Read up on the other MTBIs so you can quickly categorize people when you communicate with them.  You're not going to be too far off.  Here's some examples.   \nISTP: "Hey I know you probably already figured out why this error occurred, can you catch me up on it?"  \nISTJ: "From your analysis what caused this error?"   \nESFJ: "Hi how are you? BTW what caused this error here?"  \nENTJ: "Hey you fucked up here, was just wondering why?"  \nENTP: "I'm sure there are different possibilities to this but what's the most likely reason we fucked up here?"  \nESTJ:  "We need to look like professionals here, why did this mess up?"  \nINTP: "What is the best method to fixing this error?"  \n\n\nYou get the idea.  We need to tailor our communication efforts to inspire and encourage, not demoralize our team even though we really want to say "A 5 year old child could have fixed this, or even a monkey." :)
1	Hey!\n16 year old ENTJ female here and....I don't know if this helps but what I realised is that because of the ,,I want this done and I want this done my way" ENTJ's can sometimes come around really bossy. (Probably something all of you know)\nI work really efficiently and sometimes I get a bit ,,passive aggressive" when people work really slow or inefficient.\nOther than that I think because we sometimes struggle to keep the emotions of others in mind people also find us intimidating.\n\nSo what I do to save my image is that I tried(try) to do more smalltalk....even though I really suck at that.\nBut other than that I really don't know how to solve this problem.....\n\n(Sry for any grammatical/spelling errors English isn't my first language)
1	I've been told I'm courageous and fearless. I've also been told I have no sense of danger or self-preservation.\n\nI imagine all of these can come across as intimidating. Sort of like someone who plays chicken by throwing the steering wheel out the window
1	Situational awareness and spot the quiet person who has something to chime in or you know has something to add that interesting, assertively get the floor and then immediately state you want to hear from this person on that point.  I get their buyin before I do this real quick.  But basically I just use my exertion to make sure everyone contributes to a conversation instead of monopolizing the conversation.  I can be myself proper ENTJ style and even intimidating but it’s a good leadership style cause it promotes teamwork and gets people out of their shell.   I save my comment (which I try to make under 2 sentences) till the end, gives me a chance integrate other peoples points and make a more big picture dissection of the subject.   I have been told people appreciate this.   
1	One of the most important things I learned in my first few years of adulthood was to hold my sense of humor back. Not everyone has the same sense of humor as you do. Dry humor makes some people laugh, some people feel stupid and made fun of, and others think you are just dumb. That's ok - it just took some practice and thinking before speaking to be more sincere in my professional interactions.\n\nThinking before speaking will be your best friend. ENTJs are good at reading people, but we tend to assume that we've already thought of every possibility and have set up Plans A,B,C. Which, to be fair, we're really good at.\n\nI try to emulate an amazing professor I once had. Sometimes people would raise their hand and say something that, to me, felt completely off topic and out of nowhere. I would be reeling at how they even thought of what they said. The professor, however, would respond by thinking hard, considering what they said, and then slowly relating what they said to the conversation at hand, adding "I think this is what you're saying, tell me if I'm wrong here." Somehow, every time, he made the incomprehensible comment relevant to the topic and managed to unearth what the student was probably asking or commenting on. The way he went about it made the student feel empowered, like what they said was really smart, and probably taught them over time how to more carefully word what they said. Whereas, had I been the professor, I think I would have just been confused and wondered why the student asked something so out of left field. \n\nThis skill is hard to see, but I think it's valuable because it makes others feel valued. Not everyone is well spoken or knows how to say what they really mean. If you can bridge what they are saying by considering it in the **context** of what the group is discussing, you can lead in a way that makes everyone feel empowered and respected instead of forgotten or misunderstood.
0	I get this but I don’t really. I use a lot of charm and wit and charisma. I am a 3w2 so I use my people skills. I’ve also asked whys when people have said stuff like that a few years back. I’ve really toned down my te. I don’t mind not being leader or boss. I serve at the bottom and try to stay humble be helpful and I guess remember people is kind of the way to get stuff done.\n\nI also try if I lead to let people help me I come up with ideas ask what they would like and combine them and say well why don’t you do this and that and such. Since they helped me they’re a bit more willing to oblige.
1	What duality can teach us about ourselves	[http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/content.php/374-Duality-Relations-ISFj-and-ENTj-by-Stratiyevskaya](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/content.php/374-Duality-Relations-ISFj-and-ENTj-by-Stratiyevskaya)\n\nI do need to clarify a few points first though.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not trying to promote the worth of a certain pairing. Rather I found that it's a great read to learn about yourself and what your needs and wants are. To be honest most ISFPs I've known were retards unwilling to learn anything and generally lazy, self destructive. If you're in a couple with one of the good ones, consider yourself lucky. Don't fucking stay in a unhealthy relationship with an ISFP, it will fuck you up. Duality basically means you give your car keys to your dual and trust them to drive safely while you sleep in the passenger sit without the safety belt.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSocionics is hard to accept. I know, it took me a year to even consider it as more than a fancy horoscope. But I did the study, the experimentations and it revealed scarily accurate. It's not a perfect "science" as you'd imagine. There is no warning about how duality can be a bad thing for exemple. It's something I had to learn myself. It works as a base in that sense.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would suggest you to read it only if you're 100% sure you're indeed a logical intuitive extrovert and not just someone who works a lot. MBTI ENTJ is different from Socionics ENTJ. You will only create confusion for yourself if you're not certain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy last point is that I'd like you to consider the value of this text. If time is money... Well this might save you a long and costly journey of self discovery.
2	Yeah, well I love sfps in general way too many sfps as friends. ESFP more then ISFP. Unfortunately the only isfp I dated and I didn’t date him because he was isfp, was really truly unhealthy! He was unhealthy and immature even non-mbti standards I didn’t see it for a while because he was great at pretending he was. But yeah. I actually didn’t know he was isfp until we parted ways for a while. He took a test and got isfp and then everything just clicked. Of course he is. I wasn’t good at typing then.
2	Both my high school boyfriend and high school best friend were ENTJs. Easy and natural pairing.
2	> To be honest most ISFPs I've known were retards unwilling to learn anything and generally lazy, self destructive.\n\nIt's much easier to judge these people rather than understand how they work.\n\nSocionics only work after you've reached a certain point in the individuation progress, you realise your weaknesses instead of project it onto others, you respect that aspect from the ISFP. Same quadra relationships require a lot of vulnerability and sometimes very painful because you have to accept your shadow to make it work.\n\nIf you want an easy one, watch CS.joseph and consider shadow relationship(contrary). IRL most marriage around me that I've observed are from opposite quadra, you just have to accept the other person differences instead of accepting your dark side. In this kind of marriage, deeply inside no one respect their spouse but still able to work because all the needs are fulfiled.\n\nBut high effort include many rewards tho, you'll learn a lot from it, also having a SO who have a similar thought process with you makes it easier when you're both in the same team

18	How to chill out / relax / switch off	Hey fellow ENTJs. I have noticed that I have trouble switching off and doing things that are not directly contributing to some productive goal. The one thing I can do to relax is read reddit because it's easier to slip into but other activities not so much. For example when I think about watching a movie or playing a video game it seems like quite a largetime commitment for something I know will not get me closer to achieving my goals at work, home or otherwise. My girlfriend could convince me to watch something with her because then I see it as an activity contributing to our relationship goals but I would never watch a movie on my own. In that situation I'm not really switching off, I'm thinking about her having a good time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI realise there is value in switching off because it gives you new energy, life and creative ideas to bring to your work. It's also just not healthy to go without it. So my question is:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow do you relax and disconnect without lingering thoughts of work or other goals?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance.
14	pot 
4	I plan vacations to relax. \nYes, the planning is relaxing.
3	It may just be that you don’t get as much out of most films or mainstream entertainment as other people do. My INTP SO and I rarely watch them, each preferring to be engrossed in our own projects or each other. Every once in a while we’ll get sucked into a game we like, but that’s pretty rare. The last game he got really hooked on was Portal, mine was Zelda: Skyward Sword. Lol \n\nIn general, our hobbies have purpose outside of just relaxation; they usually involve self-improvement, mind-expansion, or skill building of some kind. These activities help me relax, anything else just feels like I’m numbing myself for the most part.
2	When I say I’m stressed about work and people say I should take a break and relax, I say that getting my work done is the best way to relieve my stress!
1	Hmm, tough one; Happends the same to me.\nJust learn how to relax and just get off of that “work mode” that bothers us a lot.\nIn my case, I’ve developed my own way to actually relax about it and postpone the “work” or the frustration for work that I have, and just chill with my family as we should do. We as ENTJ’s have the fame of being overworking sometimes and yeah, it’s true, but too much of something is bad. We may be super focused and intelligent, but don’t take life so seriously (talking about work), just take a more chilled vibe; you’ll notice the difference right away, and automatically, you’ll seek more quality time with your loved ones.
1	Date
1	[daily routine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQCFdcEXknc) to take the edge off
1	When I'm feeling the need to date or give in to "balance",  alcohol helps me turn my ENTJ into an ESTP, although very rarely do I drink.\n\nBut that was yesterday.  Today I am reading up on all other MTBIs to take this shit over.\n\nFor the the rest of the time I meditate on my goals, work out at the gym, or usually read.  Here are some of my book recommendations.\n\n1. The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand\n2. Einstein by Walter Isaacson\n3. Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham\n4. Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow series by Orson Scott Card\n5. Mastery by Robert Greene\n6. 1984 by George Orwell\n7. The Art of War by Sun Tzu\n8. High Output Management by Andrew S. Grove\n9. The Foundation by Isaac Asimov\n10. Letters from a Stoic by Seneca\n11. Geneology of Morals by Nietzsche\n\nReading is a passive activity enough to chill out while still helping you become skillful to help you with goals in real life.
1	That's about the one thing we can't do well.  Change is as good as a rest - you won't be happy if you aren't doing something; the answer is to do something different.
1	For me I use my creative outlets as my relaxation. This way I feel like I’m putting my time towards my creativity goals but I still find making art/music very relaxing. Or sometimes if that even feels to taxing I’ll read self help books or other books or Reddit because then I feel like I’m improving my vocabulary and brainpower etc. 
1	I study stuff on the internet pretty much turning in to an intj. Like now. Sit here and study something mbti, christian apologetics, politics, etc. You name it I get to research endulge my 5 hahaha! I think they call that inner child hahaha! really it’s fun and it’s relaxing. And then I talk about it with other people. I also read the news and make comments on twitter. I do social media. Facebook posting looking through people’s posts on there. Stuff of that nature.!
28	YES, ENTJs CAN BE BAD AT _______.	We see these posts constantly. Yes it is possible for individual ENTJs to be good, bad, mediocre at ANYTHING. Myers-Briggs is not a catch-all box that we all fit into. 
61	…what they don't have interest in.
20	Being empathetic and considerate of their own feelings or the feelings of others \n\nWe‘re bad at it, but I’m not bothered by that 
8	Emotional labour 
8	Explaining our entire train of thought with all of the facts and experiences that have led us to a well-founded conclusion that to others seems contrived or false.
8	Following incompetent leadership (respecting command just for institutional/tradition’s sake).  Example would be a private in the military.  I imagine there would be a pull towards going rogue on somethings because they don’t want to carry out orders if the task could be improved or made more efficient.   If all privates did the military would not function, you need people to be 100% followers.  To some people they like that and don’t want a say in the decision.  ENTJ would piss people off and would be consistently punished for being themselves in that setting. 
4	Gymnastics and talking about somthing that don’t interest me in my freetime
3	Bad at being bad at anything
5	handling negative emotions.

1	Oh yeah, I’m sure about what you said about MBTI; being ENTJ doesn’t mean we are good at math or physics or anything, that is more personal stuff.\nI’m bad at drawing, designing and making artistical stuff, like sculpting and that stuff, argh, I just don’t have the gift and I neither enjoy it at all.\nAlso I’m not good playing soccer, and I don’t enjoy it either; I didn’t developed that soccer side.

1	being bad
1	Criticism for me . 
1	I got one for you bad at being the ceo hahahaha! I dont’ think all of us entjs are ment to be CEOs I for one have no real interest of owning a business. I am a political minded person. I am studying to be in service to the country may run for senate or congress sseats. But ceo and business isn’t my forte. And making every entj a ceo I don’t know about that.\n\nI agree with you totally these stereotypes are really bad this is why I don’t like the main mbti communities really. I am now avoiding r/mbti really. Me and another member on here started a more serious, more scholarly if you will, higher quality of posts, and less dramatic one. So yeah. We actually have quite a few takers. I think personally the entj worship is poison. It’s really bad. We’re entjs. We’re not Gods. We are humans. We are like those other types. Like being you stop like being us. Because I am not you and neither are you me.
5	Fight club	So I watched the movie above, every time I watch it i get this high about how life actually could become interesting. I analyze the shit out of every scene so I can apply it to my real life. Im 17 and I dont have a job, im not even in the ratrace yet but i still want to avoid the horrible lifestyle people get stuck in. I have been thinking for hours about what jobs that could give the same meaning and adrenaline as setting up fightclubs all over the country. The closest I’ve came across is to become a pickup-artist or to become a soldier and go to war. But Im sure there is more, so I need your help to find more of these adrenaline-giving jobs that dont involve breaking the law. And please, dont mention bungee jump instructor or some lame shit like that.
7	First of all, please take every media that shows "office life" with a grain of salt. While they are entertaining and sometimes hit the mark they are written by people who *don't* enjoy the office environment. Also every office is different and it really depends on management and the other people around you whether it's good or bad.\n\nAs for the "job that gives you an adrenaline rush" I would say it's highly dependent on you and your interest. I feel an adrenaline rush when I'm starting to figure out how to solve an issue in my code, even though physically I'm just sitting in a chair in front of my computer.\n\nAlso as a woman: please don't even consider pick-up artist. Thanks. 
5	I’m an ENTP and joined the army hoping to be killed in a war.\n\nSurvived, sadly enough. Turns out war is boredom and discomfort mostly.\n\nYou are, in fact, doomed to boredom and discomfort wherever you go or whatever you do.\n\nSorry about your luck.
4	I've found life is better when you have people around you who care about you and vice versa. The Fight Club and war crap are fantasies that amp you up but leave you nowhere. \n\nYou're not doomed to a life in a cubicle either. Figure out where you want to get to and make plans to reach it. Financial Independence is a realistic goal in a decade for a middle class income if you're smart about it.
5	Firefighter, rescue diver\n\nI’ll ignore the social criticisms of PUA because there are plenty of people to tell you all about that. On adrenaline and excitement, it wears off quickly. I was into PUA in college and cold approached somewhere from 500-1000 women. Yes there was excitement, hilarious moments, and personal growth, but it’s not sustainably fulfilling for the thrill-seeker. You become immune to the sting of social rejection and realize that socializing really isn’t a big deal.

1	Yeah, not sure if that’s the best idea. Honestly if you need someone to talk to I guess I can help haha! But seriously just try to learn from something more useful. Get friends, learn about society, I got in to politics when I was your age, now play in it hahahaha! You don’t have to though. Pick out what you like and study it. Knowledge is power. Haha! I don’t know if I’d base your character or life over a tv show..
4	Can an ENTJ be bad at leading?	Asking because I've never met an ENTJ online (not sure of offline) that claims to not really lead. Would you still care about leading if the matter at hand isn't something you are interested in/is important to you? For example, if a school project doesn't really affect your grades but you have to complete it, yet you just really don't give a fuck would you still lead and try to do it efficiently?\n\nAlso, are there any Te doms that can't command the group due to anxiety reasons etc, or do you suppress your emotions for the sake of the project? 
12	I am going to answer the title. ENTJs can be bad at leading.
5	> For example, if a school project doesn't really affect your grades but you have to complete it, yet you just really don't give a fuck would you still lead and try to do it efficiently? \n\n  This isn't a question of efficiency. It's a question of **priority & importance.**\n\n> Would you still care about leading if the matter at hand isn't something you are interested in/is important to you? For example, if a school project doesn't really affect your grades but you have to complete it, yet you just really don't give a fuck would you still lead and try to do it efficiently? \n\nBeing able to lead, and wanting to lead are two different parts. \n\nI think any type can lead, and any type can be bad at leading. \n\nIf leading has an emotional component due to the amount of feelers and high sensitivity - would an ENTJ still be good at leading? They can. It would depend on the ENTJ.\n\nFor myself, I don't put my self-interest and ego above the project. If someone can lead better or provide what's needed in the group dynamic, I don't see a problem whatsoever. 
2	I found leading hard due to other thinking and perfectionism. I'm never 100% sure of something and I worry I'll lead the group in the wrong direction. I'm better when given a task I can set my mind to and make perfect. 
2	I've met a lot of bad ENTJ leaders. Especially when they're young, they often care too much about having control and about appearances to really understand what's going on with their co-workers/friends/family. They usually overlook the individual and substitute with their own idea of perfection. Once they get past that though, they can be alright at leading 😉
1	I think I’m better at strategizing than leading. I can lead efficiently, but it’s a skill I developed with experience. I don’t relate to wanting to lead everything personally, but people in my life have admired or complained about how I take charge quickly in many situations.\n\nI don’t know if ENTJs are good or bad at leading generally. But I do think we’re good at solving problems and organizing people.
1	Take a good look at people in general in western society. Everyone can be anything, everyone's unique and good enough to do anything they'd like to. Everyone's a specialist of everything thanks to the internet, everyone's righteous because they're woke and informed. All you need to do is to believe in yourself. And you can certainly choose to follow someone you like over someone who appears competent. You can just deny reason and tell yourself you know better.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow do you think leadership matches with people who have no humility about themselves?
1	I don’t think they’re actually good at it particularly; some are and some aren’t.\n\nWhat they do is absolutely insist to their utmost to be in charge as far as possible. Sometimes the results are ridiculous or disastrous and sometimes they’re acceptable or even great.\n\nI just think of them as social bulldozers oriented first on their role in a group and second, on the effectiveness of whatever is going on.
1	[elected to lead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4tvZJGNIhM)\n
1	I think it depends on the person. Yes.\n\nI don’t always have to lead if there is already a competent leader there. If say an estj is doing the job just fine I’ll sit and watch and do the non-leading things. I run a sub on here it’s very new but out of us two I probably take backseat at the moment. I am a 3w2 I am letting the 8 be the boss I mean we are both mods but yeah. I could do more but I am also busy and my ni is curious. Haha! I think I am actually closer to a ni subtype now I think of it. I don’t know though. I am not as controling or intimidating as some are. I think it’s my tritype. I don’t have an 8 to speak of. I am a 351 and probably actually so/sp so yeah.
1	We're shit at leading the things we don't care about. Plain and simple.
9	Musical Tyrants	ENTP here. Lovely sub. Thanks for having me.\n\nDo any of you play musical instruments?\nHow important is music to you (how often do you listen, etc)?\nWhat sort of music do you listen to?\n\nThank you for completing the questionnaire. 
3	Your question intrigues me J\_The\_Conqueror, so I had to do a little digging.\n\nYou see, I myself love music and have played a few instruments (mainly piano and organ). I was mainly intrigued, however, because I seriously doubted a MBTI personality itself would lead someone to like a particular instrument or type of music. However, it seems like a fun idea and maybe, just maybe, if you had a large enough sample size (I'm talking 1000s of people), you might get some statistically significant correlation.\n\nSo I did some looking. Turns out this is a question Redditors enjoy asking. For instance:\n\n* [ENTJs and music](https://www.reddit.com/r/entj/comments/681prt/entjs_and_music/)\n* [ENTJ music tastes](https://www.reddit.com/r/entj/comments/8cghzf/entj_music_taste/)\n* [Are you guys musicians?](https://www.reddit.com/r/entj/comments/2t1zly/any_of_you_guys_musicians/)\n\nOf course, these are rather small sample sizes and doesn't really get far with any serious conclusion. Besides, we could take this question a step further and figure out if ***any*** personality types correlate with musical instrument or a favorite music genre. However, for this we would need to go beyond the scope of what Reddit is equipped to do. \n\n[A study from the University of Miami](https://scholarlyrepository.miami.edu/dissertations/1937/) looked at "the relationship between personality type and instrument played in undergraduate music majors." Unfortunately, they found that there wasn't any pattern of similarity within the different instrumental groups with regard to MBTI personality type. They did find that vocalists were more likely to be E than instrumentalists. I personally believe they didn't have enough people in their study to really draw any conclusions.\n\n[A researcher at Indiana University](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0022429410395579) did a study looking 355 high school students at two high schools and looked to see if there was any correlation with MBTI type and if their choice of either band, orchestra, choir, or none of the above. Turns out, yes there are some significant differences between the groups. Kind of. For example, choir students were more likely to be extraverted when compared to orchestra students. But before you get too excited, there "were no significant differences among the ensembles on the Sensing-Intuition, Thinking-Feeling, or Judging-Perceiving scales." That being said, these musical kids were more likely to be I and F when compared to non-music high schoolers. Also, when comparing to the non-music group, band kids are more likely to be P.\n\nIs this conclusive? No. Interesting? Heck yeah! Did I use this as an excuse to not study for my classes? Why yes, yes I did. 
3	I play guitar, bass, drums and little vocals. I enjoy all kind of rock and roll and metal. I think where the entj plays in my music is that I was the leader of my band and arranged all the gigs like a manager. 
3	I'm a professional musician, classical music is my genre of choice. I play the piano and have played since I was four, and I am an opera singer. I compose music also, though I haven't written any new songs in several years, haven't been inspired lately. I've been exclusively performing for the past while. Yes, I make good money doing it. \n\nI've thought about picking up more instruments, I'd love to learn violin and cello. \n\nI also love listening to music of various genres, really all kinds except country music which I can't stand. \n\nI've always had an affinity for music. It's a huge part of my life. \n\n"Musical Tyrant", lol that should be a sign on my wall at my office. 
2	I play some piano and guitar. I also do vocals. When I make music it is usually based on sounds that make me feel good. If someone else likes it, that’s great too. Hobby, not a moneymaker. It’s my SeFi playground. \n\nThat about sums it up from my perspective. 
2	I play violin, I’ve been playing for six years and I’m pretty good for playing that long (I think).\nI enjoy playing, especially in my school orchestra. I sit first chair which is like being a leader, which would be fun but my class totally sucks. \nMusic theory intrigues me, but I’m more interested in math/ science. \nI listen to music but prefer podcasts about politics, science or math. \nWhen I listen to music, I like a variety of genres, from electronic to classical to punk to indie to whatever came out in 2013. 
2	I sing, play piano, saxophone, uke, guitar, fife,  Banjo, on and on. Composed music too. I try to dabble in all areas of intellectual hobbies. My favorite composers are Mozart and Bach for their structure and technical perfection.
2	I played percussion in high school and used to own a drum set. I ended up selling it when I moved out of my parents’ house, but I miss it sometimes. Every now and then when I have access to a drum set I enjoy jamming out for a few minutes. \n\nBeing that I grew up in the 90s, I like alternative/rock bands like Red Hot Chili Peppers, Radiohead, Flaming Lips, Rage Against the Machine, Nine Inch Nails, Smashing Pumpkins, and many others. I’m also into hip hop from the 90s to today. I’m a fan of Kendrick Lamar, Drake, Dr. Dre, Tribe Called Quest, Kanye, Odd Future, Beastie Boys, A$AP Rocky, and more recently XXXTentacion and Lil Peep. In terms of other genres, I like Miles Davis, Stevie Wonder, Pink Floyd, African tribal drum music, angry female singer-songwriters of the 90s like Alanis and Jewel, and EDM acts like Daft Punk, Air, and Squarepusher. I like 90s pop and rock which are my specialty for singing karaoke, which I love and try to do every couple of months. I get a kick out of performing well and receiving compliments from strangers. \n\nMy interest in listening to music waxes and wanes. Sometimes I love it and listen to a ton, but other times I listen to podcasts or audiobooks. My interest in things in general tends to come in phases, where I’ll obsess over a new thing for awhile, abandon it for some other new thing to obsess over, and occasionally return to things. \n\nI like having variety when it comes to any kind of entertainment. I would say overall I’m more knowledgeable about movies than music. I find it fun to dive in deep into a specific artist or genre for awhile before moving on. 
2	I was going to lie about my music abilities but then I noticed your small entPenis sticking out. Ugh, waste of time ... \n\nGood question though\n
1	I am non-musical really but appreciate some music sometimes. Mostly old and softer stuff. But there’s a big variety there. I listen to most things before the 80s or 90s and some of it is 80s or 90s but much less. I listen to most softer sounding genres. Use to listen more. I don’t as much anymore. I also have phases when I do. Especially stress. I also listen to a lot of jazz fusion and stuff of that nature. Lots of gospel stuff these days.
3	ENTJs that are enneagrams 8 - can you relate?	&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/5gl5jd95lug21.jpg\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere's apparently a notable correlation between ENTJs and enneagrams 8.\n\nPersonally, the consistent references to how it all broke from the beginning (as a theme) doesn't quite do it for me since that can be applied to anyone.\n\nI think the 'broken'-focus of the song does speak to the *fragility of the inferior Fi* in ENTJs: the ability to compartmentalize, but all it takes is a hit to the Achilles heel for it potentially to destabilize everything and consequently a fear/above-average-caution of letting someone into your private emotional space.\n\nI find that, we, for the most part - seek safety and security (within our emotions) more than anything.\n\nI've bold the parts that spoke to me. Just wondering how many of you here see yourself in this song?\n\nI'd like this to become an open discussion of the moments in our childhood **cemented** who we are today.\n\n**Song:** [https://youtu.be/K99i5GF65to](https://youtu.be/K99i5GF65to)\n\n \n\n**Lyrics below:**\n\nI remember the minute  \nIt was like a switch was flipped-  \nI was just a kid who grew up strong enough  \nTo pick this armor up  \nAnd suddenly it fit\n\nGod, that was so long ago, long ago, long ago...  \nI was little, i was weak, perfectly naive  \nAnd i grew up too quick\n\nNow you won’t see all that i have to lose  \nAnd all I've lost in the fight to protect it  \nI won’t let you in. I swore never again-  \nI can't afford, no, I refuse to be rejected\n\nI want to break these bones 'til they're better  \nI want to break them right and feel alive  \nYou were wrong, you were wrong, you were wrong-  \nMy healing needed more than time\n\nWhen I see fragile things, helpless things, broken things  \nI see the familiar  \nI was little, I was weak, I was perfect too  \nNow i’m a broken mirror\n\nBut I can't let you see all that i have to lose  \nAll I've lost in the fight to protect it  \nI can't let you in- i swore never again  \nI can't afford to let myself be blindsided  \nI'm standing guard, I'm falling apart  \nAnd all i want is to trust you  \nShow me how to lay my sword down  \nFor long enough to let you through\n\nHere I am, pry me open  \nWhat do you want to know?  \nI’m just a kid who grew up scared enough  \nTo hold the door shut  \nAnd bury my innocence  \nBut here's a map, here's a shovel  \nHere’s my Achilles' heel\n\nI’m all in, palms out, i’m at your mercy now and i'm ready to begin  \nI am strong, i am strong, i am strong enough to let you in\n\n**I’ll shake the ground with all my might**  \n**I will pull my whole heart up to the surface**  \n**For the innocent, for the vulnerable**  \n**I'll show up on the front lines with a purpose**  \n**And i’ll give all i have, i'll give my blood, i'll give my sweat-**  \n**An ocean of tears will spill for what is broken**  \nI’m shattered porcelain, glued back together again  \nInvincible like I've never been
5	“I’m just a kid who grew up scared enough to hold the door shut.”\n\nI lost three of my closest friends before I turned eleven years old. I lost two of the last handful before I was sixteen. I lost my dearest uncle who was almost more than a father to me than my own father (because he spoke to me like an adult and didn’t treat me like a child) and I’ve had my house broken into while I was still inside with my brother. \n\nI am an ENTJ/8w7 sp-sx. And I’m sure that those moments in my life cemented that portion of who I am. \n\nI recall the first time I actually comprehended death and it was when I was young, 10?, and fully comprehended death in all of its sheer finality while watching a young minority child get run over by a SUV while trying to climb a fence. It rung so loudly that I’m sure that is also where a part of my sp 8 comes from. \n\nPair that with the inability to connect with others, and consistently being let down in finding others who were as genuine and smart as I (I’ve only met four other people personally whom have similar intellect) and you’ve got a good idea of the kind of person I may be today. Able to blend into the pack, take the spotlight, but lonely by choice and in disdain of those who are overly affectionate, vulnerable, dependent on others for validation, etc. \n
4	ENTJ 8 here, this song speaks to me so much. Especially this verse: \n“But I cant let you see all that I have to lose. \nAll I’ve lost in the fight to protect it.\nI cant let you in-I swore never again \nI cant afford to be blindsided....” \nThis gave me the chills, it is me to a T in relationships  \nThank you for sharing 
2	Sure, just have opened myself in a relationship (heart completely open, caution to the wind) and he messed me up- mentally. So now, I feel as if I need to protect who I let in my life- I’m afraid that I’ve built up all this confidence and courage, and I’ll meet someone like him who will tear it all down again. 
8	Question: When feelings overwhelm & take the lead of your “Thinking” personality trait, how do you regroup, function, & regain lost momentum?	This is to piggy-back off another post from earlier today re: productivity.\n\nTL;DR @ bottom\n\nMan, when I’m productive, I kick ass & take names.\n\nWhen I dip into the foreign territory of allowing the ooey-gooey “feelings” things to take control? Whole ‘nother animal. \n\nI usually just focus on what I’m doing. Feelings are irrelevant to getting the job done. Recently though, life threw me one curve ball after another. Seats were loaded, bases full, and there I  was ass-naked, unprotected from the elements, just striking out. \n\nLame, long-winded metaphors aside, I’ve recently learned that it is very, very hard to get back any kind of productive momentum once you’ve been slammed to a standstill. I was absolutely *hating* every second that I wasn’t doing, accomplishing, achieving, excelling, producing. That annoyance led to disappointment in not only the situation I was in, but also myself, as an individual. This negative perspective turned into a self-sustaining cycle. The lack of doing fed the lack of positivity, which fed the lack of doing, which fed... you catch my drift.\n\nAll this is to say that as an ENTJ, I know I can be a total productivity powerhouse. Usually, when I fall down - even when I fall *hard* - I get right back up, grinning at what the world is gonna try to tackle me with next. This time, though, when life shoved me down, I couldn’t get enough of a foothold to even try to get back up. Stupid learned helplessness shit.\n\nI know that ENTJ’s are renowned for pushing everything aside to get the job done both efficiently and thoroughly. However, as I’m still building my momentum from Life unrelentingly wailing on me, I’m curious to know: Do you think that once ENTJ’s get stuck in negativity and allow the Feelings (vs. Thinking) side to dominate & take control, is it more difficult for them to dig their way out?\n\nI know we ENTJ’s aren’t the best with feelings, & maybe if we were, it wouldn’t be as difficult to regain that lost momentum. \n\n**Main Question:** In moments when you’re stuck with a case of the Negative Feels & feeling like a foreigner in your own skin, unproductive & unmotivated, how do/did you get back your momentum? Did you hate every second of it like I have been? \n\nPlease share any & all stories or experiences you may have re: times when the F screwed over your T!\n\nOr who knows, maybe it’s just me?\n\n**TL;DR:** Productive as all hell until feelings overwhelm the thinking, then lost momentum is extremely hard to regain. F stole the thunder from my T.  DAE have this happen? How did you get back into your productive ass-kicking natural state of being? Please share any/all experiences.\n\n**Edit:** Just to clarify, I’ve never had this happen before. Sure, wind would get knocked outta my sails, but I’d always find a way to power through. It’s possible the “feelings” I referenced were actually a case of Clinical (and/or Situational?) Depression, but I don’t want to call it that. I don’t see myself as a depressed person, and I don’t want to start identifying with that any time soon. 
1	Being held accountable by others always keeps me on track. I lack self accountability so I push it onto others by telling them what I plan to do. I personally feel the pressure anf discipline myself to get it done.
1	I try to use music and to try not to think about it distract myself then get back on track.
8	Understanding some ENTJ (annoying) stuff	Reading trough some ENTJ descriptions, I found this on the personalityjunkie.com description of ENTJ:\n“Despite outer confidence and imposing presence, they are, on the whole, no more inwardly secure nor sure of themselves than other types. In fact, because their inner Judging function (Fi) is inferior, they may feel they have relatively little inner control.”\nWhat does this mean? Opinion needed; ENTJ’s needed.
6	If you feel you have little inner control, a reasonable reaction is to master the external world. Through efficiently and planned action. 
3	IMO Weak Fi means not really understanding the big picture in terms of why am I here and what is my true purpose, so compensating that with just pushing forward and getting more shit done.
2	TBH I do feel insecure time to time, but I don't let my feelings dictate my behaviour. So I may sometimes be seen as a petulant bastard but I prefer that than being called a little bitch. 
2	It means what it says. The kind of self mastering confidence you might associate with an ENTJ comes from Ni because "improved" Ni helps you restructure your own thought process and understand the ones of others. But we think of social sphere as you'd understand a coding script, it's a logical sequence, one thing leading to the next. \n\nFi is more of the human side of things. What someone wants or needs is all very subjective and hard to associate with, without a deeper understanding of human subjectivity. It's this subjectivity that causes problems and one's own subjectivity can remain a mystery until experienced when your own cognition doesn't favor it. \n\nIt's also the lack of deeper social understanding that makes us appear confident. Fi is so loosely tied to our state of mind, it can only be a very secondary concern when your mind is set on a logical intuition.
1	I am a fairly confident and don’t usually have a lot of fi moments either but yeah, I think descriptions are bad. I don’t like those. Just understand ni and te. I think that description is overdoing fi moments too much. If you understand the functions and how they work and then apply them to your life then that’s really all you need to know. The more I look around and study the functions and examine my own life the better grasp of things I can grasp.
1	its false.  \nENTJS by definition get the most conflict / challenging experiences of the bunch. or at least have the right mindset to get most out of them.  \nintuition is a living organism that will feed on that data and create a value system more in touch with reality.  \nthe closer to reality the value system is, the less internal conflicts you get.  \nso, if those guys are refering to simply being emotional, typical leftist propaganda? well thats irrelevant. its not only emotionally efficient to follow your emotions , but it usually brings best results (even if that includes failure)  \nof course im talking about becoming emotional to a context where both your reason and your emotion are in sync with the value system  
1	Only idiots are completely sure.  Being completely sure cuts off all new information, which just doesn't make sense in 99.99% of contexts.\n\nSo, yes, I think we are just as unsure as anyone else.  But the mistake they make is that the same level of unsuredness is the equivalent of having the same level of suredness.  Like there is some set amount of internal 'sure' that people get and thats it.  'Humans get 100 sure'.  But that's not how I see it.  I may have 30 unsure.  The guy next to me may have 30 unsure.  But my total possible sure level is 500 not 100 so, while we have the same level of unsure I am still way more sure than that fellow.  \n\nI am keenly aware of my inner struggles and I put a lot more work into understanding them and changing them than your average person, I'd guess.  I don't take it as 'this is the way I am'.  I take it as 'this is how my inner environment is right now.  Is that working for me?  If not, how does it need to change'.  Changing your environment starts there, after all, and that's what we're all about.\n\nI'm not sure how they get that Fi is 'inner Judging'.  That's introverted feeling and we can substitute introverted intuition for that function just fine.
11	Questions to ENTJs	How productive are you? Do you ever get unproductive? Also, would you not take the lead if you don't think the situation needs a new leader? How often do you initiate the leading? 
23	I can achieve anything I want ahead of most people as long as I find the motivation for it. The moment something external that I csnt control slows down my process I tend to become a sloth but then I find the flame to refocus again and keep going. Generally, efficiency is my thing.
8	Hard to tell how productive one can be without metrics. More than average, for sure.\n\nCan be very unproductive, like this very week, being on holidays and doing close to nothing. I felt the flame starting to burn again this morning, stuff is about to get done very soon.\n\nI take the lead if I have to. That means everything and nothing but it's so situational I can't give you any better answer. How often is that? Often, but again very situational. Co-leading is also an option.
7	I can procrastinate a shit ton lol. But when I’m focused and doing work, I get things down very quickly and efficiently like it’s nobody’s business. \n\nAll depends on what the task is. 
7	i can be unproductive a lot, i work in short bursts of energy i find.  i will 100% take lead in social groups or class projects if nobody else has just for the sake of getting things done 
6	-How productive are you?\n\nMore than most but not as productive as I could be, I'm sure.\n\n-Do you ever get unproductive?\n\nNot for long.  Lack of productivity makes me very, very restless and there's only one cure.\n\n-Also, would you not take the lead if you don't think the situation needs a new leader?\n\nNot only do I not take the lead if I don't think the situation needs a new leader, but I actively delegate leadership that I think I could do better than the person I'm delegating to.  Why?  Because there are other, more important, things to be done and other leaders need to develop.  Just because you are the most effective at something doesn't mean you're the person for the job.\n\nThe example I use to illustrate the point is folding laundry.  I'm pretty good at folding laundry.  I can fold a week's worth of laundry for my family in about 45 minutes.  My kids working together (pre-teens) can do the same in 2 hours.  I am obviously more effective.  But I'm not the person for that job because there are other more important things that need my attention.  Same goes for more serious considerations.
5	As a general rule I'm a productive person but there have been times when I've been elaborately lazy.

Depression, but I don’t want to call it that. I don’t see myself as a depressed person, and I don’t want to start identifying with that any time soon. 
3	I'm unable to be productive unless I truly think it is needed. I cannot trick myself into productivity and I cannot make myself do tasks I think are stupid, rushed, etc. I used to think I could force myself to do stuff anyways, but I don't function like that. It's better to accommodate your own needs.\n\nAnyways, the leadership thing changes based on the group/surroundings imo.
1	I mean I had two kids while getting my MA, moving across the country, buying an investment home and joining the Catholic religion (which requires a lot of research and quality devotion time). That being said, I’m emotionally annihilated and constantly irritable. 
1	I am generally pretty productive in my own ways slacking isn’t my thing sometime my focus isn’t on the right thing though. Like I am productive but defocus on some other stuff. If the task is pretty trivial not intellectually stimulating enough I learn stuff that isn’t related to school. I also think I’ve been in the school game too long, I’ve been in it 8 years. I am 26 years old. So yeah. \n\nI wouldn’t call myself unproductive though. I use my time generally wisely. I procrastinate and learn other stuff sometimes because the stuff I am suppose to do are. Just.... not that challenging.\n\nNo, I don’t always lead. If there is a efficient leader they can go ahead I am fine working under them. But I usually get asked to lead or mentor or some other form. Sometimes I don’t directly lead but I’ve done some representation work. I have also done modling. I don’t mean being a model like fashion. I mean more along the line of mentorships but sometimes I am the person they chose to talk about what I do and to show them how to do it. I do a lot of consulting stuff in terms of volunteering work. I am disabled so I get a lot of I don’t know what to do with this person. How do you handle it and what advice would you give? Or how are you so successful?\n\nI initiate the leading when necessary when there is an opportunity I usually ask in those cases.
0	My ENTJ business partner is not productive at anything but trying to get others to do stuff.  I’m the only competent other in the business and I’m an ENTP so he’s frustrated a lot.
5	Artifacts from Failed Relationships	Guys and Gals,\n\nSome relationships fail. Inevitably, artifacts and memories are collected whether the failed relationship is platonic or romantic in nature.\n\n*Purging* these items finds purpose in emotional and spiritual relief, but is it merely a net gain in the short term?\n\n*Keeping* these items finds purpose in retaining an objective point of reference in life, continually lending perspective through the years; but is there a cost involved?\n\nI tend, usually, not to throw away or delete these kinds of things. I find value in my experiences and relationships regardless of how they pan out. I recognize the value in retaining memories because I so infrequently visit them on my own without prompting. My memory sucks.\n\nHowever, I also see the value in releasing relationships completely, and I often wonder if such a purge is necessary for that kind of surrender.\n\nI have always struggled with this idea, and I know there's no universal answer. I am just curious what you all tend to do with things like this. Does anyone else vacillate on this topic, or are most of us inclined to an M.O. one way or the other?\n\nEdit: grammar
5	Purging. But I’m very non sentimental, things should be utilized, or at least decorative. I have even thrown out my old diaries, if I haven’t read them in the last decades why hold on to them?
4	Those “artifacts” could be injurious to your psychological and emotional health. My reasoning is this: that which holds you to the past anchors you there; and when anchored, keeps you from moving forward toward a greater future. \n\nIt’s a lot like “not getting over it.” We know that relationships require “all” of oneself. It is the only way to truly be happy in a relationship. Complete and utter commitment, devotion, and loyalty. Those three things are compromised when you allow the memory of another relationship to exist. It compounds the difficulty in establishing true commitment, devotion, and loyalty in another relationship by inserting a fragmented, and of course irreparable, piece of the former relationship. \n\nThere is a reason why that relationship ended and to remind yourself of the failure and the heartbreak is to impose disarray emotionally (the nature and ongoing unresolved portions of the heartbreak) and to suggest another failure psychologically (this remnant of the prior relationship is just one of many, thus which piece of the relationship I am in currently will be my artifact later). \n\nMy suggestion is to purge, always. Photographs, videos, gifts that are nonessential for functional use, sentimentalities that bring forth memories of the “good” times, etc. The only thing I wouldn’t get rid of? Seismic items that are nonsensical to dispose of without having a plan to replace them: a house, apartment, bed, office desk, mortgage documents, legal documents, children (lol), and so on. These are inevitably going to stay, but it’s up to you to make other memories to sustain your progression away from the previous relationship (e.g. moving in with your new s.o., having sex with someone else you care about deeply, treating the desk as work only, changing the documents to reflect your name only, and only interacting with the other person insofar as is required to ensure the child is happy).\n\nOur brains are wired to remember the past and having memorabilia greatly eases that process but it also holds us back from growing from those experiences. If I were still the same man when I was eighteen in any way, I would not be the loving boyfriend I am to my girlfriend today. Plain and simple. I was far too controlling, self centered, and aggressive (only ever psychologically). Having any artifacts from that past relationship would serve to remind me of those traits which I’ve learned to resolve and make better. My memory (or muscle memory for that matter) is enough. Anything more and it would only cause me more turmoil. I hope this answers your question.
3	Depends on the importance of the relationship. Most are lost to time, there's nothing of them that I want to keep. I've kept a box of letters from 15 years ago, assorted jewellery, and some perfume. They're visceral symbols of a different time. One day I'll get rid of all of them, but as someone who isn't nostalgic or sentimental they're the only visceral connection to the past that I have.
2	I keep the items as relics of my victory. I overcame and took the spoils. Haha sucker thanks for your gift
2	Take the good and leave the bad. Sometimes you find a reconciliation if things end amicably, and you can hold on to the good memories without stressing about the bad stuff. But sometimes you have to cut all ties if things end badly, and it's ok to leave those totally behind. Each situation is going to be unique, and require a different internal emotional response to move forward optimally.
2	For ENTJs its probably OK or even beneficial to keep. Since we tend to be future oriented anyways.
2	I don’t and never will have emotional stuff to objects I keep them because it’s utilitarian. You give me something I’ll put it to good use. Like this guy who really wanted to date me or something like that he gave me a binder. Sorry it’s mine, I am using it. Haha! I use it to hold my transparencies the little plastic sleeves. So yeah. I guess I don’t add a non-logical sentiment to them. I just keep it for my use.
1	I think ENTJs are extremely sentimental people. I also think that nostalgia hits ENTJs in a unique way. Having the mental pathways as an ENTJ, where meaning and significance matters, where connection is made through patterns etc. This here always leads us to also operate the emotion under the same process. \n\nKeeping romantic artifacts or getting rid of them is part of the human experience for ENTJs.
5	Help!/Question for Female ENTJs, Male perspective is also appreciated.	Hello,\n Backstory: Female.Grade 8.Tested as an ENTJ.Tested as Exceptional. Asexual (?) \n\nToday Is Valentines Day,and today I had a realization while everyone around me was coupled up with their S.O ( yes, I know we’re young) I was alone in a corner sitting on a bench on my phone reading a psycho-Analysis on lawyers. I have never cared much for friends/boyfriends unless they were of any benefit to me and my goals ( Oxford’27,Harvard law’30). But at that moment I just wish I had someone who understood me and was my equal. So to find out why I am single ( this honestly sounds like a bad book quite honestly) in a subtle way I found out why. Apparently I am intimidating,Evil,A Bitch,Cocky, Smart and etc..\n\nNow here is the question for women; \nHow Did you meet your S.O? \nWhat MBTI type is your S.O ( if you know)? \nAny advice for me? \n Do you think your intimidating?\nHow old were you when you met your S.O? \n\nWell that’s all I can think of for now.If anything is not clear please comment so I could clarify and hopefully get some advice. \n\nThx in advance \n\n\n
5	I was 29-30 when I met my S.O. (I’m now 34)I feel like he’s my intellect equal, even though we are intelligent in different ways — I’m much quicker and grasp concepts and analyze much faster. He’s more methodical but much more detail oriented than I am. I’ve learnt a lot from him, and him from me. He’s an INTJ. \n\nWe struggled a lot in the first four years of the relationship, mostly small things and power struggles, even though we are rather aligned in values and principles. It was definitely hard and both of us felt like giving up many times. \n\nI would say, stay ambitious and stay true to yourself. My relationship got much better when I stayed true to myself — I don’t think I would have been happy compromising on my beliefs or ambitions because of an S.O.. I feel the most confident when I’m staying on my own two feet. \n\nI do get a lot of comments about being intimidating and being “too smart” and “too aggressive”. I struggled through that sort of feedback for a while — but now I say “fuck that shit”. If they can’t handle it then they don’t deserve the benefits and value I bring to the table. \n\nKeep yourself open minded and socially out there! But don’t compromise on your ambitions. The right one who can love you for who you are will come along. \n\nEdit: I am ENTJ.
8	I'm going to be honest with you, and it's probably going to suck to hear. You are asking the wrong questions. Focus on your goals and everything else will fall into place. Your goals are extremely ambitious and you absolutely need to stay focused to make them happen. Michelle Obama has a quote about how if she had worried about relationships at such a young age, then she wouldn't have married the POTUS. She said it while talking to a group of young girls, and I always thought that was a really important thing to say. You are ambitious. Stay that way. 
2	Mine is an INTP and met him 2 years ago and now we r happily married. We met in Asia while I was working there and came following me to start a new life in Barcelona. Couldnt be happier, but Id honestly recommend u to mix and match and find what feel right for you. Never settle and dont rush these stuff. When it comes, all these thoughts or fears will dissapear and be replaced with a peaceful mind.
1	I actually just recently (few years back) found out I was intimidating to men, just considered myself a normal competent person so it was a bit of an eye opener. Funny enough the women stood up for me and said I was so sweet and lovely when the men spoke of how intimidating I am, so not to everyone obviously. At the same time it was a massive boost of confidence, especially in my field. \nI’m a lawyer funny enough and have moved on to commercial negotiations, so contracts and pricing, which I love. I am 6 foot tall and walk into every negotiation with 5 inch heels and flamboyant clothing, making the most of what I have to intimidate (men mostly). \nI used to have more female friends in Sweden, found women more rational there but it is hard to relate to women here Australia where I live now.\n\nI met my husband when I was 21 and we fell instantly for each other and got married in 6 months, that is 15 years ago this year. I think Swedish men are more intimidated even if they are used to Swedish women being strong, but my Australian husband thought I was quite a novelty being so independent and standing up for myself. He is ISTP so we are opposites except for T, which is crucial for our relationship as we get each other’s jokes and can have meaningful discussions. \nThe I and E balances us out. The S and N provides different perspectives. The P and J can be challenging to a certain extent, but we are both pretty flexible so it’s also balancing us
1	Met my SO at 22 been together for almost 4 years, he is also ENTJ. I don’t think I come off intimidating because I appear very feminine and friendly (think long hair, eyelash extensions). I wouldn’t worry about being in a relationship if I were you. Focus on your goals and develop yourself into a well balanced individual. My advice would be to also try to develop emotional intelligence and empathy. Nonetheless if someone is intimidated by a motivated, independent and smart female then they are definitely not for you. Surround yourself with other high achieving and motivated people (both guys and girls) because we all need high quality social connections. They will also spur you to achieve more. 
1	It’s really, really difficult to find an equal. Especially if you end up becoming athletic as well, because rarely do people enjoy both intellectual pleasures as well as fitness. Then, there’s the uniqueness of a sense of humor - some are dark, some are light, some just don’t have any sense of humor at all. I don’t think I’ve met my match but I’m still married. I’m just smarter than he is. He makes more money, though. 🤷🏼‍♀️ As you age, you develop a checks and balances system that they all filter through, and then settle on the most attractive one. Alternatively, get a new one every year. Either option is acceptable. 
17	Texting	How are you guys in general with texting? My SO and I recently became long distance, and the lack of ability to communicate in text messages is driving me mad. Never had to deal with this before bc we were together physically. \n\nI feel our types (ISFP) have some similarities, plus I type as a common ENTJ type on enneagram. But the long distance communication is not needing my mental needs, and that’s with me being a low maintenance communicator\n\nFeels like our conversations are all close-ended with him recycling the same 10 standard responses, and me trying to introduce new topics and keep conversation going. \n\nAny insight on how to approach this? I have mentioned to him multiple times that our trouble communicating when separated is an issue for me,  but I think we may define communication in different ways 😂
27	I have really low patience with any interaction that isn’t face-to-face. Doesn’t feel real.
10	FaceTime 
8	Some people just aren’t readers and texting annoys them.  \nI’ve got close friends like this. I text like crazy, they answer 1 out of 5, usually with canned responses.  \nIt’s ok.  \nLook for a way to communicate with him that works, rather than trying to make him work your way.  \nSkype, calling, FaceTime, letters.....  \nfind a solution rather than being stuck on the problem.
8	Yep, hate texting 
4	i love writing. i love my keyboard.. i hate phones and typing on them, other than that i dont give a fuck
9	I hate texting because of the lack of context. My ex and I had arguments because of this. I thought she was being a smartass when sometimes she was just kidding. \n\nLol, our only solution was to break up. Obviously there were other issues. 
3	If you’re forcing conversation, texting is the wrong route. Texting should be brief inspirations of conversation and it should be allowed it’s natural stopping points. If you’re worried the person is losing interest in talking to you, it’s probably because there’s really nothing to talk about anymore. Allow the day to pass without constant conversation, then pick up the phone and call them at the end of the day. You’ll see then how much more talkative he is.\n\nWe live in an era of constant stimuli and the thing is, our brains are not well equipped for that. It needs time to process things, especially when we are busy doing other activities. You say you’re long distance now. If he works, he may text when he’s bored during the day if his job allows, but if he doesn’t, it’s probably because he’d rather not be looking at his phone all day. If he’s at school, he’s reading or pressed for time doing homework, projects, papers, studying, relaxing or taking a break, etc. If none of those things, a texting conversation is one built around the two people involved, their conversation styles, their interests, their interpretations and purposes. If he’s going short with you it’s likely that he’s be short in person when given the same topic. It’s not so easy to turn the conversation around without first addressing what’s been said because it takes time to write, send off, all the while seeing the record laid out. \n\nTL:DR Stop texting all day, and wait till night time when there’s more to talk about. 
3	I don't mind texting, but I don't like texting all day long. Who has time for that? If I had a preference, I would talk on the phone or FaceTime. FaceTime would be best in a LDR. 
2	Same. I will do online interaction with my computer, but when I leave the house it's people interaction. I purposely have a phone that can only phone (no internet) & it is only for emergencies or necessary calls, like meeting up & requiring verbal communication in the process.
1	I pretty much never text any of the girls I'm dating unless they text me first, then I just usually setup a date.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you're long distance, I think I'd do facetimes & skype dates.  
1	I only ever text in a group chat. Other than that, I hate texting 
1	Disclaimer because I can’t respond to everyone lol: we don’t text all day! We both work 10-12 hours days so most of our texting is in the evenings. I hate talking, texting myself but I want my relationship to survive long distance 😂💀
1	I text purely for logistics. See you guys at (place) at (time). I don't want phones to become a substitute for socialising.
1	Been LDR with one of my best friends going on four years now. Best way hands down is FaceTime. Maybe play an online game or do something else together while FaceTiming. Easily better than texting. 
1	Have you tried voice messaging, what’s app, we chat, facebook messenger the voice button other voice messaging things. If I get too lazy to type I’ll voice message.\n\nHas anyone read any of my comments on here if you have you’ll realize I text quite a bit. So I don’t mind. I do that a lot I just text as if I am talking to someone naturally this is why this style of writing. Anything I would actually think of saying out loud I am currently typing right here. My texting like on here is extremely stream of consciousness. I dated an isfp actually and an esfp online long distance Nd I had no trouble. Well things fell apart but it had nothing to do with texting.
8	Did I say something wrong?	Hi, I'm an male INFP and dating a beautiful and awesome ENTJ woman for a few weeks now when a past scenario popped in my head. When she asked initially asked me to hang out, she seemed like she couldn't find the right words to say (which was really weird to me because she usually never hesitates to tell anyone anything) so I remember asking her if she was nervous. The next split second, she slapped the HELL out of me from out of nowhere. She apologized profusely (also very out of character) and we've since been very happy as a couple.\n\nBasically I'm just wondering if this was a specific ENTJ thing, did I insult her or was I just wrong that whole time? I feel like she usually never gets nervous about anything from what I can tell so I thought it'd be a good idea to ask some like minded people. 
46	No, domestic violence happens with all 16 types.
11	[deleted]
8	Probably not a type thing.\n\nHowever since we’re here, if we wanted to explain it via type thing I would say the ENTJ’s aren’t terribly comfortable with certain emotions.  Varies person to person, but I know personally I very much dislike having someone acknowledge or “call me out” when I’m feeling certain emotions such as embarrassment or nervousness.  
14	Next time she is naked slap her on the butt.
8	[deleted]
2	Please please talk about that slap again. I know you dont want to. But do. Just ask her how she feels about it. Now some time later. It will set aside this event :)
2	She slapped you across the face?!
2	ENTJ female here in relationship with INFP male.\nFirst thing-our relationship is a daydream.\nAbout that situation you described..I am extremly touchy in situations when my partner suggest that I’m weak/incompetent, in that moment my rage level increase in intimidating way I just can’t control.\n The point is that I’m weak in emotional discussions about feelings, especially in comparation with INFP who is probably the best, so I would say that I feel that I can’t give right emotional feedback and that’s really frustrating.\nI’m literary learning how to express my feelings and get in touch with them, and I think that I have best teacher possible for it! <3
1	violence is missunderstood, and demonized. its cool. just hit her back tho
1	I have slapped a few males in my days but only if they had it coming (read groped me). I am assuming she felt confronted by your question as she was out of her comfort zone being nervous, so maybe it was some strange overreaction? Wouldn’t necessarily connect it with her type unless she’s really big on keeping up certain perspectives of herself
1	Yeah, not really. No. I don’t care what type I am either but the entj stuff explains everything and I am sure I am. But I don’t resist or didn’t when others say I am this. I have no dogmatic need to be entj. I am by reason not by want or desire or fanatic fantastical stereotypes.
1	Take some time to think about every adjective you could use to describe someone. Select the ones that would make that person appear or seem to be weak and make sure you never use those to describe her. Problem solved. Some Enneagram 8 and Enneagram 3 ENTJs can be extremely insulted by even an indication from someone they trust that they are either weak, incompetent, or incapable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUse beautiful and kind language when talking to your partner and try to avoid being too direct in any emotional confrontations. As an enneagram 1 ENTJ, I completely understand the importance and significance of being open and honest when discussing emotions, but most ENTJs will not have highly developed Fi and may feel trapped by that type of discussion or confrontation. You may have just made her feel backed into a corner when you asked that, especially since you're someone she had just recently opened up to emotionally.
0	I have only ever lost control and hit one person ONE TIME, and even then, it was a gentle bump. What I'm saying, is that is UNACCEPTABLE and likely calculated (because she wasn't in a flight-or-fight scenario, unless your comment brought on PTSD or something). \n\nI had an INFP partner surprise tickle me once, which made me jerk and accidentally elbow him (he was laying down next to me). He was mad that I elbowed him, so he bit me. Afterward, I let him know that if he ever intentionally hurt me again, no matter the circumstances, I was gone. He cried and apologized a lot and said he understood. And we were together for 3 years and went through a lot, fought a lot, and he never touched me. Until I broke up with him, that is. Then he shoved me once (and felt guilty about it), because the leverage of me leaving was gone. That's what I mean by calculated, people who hurt others do so because they think they can get away with it.

13	If you are an ENTJ and your boss is ENTJ too. Is this a plus or minus?	
17	That's just gonna depend on the people....
15	Okay so here goes my experience.\n\nI got my foot in the door with consulting and with my boss being an ENTJ and recognizing I was an ENTJ something happened that did happen before which was something I like to call “expedited promotion”.\n\nHe recognized the ENTJ in me and boom immediately used it to his advantage. (Duh)\n\nNow, because I understood what he was doing I made sure to express what I needed to play along.\n\nSo it turned into me getting promotions and compensation and him tell me how he wanted to mold and influence the team/department. \n\nHe was strategizing at the top, I was strategizing in the middle, everyone else was a pon. \n\nBoom, there it is. 
12	My boss is an ENTJ and we get on very well. We are very similar and sometimes I call him out on his schemes and plans. He likes it. 
3	If you work directly with an ENTJ boss, it's like mixing random chemicals. Sometimes it's great, sometimes it's poison, but it's never boring.  Ideally, you head your department and meet with them for company wide coordination meetings. In these scenarios, I have tended to respect their vision and direction more as we are not both trying to grab the reins every day. 
2	I had a boss who was no doubt an ENTJ.   we were pretty upfront with everything.   I know when we first met he said something like... we have 1:1 meetings every 2 weeks for you to bring anything up... and I said, no I'd definitely just tell you right away.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe gave me a team of guys 5-10 years older than me, who were during the leadership offsite we werent sent to considered "individual contributors" and had me run that group.  I eventually left... because well HR denied a promotion due to budget reasons.  Boss was like, yeah I'd leave if I were you too.  But usually I think ENTJs get along if you can set some rules down up front and just be broadly honest about what your goals and objectives are.  You'll be on the same page pretty fast.
1	I wouldn't know cause I'm my own boss.\n\nOkay aside from that boast I'm also part of a side- project which is owned mostly by another ENTJ and we are really good at just understanding what both want. As long as we don't step on each others shoes it's perfectly fine and very effective at driving our team forward. 
1	I think it depends if to te people estj and entj the same way. Great if working towards the same goal not so much if not. I don’t know if I’ve been under or worked with another entj. I am currently doing so on reddit and it’s really just working together. I think two te doms actually work well together. I have a estj teacher we have pretty much the same goals too so we work well and in the same direction. I think both entj and estj scenarios there are mutual appreciation.
1	Does that even happen? Small world. 
1	If you fall into line and apply yourself to their vision while using your own abilities to make things easier for them, and expediting efficiency, you’ll get along splendidly and will gain a powerful ally.   \nIf you’re a know it all pain in the ass.  \nGood luck! 
1	Same with me and my boss and it’s amazing.\nSo easy to communicate and understand the way he thinks.
8	ENTJs: How do you act when you really like someone romantically vs just friendly interaction?	Okay ENTJs, I think an ENTJ guy is attracted to me, but he is so outgoing and confident with women in general, it’s hard for me to tell. \nDo you sit back spend time trying to gauge the other person’s level of interest and get a feel for their personality before making any moves? \nBut at the same time, do you make your interest obvious? Like with playful banter, eye-contact, pointed questions and comments, physical touch, etc?\nThat’s the vibe I’m getting from this guy, but I’m kind of confused by this behavior.
8	Just make a move and you won’t have to do all these mental gymnastics and diagnoses. Go get em.
6	coming from an ENTJ guy, if it were me I would tell you directly that I was attracted to you. But then again, he might be in the phase of figuring out how to tell you.\n\nMy advice would be to draw it out of him. Make yourself so appealing to him that if he had any interest at all, he would have this insatiable urge to tell you.\n\nJust my $0.02 lol\n\nEdit: letter
6	It’s 2019, you can make the first move. if he’s living in your head rent free and you truly want something then make it known. 
3	theres no distinction for me. what matters is the level of attraction not the type.1-5
2	" Possess feelings of humor; are independent and romantic; react unexpectedly. Inclined to frequently change their sexual impressions or partners. Impatient, with a tendency to hurry events; they are prone to hurry sexual relations, assigning an accelerated rate. Are affectionate, tender and courteous. Express emotions in witty form. Initiative-taking, daring and value reciprocity; but touchy and impulsive. If not confident in reciprocal feelings they may search for rapprochements with other partners. Need a volitional person capable of holding them. Will find support in an economic, sexual and reliable partner. "
3	Sounds like a fuccboi to me
1	Either he's not attracted to you and just like that, or he's into you but doesn't know how to approach and is waiting for "signs" that you're into him. If he was the type of ENTJ to take the direct approach and he likes you he probably would have already done so.  \n\n\nMy advice? If you manage to get in a one-on-one scenario with him make a compliment and joke about how experienced he probably is in bed or how attractive he is or something. Also a forward sexual innuendo works too - whatever's your style. Then gauge his reaction based on body language and face.
1	Yeah, I ask them out directly. I don’t do most of that stuff that other people do. I ask them out. If I am interested in you romantically I don’t think you would know my checking you out doesn’t make a difference you just can’t tell. That is if he’s actually a entj.

7	Say sorry.
5	Quitting benzos (very strong sleeping pills) after being on them for several years.
6	[colonoscopy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OlIrPV7LKg) - it's not that bad tho
2	Overcoming blindness and overcoming overprotective verbally abusive and mentally abusive parents? Yeah. The most interesting thing was I represented and was the model of this overcoming in my teenage years it was cool.
0	KILL THE QUITTER INSTINCT - Jocko Willink	
2	After he quits the killer instinct.
2	That's how I solved all the [hilbert problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_problems)!
1	This is great video, but as always with Jocko, we have to mindful about possible dichotomies. Of course, if you are pumping money into a failed business, desperately pursuing a one-sided relationship etc. - do move on, do rebuild, but for daily discipline - working out, eating healthy - KILL THE QUITTER INSTINCT.
17	Being rude without realizing it	Not sure if this is or was a problem for others of you, but it seems pretty in-line with what a lot of young ENTJs talk about. \n\nEssentially, I have a habit of questioning people. Especially teachers, sometimes other kids at school. I don't see it as being particularly rude, but everybody else is like, dude, you always correct and argue with the teachers, and a lot of times, it pisses them off. Have any of you dealt with this? And how have you gotten through it?
24	ENTJs like to ask clarifying questions to process information. Perhaps you can consider the phrasing you use when asking questions. \nEdit: typo
11	I think that’s a social skill that needs to be learnt.\nHow to present your idea and thoughts without coming across as arrogant, condescending or rude.\n\nI know two ENTJs, one being my brother. As he got older he got better at talking.\nBefore he’d just piss everyone around him off. I’m sure it was a point of frustration to him, especially when he was young.\n\nAsk questions to know what the person you disagree with is saying. Like actually listen, acknowledge their thought process.\nRepeat back what they’re saying so they know you understand.\nAnd then present your ideas, say what your logic is behind your conclusion.\n\nWhen people know you’re trying to understand them, they’ll more likely try to understand you back.\nAlso I reckon that’s the best way to not come across as aggressive.\n\nMost importantly: \nChoose your battles, don’t waste your energy in useless places. Most times people disagree with each other, leave it at that. \nYou can’t convince someone of something they don’t want to be convinced of.
6	You don't argue, that hurt other's feeling and go against the social rule.\n\nWhenever people show some sign of defensiveness, just assume that it cannot be changed and stop unless they can handle the criticism/you really want to help them
3	i just think ENTJ’s communicate in a very direct, factual, to the point and extremely blunt ways when they are trying to get a point across and this can be perceived by many as being rude. Also with questioning, maybe you can just phrase it like “ sorry i’m not sure i fully understand, just for clarification you meant that...” 
2	Ask yourself if the reason why u keep on pushing is ur own satisfaction seeing them struggle w knowledge. People remeber how you made them feel and this feedback might hunt u throughout ur career. Fight for what truly counts without damaging relationships.
2	questions are conflictual by default, they are expressions of violence. and they demand expenditure of resources.  \nso, be mindful of putting them and framing them
1	You gotta not worry what others think of you. Yeah most of the time stupid people don’t comprehend well what more intelligent people say. Arguing with idiots is often a waste of time that otherwise could be used effectively for other things.
1	I used to be like that growing up. Had to learn and adjust the wording my questions to where the other person wouldn’t feel attacked by my need to have more information and be better informed. I’m no good at receiving ambiguity and am easily frustrated by it. \n\nLike most things in life, you build the skill to charm and read others to get what you want.
1	yes. you all are a bunch of assholes. but i love you all thoo
1	I think social mimicry is helpful. I am a 3w2. Be charming and a smooth talker.\n\nHey I have a question, I am a little confused so (ask your question.\n\nTo state a opinion I actually got this from a book character.\nEither over use I think. Or the word personally. Or I clarify this is just my view on things. \n\nIf it’s challenge something like.\n\nSo I have a question. I don’t know if I agree. My point of view is this. Or this is how I look at the situation. Or I just think of this issue this way.\n\n\nAlso, let others be wrong or hold their opinions. They should be allowed to voice your opinion as an opinion not the only right way. Like hey this is just my opinion or just another point of view.\n\nKnow that not everyone will agree with you.\n\n\nDoes this help?
1	I ask my dad to do literally anything and he gets pissed with me, kinda, not massively he just mockingly says, 'Ok daddy'.\nAt school I was always asking questions and the teachers would get mad also.\n\nAt work I've often asked questions and provided solutions but the employers have either answered or took on my suggestions, others have fired me.\n\nAll in all, I think it's their problem.\n
16	Question: Got cancelled on 3 times in a row. Do I axe or no?	Hey Folks\n\nLong time lurker, first time poster.\n\nJust need some advice, I started seeing someone in December after being disconnected for nearly 10 years. She is also an ENTJ. \n\nIn the amount of time I’ve spent with her, I feel that I’ve changed as a person, I’ve opened up to her which I never do with anyone. Albeit she’s only received small bits of information. I feel safe and comfortable around her. \n\nOver the span over 2 weeks she’s cancelled on me 3 times consecutively. Twice with notice and once without. I’ve always had a rule which is if I’m cancelled on 3 times consecutively, I cut that person from my life. (This is due to my schedule, it’s hard for me to accommodate time for people so when they can’t do it for me, I drop the axe.) \n\nShe just messaged me this morning asking me to grab breakfast with her tomorrow. I’m having a mini crisis, do I follow my rules or do I break them for her?\n\nAppreciate all advice in advance. \n\n\nUpdate:\n\nSeeing her tomorrow morning for breakfast, going to hear her out and tell her how I feel from there. \n\nFinal Update:\n\nWe met for breakfast today, I was 15 minutes late. And the first thing she said to me was that she was sorry and if we were going to continue, she had to let me know that she’s bipolar, and suffers from manic episodes. She then continued to open up to me and tell me about how it can make her behave. She spent the next hour and a half telling me how she felt. We discussed my rule and she said she would understand if I didn’t want to continue moving forward. My career is based on reading people and anticipating reactions, she was genuine in everything she said. We made plans for dinner this evening. She’s cooking. \n\nThanks everyone for your input!!! 
20	Have breakfast, tell her about the rule and ask her what happened
4	[deleted]
6	Usually I’d say axe but if she’s trying to hang as early as tomorrow morning, go for it. Worst case scenario you eat some bomb breakfast by yourself. Win-win! 
5	I would say meet her, hear her out and then explain how you feel. It's a two way relationship and it's important that you're both happy. 
2	Go. Love dont cost a thing
2	Based on the stats of this thread, ENTJs give good advice about 70% of the time. lol
1	Be upfront about the rule, and if she needs to reconsider her schedule to better accommodate you, she can. Have a nice breakfast! 
1	[deleted]
1	3 per what ? day, week, month, year or lifetime.\nhey life partner, you hit 3 cancels after 20 years, you're out!! j/k But, I think you can make a better algorithm/rules than that. \n\nAny cancel with notification is a winner in my book.  Should be a +1 instead of a -1.  So she would be at +1+1-1=+1 still.\n\n
1	Axe. Why would someone do something like that? She clearly isn’t interested in how it affects you. Imagine being in a relationship with someone who constantly cancels 😵 
1	Stick to your rule. Do not compromise for her or anyone. 
1	Confront her first.  Tell her how her behaviour made you feel and give her a chance to explain. She may have a perfectly valid reason for behaving the way she did.  Either way you should know for certain after speaking with her.
1	this gonna be hard for both of you.\n\nIf she's interested in you and ready to work this relationship out, don't end this unless after a calm face to face conversation. Ask her why and look at the situation from her perspective whenever it's out of control.\n\nThe relationship is worth it tbh. You two will learn a lot from it.
1	I wanted to say meet her but saw that you were about to meet her anyway LOL. Update us on the date OP!
1	getting cancelled on three times, and still agreeing to see her at a time and place of her choosing says a lot about how much you respect yourself. And she's going to subconsciously pick up on this and devalue you. 
1	Kind of a stupid rule imo. People get busy. I would only cut a person off like that if we we're all that close.
1	The 1st cancel with notice = monitor.  The 2nd cancel with notice = Axe.  Any cancel without notice = Axe.
1	The good news is she reached out to you and initiated the meeting, which means she very well could’ve been stupid busy during those times. She’s interested as from my experience with ENTJ women, they only initiate if they dig you. I once last minute cancelled on a coffee meeting, and she legit didn’t talk to me for 2 months straight. I eventually made it up to her though.....🍆
51	itiswr1tten's Bullet-Point Guide To Fixing Your Shit	**Intro**\n\nOh boy, a collection of people who are like me. Let me share some condensed wisdom I've learned that will help our little budding enlightened despots course-correct some of our most terrible faults. Strap in. \n\nItalics punchlines are at the end of each section for the "I need utility before I'll read this" crowd.\n\n-----------\n\n* "Annoyance" is our most common negative emotion, and (inter-personally) is the result of mismanaging our expectations of others\n\n\nIf you can fix one thing from reading my post, try to internalize this point. If the customer service rep failing to understand your nuanced problem is pissing you off, it's because (A) you are not communicating effectively / in the manner the other person requires and (B) your expectations of this person's intelligence are probably too high.\n\nThe same can be said of significant others - if gf/bf didn't organize the fridge properly for the umpteenth time, your expectation you can teach them to be "better" is stupid and your fault. Accept the limitation or take charge of these annoyance patterns yourself. DO NOT try to change the person - this is the manifestation of your arrogant belief that your original expectation is "right" and reality must conform to it.\n\n\n*Solve annoyance by changing expectations, fostering internal acceptance, or taking charge.*\n\n---------\n\n\n* You (very likely) don't have Narcissistic Personality Disorder / Cluster B\n\nA common and easily dismissed allegation - yes we are rare, yes we are special. We are not (all) Narcs. We score really high in two [Dark Factors of personality](https://qst.darkfactor.org/), however. Those are:\n\n1. Moral Disengagement\n\n2. Machiavellianism \n\n\nIt scares the masses when they see your gears turning with zero regard for what other people think is right, or how other people feeeeellllllll. Furthermore, when your plans are laid out and executed in plain sight, with the finality of decision-making ENTJs excel at, many will perceive you as totalitarian. \n\nTo avoid this in personal and professional settings, solicit stakeholder opinions on your course of action. To save time in professional settings, solicit the leaders of stakeholder groups. Even if you proceed exactly as before said solicitation, you'll make people feel like they were part of the idea. This is critical.\n\n*You're not a narcissist, but we're very high on certain Dark Factors of personality. Assuage misgivings in others by directly soliciting their feelings or opinions, because that makes them feel included in the decision (even if you never intended to do so).*\n\n-------\n* Stoicism can be a trap if you apply it incorrectly\n\nMost people need stoicism to stop getting overwhelmed by all their feelings and responsibilities. We need stoicism to deal with how ANNOYING everything in life is for us. \n\n> “Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth.” -Marcus Aurelius\n\nThe majority of the population feels empowered by this because they're hung up on others' judgments. We read this statement and think "no shit". \n\nHowever, don't fool yourself - it is a huge mistake for an ENTJ/LIE to become *more dismissive* of their own and others' emotions. \n\n*Use stoicism to overcome your irritations, not to amplify your (often weak) attunement to emotions.*\n\n----------\n\n* [It's not about the nail, stupid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4EDhdAHrOg)\n\nWhen we identify internal problem in someone else, we usually skip past all the steps other people need to reach the mental point of "OK, I'm ready to fix it!"\n\nThe reason for this is ENTJ/LIEs simply do not need justification or rationalization to reach conclusions. The decision is all the validation we need. The other 96% of the population often need these things. \n\nThis is consequential because if you just grabbed a claw hammer and pulled the nail out of their head, they'd resent you despite it fixing the problems at hand. No amount of "the pain is gone, right?" and "when is the last time you had the sweater snag thing?" will undo said resentment. This is fucking confusing for us. \n\nEither tailor the solution to the person's operating function, or lead the horse to water, mentally detach, and leave it there. If they're a feely, connect with their feelings and steer the emotional rollercoaster. If they're a neurotic planner, help them craft their spreadsheet. Get the gist?\n\n\n*You cannot solve others' personal problems without a "personal" solution.*\n\n\n\n----------\n\n* It is fine and often necessary to hold yourself to ridiculously high standards. Don't do the same for everyone else.\n\n\nThis is a classic ENTJ struggle. We're psychos with our goal setting, and that's what makes us so effective. However, annoyance and pain will decorate the walls of our lives until we mature past projecting this "greatness" onto others. \n\nA big portion of the other 96% finds this approach to life fucking exhausting and terrible. Let them do it their own way and assess value accordingly. \n\nOn the flip side, people giving you advice "not to be so hard on yourself" are often wrong outside the realm of mental well-being. \n\nGood ENTJ advice: stop being consumed by your lofty goal, it's inefficient - you have all the tools to make it work, just not this second. Shitty ENTJ advice: These goals are too high! You need to just relax, man!\n\n*The title of this section is the summary*\n\n\n----------\n\n**tl;dr Here are 5 common ENTJ traps, and how to unsnare yourself from them. Enjoy.**\n\n
9	This was beautiful to read
7	Eh, my list would go more\n\n1. Learn about meditation\n\n2. Get a vision\n\nThats it\n\nBonus that it works for all of the types\n\nBeing an ENTJ doesnt mean that everyone around you annoys you, you may just have a bit too big of an ego, given your writing style I take it youre good mannered and polite in person, so it may be difficult to realize how much of an asshole you are\n\nYou can be dominant in situations, but you viewing incompetent people purely as roadblocks is very telling you may have some other shit you need to fix
3	ENTP here. This really helped. Thanks. 
2	holy fucking shit nice post
2	Very nuanced explanation and very useful tips!
1	Woah. This was eye opening. Thank you so much for sharing and breaking it down so clearly 
1	Thanks man!  \nI'm clearly under developed.  \n\nAny material I can read?
1	> You cannot solve others' personal problems without a "personal" solution.\n\nCould you give me an example or two? I understand what youre saying but i dont know how to fill in the other parameters, how do i know which sort of personal solution to apply? An example or two will help me construct the beginnings of a heuristic
1	This post hit so much of what I feel right on the nail. Beautiful post, appreciate you taking the time to write all of this out and post it for us to learn from
7	Since you guys seem to be uncomfortable with feelings.. is flirting awkward for you?	Not just keeping in contact but actually saying cute or sweet things. \n\nWhat’s your flirting style?
18	I actually find flirting pretty easy, but have never thought of flirting as related to having trouble with feelings. Talking about and expressing my feelings is different from flirting.\n\nI'm not really someone that's good at "saying cute or sweet things" either and it usually feels awkward to me to, but I do get told I can be surprisingly sweet sometimes, generally when I'm just speaking my mind and not trying to be.
9	I've been told I'm charming so I imagine that means I'm good at it. It really isn't that hard. You just mix being genuinely interested in getting to know them and sincere compliments with a little cheeky innuendo and magic.\n\nSaying sweet things is just pointing out things you like or appreciate about them in my opinion. It has to come from a place of sincerity in my opinion, otherwise it's... off.\n
7	I don't flirt. I tend to encourage in that really specific personal way or I try to compliment them on very specific things. The endearing things. I don't know how to flirt dude- ITS BECAUSE I USE THE WORD DUDE AND BRO ISNT IT
9	I don’t flirt, I have really great conversations with the girl I’m talking to that impress and attract the fuck out of her
3	I suck at flirting over text and stuff, but I have no trouble with it face to face.
3	Writing as Male in prime dating years for context.\n\n\nI can assess in about 5 minutes whether I am a match with someone, then in another 15 minutes whether they are going to be just a sexual prospect or if there's depth. \n\n\nThose first 5 minutes I'm polarizing aggressively - I want her to be disgusted or REALLY interested. The next 15 I'm just probing for intelligence and adaptability, usually by challenging and teasing verbally. \n\n\nFrom there I fork the road - sex prospects are going to get strong physical escalation while depth prospects I'll continue to evaluate where their weak spots (read: attraction attachment points) are and exploit. That early window is critical to anchor yourself as attractive.\n\n\n\nThis is flirting imo
2	The odds are good but the goods are odd.
2	Flirting is as easy as breathing ( it took me about 2 years of half-assed research + 1 year of awkward flirting to get to a generally ok level)
2	Flirting is sales of a personal nature. There is always an angle to advance your product by flattering the customer 
2	Flirting is hard.
1	I still have no fucking clue what flirting is... like its not just saying insinuating things with a coy smile, is it?
1	Flirting is pretty easy since I can anticipate their next move pretty easily, but I don't really flirt anymore. I got hitched pretty quickly. Good thing too, dont like wasting my time lol
1	I express my feelings maybe once every 5 years. I express my opinion on things very often. I'll discuss a relationship with a 3rd party in an objective manner with 0 feelings… maybe except for frustration… which I "feel" all the time.\n\nMy flirting style is ridicule. But I make it very apparent that it is with no mal intent. I also try to push/motivate those I like to better themselves or take better care of themselves. I've realized, through experience, that self deprecating humor shows that you know your own shortcomings and own them.\n\nEdit: When I say "like", I mean in a non romantic way but more like a friend way. But in a snap, that flirting can be amped up to be romantically motivated.
5	Must reads	What are the ENTJ must reads? Besides the obvious like 'The 48 Laws of Power'. \n\nAnd no, I'm not asking for books you liked. 
5	Sam Harris - free will
5	Dan Pena is interesting to watch.
3	Sir Alex Ferguson (legendary soccer manager) wrote a book called “Leading” that is a very good read for people who are aspiring business owners and entrepreneurs.  He gives lectures to Harvard MBA students sometimes, and he’s a very smart guy. \n\nThe book goes through his philosophy of organizing a business, establishing a culture, getting the most out of people, etc.  A lot of it is about soccer obviously, but managing a club is similar to managing a business. 
2	Destiny is a great Twitch Streamer that debates people from very rational perspectives that I think all ENTJs can appreciate. Destiny uploads his debates onto Youtube. A good hook is either hid debate with Jontron or Sargon of Akkad\n\nNot a book, but relevant imo. 
34	Emotional Labor and the ENTJs Who Hate It But Also Don’t Get Enough	Part of getting along in the world as an ENTJ is always having to factor in “the emotional component” when trying to get things don’t woth other groups of people. I hate every second of it, specifically the constant emotional hypervigilance. Always having to be aware of and suppress my emotions and continuous monitoring of everyone else’s emotional state is exhausting. That emotional suppression and constant awareness of other people is making me depressed. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nFurthermore, When I’m burnt out and stressed from doing this, who will be there to take care of me? IME People don’t know how to emotionally take care of ENTJs and they assume we don’t need it. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd to be honest, I don’t even know how to take care of myself emotionally all the time - I just know when I suddenly become an emotional train wreck something went wrong along the way. 
23	Agreed! We are always assessing other people’s emotions (probably because we see it as the most efficient way to go through life). However, it seems that no one can pick up on, or cares, to asks about how we are doing
4	Start by expressing to someone that you need to be allowed to have an Emotion. We think people don’t care, but finding someone you trust, expressing to them, and being vulnerable will help them see that we’re not emotionless efficiency robots. It’s our own persona that lets people think we’re invincible but we need others and part of that is telling them those needs\n\nThat being said I 100% see where you’re coming from and it can be hard to express things but even starting with that feeling can definitely help 
5	As an INTJ, I completely relate to this.  I have really worked hard at this part of my life, both professionally and personally.  I think that I do a decent job since I am so hyperaware of it, but of course there are always going to be those who will continue to take advantage of it and try to suck your soul, no matter what you do.  We are assumed to be without feelings, since we often come off as stoic.  Somehow, this translates to people demanding that we accomodate their feelings while they feel no reciprocity of the same consideration that they expect from us in return, as they perceive us to be not sensitive and therefore in their mind, they assume that they can treat us harshly and it's ok.  I have had coworkers who thought that I was not upset, after very upsetting incidents and that has always surprised me.   I guess that I am good at staying calm and appearing unaffected, but that doesn't mean that I am not upset.\n\nI agree that being, "on" all the time for the benefit of others \*does\* wear down on you.  The number of times where I not only bit my tongue, but had to bend over backwards to soften language for the benefit of others gets the point where it can feel as if we're the ones making much more effort than the other party and yes I resent it. If I am taking the effort to be considerate and going out of my way to make it obvious that I am being, "nice," then it sucks when I get nothing but grief back.\n\nA couple years ago, I went through this in a workplace, bc I was constantly being told that I was too direct, by two particular women, who were about 20 years my senior, plus one older male (I'm a woman).  It got to the point where I felt unauthentic, unhappy and just felt like crawling out of my skin, bc I felt stifled.  If I did not 100% go along with their ideas (many of them were bad ideas), they would use this against me.  Worse yet, I was basically being bullied by the same people complaining about ME, and when I finally get fed up from constantly having to be the bigger person, and told them that I it was wrong that I was being treated so harshly, while I had made every effort to accomodate them.  Well, they ganged up on me and came down hard on me and told me I was the problem, even though other coworkers were having similar issues being bullied by those complaining about their feelings getting hurt.  It was just that I was the main target, as they felt more threatened by me, than they did by coworkers, who admittedly often hid behind me, bc they felt that I advocated for them.  I was just the only one willing to say something, not just for me, but for my entire team.  I ended up leaving that place, walked away from a promotion, but it was too toxic and I decided after that experience that I will never sacrifice myself in that way ever again.\n\nIt took a huge emotional toll on me, that not only was I bending over backwards to accomodate, but then I was NOT acknowledged for it and then somehow others justified that it was ok to treat me poorly in return?  That doesn't even make any sense, it's just purely toxic people trying to be emotionally manipulative!   I have gotten feedback from people that I trust and my other coworkers (all who I am still on good terms with and keep in contact with) that I am more than considerate of others' feelings and I was not the problem.  We are hyperaware of our, "weakness," we can inadvertantly end up accomodating TOO much and we end up sacrificing ourselves because of this.
3	Yes! I now articulate that as a weakness in the workplace (subtext: go to someone else with your problems - I have enough!)
3	It's almost like I have developed a little switch: "Yes. This is annoying but you can't express that. Just deal with it and smile and pretend it's ok." I find this more with friendships and relationships than in the workplace. It's not to say I haven't dealt with it but the one time I remember having to do it, I wound up firing the person after excessive multiple outbursts. I also double-checked with my boss first because I was worried it was my "No BS" personality being fed up with it.\n\n\n\n
2	Heavy is the head that wears the crown. Seriously tho, I have come to accept that human nature is a double-edged sword. No being has the power to separate the gift from the curse, and I wonder if we’d even want to if we understood the cost. \n\nI tend to be more capable of meeting the needs of others than they are of meeting mine, and therefore they tend to get more out of the relationship than I do. I don’t know whether people have more needs than I have, or if I rely on myself to meet my own needs more than they do, or both. \n\nRather than trying to excise that cursed underbelly of competence and emotional intelligence, I try my best to limit the toll it takes. I find comfort in being understood and appreciated in the few equal relationships I do have, and save most of my effort and care for them. I find comfort in music, especially classical. Rachmaninoff (INFP) has soothed me when I needed it the most, and helped me understand myself emotionally. I find it comforting when my boyfriend helps me with day-to-day responsibilities. When he covers the small things, I can focus on the big things (and vice versa). The occasional indulgence in a luxurious experience can be healing as well.\n\nI don’t understand why my posts turn into a wall of text every time, it’s this weird need to be thorough and clear. 
1	This topic itself gives me a headache. I just don't have to say anything when it comes to emotions. All I feel is the mild headache when I talk about it. I somehow feel uneasy and like a retard. 
1	Amen. That is my experience!
1	I responded to a similar post that you made in a different thread. I'll go ahead and respond here as well. Just trying to think of how to reformulate my response in the new context...\n\nHm. I do agree that people tend to assume that ENTJs aren't in need of TLC. You guys are such pillars of strength that, well, yeah. Also, I think you guys instinctively hide weakness and vulnerability. I'm not trying to victim-blame here, just trying to get a feel for the situation.\n\nAs I mentioned in the other thread, probably the best way to get your emotional needs taken care of is to develop a small network of friends that you're intimate enough with and trust enough with that you can let your hair down and make your needs known. I does strike me that an ENTJ might have trouble developing such a network. I suspect that your social networks are larger, more diffuse, and perhaps more instrumental than an INTPs? Not sure, I'm just extrapolating from what I know about ENTJs. Developing a smaller, more intimate social network of your own, alongside your larger 'business' network, might be something worth looking into. Might bear some thinking on, if you agree with my diagnosis.\n\nEven with such a network, making your needs *known* might well take an act of courage. That's a practical difficulty there, alright.\n\nNot knowing how to take care of yourself emotionally is perfectly okay :). If your friends truly care about you, they should be willing to undertake the work to figure out how you tick and what needs to be done to make you 'tock' 'correctly' :). Um, if your friends don't appear to care, that's okay too. No reflection on them or you. Different people are wired differently. One problem might be "knowledge of the result" - how can your friends know if what they're trying is working? Or is it making things worse? With knowledge of the result, even just random tweaks will *eventually* teach them how to help you. Without knowledge of the result, they're just going to be shooting in the dark.\n\nIf the idea of somebody else taking care of you despite your "emotional self-care ineptness" makes you feel guilty, well, keep this in mind: Line from a tv show I like: "Back when my wife and me were still just dating, she'd come over and help clean my apartment. I was like, 'Babe, what are you doing? Your place is a *mess*. Why are you helping me with mine?' And she told me, 'When I clean my apartment, I'm just cleaning my apartment. When I clean yours, I'm *helping you*.'"\n\nSo, it might be easier for other people to help us with our hot mess than it is for us to take care of our hot mess ourselves :). And vice versa. Trick, I suppose, is finding somebody who actually cares...\n\n>Always having to be aware of and suppress my emotions and continuous  monitoring of everyone else’s emotional state is exhausting. That  emotional suppression and constant awareness of other people is making  me depressed.\n\nHmm. Why do you suppose that helping other people requires emotional inauthenticity on your part? Could you walk me through an example? As detailed as possible, my Ne needs to feed if I'm to find you a solution.\n\nAlso, when you try to help somebody, are you taking care of their needs, or are you trying to make them happy? Myself, I suppose I'm trying to do both, but making them *happy* is important. Helping them with their needs is important too (flowers can't grow without dirt), but the idea of helping somebody with *all* their needs is a bit exhausting.
1	Make friends with others and they will care use charm rather than force. That’s my hints.
6	ENTJ vs ENTP most likely behaviour	I met this guy, and he is an unusual combination of both. Basically quirky jokes, a bit of a messy vibe, not that charming, but extraordinarily commanding when given a leadership role with quick thinking skills to get things done. He's intellectually fast enough to think of a good rebuttal by ten seconds in debates but not quite serious as I thought ENTJs would be in social situations.\n\nSo my question is: Do most of you relate to being socially informal yet serious with getting work done and changing to a whole new person when doing so?\n\nI know that typing someone is mostly about functions and motivations etcetera, and I've mostly deemed him as an ENT but the Te part just gets me confused all the time. 
6	I wouldn't really say I get "informal" very often. I always tend to be a little too formal for the occasion to be honest. For me, it's really about jokes and sass. I reign in my humor and insolence at work, especially here in the U.S. because you can *literally* get fired for no reason at all in most states. I'm not goofy though - at home or at work.
2	Ha ha reminds me of me. I find that when taking the 16 personalities test my percentage of judging or prospecting is 53% (J) and 46% (P). I wonder if it would be possible to be both but the thing that gets me is the other functions that really differentiate the two types.\n\nSometimes I catch myself being less of a lead type when I don't care about the situation or want the people around me to like me or laugh etc.., but when I know that shit needs to get done, I snap into this colder, no time for games, working-for-the-greater-good leader type .... strange
1	Yes I am that way. People are really surprised when I get back to work I am really friendly and casual when not at work. You’d think I was something else. But I think if you look hard enough I could be.\n\nBut you haven’t given us enough information there is still difference in style and type of talking and many different things when having fun. So I can’t tell.\n\nIs he arguing to argue or arguing to win? I think I discuss and debate more in a straightforward manner definitely not like entps who can be a bit more argumentative and use normal persuasion techniques. I have more of a discussion and use te or situational logic.\n\nAt work I think you can see their ne best if they are entps thinking pprocess is all over the place. And even at play or in casual situations entps can be much more scattered and creative. IN a sense during having fun we’re still ni, analyzing different situations whilst talking to people or researching. And has a more focused and analytical air to us. We don’t come up with a million ideas a minute. Ne ti does.

19	When was the last time you cried?	And why?
33	There is nothing wrong with ENTJs crying in private. I think we need to hear that. 
21	I rarely cried most of my life until about six months ago. A lot of heavy things have been happening in my life which have caused me to emotionally process junk I was carrying I was previously unaware of. I am now finding I am able to allow myself to feel more; both with myself and with others. I have cried more in the last six months than all the years in my teenage and adult life combined. I find myself regularly fighting back tears when certain topics come up in my mind or in conversation. Never thought I would be this emotionally aware -- I mean, I half expected something like this in my 60s or something, but not this drastically this soon.\n\nIt has been extraordinarily relieving and therapeutic.\n\nEdit: grammar
13	When my mother had a miscarriage. I was about 9 and was excited to see my new sibling. The reality hit me hard. 
10	This post made me chuckle. I seldom cry. It takes quite a bit but I cry somewhat easily when it comes to disadvantaged persons who don’t know better, really really good movies, or relatable books. 
8	Couple months back. Watched a movie where a dog died :(
7	February 25th, 2018.\n\nIt's been almost a year. I really want to cry again because I've been going through some shit, but no fucking luck at all. It's getting frustrating.
7	After 2 weeks of starving on the diet my girlfriend put me on. I didn't know how to tell her it's shit and I'm done with her shit
7	It’s been about every day the past few weeks. Recently got broken up with 
6	I don't cry very often at all, but last night I watched the most recent season finale of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, and that set me off. No spoilers.
6	Armageddon when Bruce Willis changes spots with Ben.
6	I never used to cry when I was younger. It would take a lot in order for do so.\n\nNow, I am a much more emotional person. That doesn't mean I cry all the time but definitely more than I have before in my life. After dealing with a toxic relationship and going to therapy, I realized that my emotions should be felt and didn't need to be bottled up. I'm allowed to feel how I feel, which was something that I wasn't allowed to do for a good portion of my childhood. Once I allowed myself that, I swear I became a different person. Still an ENTJ, oddly enough, but more in touch with Fi.\n\nLast week I shed a tear while a watching a video. It was very touching. It was happy tears.
4	Last time was this past Tuesday. I have an ISTP husband with ADHD - enough said? Every 6 months or so I have to remind him I exist and his behavior impacts the whole family. Plus I had to plan an important work party. Too much happening at once.  lol
3	Cried playing Yakuza 0 last night. And the night before. Damn game playing with my heart strings.
3	December
3	When I had to put my dog down a few months ago.
3	I cried Wednesday night. I live in chronic pain and sometimes I have a bad flare, and that night was unusually bad. I’m used to living in pain and just pushing through it and living with my limitations but every once and awhile a bad flare like this inevitably happens. I was stuck in bed for hours, unable to move, unable to think at all, I couldn’t perceive my surroundings at all. All I could perceive was the pain. It was blinding physically and psychologically. So yes, I cried, it fucking hurt. \n\nThen I succumbed to exhaustion and passed out and slept through the night, and yesterday was a better day. I’m still physically fragile from it but, I’ll be okay. 
3	Yesterday. I probably cry 2-4 times a week. I have clinical depression.\n\nBut before I was depressed it was probably like once every 3-4 years.
2	Yesterday. 
2	Last week. It was really silly, but profound. \n\nI've been under a lot of stress while taking care of my SO who's is going through long term illness. Too much to go into now. \n\nI took a break from everything to avoid a burnout and am getting back in the saddle. I'm not in the best place yet, so everything is giving me some compounding anxiety right now. \n\nLast week was tough. One day, just everything was going wrong. I had a workout class scheduled which was the one thing I was looking forward to all week. I was running late and had to stress to make it on time. My gym is typically open without any checkpoints. But when I got to the place, I realized I forgot my gym card and they happen to have a checkpoint set up. I couldn't get in.\n\nI walked outside. Sat on a bench in the out in the snow just.. being empty. At one point I got myself home and got in the shower. I sat down on the ground and just cried and cried and cried. My SO kept me company. At one point he helped me get up from the ground and helped getting me dried off. He got me into bed and he held me until I fell asleep. We took a nap together and I felt a lot better once I woke up again.

2	I think it’s a great misunderstanding that thinkers do not cry, and can’t get emotional. I usually cry in private but can occasionally shed some tears in public usually I really have to be pushed. I don’t cry very often, but I would not say very seldomly either. I think thinkers can get emotional and feelers can be quite rational. It’s definitely more of a preference.\n\nThe last time I cried was about the beginning of this week. I was in a unruly class. The class was really random and chaotic. The teacher is a fairly young entp. The guy is fairly scatttered and tends to be really ne and to some degree ti. He’s also not the most healthiest entp. I’ve ever met.\n\nThe randomness and chaos, along with a conflict between the entp and entj really took my emotions by storm, and my confidence. I also was feeling lost, not keeping, up no idea what the material well. Getting to my 3 and my 5 really. So I turned in to an isfp and cried and stayed in bed and slept most of the day. Usually I am fairly good and it doesn’t happen but this as been a rough time. Things has gotten better with the entp. It was actually a fairly good class to learn last class.\n\n\nBefore this a while ago.
1	Funeral / duh\n\nSometimes I tear up and feel like crap when I abuse my stomach too much. At times it is indistinguishable from a real cry but I do know what is actually causing it.\n\nI am not depressed. I was raised a certain way. I try not to cry unless I physically can't control myself - happens rarely. It does not help anything anyway.\n\n\nI think you are looking for something different - like how to get your life together and reach a semi-happy place.\n
1	My aunt, who I was really close with when I was younger, died a couple weeks ago.  I sat at my desk, at work, and cried, but got my shit together and kept working.  Then, yesterday, I saw a photo of her, which made me tear up.
1	I don’t cry often, but when I do, I don’t pretend I’m not.
1	5 months ago, my grandfather's death and funeral soon after. I was 30% sad that he passed and 70% frustrated with myself by taking in blame. I thought that had I pursued biology in my studies and researched cannabis and made strides in medicine, I could have saved him from succumbing to cancer. Another part was that I felt that I could have done more to influence his hemp oil intake. Had I done more, I think I wouldn't have felt the same level of guilt and would have been easier to accept that his passing was unpreventable.
1	Atleast once a week, sometimes everyday when stuff gets really shitty.\n\nI have lots of surface level friends but no close friends and I've only ever had one thing I could even remotely consider a relationship... So it's usually just me pathetically blubbering over how lonely I am.
1	When Trump was elected.  \nDuh.  \n
3	ENTJ or ESTJ?	So yeah, I have the doubt whether I’m ENTJ or ESTJ. I’m super passionate, focused, goal oriented, and I constantly question myself how the world could be better, but I don’t know if I’m faking the “Intuitive mindset” to just be “ENTJ”. When I did the test and showed I’m an ENTJ, it just like connected together, and I started to work on my skills of intuition; I just feel the counterpart “sensing”, I just feel incomplete, somehow bored of sensing and not acting and thinking stuff.\nDo you have cues to know whether I’m ENTJ or ESTJ? Differences between ENTJ and ESTJ? \nAppreciate that, thank you!
8	Both are goal oriented, driven, resilient, love efficiency, and can be blunt. \n\nENTJs like change more, they’re more likely to argue as a way to get their desired outcome, and they’re much quicker thinkers in conversations. 
13	are you lowkey edgy and think thanos did nothing wrong?\n\nentj.
3	If you are an ENTJ, I believe [this article](https://personalityjunkie.com/10/introverted-intuition-ni/) will resonate *tremendously* with you -- as if someone peered into the innermost part of your mind to see how and what you ponder. Compare and contrast with [this article](https://personalityjunkie.com/09/introverted-sensing-sensation-si/) from the same site. Let us know which resonates more!
2	I feel the same, must be somewhere in the middle. But I am much more bigger picture focused rather than detail oriented, and reading the room I pick up on the small things going unnoticed by S’s
2	There are many tests you can take to tell but at the end of the day does it really matter? The MBTI is just an indication of what you might be; even if your test shows ISFP, so what? It isn't as if its God coming down and telling you that you must absolutely obey your 4 letter type.   \n\n\nBesides, ESTJ or ENTJ we are pretty similar in our hatred of inefficiency and will eventually ascend the ranks of the workforce (the latter obviously doing so much faster and going much higher but its inconsequential relative to other less effective types).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut I have found certain hallmark traits that are dead giveaways that you are likely an ENTJ instead of an ESTJ (only works to differentiate not identify an ENTJ among other types)\n\n1) Time Management: If you are 101% on time all day everyday, there's a high chance you're a ST and not a NT. The latter is on time when he feels its important not because he "has to be there" at a certain time  \n2) Work Ethic: When did you last have fun? Upon meeting your goals what is the thing you next think of? Having fun or doing the next task?  \n3) Rebelliousness: How willing are you to flout the rules to get what you want?  \n4) Innovation: Is the path you're taking unprecedented and against all societal conventions? Then you're likely not a ST
1	I think some people on here are pretty poor typists and some are okay reading your ideas probably entj but let me ask you this.\n\n\nDo you tend to identify with being a little rash or do you identify with a safer approach always. Finding possibilities to feel safer. Do you find new possibilities you deem pretty much on par with the other possibilities?
1	Rash, what do you mean with it?\nYeah, I always before getting into a decision, I internally keep my options open untilI find some logical decision.
1	I don't want to say it, but this reads like a pretty sensory post. Don't think too much about identifying with one type or another anyways, just live your own life.\n\nThe N/S dimension in MBTI is actually the same dimension as the Big5 openess.  Take this Big5 test and report back:\n\n[https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/IPIP-BFFM/](https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/IPIP-BFFM/)\n\nLet's cross validate! :D
18	Getting pushback as female ENTJ	I am a 35 year old female ENTJ — highly ambitious, strategic and execution-oriented. But I have been getting lots of push back over the last year — called too abrasive or aggressive or uncollaborative — when really, I was trying to get shit done. My intentions are constantly being misunderstood. How do ENTJs, in particular female ENTJs, deal with this push back in the workplace? \n
34	One thing that has helped me when working with others is this: **people don't remember what you did; they remember how you made them feel.** Even if you produce amazing results and aren't trying to hurt or intimidate anyone, if people feel that way, then that's what they will remember and associate with you.\n\n&#x200B;
12	We males ENTJs get that all the time.  It took me long enough, but I learned that 50% of getting things done is making sure you placate the feelings of the person you are talking to.  It's possible to do both at once, and a useful life skill.\n\nIs there a specific situation you have in mind?
6	Learn to be collaborative because it is actually helpful. Female ENTJ here to say that as an E, I know you probably need people somehow. Don’t let yourself be misunderstood, be clear. Adapt, quit being abrasive. You acn’t really file that as “just your personality”.
6	I'm a tad older than you, and have experienced this a few places during my career.  From my experience, it's been from other women.  Twice, I had to go over their heads and speak to their superiors, who were both men, who I knew understood where I was coming from.  \n\nIn both of those instances, the women were slightly older than me in middle management type positions, managing me as a professional (but they were not experienced in my profession, if that makes sense -- they were simply managers), but the men were much older, and in positions where they were very much senior professionals.  In both of those instances, the middle managers backed off because the senior partners basically told them to because they didn't want me to leave.\n\nIn my current situation, my disagreeing female boss is more than a middle manager.  She lucked into her senior position, and completely manipulated the male who is her boss.  At this stage in my career, if I feel stuck, I know it's time to move on.  \n\nIt took many months to find a new job that fit my needs, but I did, and put in my notice last week.  It feels good.  If they're not going to appreciate my skills and what I bring to the table, they don't deserve them.  Oddly, in my current scenario, my female middle manager has turned out to be more like me, and it's our more senior superior female who has targeted both of us.  I think she feels threatened by anyone who she thinks might go for her job.\n\nI don't know if there's a magic answer, but I feel ya.  And my thought is that I don't tend to experience this in places where I'm challenged and work with people I observe to be more intelligent (in whatever form).  In those places, it seems that we're more of a team, working together towards a goal, instead of a bunch of silos competing with one another.   \n\n  
8	Male ENTP here. Study emotions and how to influence them, because ultimately your coworker 's (negative) emotions in response to your way of interacting with them is the problem. I'm not saying you should do anything Machiavellan, just familiarize yourself with the different ways of interacting with people and the emotional responses garnered by them. 
3	Recognise that the most efficient way to get things done is not always the most straightforward way. Other people have feelings. It's a thing.\n\nYou don't always have to say exactly what you think, you only have to say what's needed to get things done. And sometimes (most times) it means playing to people's emotions. 
3	as u see, the point is putting your focus on people rather than project, at least 200% more than you are doing right now.  \npersonally id suggest studying people / communication and starting to LOVE them objectively , universally so its alligned with emotion.  \n\n2 u should also consider a context change, there are tons of places where (more autistic) these htings , the emotional element IS NOT REQUIRED.   \n\n3 growth mentality. whatever happens, ur growing, take joy in that and in your challenges  
3	Happens to me all the time. Tried being softer then they took me for weak. Dont try to change otherwise u wont feel good about ur way of doing things. What could work is maybe talk about ur decisions, showing that u mean it for the long term greater good and benefits.
2	Ideal Artist - Working alone in solitude, creating masterpiece. \n\nWhat monologue goes inside his/her mind - uhh, no no, yes, no, ahh not this, yess, hmm, this works. \n\nAs work in solitude has this way. \n\nThe team meeting and the cooperation at work has its own way of umm ,yes , no, no no , not this, yes, this one , aha ! \n\nIt's the same and bit prolonged and complex yet results are "attainable". \n\nBest Regards !\nFellow ENTJ 👍

2	Meh, don’t bother. We as ENTJ’s struggle to connect with people because of our high rational thinking, just be yourself.
2	Huh. I'm an INTP, and I'm seeing a very different side of ENTJs today. Not just this thread, but this is the one I'm starting with. Maybe you guys are suffering from Seasonal Affective Disorder and letting your emotional hair down? If so, it sucks that you guys are hurting, but it is helping me see a different side of you.\n\nBased on this different feel from you guys today, and how it's making me see you guys differently, I think I can offer you some advice:\n\nEmbrace your vulnerability. You can use it like a weapon. That might sound Machiavellian, but it's really not. In some ways, it's the opposite of being Machiavellian, since it's about being *more* emotionally honest than you guys usually are. My guess is that you guys are always emotionally hurting a bit, just like us INTPs always secretly care about people and if they respect us. It's just that you don't like to touch it, and your Te usually hides it.\n\n>Korg\_and\_Miek said:  \n>  \n>People don't remember what you did; they remember how you made them feel.\n\nAnd you said that this resonates. I think I agree, it's just that I guess I'm more concerned with getting at the Truth than I am with people liking me or even getting things done. And I think I'm more concerned with making people feel better than I am with them liking me. I read recently that INTPs want to be respected; ENTJs want to be liked. Yet INTPs are generally liked, and ENTJs are generally respected. It's an Fe/Fi thing, I think.\n\nOkay, so you want to be liked. The way to do that is to make people feel good. But making people feel good is itself an end result, not the means you use to get there.\n\nOne way to get people to feel good, one *means* you could use to get them to like you, is to make them feel like they're *helping* you.\n\nThat's were that vulnerability comes in. I know this will probably feel a bit gross (if it's like how Fe feels to INTPs), but a little bit will go a long way. Don't say "x needs to be done, or else y will happen." I think you need to go further to say how y will make you \*feel\*. If an Fe-user (Not just xxFJs, but xxTPs as well) knows that doing x will make you feel better, they'll probably be more motivated to do so. Making you feel better will make them feel good, which will make them like you.\n\nI'm not sure how well this would work with xxTJs, but it sounds like you guys don't have that much trouble with them. So ration the vulnerability gambit to people you think might be Fe-users. That'll help you minimize the ickiness :).\n\nHmm. One last thing, before I move on to responding to other replies instead of globbing them all together into one bit post...:\n\n>\[I am\] highly ambitious, strategic and execution-oriented. But \[I have been\] called too abrasive or aggressive or uncollaborative.\n\nI find it somewhat illuminating that you have a "but" in there :p. 'And' and 'but' are synonymous in terms of formal logic, but 'but' implies a contrast between the two clauses being conjoined. You say that you're "ambitious, strategic, and executed-oriented," and that's a point of pride with you. But I think *most* people would think those terms are almost *synonymous* with "abrasive, aggressive, and uncollaborative." I'm not saying you're wrong that being ambitious, strategic and execution-oriented are Good Things. And I'm not saying that you should feel bad for being those things. I'm just trying to help you understand how the people around you tick.\n\nOne way you can get around being seen as "abrasive, aggressive, uncollaborative" is to mindfully do some emotional labor. Make small talk, praise people for their contributions, etc. Most people aren't living to work like you guys do. Their job often isn't their calling. They're just working so they can live. INTPs are somewhat similar to you guys, except we think of our truest work as "play." If we're very lucky, we might get paid to "play." But a lot of people, their true calling is their families, or their past-times. The job is just the thing they have to do so they can afford to live and tend to those past-times. So helping them with their feels, and talk about the things they're actually passionate about can help smooth things over.\n\nBut I think, in some rare cases, you can accomplish being seen as something more than a hard-core, ambitious go-getter by going the opposite direction: make *them* do *your* emotional labor. Your ambition might be easier to take if others can see there's something emotionally beautiful behind it.\n\nI'm a reader, and one epigram I read once struck me. Something about how much it sucks when you get into a relationship, and because you're in lurve, you make it a point to lend them your favorite books. And then you break up, and you don't get your books back. Solution: borrow *theirs*. I inadvertently did that with my last breakup, and, yeah, it works. I feel bad about not being able to give her her book back, and I get some bad feels every time I see it. But it is, in fact, easier to deal with than having the insult of losing a book you liked added to the injury of loosing somebody you care about.\n\nSo, one way you can handle the emotional luggage of others is to get them to handle *yours*. Dip into that Fi of yours: *Why* are you ambitious? What changes do you want to see in the world? What do you want to do with all that power, once you get it?\n\nYou might be surprised how grateful people might be to have the *opportunity* to carry your "luggage" for you.
1	Use charm wit and love to prove your point. Also try to make friends and connections and show them who you really are. That you’re not this one dimensional figure. I think a lot of people like working with me because they know I am their friend too.
1	Need more details.
0	you just dont be flamboyantly J
8	ENTJs and ENFJs	I just wanted to know how well your experiences are with ENFJs, Both platonic and romantic and if you haven't met any how about what you hypothesize it to be?
6	I married an ENFJ. She is the first person to be able to put me in check while still having great romantic chemistry. Helps me get in touch with my softer side. 
5	Very difficult when one side wants the spotlight that the other currently occupies. Despite a lot of similarities, mainly the differentiation exists in that ENFJ’s are very sensitive to their emotional environment whereas ENTJ’s are attune to objective, unemotionally charged organizational patterns.\n\nExample, when an ENTJ cuts to talking about something concrete in the middle of an ENFJ-centered conversation, the ENFJ may take offense to how the ENTJ didn’t comment on the ENFJ’s position at the center and instead chose to offer an objective solution or explanation to the problem. \n\nCase and point. A stressed ENTJ will close up and withdraw from the rest of the group to think, and if not allowed to do so, will lash out at the person that is making things difficult for them to process or verbally push  that particular person away. A stressed ENFJ will be outwardly passive aggressive, even resorting to stressing others, by making a demonstration or show of hurried anxiety and yelling without targeting anyone in particular. 
3	I recently just got out of a relationship with an ENFJ. Here was my experience. \n\nPro’s:\nThey’re excellent conversationalist,  genuinely care about you, and will bend over backwards to help you out.\n\nCon’s:\nCan be overly affectionate to the point of being smothering and they constantly apologize even for things that they didn’t do.\n\nOverall, not a bad experience. We are still close friends even despite breaking up. \n\nEdit: Formatting 
3	They steal the show. Not easy to deal with, but worth the effort.
3	I work with an ENFJ.\n\nSometimes we'll be talking about a project and we'll be chit chatting and it seems like a heart-felt conversation, then out of the blue I'll get a series of questions related to work... similar to how I would blast questions at a person until I get my answers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen we'll circle back to talking about our day.\n\nIt is... different... hard to explain.
3	ENTJ - I wanna build my empire. \n\nENFJ - Great idea, take care about yourself and the people. \n\nENTJ - I haven't thought about that, well I need you as chief of people\n\nENFJ - Hey I'm your mom ! \n\nENTJ - 🤐\n
2	My new girlfriend is an ENFJ. Few months in and it’s going well. I’m trying to understand her emotional side. 
2	Quite well actually I am friendly with this infj professor and we get along just fine. No issues. Cool woman actually.
3	ENTJs are thoughtfully curious and rational. Enfjs are rigid, thoughtless, and reactive 
3	Does anyone see the world in black and white in contrast to being shades of gray.	I like to my see the world with absolute clarity. A small non harming  lie is still a lie in my eyes. I am straight with my thoughts. I clearly say if I know something or I don't. Even if I am not sure about something I state it like that. But the more I interact with people the more I have felt people make up stories. Bending the truth a little is widely accepted in the society. \n\nThis just makes me sad/ frustrated. I feel I can't connect with people because I can't trust what they say because they might not mean it.  It makes me feel I am not a normal human capable of functioning in the society effectively. \n\n\nDo any of you feel the same? Any suggestions to deal with this better?
3	I tend to take things quite literally, and have a strong sense of right and wrong.  For example, I have separate sick leave and vacation time.  I would never call in sick when I wasn't actually sick, even if I ran out of vacation time.\n\nSimilarly, my husband and I owned a small restaurant.  We struggled at times, so I talked to a lot of competitors about how they succeeded.  All of them, *all of them*, kept secret second sets of books for cash transactions, which they did not pay taxes on.  Many of them paid employees under the table.  I'm too honest to do stuff like that.   \n\nAnother example: my husband frequently tells white lies for no reason whatsoever.  It's very frustrating.  He'll say he's 5 minutes away while driving, when in reality he's 10 minutes away.  What's the point?  He'll say he's on his way when he's yet to leave the house.  He'll say he spent $150 on something instead of the actual $200.  It's like he gets through life by rounding and exaggerating or undervaluing everything.  It makes no sense because it causes more headaches on the back end.  Then, it makes me question what important things is he lying about if it's so easy for him to lie about little things to me and other people?\n\nIf someone asks me similar questions, I provide the exact answer.  For instance, I spent $199 on that item.  Or, I'm 2.3 miles away according to my map on my phone.  Or, I haven't left the house yet because my children are throwing temper tantrums, but we'll be out the door soon.  And so on.   
3	>I feel I can't connect with people because I can't trust what they say because they might not mean it\n\nYou *can't* trust anyone, it's the objective truth, but you have to separate facts by their level of importance. Anyone could give you false information, on purpose or unintentionally. Surround yourself with people who tend to be honest and be mindful of people who tend to lie. Asking clarifying questions can help against half-truths in a professional setting, otherwise most lies people tell are not that important\n\nI can relate to you in a way. I guess having strong Fi made me ignorant of the fact that most people like to lie, even in situations where they don't really benefit from lying. Once I fully realized this I started taking people's words a lot less seriously and became more skeptical in general
2	Seeing stuff in black and white can get complicated really easily. Imagine a kid telling a lie to escape an unjustified punishment by the parents. Is he totally wrong for telling the lie? Is he absolutely right for avoiding a mine? \n\nHere's another scenario. USA dropping the bombs over Japan. Are they wrong for killing many civillians? Because if they don't drop those bombs, the Amercan soldiers will have to fight a bloody war. The Japanese soldiers will do everything it takes to stop the USA, That includes strapping a bomb to themselves, going under a tank to blow the tank up. They rather die than surrender. \n\nMany things in this world are in the 50 shades grey. What's considered wrong to you may be what's necessary to the one commiting the crime. If everything is easily in black and white, then the need for judges, lawyers and prosecutors will drop dramatically. Try to think of thing in their shoes. If a businessman found a loophole around a law that could save him millions of dollars, why not? Technically he did not commit a crime. 
2	Our brains are very limited in their computing power. We take shortcuts all the time. For example, language itself is one giant approximation of reality.\n\nSo you are guilty of the same thing, just maybe to a different degree.\n\nThe world may be black and white at the level of quarks, but even then I am not sure. As soon as you start assigning verbal categories  to different objects that contain trillions upon trillions of particles, you enter a grey area. Sorites paradox will kick your butt every time.\n\nP.S. Down-vote without a comment? Lame!\n
1	I do this and I hate it, but it’s unavoidable. You either should have done something or you should not have. I either like you or I don’t. A process is either correct or incorrect, right or wrong.\n\nI do not really relate to anyone or anything anymore, except random posts like this on reddit. And they’re usually posted by autistic ppl or other people in the gamma quadrant (ISFP, ESFP, INTJ, ENTJ.)
1	Mor or less so yes. I am not as stuck to it as I was, but I am pretty much this yes. I see the world as being non-relative. I am not big on relative philosophy but I’ve learnt to let the stuff go unless you’re being really rude about it. Then I will not. But yes. Generally. And sometimes I just shake my head but not say anything to the person. sometime it’s better to mind your own business and be polite about it then point out how people always lie or see the world in grays.
3	Winning an ENTJ back	Hello ENTJS, it's an INTP in need of advice.\n\nI started seeing this ENTJ I met from online dating a few weeks ago and sparks were flying on our first date. We were texting fiercely nonstop during the first week between that date & our next weekend together. We were already idealizing what could be and fantasizing about a potential future. We both had brought up wanting this to turn into something serious if all went well. \n\nAnyways, the second weekend roles around and we spent 3 evenings in a row together. I can sense by the end of it that we both need space and felt as though things were moving too quickly. So I did just that- I kept myself busy this past week and made separate plans for the weekend. \n\nI noticed he was leaving me on read & taking forever to respond to texts this week. I just texted him this morning asking, "I'm going to be up front. Did you lose interest here?" I don't enjoy having my feelings toyed with. He said, "I guess IDK what I think"\n\nI understand that we got ahead of ourselves early on, but he told me on our second weekend together that he is the type to tell people up front how he feels instead of "ghosting". \n\nI'm just going to leave him be for him to either further pursue or not. Is this the right choice? How can I win this ENTJ back? I figure asserting my independence through ignoring him now is best.\n\n** he has initiated i'd say 70%+ of our plans & deep conversation so far. I went along because I like him a lot, but did not push hanging out because I figured this may happen..\n\n****02/15 update- I got over it, didn't reply to him and now a week later he reached out saying he didn't intend for this (to end things so quickly) to happen. He just needed to step back for a bit. He is resuming texting me, but I am playing distant. Interesting... Thanks for your input everyone.
13	As an ENTJ myself once I’m done, I’m done. I don’t go back.
4	slow the fuck down lol 
3	ENTJs are known for their decisiveness and efficiency. He would most likely confront you if he is not interested and if he says “I guess IDK what I think,” it most likely means he’s in the process of deciding whether or not he wants to continue things. You can’t really win ENTJs back. Once we make a decision, we don’t look back. Although one thing you can do is ask why he is not interested in continuing this relationship and there are high chances that he would be straight forward. 
2	Had my heart broken by 2 entjs so far.  Weird situations both times, we weren't actually together as things were in the way. I wanted to try again after situation cleared, one seemed to want to. I should mention these were deep connections- being an infp. So ordinarily, I think with anyone else, the guy would not have entertained a second go.\n\nI will mention that 1 got put off by something so small, in my mind, I just didn't know how to take it. Sometimes entjs make fast conclusions based on assumptions and cut people off quickly. Unfortunately, it means you have to think equally as brutally when it comes to them. I love entjs and would give them many chances, but they just tend to not think the same way. As hard as that is to realise. It's so challenging, because some entjs are super open, others very flighty when it comes to emotions so it's hard to tell what kind of entj you're dealing with- higher f, or much lower f makes a huge difference.\n\nI tend to assume if they aren't pursuing it's not happening. With entjs I think you have to enjoy the time you have, and accept the reality of situation (actions) at all times. If actions aren't moving toward closeness, it suggests "finished". If I were you, i'd just say thanks for your time, goodluck with your career and future. So you give yourself closure. Sucks, but I think for this entj the F isn't as developed, or they are not as interested. With entjs sometimes you won't know which one it is. They would be infuriated with this kind of analysing, so i'd just pick a course of action and stick to it, and not analyse too much and just "move on".  \n\n\n\*prepared for downvotes\* lol
1	Yikes
1	I'm a female, but even for me, when I'm done with someone, that's it.  \n\nHowever, I'll also add that I do not see the point of useless texting or phone calls about seemingly nothing.  If I don't have something to say, or I'm focused on something else, you may not hear from me for months.  Even my female friends don't think I pay enough attention to them.  My mom thinks I don't call her enough.  It's like, dude, I see you all the time, why do I need to call you?  I just don't get needy people.\n\nBut, yeah, a few weeks in and the fact that you're already over analyzing at this level probably isn't a good sign.   
1	What does he do? As a ENTJ that is still striving for success, I sometimes feel unworthy to be with people I like. I feel that if I fail, I'll be letting them down. \n\nIf he is not where he wants to be in terms of his career, this may be what he is feeling. Seems like you're the girl he wants but it's the self reflection that he fears most.\n\nedit: also at the same time, I feel that being with someone that I really like is a source of support I could really use. But it's a big decision to make. It's quite selfish of us… but yea.
0	well, i know this is hard,  but  \n(if he is a good one) ask him for guidance on how to get better , like honest complete feedback what you can improve on   \n2 - what is his ideal relationship with you? how low did you drop ?   \nbe mindful (especially if not entj or a shit one) to take care of him not anticipating ur a needy bitch that just cant let go.
24	Do you guys test people, without really thinking about it?	I often test people without even thinking about it, basically I test if people are strong enough for me and align with my fundamental views enough!\n\nDo you other entjs do this? 
10	Somewhat. I like to think of it as testing the waters to see if we’re compatible. I don’t think it’s a trait exclusive to entj’s but maybe more common based on the judging trait.
5	I've been told by my partner that I sometimes prompt people into saying something interesting or outrageous (at the cost of coming across as intimidating). \n\nWhen they fail (in the sense of refusing to say anything outside the norm) - I tend to completely ignore them. When they don't, we usually get along swimmingly.\n\n
4	I analyse everybody and everything. In sales I have adjusted my demeanor,language and approach based on my perception of those customers to maximize my results.  I'm not sure I could go through life any other way. I also automatically do assessments of business staffing and viability as soon as I walk in the door. I am not sure this is me being entj or whether I am just weird 
3	I thought I was the only one who did this. I push my limits with SOME people to see if they would be beneficial to my life. Based on answers then I proceed to place them in my life. Close friends, acquaintances, one time people, etc,. It is to see if we are compatible and to see how some people react. I’m really good at reading people just like I’m sure most of you are and I always observe and watch people. I gauge reactions and listen closely to how wording is. 
3	All the time, especially at the beginning w people Im starting to feel for😊
3	Yes. All the time. It’s a filter 
3	I think I do it subconsciously. 
3	This is not a game 
8	There are different levels of interactions with people. Some relationships become close and some interactions last less than a minute.\n\nIf my toilet is leaking like a motherfucker and I need to have it fixed before 6 AM or else, I am very nice to the plumber and try to match their personality.\n\nYou are not always on top. On Reddit I'm the shit though.\n
1	I think most people probably do in some way, but how do you test people? 
1	I don't know if I'd call it *testing* people, but I have a figurative list of questions in my back pocket.  Some are space fillers, but if it seems that someone actually might be worth getting to know, I dive deeper, with more meaningful questions.  Then again, this takes a lot of time I don't have, unless I'm trapped somewhere with the person, like in the office, or in a vehicle, or at a party.
1	I don't feel like I do. I think I rely more on their energy and how I feel around them.
1	No, not really but I can definitely tell if you and I will get on really quickly.
3	ESFJ looking for Career Advice.	I'm sure a handful of you here may be in Private Equity, I-Banking, or Venture Capital. Or, even better, you're ENTJ, and you're a kickass action-oriented killer with a plan. And, Mr., or Ms. kickass action-oriented killer, I need your help.\n\nI'm currently a lowly retail banker trying to determine my best course of action. I want to break into the world of Finance at the highest level. Something about it is just exciting. Yes, spreadsheet work can be menial, but... at some point you get to pitch BODs and C-Level Execs. That gets me hard like a diamond. The thrill of doing a good job in front of top level people excites me. That said, I'm from the outside of the outside of the outside looking in. You'll understand why here:\n\nI'm unfortunately split between two decisions, which include the following: study for the GMAT, and/or study excel, valuation techniques, and everything associated with PE/IB/VC (I understand that each division/industry is quite different). I need a 740+ to get into a target B-School that can help me leverage connects.\n\nFurther explaining who I was then and who I am now:\nI was an underachieving kid growing up. I figured out how to just make it and be decent. Now, I'm 25, and being decent should not be my standard. It'll be the reason I shoot myself in the shoot 5-10-20 years from now. I watch a lot of people who are just okay with okay, and I see where they end up. So I'm saying fuck that-I need to push the limits. Also, I am very interested in Finance.\n\nEducational Background: \nShitty SAT score and a 3.0 GPA from a Non-Target.\n\nCareer Background: \nTook a dealership job out of college; afterwards, a phone sales job; and now I'm in retail banking.\n\nIf you'd be so kind:\n1) Feedback-your angle on my angle.\n2) Critique-shit on me if you have to, Te feedback is very necessary.\n3) Any form of help would be greatful.
3	> I'm unfortunately split between two decisions, which include the following: study for the GMAT, and/or study excel, valuation techniques, and everything associated with PE/IB/VC (I understand that each division/industry is quite different). I need a 740+ to get into a target B-School that can help me leverage connects.\n\nWhy not both?  If you have a lower SAT and GPA, you need to bust ass and get a great GMAT.  Put in the time.  Use your degree to network, because life is all about connections.  Nothing to it but to do it.
2	not sure what exactly attracts u to it, as im an alien to the topic.   \nbut - if u get into it, ur ESFJ not only wouldnt help u, but it would prevent you from being succesful.   \nthis first step is good, asking for help, but perhaps find a mentor, inside and outside the context, and keep ur options open imo.  \ni dont really see why you wouldnt want to work more with people than numbers. fuck wealth
2	Hey, I used to intern in investment banking until I left finance to grow my first business. \n\nIn summation, I think you’re better suited to going to law school if you can kill the LSAT and shooting for Big Law. Unless you’ve got other killer experiences you haven’t mentioned here, I don’t see any worthwhile b-school admitting. (Worthwhile = will get you into high finance). \n\nKilling the LSAT just means so much more for law school admissions than a similarly killer GMAT score does for b-school. \n\nI love retail bankers, I think you guys are awesome, and you have added great value to my life. However, that is not how b-school ad coms and high finance employers perceive your job. \n\nNothing is impossible, but there’s almost nothing of a proven route here. I say Big Law, or move into something like real estate and push yourself to become a rainmaker salesman, or start your own business. (Or if you’re working for a bulge bracket, *maybe* luck out meeting the right person who can help transfer you to something that’s not super competitive)
2	My Finance Dpt Chair once gave a seminar on finance. If you can walk into a fund manager's office and interview him/her and literately converse in finance, they're going to tell HR to find a spot to hire you. You weren't even looking for a job, they want to offer you a job. This is where you win. Make them want you. \n\nCSULA is a good example of a terribad school with S tier networking. The business professors there are straight out of Downtown LA or from Wall St. 
2	Ask an estj I think the answers there are more pragmatic.\n\nI also will say this get a college education as to whereever you can. Start off with a community college. Get use to school, work hard get the gpa and necessary grades then look at transfering to a good school or a fair one. So yeah. I would say a degree is pretty big these days. Don’t aim for top school especially as a returning student try a community college first.
13	Young Female ENTJ fearing isolation	I need people to survive, I lean pretty heavily on the E. But people at my school keep setting me up to become isolated. Most of the time I’m surrounded by idiots, but now these idiots have figured out how to Taylor their questions to make people hate me. I choose not to answer them then they think I’m stupid. What the hell. Nobody respects my opinion ever, but they continue to ask. They are infuriating. I’m worried I’ll And up isolated. They say it’s lonely at the top, I don’t want that.
16	> Most of the time I’m surrounded by idiots\n\nYou are right, everyone is stupid. However, you need to remember that everyone is stupid *including you.* You are not infallible, and you need to accept that.\n\n>these idiots have figured out how to Taylor their questions to make people hate me\n\n>Nobody respects my opinion ever, but they continue to ask.\n\nThis is your Ni going into overdrive. They are probably not trying to tailor their questions to make you look stupid. They are probably not conspiring against you. If people are asking your opinion, they want to hear your opinion. Just because people are not worshiping you does not mean you are not liked or wanted.\n\nRemember to have some humility. Remember that you are an important ingredient in the pot, but there is a whole social stew that's filled with other important ingredients as well.\n\nYou won't be lonely at the top if you continually show respect to your peers, even when they are being stupid. Your goal should be to become a respected peer, not the queen.
5	Suck it up. They're the ones manipulating the social context, and they're winning. This means that they're better than you. Get rid of that superiority complex and learn and grow.\n\nIt's worth enduring the idiots for the few tolerable people out there.
3	Don't take it personally when people don't listen to your opinions/advice.  It takes awhile, but people eventually come around to treating you with the respect you deserve.  Remember that they are people, and people are prone to make mistakes and do hurtful things.    \n\n\nYou are young; you have a lot of life, friends, time, experiences, career, education, and a million other things ahead of you!  Everything is temporary, including this situation. Learn what you can from it and move on when the time comes. 
4	>Most of the time I’m surrounded by idiots\n \nOkay, don't take this personally, but subscribe to /r/iamverysmart.\n \n>have figured out how to Taylor their questions to make people hate me\n \nCheck out the wikipedia article for psychological manipulation and pay special attention to how people use these techniques... It's sometimes empowering just to know the names of things so that you can not take them personally and realize they're just a fact of life/human behavior. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_manipulation
2	Even though I was bright, I blundered my way through high school under the very wrong idea that nothing anyone else said to or about me mattered. Looking back, I missed a lot of opportunities to grow socially. You don't have to respond to it, but you should tune into it. \n\nThe most important thing I took away was to be patient, to not go out of my way to make anyone look bad even if they're being ridiculous. Especially because I gave them plenty of opportunities to return the favor. People will be more willing to give you the benefit of the doubt that way.
2	A: Most kids are idiots these days\n\nB: Yeah you might be fucked\n\nC: If any still exist, find like-minded people\n\n&#x200B;
2	It's simple. Stop surrounding yourself with idiots.
1	You can talk to me, if you want. I fluctuate between both IXTJ types
1	Not many people like us for who we truly are, better get used to it. \n\nNow learn some social skills.
1	Haha this is funny.  It's all very true.  ENTJ's get misunderstood all the time...like all the time.  I still do and I'm in my 30's.  Super successful and people gravitate towards me because of that and my ambition.  However yes you may think the people around you are idiots and they are.  But...you won't be able to function that way.  You see these idiots are needed.  ENTJ's by sheer will need to recruit people to make things happen, so these idiots are your lifeforce.  If you think of it that way you can succeed.  Treat people nicely now matter how much you want to write them off for "being dumb"  it's a big lesson.  I know because I have burned many bridges until things started to click.  And the click is realizing that you need people in order to get things done.  And challenge yourself to motivate them.  If you see it this way you can succeed and be seen as a wonderful leader who gives people a chance.\n\nOh yeah and make sure you walk the talk before you write people off lol.  You have to have some validation that allows you to think you are smarter than people.  You can I guess just think you're smarter than most people but everyone thinks they're right.  What do you have that shows you are right, it seems like you have no leverage here.  Until then stay quiet and climb the ranks until you can change things and people have to listen to you.  As an ENTJ obviously what you are looking for is power.  I suggest you start a project at school that resonates with you, recruit people and learn to work with them. \n\n&#x200B;
0	Teens can be vicious.\n\nYou need to prove to someone that you are not worth fucking with. Find people to hang out with outside of your school. Don't cave in to your E. If you get disrespect, explain to them once that you do not need to take shit from them and then cut them off.

Also, always do what is necessary and nothing more. Giving your 100% when 50%  would've cut it is simply stupidity; redirect that energy and find something else more productive to do with it (like having fun).

1	Working towards a world where the only people that die, are the ones that choose to. The first responses are, if this is even achieved, how do we deal with population? I just say 1 problem at a time, human beings are determined as heck when they're motivated, & they always find a way. Worst case scenario, nothing changes & we die anyway.

Why don’t you go ask r/estj that last question they can give you more insites on scheduling and prioritizing. I keep my goal in mind and then go do it. Ni is very hard to explain how we do it. We evaluate what is the best end and use consequential type of thinking.

3	Advice for a party at a business school tonight? (cross-posted from r/socialanxiety)	In a couple weeks, I'm starting a graduate program in finance, and this evening (i.e., in a couple hours), I'm going to a welcome social event for all graduate students in the business school. I'm really nervous for this event. I really want to go because I want to make new friends and have a good time, but I'm afraid I'm going to be awkward or embarrass myself or something.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoes anyone have some kind of advice to help me feel more comfortable and/or socially confident for this event?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is mostly cross-posted from r/socialanxiety. It's more appropriate for that sub, I know. But I figured I'd post it here because, as an ENTJ, I feel like other ENTJs could give me some specialized advice.
3	Forget the idea of doing perfectly. Even if you would mess it up it doesn't matter tomorrow's a new day. You cannot do everything perfectly. Go with the mindset "it doesn't matter if I fail" and just do the best you can in a way to still feel comfortable. You will not die. And if you feel uncomfortable you should worry about yourself, not about others in that moment. Its important to make yourself feel good, not others. I‘m an ENTP but I hope this helped.
3	ENTP chiming in, who has been to a lot of networking events.\n\nFirstly, is this a student-only event, or will there be faculty/working professionals there? If the latter, you will need to be on better behaviour.\n\nTry to limit your alcohol consumption. No more than two glasses is probably best. People have more, but some of those people also drink too much and make an ass of themselves before the school year has even started. Don't be that dude. Also in terms of food consumption, please do not stuff your face with canapes. I've seen people do this out of nervousness, but it can be very obvious if you're on plate 4 when other people are finishing off plate 1. \n\nMake sure you're appropriately dressed. I'd say business casual is probably fine. A nice shirt, a skirt if you're a woman, some slacks if you're a guy. I wouldn't wear a tie. Nice(r) shoes.\n\nSince this is a welcome social, don't be the person who comes out of the gate rattling off all of his or her accomplishments. It's not cool and just paints a target on your back. Obviously, it's fine to talk about things you've done, but some people can definitely get a little obnoxious listing every internship they've ever done and all the people Their Father Knows. \n\nHonestly, just be on your good behaviour and try to have fun. Remember to be kind and courteous to others and you'll largely do fine. Don't forget to mingle. I'll keep a note in my head to introduce myself to at least 10 new people by the end of the night and exchange a few words with each. You can settle into a group, but don't just pick one person and talk to them the entire time. If you're lucky, you might click with one person and you guys can do the mingling together - just don't limit yourself too much, y'know?\n\nRemember that other people are also likely to be nervous, and that's okay! You all just want to create a good impression. My personal strat is to look around the room for someone else standing alone/looking a bit unsure, and strike up a conversation with them. They'll often be quite relieved someone is talking with them and you might get a good dynamic going.
1	You already know how to be a likeable person. Listen to others, think twice before speaking, and never be crass. Don't speak badly of others and don't reveal others' secrets. But don't be afraid to be extroverted or emotional
2	21 year old female ENTJ (8w9) AMA	Feel free to ask if you have any questions! I'm not sure if there are many females with my mbti type and enneagram on here so I figured I'd make an AMA post. 
10	> I'm not sure if there are many females with my mbti type and enneagram \n\nAhem.  Supposedly, female ENTJs make up ~2% of the population.  Where I live in the U.S., that would amount to about 6.5M of us.  Not sure if I'd say that's an insignificant number...meaning we're not special snowflakes.  In addition, the most common enneagram for ENTJs is 8. 
3	When did you lose your first tooth?
3	How do you get along with male ENTJs?
2	Hello, I'm also a female ENTJ. Just older by quite a margin. I'm 8w7, more of the stereotype of an ENTJ there if my memory serves (I haven't delved into Enneagram as much, admittedly.)\n\nWhat are you doing with your life right now and what are your plans for the future?\n\nWhat are your thoughts on romantic relationships? \n\nDo you know any other ENTJs, if so, how well do you get along with them? What about other NT types? \n\nWhat is your relationship with your parents like? (If that's too personal you can just ignore this one.) \n\nDo you like music, if so, what genres? \n\nAre you religious or spiritual at all? \n\nWhat are your thoughts on NF types, specifically INFJs and INFPs? \n\nWhat are your thoughts on ESTJs? \n\n
3	How are you feeling? 21 was a hard time in life for me. Don't burn bridges.
2	hey, its your 3w4 twin over here\n\nhow are your relationships with other females? for me, my whole life ive tended to have more male friends, both close friends and acquaintances. i only have one female friend, and shes in my close circle. wondering if its a type thing.
2	**What are your thoughts on your close relative the INTJ?** \n\nAlso if it was a productive day off what would you be found doing? \n\nWhats your greatest achievement? \n\n&#x200B;
1	How do you find yourself different to the fem ENTJ 8w7 or the fem ENTJ 3?
1	Awesome. Do you think you care less or more than ENTJ males do when it comes to appearance/looks?\n\nAlso a more obvious question perhaps but what is your current occupation in life and what would be your dream/goal? 
1	As an 8w9, do you sometimes question your ENTJness for being less ~~agressive~~ aggressive than the ENTJ stereotype? Do you think "I could be more proactive" 70 times a day? Do you sometimes think you would be much forward in life if you had taken more risk in the past?
1	INTP - Where do I find female ENTJs?
4	Asking for some intuition to help out a sensor !!	Hey ENTJs.  I've been unsure about whether I'm truly an I or ESTP (of course, a dead split between E/I is possible).  I was just hoping to get some intuition + analysis on this topic from y'all.\n\n**My ISTP characteristics (Ti-dominance, Ni>Fe):**\n\n\-Love to think, analyze deeply, interpret (e.g. spending so much time thinking about MBTI) sometimes far more than socializing. I am also pretty adept at understanding metaphors and future implications (Ni>Fe)\n\n\-Although I've made impulsive decisions, nearly all risks I take have been deeply considered and analyzed, *probably* more deeply than some risks taken by ESTPs\n\n\-Some days, I literally am unable to make basic conversation with people. I just cannot think of anything to talk about. All I seem to want to do is be alone and watch TV shows, ski, walk around my city, excercise)\n\n\-Certainly have 'Aha' moments when stumped by tough issues (Ni>Fe)\n\n\-I can't stand being in a position where I need to oversee and organize people. Fuck that.\n\n\-Rarely start conversations w/ classmates idk well unless absolutely necessary...and even then, I don't enjoy doing it\n\n\-I'm openly a bit of a loner. I might chill w/ a friend group for a little, but often in school, I'm seen alone or with by best friend who's a textbook INTP.\n\n\-In restaurants/open settings, I usually gravitate towards the walls/corners and away from the center. I really hate when everyone can see me.\n\n**My ESTP characteristics (Se-dominance, Fe>Ni):**\n\n\-I'm persuasive. I Can spew highly believable/realistic ESTP charming 'bullshit' (I.E. when in trouble with parents, college interviews)\n\n\-When socializing with people I'm close to or if I'm in a non-apathetic mood, I can act very goofy/slapstick Se humor, even offensive at times, and I can certainly gain energy from this\n\n\-I *can* be outspoken. If needed, I will not hesitate to call someone out or debate my points, or to take the lead on group projects (though I dislike doing this).\n\n\-Quite aware of the mood (Fe>Ni) of a room is...I just don't always choose to give a fuck (Ik I can be an asshole)\n\n\-Not terse like an ISTP (this whole fucking post lol). In English class I tend to get points off for excess wordiness\n\n\-When faced with a problem, I tend to act first, and then think about the effects of that action on my environment to use deductive reasoning (it seems that an ISTP would analyze first, then act but ik they troubleshoot a lot too)\n\n\-I have ADHD, and had anger issues as a kid\n\nIk this is long as hell. All comments appreciated, thanks so much.
0	4 subtypes. One type more influenced by his dominant function, the other more influenced by his auxiliary. It's possible that you might be attracted to both descriptions of a same page, it would mean you're an overall balanced type. If you can't relate to any of it, you might be too young or not an STP at all. If you feel like you can't decide between those two types I would suggest taking a look at ESTP-Ti and ISTJ-Se. \n\n[https://www.sociotype.com/socionics/types/LSI-ISTj/subtypes/](https://www.sociotype.com/socionics/types/LSI-ISTj/subtypes/) [https://www.sociotype.com/socionics/types/SLE-ESTp/subtypes/](https://www.sociotype.com/socionics/types/SLE-ESTp/subtypes/) 
4	Do any ENTJs out there believe in astrology?	Why or why not?
20	no, because I find it silly. Besides that, my friend Nick was born a few minutes after me in the same hospital and we are very different and nothing about our lives is similar. 
16	It's stupid. *Edit:* No offense.
9	Lol heck no
9	When you are born, your OBGYN doctor exerts more gravitational pull on you than all of the celestial bodies (other than Earth) combined.
9	No.\n\nBut I do believe in belief.  So, I acknowledge that people that do believe in astrology might shape their lives and personality according to astrological expectations.\n\nBut that's as far as it goes.  
7	Wouldn’t say I believe in it but my cousin and I used to study it detailedly like trines, houses, quincunxes and shit when younger. So I am somewhat open to it. If somehow an astronomer was to figure out the mathematics behind it or something, I wouldn’t be shocked. \n\nI can’t deny that it is creepily somewhat accurate. Maybe it’s a coincidence that my tightest orb is mercury square Pluto and I’m drawn to investigating everything Plutonian despite its strain, maybe it’s not.
5	No, but it’s interesting. I am very into Jungian psychology.
5	ENTP here. Astrology is a pseudoscience, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have some use. If you have the mentality of "This is all objectively true information about me" then you're just being silly. However, if you use the framework provided by it to see things from a new perspective, then, that's useful. 
13	Lmao it’s like any other personality description. Fun, but we know it’s not something to be die hard about 
4	I don't believe in astrology, but I don't think it's completely useless. 
4	Astrology or signs?\n\nI didn’t know my actual date of birth for a long time. The birthday I thought I had, and my actual birthday, both contain traits that I can relate a little to — just like I can probably relate to a little of all the astrological signs. So no. But I don’t put much stock in mbti, either.
4	I don’t. But someone I respect told me that it truly helped him understand people on a regular basis. the way Meyers-Briggs does, and i thought there might be something to it. But I don’t understand it.
3	I personally believe in it and I think those that don't are just confused as to what astrology really is. It isn't simply stuff like "which character on friends are you based on your zodiac sign". If someone just looks up their birth chart, they can gain some really interesting insight on some of their personal qualities that they were never quite able to explain
13	Idk if I believe in it but I think it’s fun 
8	Astrology yes, horoscopes no. In my experience people conform to the signs a little too much for it to be ignored. What I can’t figure out though is why
2	I don't take it seriously though I do find it fun and entertaining at times. 
2	Not real but definitely fun. 
2	Believe, no. Find amusing? Yes, indeed. 
2	Complete garbage.  The highly abused and even monetized  arbitrary belief that ones life has anything to do with the alignment of stars during their birth night.  How do the "astrologists" commune with the heavens for their information?  It drives me up a creek when someone says something to someone such as "oh that's because you're an Aries"
2	No, I think it's purely coincidental. Although I do find the topic intriguing. 
6	It's more fun to believe in it than not, and I match my sign (Leo). And if you want to get really new-agey, it makes sense that invisible high-frequency rays expelled from the most powerful nuclear reactors in the universe would have some kind of effect on newborn children.\n\nI don't hardcore believe in it, but I see the argument. And it's a fun argument. Meh.
1	Of course not. But I will humor someone who does in order to gain a tactical advantage. 
1	No, bullshit
13	Does anyone want to debate with me ? My ENTJ bf and I (INTP) used to have such fun debating!	The mental or intellectual sparring was pretty invigorating. He would almost always let me win. But it was like a game to us both I think, slightly rough and tumble play. God we loved to argue for the fun of it and he appreciated that I could hold my own and not get intimidated and back down.
13	Sure you're not Entp?
8	Ok, I'll bite. Hillary would turn any frog gay. Change my mind.
4	NSFW tag missing
4	Only if you are willing to die for our meaningless mental exercise
3	The bulldozer architecture is actually good. \n\nChange my mind 
3	Arguing is annoying. 
2	In America, a lot of people think that the reason we started seeing more cases of combat-related ptsd around the Vietnam War era is because it was better understood and starting to become less tabboo to talk about. And I disagree. I feel the main difference is that the soldiers of previous wars had months to sort themselves out on the ship ride home. Those vital months provided constant support among those who actually understood each other and the realities of what they faced. As opposed to Vietnam when soldiers were riding jets home and having supper with their families less than a day after living in the hell that is war. 
2	Tom Green's 2001 comedy film, *Freddy Got Fingered,* is an art house masterpiece that pushes the boundaries of how a comedy screenplay should be written. Change my mind. 
2	I'd love to, I'm a master debater.
2	I like debating if you get to cuss and insult your opponent too.  Like funny insult not mean insult.  It’s hard to find people that see the fun in that and don’t take it seriously.  Actually I want them to take it seriously but not personally. But also be really witty. With lots of obscure movie and other social references.  And drink beers too...
1	ENTJ female who also studied physics/math and I love to argue so we might get along too well to have debates lol
1	yes. shooot. facebook ok?
1	What do you debate about ?
1	No, because you wouldn’t survive.
1	IPCC made a mistake.\n\nhttps://www.informath.org/Contest1000.htm\n 
10	How do you guys deal with anger?	I'm not talking mild irritation. I'm talking that kind of anger that makes you want to tear the walls down and absolutely demolish everything in sight. Obviously we don't do that, but fucking hell does it suck.\n\nDue to unforeseen circumstances, today is one of those days, and I keep pushing people away. How do you deal with this?
9	Chopping firewood. It's destructive and productive at the same time.
8	That's my secret captain. I'm always angry. 
5	Do you have a bicycle?\n\nFirst thing you do is get the fuck away from all your problems as fast as you can and 2 hours later you turn around and face them and get sprint toward your problems.\n\nSounds heroic at first but you have got to eat and drink and use a bathroom at some point.\n
4	Music, exercise, venting to a close friend. 
6	I've felt this way a number of times over the past few months due to some individuals attempting to exploit friends of mine with an agreeable temperament. I've found that I've only ever found calm once I've pieced together a strategy to absolutely tear that person down (e.g. Penal codes that could lock them away).\n\nUp to that point, working out has always served as a reliable mechanism for releasing a lot of that aggression.\n\nDon't ever try to bottle that anger up for an extended period of time - it's toxic and will sometimes only make the situation worse.
3	I run
3	Cardio is great because you can burn off the aggressive energy and then transition to planning a way to deal with the situation. Also, I don't get that angry often because it normally means I've given someone enough of a leash on me  so to speak so I'm normally annoyed with myself as well. Turns out cardio helps with that too. 
3	Running, talking/venting to friends, yelling out loud in my car, violent video games, I gotta have an outlet.\n\nAnd remember, there is nothing wrong with you for having that. Because hell do people make you think there is
2	So all the healthy cardio exercise everyone mentioned above and if that doesn’t work - a couple glasses of wine and a good roll in the hay. 
1	Biking, music, learning new things, reading old journal entries 
1	1. Don't get that angry in the first place. \n\nIf you get that angry it means you've lost self-control and control of the situation. Don't lose control.\n\n2. Jogging\n\nWhen I feel that angry (very, very rarely) I literally crave going jogging, like it's an addiction. It's not an addiction, just an excellent learned behaviour. I can physically feel the tension, stress and rage leaving my body. The surge of happy hormones is also incredible.
1	I find it very hard to deal with emotions of any kind, not just fake it for others but actually dealing with them. I do it best when i go to the gym and listen to my music. It gives a controlled environment where i can focus on dealing with whatever is bothering me. And clears my mind enough to distance myself from the feelings and deal with them in a more rational way. \n\nOne thing that has helped me really control my anger is martial arts. There’s a lot if magic and wisdom there. 
0	Can you be ENTJ, or even have T in your personality and be on the left wing?	
14	There are retional reasons to be left leaning just as there are rational reasons to be right leaning. Ive met plenty of both. I've also met a slew of very irrational conservatives. I don't understand your question. 
15	Yes. Remember that there are plenty of ENTJs who live in socially democratic countries. I personally think there are some things that should not be profit-driven (healthcare, prisons). I also believe that in order to have a truly meritocratic society you need to address inequality, and aim for equitable outcomes. Politics and ultimately distribution of resources come down to values, which can be cultural. There are arguments for efficiency on either side.
7	I think I understand the spirit you're coming from here. Even intelligent, rational thinkers can be predisposed to hanging their worldview on what they *hope* human nature is, or what they want it to be, rather than what it actually is.\n\nWishful thinking is still thinking.\n\nEdit: grammar
5	Kim Schmitz, where you are from, there are only two choices anyway: left & lefter.
9	Yup.  Buffett and Gates to name a couple famous ones.  
3	ENTJs are known to be forward thinking. Conserveatives aren't. It's literally in their name. To conserve is to remain in the status quo. As an ENTJ, all I see is a flawed political system being tainted mostly by conservatives. ENTJs typically look for a more efficient way to do things but if you have a 60/40 relation T to F, you're more likely to empathize and find a solution that doesn't cause havoc even though the solution is the most efficient. Example, It would be most efficient of us to blaze through our current economic stage as outline by Rostow's stages of economic growth. But in order to rush through and get to the next stage, you'd be leaving behind great numbers of people. Here is where killing the TPP was good.\n\nNow I'll bring up supply-side economics. It'll never work. I don't know why conservatives are still waving this flag but it's stupid. "omg unemployment is at an all time low!" We could have full employment with slavery so unemployment is not a good metric for measuring an economy's health. Gerrymandering. Yes, both sides use it but it is mostly used by conservatives. Evidence? Cities like Austin, TX. The wall… almost no emperical evidence that large numbers are crossing the border by land. Rather it's overstaying visas. Also we are at a net negative legal/illegal migration rate with Mexico. \n\nAll in all, I think most ENTJs that have a better understanding of business, statistics, and economics are left leaning. If you're looking to get informed, watch Secular talk or Destiny's debated on Youtube. \n\nDon't get me started on Net Neutrality, that was a shit show.
3	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Rollins#Campaigning_and_activism\n\n...\n\nIn August 2015, Rollins discussed his support for Bernie Sanders as a candidate in the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries.[109]\n
3	If you’re implying being a liberal or a progressive is not for rational people, you should probably take a step back and examine the difference between being rational and being arrogant. Progressivism was built on the idea that constant change and improvement is the best possible thing for society. It was my understanding that us ENTJs value that kind of thinking.
1	I think this post assumes that a Te type, or a T type may not be correlated with being a left wing.\n\nRemember, Te/T is just part of how your mind works in tandem with other functions. Let us not forget our experiences and memories shape our rationale.\n\nFor example, an ENTJ kid has seen his family die from rich people. He makes the connection, and then finds a way to hurt/eradicate rich people. A very simplified example, but it does the trick.
6	Would you say our willpower rises from our inferior function (Fi) or is it a product of the whole of our functions acting all at once?	I also thought the combination of Te and Ni gave some credence to this, but I ultimately decided that’s where the confidence exudes from. However, I’m willing to talk that out too. 
3	I am of the opinion that it's the whole of our functions acting all at once. *Nothing* exists or acts in a vacuum, *everything* is connected. 
3	It's a complicated topic honestly. You need to apply your top functions to feel fufilment in your everyday life. Your inferior is your dual seeking function, it's no bueno on its own. Very primitive, only really understands what it has experienced. You need someone else to give purpose to your inferior as it seeks something to attach to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere's a lot to say about it tbh and I probably don't remember half of it.
2	Mostly Fi related
2	I would say Te and to a smaller degree Fi is a driving force and Ni and Se is how you get there.\n\nAlternatively, MBTI is kind of BS and you need to look at the Big 5 traits (x2 aspects?) https://www.understandmyself.com/personality-assessment\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_Aspect_Scales\n\n* Openness to Experience, made up of the aspects Openness/Creativity and Intellect\n* Conscientiousness, made up of the aspects Orderliness and Industriousness\n* Extraversion and introversion, made up of the aspects Enthusiasm and Assertiveness\n* Agreeableness made up of the aspects of Politeness and Compassion\n* Neuroticism, made up of the aspects of Withdrawal and Volatility\n
1	Why would willpower rise from inferior Fi? Doesn't make sense to me. I think your will power is mostly dominant Te(while keeping in mind that you can't really separate one function from the rest as they always work together and bounce off each other)
1	Teenager ENTJ friend going through rebellion phase	Hello guys, as title my (male) friend has recently unlocked the rebellion phase, maybe a little late (19) but who am I to judge. He has a girlfriend and he's feeling like the smartest person on the planet. I dont think he's aware of it and I think it could be damaging everything around him. From his grades to our friendship. Like most ENTJs he's very touched by criticism, I've tried to explain the situation to him but he refuses to collaborate and gives me the angry face. I fking hate when he ignores the obvious but I'm trying to keep calm here. How do you think is safest to approach him? I dont want to argue with him calling him immature. \n\n\nEnglish is not my first language so please correct me.
7	My rebellious phase was when I was 15. My friends tried to talk to me and I pushed them away by hurting them as best I could. \n\nMy advice as cruel as it may be is to let him go through it on his own. In a few months he’ll come back to reality and you can help pick up the pieces then if you want to. You seem like a good friend, don’t become his enemy. 
1	If you know it’s a rebellious phase then you understand it’s temporary and it appears as though you are aware of it etc. \n\nI suppose it depends on whether you want to share/express sympathy towards his/her “human moment” or just cut your losses and move forward. \n\nI would just remind you that each type has their own life phases and human moments so it’s very practical to just let him have this human/type experience and then decided what to do when it’s over etc. 
19	How many fellow ENTJ's smoke weed to calm?	just wondering
16	I love it, it helps me calm down and focus on the moment rather than worrying about the 50 things I’m working on. It’s too easy to get caught up in our work flow, sometimes you just need to take a break and get some perspective.
14	I used to love smoking weed because after smoking it, I always felt like I was in another world. I even got a script for a while. But then I started having *severe* panic attacks while high, so I gave it up a few years ago. That was a blessing in disguise though because it can make you less ambitious.
4	> How many fellow ENTJs smoke weed to calm?\n\n~~42~~  \n420
3	i love smonking the greener 
3	🙌
3	I started to smoke a few years ago. I pay attention to what kind and their effects to try and decrease excess anxiety overall.
3	I used to, but it became a habit so I didn't get more when I ran out. I'm having crazy dreams ever since, and I've been much more productive.
6	I've never smoked weed, never intend to, I think it will change me as a person, and since I feel like I'm in such a good point in life I'll probably never try it ever.
4	I've found it just makes me incredibly sleepy and heavy - so unless I want/need to sleep, it doesn't make me calm because I become very conscious of how tired I am and wary of falling asleep.
2	This is actually something I'm really curious about. I haven't tried weed, but I could never imagine myself doing it, because if I feel out of control I flip out.
2	I tried a couple of times. Really did not like it. I got heart palpitations and headaches every yime, and started to feel panicked. \n\nOne time (admittedly, the dose was way, way  way too high), I had to lie down because it was all too much and I felt as if I was slowly getting paralyzed from my fingers and toes slowly creeping up to my chest. My SO said I was moving normally throughout everything, but to me it seriously felt like I wasnt/couldnt move at all. Once that feeling got to my chest, I got seriously scared I wouldn't be able to breath anymore. I really don't need that stuff in my life. \n\nSo.. yeah. That's a no from me.
1	I enjoy smoking MJ especially as wax but don’t do it as often as I want. I like hallucinogens in general, I find they make me more open to usual little fleets of creative thought. \n\nInstead of just brushing creative thoughts off as unrealistic, I’m able to expand more on them. So I guess you could say it unleashes my Ni.
1	I think my gpa would have been lower last quarter if I didn’t smoke weed
1	Me me me.
1	I've never smoked weed. 
1	I used to when I was younger, it started giving me anxiety and paranoia now though so I haven't in years. My brain already thinks too much 
6	Social anxiety as a Teenage ENTJ?	So yeah, I have some degree of social anxiety, I feel that it’s normal on teenage; most of the extroverted people I know (My age as well), have social anxiety on a normal degree. Do you think it’s normal to have social anxiety? I’ve been trying to fix it, and yeah, I’ve improved overtime but it’s still there. On a regular basis, I’m a confident and an assured guy, but socially, because of the social anxiety, I tend to be different, change my preferences, how I act, because of the fear of not controlling the situation, that something wrong will happend, and I won’t be capable to act as needed. Do you think this “social anxiety”, or social insecurities as an teenager are normal?\nWhat shall I do?
5	I am 27 years old, and I still struggle with social anxiety. I'm sure that ENTJs' social-anxiety complex is complex. But I think one important factor in our social anxiety is that we often feel like most people see the world very differently from how we see it, and thus we feel like we can't totally be ourselves around them and that we must constantly self-monitor or else make unrecoverable faux pas.\n\nLike I said, I still struggle with social anxiety myself, but if I may, I will offer a little advice. Make sure to hangout with people who think you're cool, that is, people who admire qualities in you. If you hangout with people who like you simply because you're funny or good-looking or anything like that, you'll (consciously or subconsciously) start to feel like you're an outsider who's socially deficient in some way. This feeling will be catastrophic for your social confidence.\n\nYour best bet is to find other NTs. They will understand and admire you the most, and you will likely feel the same way toward them. NFs can be good too, but sometimes I feel like I have to conceal my true thoughts on things with them.\n\nOne thing I do that sometimes helps is to remind myself that of all the MBTI types, my type is the one that has the greatest prospects for wealth and power. So if anything, I tell myself, they should be trying to impress me.\n\nSometimes I also tell myself: "Remember. You don't need anyone." Though, this might be an unhealthy practice.
3	I'm a female teenage ENTJ, and have social anxiety as well. I think a degree of it is normal, but I think mine (and other ENTJ's) can go slightly above what's normal. I think the smarter and more perceptive you are, the more prone you are to anxiety/depression. At first, I treated my anxiety as something to do on my do-to list. But then I realized, that it won't go away overnight and that's okay. What helps me is medication, exercise, sleep, and meditating. In my experience, the more you be yourself, and the more you voice your opinions, the easier it gets to open up. If you can, and this may be hard if you are a workaholic, but try to cut down on the caffeine, if you drink it. I know it makes mine worse. I also take meds that are stimulants for depression, and that can sometimes make it worse as well. I definitely think it is an element of normal teenage crap, but ENTJ's have a curse/ gift of overthinking and perseverating and that definitely primes you for anxiety. Just know, millions upon millions of teens have social anxiety, and although your overtly extroverted peers may not have it, they don't have the smarts that cause it. In terms of ENTJS, social anxiety is super normal. And also, being a teenager sucks. You have all of this homework, you literally have no freedom, and you're forced to think of your future 24/7, which can get really overwhelming for an ENTJ. I think this is an especially bad age because we have no control. Just know that you'll grow out of it, and worst comes to worst you can see a psychologist. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere is a link to an interesting method of therapy used for social anxiety that works for me: [https://www.anxietycanada.com/adults/exposure-therapy-social-anxiety](https://www.anxietycanada.com/adults/exposure-therapy-social-anxiety)
3	It’s not social anxiety. It’s colloquially more appropriate to call it “peer pressure.” Acting according to norms and not disrupting expectations in a way that calls attention to yourself as different from the pack. \n\nObjectively, social anxiety is more serious. A form of locking up. It’s not just nerves. It’s a little closer to a break down of your ability to function. Social anxiety can deteriorate your physical and psychological health and is capable of causing one to seclude oneself as a defensive reaction that your brain justifies as crucial to protecting you from the world. \n\nMy advice is to evaluate what’s important to others and figure out if it’s important to you. When you realize that most people are being fake, or untrue to themselves, you’ll learn not to care. It won’t be easy if you are looking for validation from your peers that who you are is who you should be. What you should understand is that the only person who should have a say in who you are is you. You’ll be a lot happier once you own that. 
2	Thank you for your advice, but I don’t agree with it. \nWe, as ENTJ’s yeah, we are the most powerful and one of the most outgoing personalities on MBTI, but I don’t agree on just accepting our “condition” of social anxiety (as you said).\nI’ve talked to a psychologist, and told me that the “anxiety” we experience, is actually a condition, but there is a congruent way to actually “sleep” that anxiety and live a happy and fulfilled life as anyone will. How? Just confront it! Accept that “anxiety” is not you, you control yourself, you decide how you are, not your mind makes you.\n
1	I had when I was 13-15 years old. \nThen I worked on myself (books, forced situations and God helped me a lot, if u don’t believe then a guidance of any type might help as well).\nAnd I can say today I am one of the most confident guys (in social interactions) my college (and all people around me) have ever met lol (4th year of Negocios Internacionales at the Universidad de Lima). (Oh I am peruvian, ur stereotypical ENTJ latinlover but with catholic values lmao)\n\n21 years old now btw
12	ENTJ copes with brain malfunctions. Poorly.	So three weeks ago my face collapsed. MRI came back with brain lesions, had a biopsy, waiting on the results. Lots of shit. \n\nI’ve always been very sure. Steady. Consistent. \n\nThen I met Keppra, my anti seizure medication. And all of the uncertainty that goes with this. \n\nguys. It is fucking awful. I am screaming and crying and completely out of control one minute, fine later. Every time they switch the brand something horrible happens and I’m not me any more. No logic. No sense. Just a giant pile of fucking crazy. \n\nI’m so used to being exacting and productive and FUCKING SMART and logical and just together. And now I am a mess who can’t control basic emotions because of some stupid drug that is in a shortage. I screamed at the Mister last night. No good reason. I was just so unbelievably angry and upset and illogical. \n\nI thought that being ENTJ might hold me back sometimes. That was wrong. It made me me. Not having the logic and the rigidity and the confidence is awful. Keep being yourselves. Embrace it. You don’t know when it might all change. \n\nPeople live like this every day and I don’t understand how they do it. Hoping mine is temporary but embrace your logic and your personalities. 
6	:(\n\nThanks for this post. It helps me value what I have. 
2	Too much noise. =(
2	Your situation really sucks and it's fucking scary to not be in control of yourself. You're still strong and you will get through it. I went through something like this a couple years ago, it was one of the hardest things I've ever done. Another ENTJ was very unforgiving and unkind to me while I was ill. My condition and that ENTJ taught me to be better at putting myself into other people's shoes. It's impossible to see that this will make you stronger and better in the end right now but it will.
1	There are other anti seizure meds like Depakote, Tegretol and Phenytoin. Some of those are used to treat bipolar disorder and could cause numbing or blunting. Have you talked to your doctor yet? Ask if the dose needs adjusted or if it would help to switch to a diff med. hang in there
17	Two types of ENTJs	I've been noticing a potential pattern in ENTJs I meet. There are two types either:\n1) really strong presence, outgoing, dominant energy OR \n2) Not as in your face, not the most noticeable presence in the room, chilled energy, a bit aloof and quiet, but still carrying obvious certainty within themselves. \n\nThis is a hypothesis and I'm asking to see if anybody has also noticed this?\n\nReasons could potentially be different instinctual stackings, enneagrams, OR perhaps I've mistyped one of the two groups :P
15	8w7 and 3w2 I'd say... I'm sorta both though as a 3w2 
21	Actually I’d venture that there are three with three varying degrees of social energy. \n\n(1) The Aggressive type who may be loud, consistently forceful, and on the move. \n\n(2) The Outlaw type who pushes others away, is always in their head, who talks when something is interesting or identifiable from the mundane or “its feeling very much weather” conversations. [This one’s me].\n\n(3) The White Bear type (very rare) that is consistently directing and helping others in a very nurturing way but may take it too far or may step over others’ toes by giving them help they didn’t ask for. \n\nThe degrees of social energy vary on the person, and I’d say this takes from the Enneagram a bit: \n\n(i) The Treasure Hunter: Looking for the one person who’s going to make their experience worth the effort. They seek singular experiences that intensify their mental, physical or spiritual stimuli. I call them treasure hunters because few things out there can satisfy others like me, but for them it works.\n\n(ii) The Spotlight Setters: Thriving when in the middle of action or receiving attention. They love being in groups of people that accentuate their personhood and their environment. They don’t care to be in the center of attention however, just close enough to the center to grab the spotlight now and then.\n\n(iii) The Relishing Thinkers: Those who act and soar into the air and think. These are happy to talk and can talk about anything. They are the information gathers to the extremes of our MBTI type and they love sharing. They tend to be loners and fit the Outlaw types, but for them, they’d rather be themselves or pick one person they truly respect after studied observation and  talk about anything and everything.
6	Yeah I noticed this because I think I particularly hate a certain ENTJ. So controlling, and tries to act like my supervisor, even though he's in the same position as me, and has not been working there as long. Bleh. 🤮
5	Agreed. Some act out in real life what their mind wishes we other did. I'm stoned :)
6	I feel like I am a little of both depending on the environment I am in. 
6	Strongly the latter 
2	I also feel like I swing between these, depending on the situation or my mood.  Two different people from different parts of my life may have completely different perceptions of me based on this.  Basically, I only let people see the side of me I want them to.  \n\nI'm an Enneagram 1w2, which I believe is somewhat uncommon amongst us ENTJs.  Per my Enneagram test results, type 5w6 closely follows my 1w2 result.  Not sure if that means anything...
26	Can I be a nice ENTJ?	Okay, so I'm a female ENTJ in high school. I'm accomplished, I have pretty good grades, but I struggle socially. I feel like I take myself too seriously, and I want to be social, but when I am, I get drained by the people I deem as incompetent. I want to be more open, and express my emotions more, but I feel this would compromise my ENTJ status. Any advice?
20	I think you should stop making decisions about what to do based on whether it's "ENTJ-like" or not.  Just get involved in what interests you. Hang around people you like. Don't force yourself to be around people you dislike. \n\nIf you can't figure those things out, then it's ok to kind of throw activities at the wall like spaghetti and see what sticks. Or think about a goal you have, and do social things around it. You'll either find people you like, or you'll discover that you don't like the kind of people you meet while doing that activity, and do something else. \n\nOnce you find people you like, it's natural to become more emotionally open with them. For God's sake, don't open yourself up emotionally to people you don't like or trust. 
5	You're in high school, do whatever you want, plenty of time to get stuck in your ways when you're older. 
4	Of course you can be a nice ENTJ.\n\nThat has nothing to do with being able to be friends with your current peers.\n\nIf you don't like their company, simply don't try so hard to socialize with them. You're not a bad person for not trying to be friends with them. Seek out people who you like interacting with. 
2	The goal of growth, regardless of the personality test you take or type you test as, is to heal the broken parts and to become whole, matured, and healthy. This doesn’t compromise your type, it means you’re integrating into the best parts of your type.\nAs a high schooler I felt very similar to what you’re describing. \nAs an adult, I am a very “nice” ENTJ. I have many friends, I’m very social, and people like me, usually. I have been described as very open, a good listener, entertaining and enjoyable to be around and gracious and compassionate towards others.\nI wish I had realized this was possible while still feeling safe when I was your age. I was too scared to be vulnerable so I was not a nice person. I was very harsh and critical and irresponsible with people. \nChoose kindness now. Choose grace now.\nYou won’t regret it, even as an ENTJ.
4	High school is the perfect time to learn all this. Im currently in high school and what i think what you are struggling with is not knowing when to cut back. Know when your words are too direct and know when you to voice your opinions as well. Sometimes people ask a question wanting a certain answer. You also need to find friends that are able to handle you as a person as well. If you arent an asshole you can probably find friends. 
3	The others have it right. It’s always great to know yourself and your temperament (MBTI) but it should not impact how you live your life. Growing means putting yourself out there. Maturing means learning to live with others as well as yourself. Acceptance is a very big part of that growth and in order to do that we all need to learn each other’s perspectives.\n\nIf you’re a little hung up on what I mean, strive to wiggle in traits and adopt some of the positive hobbies and instincts of an ESTJ for example. Help others. Listen to people. Strive to understand them. Find the one thing in others that is good and encourage them to flourish and become better for it. That’s what makes life so much better for people like us. But we have to make sure it’s not forced. \n\nAlso, seek to find those moments when holding someone’s hand really is as important as helping them solve a problem or directing them on how to be better. Those moments are difficult to see from our perspectives because we aren’t in tune with them. How does this all relate? You have to just go out there and do it. Someone said that earlier in the comments, but it’s a lot more of a leap than that. The way to do it is to stop analyzing, stop thinking so much, and just do. \n\nSomeone once said that if you really want to enjoy the fruits of knowing your MBTI type and move toward being happier you need to learn all you can about it and then forget it and just go live your life. it’ll sit in the back of your mind, yes, but it won’t stop you from doing things that are uncharacteristic of a profile created by someone else other than yourself. \n\nTake a breath. And just be. You may just be happier for it. As for friends...I’ve never really been a social butterfly, although I have attracted others to want to be my friend. I push them away. Simply because I don’t like people to begin with. But, that’s my issue to overcome. I’d say if you want to be nice to others, you have to put in the effort and just try. It’s what Ive been doing and it’s certainly made a difference short term. We’ll see about the long run.
2	What makes gold valuable is it's rarity. Friendships are like that too. Good friendships are so valuable because they are rare. Being kind, nice, in tune with your feelings, etc isn't going to make you less of an ENTJ, it's going to make you a better person. Which will attract competent people.\n\nAs you get older and move through life take care to be positive and build people up and excise people who are negative, drain you, and only take from your life. You will slowly acquire deep and real friendships, and get to where you want to be.\n\nJesus once said, "Don't throw your pearls before swine." By the same token, don't give the best of yourself to people who exploit and take advantage of you.\n\nAs to socializing... What are you passionate about? Do you have a hobby or an interest? I suggest taking up dancing. It's easy to find studios to take lessons, you meet people, and it's a fun way to go out and have fun when you are confident in what you are doing. 
2	What status? Your type is made up by four main functions... You will keep that unless you really work on them... You can't not be an entj now loool
2	I’m an ENTJ girl in high school as well and I’ve dealt with a similar issue to you. My best advice is if you want to make friends, just do it. \n\nNo matter what personality type anyone has I don’t think it should ever stop them from doing things unlike that type. That’s one issue with Maya’s Briggs unfortunately, it’s easy to get wrapped up in it, identify with it and not broaden oneself. \n\nSo just throw yourself out there. As an extroverted thinker it’s good you’re in lots of clubs because you can strengthen that part of yourself. But seriously don’t get too caught up in the ENTJ stuff as if you have to stay loyal to it or whatever. I used to think like that but it’s not worth it because you won’t open yourself to other opportunities in your life. So just hang out with the people around you who you get along with for now and once school finishes you’ll likely find “your people” 
2	my best friend is an artist and i’m a writer and we’re both ENTJ. that is to say, whatever you consider an "ENTJ-like club" is not the end-all-be-all of where to find other ENTJs. \n\nbut i digress. i consider myself to be a nice ENTJ, and i make that happen by using my ENTJness to my advantage. i’m p smart and very passionate, and i see my intelligence and passion as a gift i can use to relate to other people. everyone is interested in something (tho not all to the same degree) and everyone is smart in some way (tho not all to the same level). \n\nit bothers me so much when ENTJs complain about getting annoyed by people who are "beneath" them somehow. don’t get me wrong, im not trying to call you out by any means. but being motivated is a pretty integral part of being ENTJ. channel that motivation into learning to meet people where they are. you’ll make so many friends that way. 
2	Compromise your ENTJ status? Is there a secret club I'm missing out on? Yes, you're in high school, so you're surrounded by incompetent people, but you are also in high school, so you're also incompetent (whether you're aware of this or not). I'd suggest sitting in your room watching Futurama until you normalize. Consider what keeps bringing Leela back to Fry, and the "flaws" she displays despite being the most competent employee. Report back after you've watched every episode from the first 4 seasons, it won't take long.
2	Learn to live in the moment. When you cut loose, if you do something you wouldn’t normally do, stay confident as long as it feels right. Even if people around you aren’t excited by it, don’t step back from what you feel. Stand your ground and don’t move from it because whatever you learn about your feelings when you express them - that’s valuable to you. If it’s valuable to you, hold on to it. \n\nNo matter what anyone else thinks, says or doesn’t say. 
2	There are a lot of common themes between ENTJs and enneagram type 8s, and in enneagram theory, the best version of a type 8 is to adapt qualities of type 2s. This to me is essentially a nice and helpful ENTJ. \n\nI think when ENTJs learn to become the best version of themselves they learn to be helpful and kind. 
2	Do NOT force yourself to become friends with people you can not get along with by being yourself. It will be tiring and draining on you. You need to find a social circle who has your best interests in mind. I am socially awkward to begin with, but when I find friends based on interests and a same goal mindset, I feel at ease and able to socialize. I am always looking to improve my life, so having others around me who want to do the same is a huge boost for me. Since you are in high school, "test the waters". Join a club based on what you like. Get involved. If it doesn't work out with a certain club or you aren't feeling it so to speak, try something else. You will find your place, and feel generally comfortable. 
2	The internet makes it easier to meet more competent people. Also you are going to go on to a University, right? Then don't sweat it. It's a different game and people on average will be smarter. You can pick from the top once you are in there. You just have to get the HS over with. If you are straight, go for a guy who is a bit older. You'll be about equal then.\n\n\n
1	Just to clarify, I play an instrument and am extremely passionate about learning another language, so those are extracurriculars/ hobbies I'm heavily involved in. Also, I actually am a really nice person (once you get to know me lol), I just have trouble breaking through in the initial stages of friendship, and meeting people. In terms of my ENTJ superiority complex, I go to a school where everybody has their own unique thing going on, including myself. I do believe my IQ is high (I don't mean to be rude, but it's just how I was born), and that there are people who have strengths and weaknesses that are different than me, but the main part I have trouble socializing is because of my brain, if that makes any sense. I want to talk about different cultures, business, and intellectual things with people, who don't easily get intimidated by my somewhat forceful personality. And although I'm a somewhat naive teenager, I act very mature for my age, and don't really find the high school experience very stimulating. It's just the hard part is that my school only has like three hundred people, and mean people literally don't exist there, so I'm not allowed to think about all the things that are wrong/ inefficient in that culture, and everybody is super pro-social. The weird thing is that over the years, I've learned to tone down my ENTJ-ness in school, and am actually in class really reserved, shy, and quiet, but in a more intimate setting, I am a complete extrovert. Does anyone else experience this?
0	You can make friends as long as you don't screw people over in favor of your job/school or something. I seriously don't understand you people sometimes (always).\n\nYour status is not the most important thing in life. And you can still get good grades while not being so uptight and serious about them. You realize high school is a big joke, right? Is that seriously all you value yourself with? Getting printed letters on a paper and having your teachers say "good job"?\n\nYeah, just make some friends. You can still be the "smart one," or the "responsible one" in the group, and still have friends. It's possible they don't like you because they can sense that you would throw them under a bus in a second if you had to choose between them and your status.
11	ENTJ Struggling with Motivation Cost-Benefit Analysis	My life progresses fast in some terms. A couple elite schools, cool job, hot infp girlfriend (who i love). At 26 I find myself feeling stunted. Great plans for long term wealth generation and have been easily clearing impediments toward that goal but I lack the motivation to expedite my plans by taking things to the next level (i.e getting a second job, putting in massive hours at current job, networking with boring idiots to fish for fast paced promotion). When I do the cost-benefit analysis it comes up as small gain, large effort.\n\nI also get the sense that my ambitious nature seems to come off foreign and abrasive rather than inspiring to most people, even though people are generally hospitable and even become close friends.\n\nAm I depressed? My checklist for life seems to be fulfilled but I am unfulfilled.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSe Coping Agent: Marijuana (never bothered me much before and seem to be a MAC truck of momentum that is exhausting to others without it)\n\nMedications: Prozac 20mg (thought I was depressed, could stop obsessing over every meeting with senior execs, thought it would help, seemed to)
11	If your life is as good as you say it is, you wouldn't have had to post this in the first place.\n\nYour perceived reality and your actual reality don't match up, you're not actually happy, and that's completely fine. I'm not saying you should *"pursue your passions bro, quit your job and travel the world*" but try introducing new stimuli into your environment and see what happens (i.e. "*Change things up a bit*"). Pick up an unknown hobby. See how that makes you react. 
5	Serious question: *why* do you pursue wealth generation? \n\nEmphasis on **you**. \n\nWant to retire early? Ok. Why though? What do *you* want to gain from early retirement that you need this kind of financial independent for?\n\nWant financial security? To what end? What do you want to do in your life that requires this security. \n\n.. what I'm getting at, if you are going after wealth just because of status alone, I get why you're feeling unfulfilled like this. Any non-intrinsic motivation will make you feel unfilled as you're maturing. You need to figure out what your intrinsically driven goals are... maybe are wealth aquisiction isn't even the best path to those goals and you subconsciously know this and that's why your feeling unmotivated to put everything in motion.
4	What are your variables for the benefits/costs?
3	I don't have much in the way of advice, but I just want to say I am in a similar position (albeit the grad school version) and share many of your frustrations.\n\n*If you're like me*, the root cause is likely that, beyond a basic level (ie more money is great for many reasons), you don't feel much purpose to what you're doing and you don't know what you really want to do with your life. You see the benefits of wealth generation but don't exactly have a plan for what you'd do with it all aside from using it to generate even more. As for how to figure out what you want, meaning what you'd more deeply enjoy or find fulfillment in, I have no idea. That's the part I'm currently struggling with, and I wish I had a better answer to share for that.
2	I want to think about this and potentially post a longer answer, but it sounds like you’re at a natural pause or plateau in your professional life (maybe in your personal as well). The next identifiable step seems to be a little too far away to start seriously putting effort into. At the moment you find yourself somewhat idle and not necessarily working towards anything and that seems to be the most frustrating aspect of what you’ve relayed. If I’ve got it right, then I identify super closely with what you’re going through. \n\nI’ll come back to this when I’ve thought it through a bit more. 
2	u seem enneagram 3. id try to get to 8  \npriority is health, ur medication doesnt help. it lowers your intellect.  \ntry zerocarb carnivore for a while   \ngotta understand that your costs are high because 1 your physical resources are low > no ketones  \n2 you take drugs  \n3 inefficient strategy application (draining)  \n4 limited vision   \n5 they are all interconnected, so the more you grow, the more resources you will get, and the smaller the drain.  \nprioritize growth not socialstatus . its inefficient .. as you might see. it wont leave much room for something else, and your drained personality will get slow results on all fronts  
1	Why not build your own thing, something that you believe in?\n\nIt can be smaller but it would be all yours.
1	Part of this event is developmentally normal but typically happens in the mid 30s, yours is a bit early. When people dont know what to make of it thats when you see the typical 'mid life crisis'.\n\nIf im seeing this right then the problem is that your life has been you following the narrative given to you from childhood. But its not your own. Youve climbed this mountain high enough to see that its not worth climbing after all, but still, good job for climbing this far, better than most others who climb it.\n\nBut you were made to climb better / different mountains. The hard part is digging into yourself and figuring out which. As an ENTJ youll be able to bring to bare tremendous force...if only you can find out / decide what you are going to focus on.\n\nI think conspiracy nut is right in that its probably going to involve you taking on your own venture but who knows for sure. Thats where your journey starts.\n\nExciting stuff! Feel that tingle in the air? Thats all the possibilities waiting for you.\n\nHolding thumbs for you, guy! Have at it!\n\n  \n
1	But Ni doesn’t tell you what you want...at least not in any of the conceptions I’ve heard of. That seems to be Fi. 
1	You have to play around with your core fears to find motivation. 
2	Entj and INTP releationship help?	I am a 19 year old male ENTJ and the girl I've been seeing is an INTP (18) we go on and off from being in a relationship to breaking up constantly, she tells me that she doesn't see us as long term Partner's romantically but admits that she would be my partner because she thinks i can take her far in life in financial terms and that I'd be a capable provider and give her a soild future.\n\nBut at the same time she tells me she loves me? I always tell her that i WANT her but i don't NEED her and that i could replace her and all that.\n\nAt the same time i told her that I'd one day put her in a pent house In Puerto Rico. I honesty think that she is gonna be my long term partner for some reason, i have no logical reason why to think this but its more that i just know intuitively. But currently in my life at this moment I'm focused on school and Building my career. She also says that she doesn't want to be with me because she thinks im toxic and i have giant ego and all that, she says i act like the shit when I'm not. \n\nIll admit at this point in my life im not the shit yet but someday my ego will match my bank account and it will make sense.  So any advice?
10	LOL
6	Idk man. Regardless of type, this whole thing sounds pretty toxic to me. Personally, I wouldn’t want to deal with the level of ambiguity she’s giving you. Life is complicated enough. Love shouldn’t be. \n\nPeople might laugh at you for the “I’ll put you in a penthouse” comment, but honestly...I totally get it. I used to say the exact same thing to my serious girlfriend of many years (except it was a house in the Hamptons). Money was my primary motivator in early adulthood, and I closesly associated my self-worth with my economic production. I felt like it was something I “owed” her because I told her I love her. \n\nSounds like despite the toxicity you two just can’t get enough of each other. This might be one of those things where you two can’t help but continuously mindf*** each other. 
4	Mate she's just a girl, probably not even the best one around. Have fun with her and ditch her after since it's clearly not going to work out in the long term. If you absolutely feel the need to, replace her but if not, just go without until you're done with uni at the very least. \n\nRemember that if you are indeed like the majority of ENTJs, you are akin to an undervalued value investment and as more time passes, the more your true worth is realized. Selling now at the prevalent market rate merely shortchanges you. So hold off on locking your sights onto something; you are unlikely to have been exposed to the world sufficiently. I would say you are far too young to make a decision but that would be false, age is nothing but a barrier placed by peasant sensors to restrict those younger than them; your decision should be made on the basis of long term value with the wider horizon in mind and you are never too young to be responsible for your own choices. Think with your head and not your dick\n\nTldr: move on she ain't worth it
7	Is this a troll post? \n\nShe doesnt want u for long term and ur trying to change her mind?\n\nWhy dont u spend that energy replacing her like u said you can since u dont NEED her.
3	Just keep at it mate. ;D
2	Read about the extinguishment relationship here [**MBTI matches for ENTJs**](https://www.personalitycafe.com/entj-articles/280-love-types-entj-12.html#post20825162). It will shed some light on your relationship with this girl. Sounds like there is something that is pulling you together and also something that is pushing you apart, but I don't think anyone can give you a clear answer on what you should do because it's up to you to decide. 
2	As an intp female, she probably doesnt care that much about your bank account. And your making a huge deal out of it is probably a turn-off. Or maybe it motivates her to care more about gains IRL instead of just in her head. 
6	How would an ENTJ with ADHD and Chronic Depression look like?	I've been typed as an ENTJ but I have both of the conditions mentioned above. They're such a hindrance that it's really hard to believe I am an ENTJ.\n\nIf any of you have the conditions above please tell me how it interacts with your personality and what struggles you have in a daily basis.
14	you’re  looking at it sweetie 😳🤙😘
9	Absentmindedness, regret, remorse, losing yourself in reading whatever interests you on-line non stop in a flow chart like way. Ofter times never even finishing one page before being led to another site to another to another. loneliness, not feeling understood, powerless, powerless, powerless. 
3	I’ve been clinically depressed because of a relationship gone wrong, your Fi becomes over stimulated and your self esteem shot. I’ve actually been diagnosed with ADHD, when I’m in Ni mode I can be somewhat inattentive. 
3	I think we should talk about how to fix the problems. Why are you depressed? What is missing in your life? What are the issues? We can develop a strategy to fix and improve your quality of life.
3	I can probably speak to that, seeing as I have both.\n\nI'd like you to picture something for a minute: \n\nYou're sitting in the campus dining hall, eating breakfast (scrambled eggs, a biscuit, and broccoli). You've just taken your ADD medication; that weird sluggishness and lethargy that persists so often is completely wiped away for the time being. \n\nAs you're sitting there and eating, your mind begins to make a list of things that need to be done for the day: do practice accounting exam, lay foundation for data structures code, complete framework for upcoming presentation, do laundry. The list goes on. \n\nYou're feeling energetic in that moment. Getting that work done is a huge priority for you. You can practically see the pride on your face once you've finished the work, and you're just itching to get started.\n\nBut suddenly, your mind starts wandering a little bit; all of a sudden, you're thinking about how your parents couldn't stop fighting and threatening divorce even for your sake when you were a child. You're thinking about how when you were at your lowest, YOU had to claw your way out of that hole, and nobody was there for you. You feel really sad; you're typically not like this, since you're so busy.\n\nBut you grit your teeth. By now, you have that phrase that works so well as a coping mechanism, and you say it aloud (albeit in a mutter). "Fuck off". And then you leave, ready to start your work.\n\nAnd that's how I deal with it. It's not the most pretty thing, and I speak to a good psychologist over the phone every two or so weeks, but that's what works for me.

2	I have ADHD, I got myself diagnosed and I’m medicated for it. I can’t even tell that I have it now. YMMV but it’s worth getting it diagnosed and treated. 
5	did i make him hate me?	i know i shouldn't care, but i feel guilty because i think i made this entj dude hate me. all this started last year when i developed a \*near\* obsessive crush on him because he flirted with me a 'lil. then i became confused as to whether or not he hated me as time went on. he would routinely ignore me or look past me when we'd see each other in the halls. i didn't take this personally cause i assumed he did it with everyone and i just did the same. whenever i'd see him i'd just pretend i didn't see him and move on with my day. but usually if we'd have one on one \*conversations\* (if you could even call them that) he would be nice and personable. he even said hi to me once in the hallway, but that was it. so i thought everything was fine. so one day i was walking down a stairwell and i didn't see him but the crowd in the stairs made it so that we were forced to walk right next to each other as we went down. and i didn't say a single word to him. i didn't even acknowledge him. he didn't either, so i just assumed it was business as usual. but as soon as we separated from the stair well i overheard him talking to his friend and he says to him, "yeah, she doesn't love me anymore." and from that point on he doesn't even talk to me one on one. when i try saying something to him to start a conversation when we have the opportunity to, he doesn't even look at me. so like, did i do something wrong?? or..??
5	Hey INTP little sister, long time no talk. How are you?\n\nWhen I was about your age, a football coach said to me, “No matter how good or bad you think it is, usually it’s not *that* good or *that* bad.”\n\nYou never know what’s going on in a person’s life or their head. Life experience has so far confirmed for me that “OK they hate me” is pretty much never the reason why someone is behaving a certain way. \n\nEither that, or you failed in RETALIATING your emotions, or he was intimidated by the sheer level of genius of your plan for him to run for every single government office in America. :D
6	Too much drama. Boys take awhile to grow up. Move on.\n\n> all this started last year when i developed a *near* obsessive crush on him because he flirted with me a 'lil.\n\nMaybe you put him on a pedestal because you are not actually equal, as in he is better looking.\n\n> "yeah, she doesn't love me anymore."\n\nThat could have been a round-about way of rejecting you while letting you save face.\n\nEither way, it is not working organically. Move on. It is draining you. Out of the sight - out of the mind.\n\n
1	If you don't have any feeling toward him, then move on, he'll much appreciate it.\n\nPlease don't try to be kind because you feel guilty about it, make it clear that you don't like him. That ENTJ won't hate you because he has some feeling toward you but you don't reciprocate it. He's not that into you, so don't worry about it.
0	Real ENTJ, AMA.	Most of people on this sub know me as the "real ENTJ". I am the pinnacle point for many aspiring fakes who come here to learn and pretend to be like us. Of course... I am mostly talking about ESTJs. \n\nWe all know you fake your results... in the hopes of getting promotions or roles where strategic mind is a necessity, but you can't fake your cognitive functions. So until I have time AMA, and I will tell you how you can appear to be me, but don't blame me when in a typical non-intuitive manner you'll get caught out by your failed results.
16	Hahahahahahahahaha what a fucktard. And that’s coming from an ENTJ. 
12	Did you have to remove a couple of ribs or are you just super-flexible?
6	I think ur actually a real entj, ur post is funny and troll lol\n\nTake my like.
3	INTP here.\nWhere do I find a female ENTJ?
3	Almight ENTJ, tell me why craftshops don't sell (or even produce) anymore door handles with 170mm spacing? Had to perform heavy surgery on my door yesterday to make these fucking 195mm models fit.
2	Lol.
2	Oh boy if you think this is bad go to the INTJ community. Like 50% of those peeps dont come anywhere near INTJ. 
1	What's it like to be conceited enough to think that people want to ask you questions?
0	What's it like having terrible recollection of past events? Do you ever look at the past and think "Did this really happen? Was I really there?" Do you find yourself projecting your poor memory onto other people?
0	You’re probably the type of guy to suck his own dick and brag to others that you got head. Lmao. 
13	Looking for some answers what is ni and what is the difference between ESTjs and you?But	So I know my functions well. But what I don’t sometime know is pragmatically how they work some examples for instance. How does ni work? For a while I thought I was one of you but then I realized I didn’t know what ni was. I do in a sense I know the definition. I can figure if someone is a Ntj for instance. But I still am in the dark.\n\nCan you give me some examples of the differences between yourselfs, ENTJs and ESTJs? I know what the stuff says but any examples in terms of the si and ni preferences?\n\nI also have a few weird questions I was reading a post on here and I came up with this.\n\nDo you think there is a difference in how te is exercised or how much it’s exercised?\n\nMaybe it’s my perception and I met one person who claimed to be ENTJ but can’t be sure if she’s INTJ or ENTJ. But anyway. Do you think ESTJs are more outgoing or social? Do you think that ESTJ tend to be a little brasher? Do you have any ideas why?\n\nIs it easier to figure out what a estj think then an ENTJ?
12	I sometimes find it easier to give examples of characters embodying each type to help convey their differences, so:\n\nIron Man (ENTJ) vs. Captain America (ESTJ) some may say Iron man is ENTP and Cap is ISFJ, but they aren't analyzing the functions correctly.\n\nVoldemort (ENTJ) vs Hermione (ESTJ)\n\nTywin Lannister (ENTJ) vs Cersei Lannister (ESTJ)\n\nDarth Sidious/Palpatine (ENTJ) vs Darth Vader (ESTJ) and some will say Sidious is INTJ but Palp has never been a behind the scenes ruler. He's always put himself in the thick of his plots, and his demagoguery is trademark ENTJ. \n\n\nNow for the real explanation. Ni is, quite simply, vision. The ENTJ is the visionary, while the ESTJ isn't. This is the biggest difference, but it leads to a lot of divergent factors between the two personalities. ENTJ's are more likely to be future-oriented, whereas ESTJ's are more likely to want to preserve the status quo. ENTJ's could care less for the status quo, and we usually view it as something that may need to be overcome to bring about true improvement. ENTJ's view progress as the end goal, with order being a means to an end, whereas ESTJ's view order as an end-in-itself, the end all be all. \n\nUnlike the common stereotype, ESTJ's aren't very good at leading. ESTJ's are good at maintaining order. If you give an ESTJ a set of directives they'll adhere to it, and make sure everyone else around them adheres to it. Their Si-Ne however means that this is all that they'll usually do, & they won't be the leader pushing the horizons or advocating the new. ENTJ's however directly pursue leadership, and we excel at it and relish it, to the point that we can almost become self-sabotaging to the group if forced into a subordinate position. \n\nESTJ's are usually more closed-minded and fond of traditions, and prefer doing things the way that they've always been done. They can view new ideas as sort of "threatening" for lack of a better word. ENTJ's welcome new ideas with open arms because remember, the end goal is progress, so if the idea is good then we'll take it no questions asked. ESTJ's are very good at practical matters as well, & more regular day to day things would come to them easier. They would seem a lot more like the stereotypical extravert than an ENTJ. \n\nENTJ's tend to be far more prideful, egotistic, confident, intense, domineering, self-interested, independent, etc. \n\nESTJ's tend to be far more social, agreeable, nurturing, modest, dutiful, micro-managing, etc. \n\nThe BEST analogy I've seen for ENTJ vs ESTJ is The CEO vs The Manager. The CEO (ENTJ) is the big picture thinker, constantly pushing the limits with intensity and vision, controlling and having absolute power over the organization from the higher echelons. Since he built this from the ground up there is a certain gravitas about him, a confidence unmatched that some may call arrogance.\n\nThe Manager (ESTJ) is the local overseer. Managing one of the local chains for the corporation, they see to their duties and make sure everyone else in the corporation does as well. Rules are rules for a reason. They have a duty to serve, and they knew that if they didn't do it, the corporation wouldn't be able to function properly at all. They see to it that the day to day operations are handled, and are keen to make sure nothing ever gets too disorderly. They're compensated well for their work, and are generally content with their life and place. \n\n\n
5	Differences between me and my ESTJ friend:\n\n1.	She cares about prestige and image. For example, she has this idea of what a successful man is ‘supposed’ to look like and anything veering off that path is considered not good enough. For me on the other hand, although I’m aware what a successful man is supposed to look like, it doesn’t feel new to me and gets boring quick so I prefer men who stray from the norm.\n2.	May overgeneralize because she judges people based assumptions about the group they belong to, I usually judge people based on assumptions about their actions. Hates when I point out what she’s doing. \n3.	She prefers to have friends who share the same beliefs as her... I don’t. She’s a socialist while I’m a left wing libertarian. I often try to talk more with her but she doesn’t like to bc anyone who doesn’t share the same ideas with her is considered a threat, and since I’m a friend, she’d rather ignore my economic liberal opinions and focus on my socially liberal ones. \n4.	She’s more social than me, loves going out to clubs and prefers the culture she was raised in. I usually prefer artistic events where I can socialize as well as have “meaningful” conversations and meet “unusual people”.\n5.	I’m an idealist. When I see something sad, I’ll often add a lot of meaning to it while she’ll agree that was sad and focus on the details of what happened, how it happened etc. I’ll then somehow connect it some problem in humanity and she’ll say “wow I didn’t think it was that deep.” I reflect more on my internal conditions and this makes me appear highly self aware and serious. \n6.	I think she is more assertive in her opinions because she has to believe she’s right. I always assume I’m wrong so I’m always ready to have reasons to why I believe a certain thing. I want to have a fuller understanding of the image. She believes she already understands the image. \n7.	To me Te in ESTJs operates through Si as this is how it’s always been, this is what works and this is how to make sure it continues to work. Te in ENTJs is more like this is what works, this is what would work better, this is how we have to change what works now despite the risks.\n8.	oh yeah ESTJs hate risks, ENTJs I think operate better when there is a risk. \n9.	Appearance: She looks more preppy and athletic. I wear more minimalist/androgynous. \n\nIt may seem like I’m following the traditional stereotype of ESTJs but she’s admitted to me that she hates having to find multiple ways to solve problems. It’s frustrating to her and even the end result isn’t worth it. I think this is the biggest difference between ESTJs and ENTJs. \n\nOne way you can differentiate them is how they react to authority once you spot the Te. Does the person prefer to prove themselves to authority or does the person prefer to influence authority with their ideas. 
9	Stereotipically an ISTJ is a mechanic and an INTJ is an engineer. One is good with tools and details and memory and not a big fan of abstract ideas or too much theory and the other would rather solve a differential equation that change spark plugs or oil. Not only is it boring, it is actually difficult because the brain does not want to focus on the small details and would rather do something else, like big picture stuff.\n\nNow, IxTJs have Ni and Si as the first function. The ExTJs have those as their second functions. Their first function is Te so the difference is more blurred.\n\nI would say that while ENTJs are capable of tactics, they are also pretty good at strategy and do like it. I would say that ESTJs are less likely to venture into the unknown but can take an existing formula and with a lot of applied effort can create a lot of order out of chaos. But it better be a known kind of chaos, nothing too crazy.\n\nThat's how I see it.\n
4	Ni, introverted intuition. Here’s the deal. \n\nThe functions are easier explained by a walkthrough. \n\nENTJ \n(1) The Ego - Te - Extraverted Thinking.\n(2) The Parent - Ni - Introverted Intuition\n(3) The Child - Se - Extraverted Sensing.\n(4) The Inferiority Complex  - Fi - Introverted Feeling\n\nThe Ego is our default interaction setting. We set out to understand and control our environment to avoid being controlled or harmed. The Ego is responsible for this. It engages with the outside world and observes outside information, noticing patterns and inner workings. \n\nThe Parent is our Data Computation Center. We take in the outside information that our Ego observes and then internalize it. We simplify it into easy-to-understand terms and then hold our understanding in that Center for years, possibly longer if we engage with it enough. But what happens when we get overloaded with too much information? What happens when we just can’t seem to simplify something to how we like it? \n\nThe Child helps by acting as our Research and Development department. It goes out and looks for places to put the information and obtain ways to improve the Ni’s initial conclusions. It sees how others simplify the information so that it’s easy to understand. Once the the Child (Se) finds the right model, the Ego (Te) goes right back at it and takes it all in. Once it’s enough, the Parent (Ni) internalizes it again and again and so it goes. \n\nLast is the Inferiority Complex (Fi) which acts as our Green Light. It tells us never to quit and usually it’s very hard for us to ignore this part of our psyche. A small part of us inside wants to be helpful, wants to be appreciated and admired by others and this Green Light is always on inside of our heads. It’s why we don’t see when others are being steamrolled or when we are dominating and stepping on others’ toes. The best way to explain this is, “we want you to have a good time and to feel like you’ve had a great experience, but we won’t ask you if we’ve done our job or if you even wanted this, we’ll just keep going balls to the wall until there’s no way of doubting that you have/or would have had fun.”  That part of us that says nothing is enough, nothing is good, everything can be better...that’s our Fi. It’s an Aspirational function that drives us to keep going even where others would stop. \n\nThere’s a whole other subset of shadow functions and artistic functions which stay in the shadows, but if you want to know more I can keep going. Just let me know! Hope this helps!
2	It'd be hard to imagine what Ni is like for an ESTJ but it's basically what your mind does when you day dream. It's the knowledge of where a chain of events leads to. If you are an ESTJ you'd have a clear preference for Ne the intution of possiblities, Ni is the intuition of time. 
1	ENTJs are open minded and motivated. ESTJs are closed minded and motivated. 
3	I would like to be an ENTJ.	when I wrote it I was so fucking angry with some of the common issues I have everyday. and I know it would be different if instead of having stupid Fi Ne I would have Te Ni.
22	That is not what you want.\n\nYou want to become a better INFP, don't you?
14	You don’t. Be a better you 
12	Nice to have a fan. INTJs get all the attention, and they don’t even want it. Cruel joke life can be. 
8	you can't 
7	Sign on the line... 😈
9	Who doesn't?
4	Err, may I ask why?
4	We also have issues, we're just very good at masking them. We're not perfect, we make mistakes (no matter how hard we want to admit otherwise), and we can be VERY hard on ourselves when we do.\n\nYou don't want to be like us, you want to be a better person. It's easy to say "Man, I wish I could be just like them!" but that simply doesn't work, because we're made the way we are. We cannot change our core, but we can change ourselves for the better. \n\nI know a few INFPs, and I know you people have trouble with motivation. Seek help. I'm not sure what to tell you without sounding condescending but it is imperative that, if you want to improve, you go out of your way to do so. Everything needs sacrifice.
3	Good luck for that.
3	You cannot be what you are not. Just be the best, most well rounded YOU that you can be! If you can, maybe team up with an entj. Try offering a chicken wing...they seem to love them!
2	That's funny, some think I might be an xNFP. I used to test as an INTJ but now test as an ENTJ.\n\nA couple of years ago I actively practised thinking and behaving like an ENTJ until I 'became' an ENTJ. I was going through a huge crisis and thought it would help with my issues. It did.
2	this game wasnt meant for you William
1	This is flattering! However, just be you and know that that is great! The world needs all of us. :)
1	Well, I'm going to have to agree that ENTJ is the best type to be.
1	I don't think you should be angry. I think it is better to work together with people as a team. Why don't you team up with us instead of trying to change yourself?
2	Struggling with a long distance relationship as ENTJ	So, I’m 16, though I’m an A, I have still lots of insecurities that I’m still improving constantly. The fact is, I’ve met this girl in another country on vacation, and we had a great and deep connection; she was flirting, we had an awesome conversation, etc... I asked for her number and I left to my hotel to rest.\nI came back to my residence country, and texted her; she was excited to see me, and asked me (almost obligated me) to go and visit her! I got just super confident that she liked me, until she got all super cocky and weird. We ENTJ’s like clarity and authenticity always, even on people we don’t give anything or care about. After this, I’ve been struggling thinking of her and her authenticity; I might think, she is an ENFJ or an ENTP. I’m a very passionate guy, and I talk to her about my passions and I make her identify with them, she gets indiferent though, and stops replying text. What do you think? Shall I abandon the relationship and start another one? Any tactics for an ENTJ (teen) on a relationship? I feel weird, I never ask for help like this, but in this moment, I feel a complete ignorant about flirting and relationships science.\nThank you!
8	You are 16 and you are acting desperate, like she is the only girl that has ever looked at you. Yes I would meet someone local. You have not done much anyway; merely exchanged phone numbers. I do not know how far away her country is and how different your two cultures are, but finding someone local is soooo much easier. Also you save the valuable time - in case you are incompatible you will find out sooo much sooner. Soon enough you will be in a University and there all bets are off anyway.\n
2	My top piece of advice is to not think of dating as something that requires “tactics,” or anything involving “relationship science.” Women are people, not video games to be studied and mastered. 
2	Long distance almost never works out. You need a lot of trust to build and even then, if you’re an ENTJ, you may not be happy until you can see her be honest. \n\nAside from the MBTI, you’re 16. Now is not the time to be in serious relationships. Now is the time to work on yourself and let dating be a secondary focus in your life. Get smart, get skilled, and forget being in a relationship. It’s a social fiction that you need to be in a relationship to be happy. Leave that to the S-F types who can’t be bothered to understand themselves. Frank Sinatra said it best, “Be wary of those who can’t stand to be alone, most of the time they are not standing.”
0	I’ve had girlfriends already, but not on a serious vibe of relationship. This one, I feel is the one to start a serious thing. I’m just naive on the topic, and when an ENTJ doesn’t know something, struggles until the ENTJ finds it and masters it.
0	So, am I supposed to not take it seriously? Glad Myers didn’t hear you
6	Which of the logical fallacies do you find yourself guilty?	
21	The fallacy fallacy.  \n\nJust because I can spot a fallacy in someone's argument, doesn't mean their idea is wrong, merely their rhetoric.\n\nMistaking rhetoric for ideas is one of the great poisons of our age, I'm convinced, but it is a nasty habit to break.
13	INTP spotted
6	Ad hominem, I keep an eye on that during debates but in terms of getting what I want it’s useful unless someone calls me out on it. 
6	Confirmation bias. I hate it, I watch for it, and I still end up doing it anyways
4	I am sexually attracted to Sam Harris, so I find myself defending his quotes and ideas until my fingers turn blue regardless of how dumb the things he said / wrote are.\n
2	Probably https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivated_reasoning\n\nAlso I can't help but take shortcuts. When someone tells me of the virtue of socialism and how much better it is I don't have the time to debate their every point. I check their post history, try to asses their IQ, their verbal ability, how emotional they get.\n\nThere are billions of people on the internet now, and most of them generate noise. Maybe I am wrong but that is my operating assumption.
20	Has being an ENTJ led to social anxiety for you?	Finally hopping off the lurker fence and joining because I need some perspective...\n\nI know full well my tendency to run over the top of people and be utterly clueless about other people's emotions. Or I start by trying to be helpful, and before I realize it, I've accidentally just taken charge and unwittingly offended people.\n\nI try hard to avoid this, but I feel like in the process I'm constantly second- guessing myself, and I struggle not to constantly dwell on whether I was accidentally an insensitive cow when I said whatever wrong thing I said that day, whether I was so helpful I steamrolled someone... Am I the only one who lives constantly stressed out over whether they're regularly accidentally alienating people or not sure where the line is between being an ENTJ vs being seen as a domineering bitch?
20	I struggle with this too, being a female ENTJ. In the moment I just act naturally, but then when thinking about the interaction later I realise I might not have been as thoughtful or sensitive as I would like to be perceived. It makes me wonder whether we have more of this conflict as our personality traits more directly clash with traditionally desirable traits for females, and the way we have been raised. Maybe look at it this way - the fact that you look back on these situations and actively try to learn from them shows that you are hoping to grow and change which is positive! You could easily not reflect on your behavior at all!
7	Every single day man. People ask me why i like to be alone
7	 Yes. Holding back makes me kind of depressed. The most effective way to handle this that I’ve seen is to be relentlessly optimistic.
7	I honestly dont care. Some people at work just plain call me rude. I dont care about their opinion. Im just me. I dont go out of my way to be mean, im not malicious, im just honest. People who dont like it...well sorry... the people who matter appreciate it.\n\nYou cant live your life being scared like that. Youre a peacock and you gotta let yourself fly! (Mark Wahlberg paraphrased quote, i forget which movie)
3	Not at all
3	That’s the critic function imbedded in your shadow type. Our shadow functions are INTP and they definitely have at least some say in the way we reflect on what we actively do. The critic function is that little voice in the back of your head that makes you second guess yourself after hearing, “Are you sure?” or “When was the last time you checked” or “Is that really what it said?”\n\nYou’re dominant functions are certain, basing its intuition on the extraverted thinking and jumping to the conclusion after studied absorption. The shadow function is there to allow ourselves to the tools in which to better ourselves or to push ourselves to be better, to “get it right the next time” so to speak. \n\nIt’s all about keeping ourselves updated, informed, and remembering to break out of our intuition and look out to others to learn whether the person you are helping even wanted the help to begin with lol
2	i dont see the relation.  \n1 u fail u learn, that has nothing to do with social anxiety  \n2 anxiety is good and kinda mandatory when trying new things, its the tesion of th e deliberate   \neither way , nu. i didnt get it\ntake better care  of ur selfesteem 
2	I've been trying really hard to be more empathetic . I would recommend trying not to get wrapped up in discussion/debate, continue reminding yourself that your words effect others. \n\nI often lead a conversation reminding others that I'm coming from a good place or acknowledging my privilege in the conversation. This I think helps me seem less intimidating in a conversation but also reminds me of where I should be mentally.\n\nBe proud of yourself and keep trying 😊 you can do it!! Change takes a lot of time and effort, but if anyone can do it, it's YOU 😁
2	No, social anxiety leads to social anxiety. Personality types are not causes of mental health disorders. 
1	LOL INTJs are even worse.
0	is it safe for me to say entj....?	is it safe for me to say that entjs are wrathful. while nfjs are ruthless?\n\n\nim just trying to get to the core of this, in my experience ntjs have more inner emotion and can experience anger , while nfjs tend to be more cold and detached probably due to ni-ti and can become more cold and heartless=ruthless \n\n\nso can i say entj=wrathful\n\n\nnfjs= ruthless?\n\n\nthis oviously if the nfj or entj has gone wrong or bad.!\n\n\nbut in your experiences would you say, you experience more intense anger or temper? than the colder nfjs?
11	Not particularly. If someone wrongs me that I'm not close to, I'll probably move on and just keep that tidbit of information in mind for a good while. If someone wrongs me that I'm close with, I'll talk to them or let it slide, depending on how serious it is. Rarely do I get very angry and "wrathful".
3	I have a terrifying temper. I can go from room temperature to hotter than the surface of the sun in a millisecond (hence the username). However, me being an ENTJ has nothing to do with it. \n\nI'm diagnosed with a personality disorder (*not* borderline), and that's the underlying cause of it for me. It's gotten better with time and therapy but progress has been painfully slow, and my lack of self-awareness for many many years didn't help anything at all. But nothing can be done about all that now, the past is the past. I have to play with the cards I've been dealt, it is what it is. \n\nLife goes on. 
2	It goes deeper my friend, much deeper. You have got to peel more layers of the onion.\n\nI would say that ENTJs are armadillos and NFJs are platypi if you know what I mean ...\n\nP.S. The squirrel will be ready for breakfast at exactly 2 AM Feb 2nd Greenwich time. Maybe 5 minutes before that if you are impatient but not guaranteed.\n
2	ENTJ bf mostly gets angry if someone’s really incompetent. If they’re just underhanded and a bad person, he’s more chill about it than other people around him. 
14	Advice	15 yo ENTJ here, what's some advice that you consider vital or wish you knew at that age? \n\nEdit: Thanks in advance for the replies
39	Compete with yourself instead of others\n\nDont take people in HS, or HS politics so seriously. Within the first year out youll realize how little it all really matters\n\nDont base your personality off of your MBTI\n\nBe sure to stop and smell the roses
21	Start exercising daily if you're not already. It makes your body and mind feel amazing, and it's way easier to stay fit than get fit. If you're just starting, do one day where you do cardio like running, cycling, rowing machine, etc, then do body weight exercises like push ups, pull ups, planks, lunges, etc. Get in the habit of this primarily to harden your mind, and you will start to feel better about your body as well.\n\nDiscipline your eating. It's OK to pig out and eat a whole bag of chips or eight slices of pizza every now and then (like once a month or less), but if you're doing that every week, your habits will catch up with you. Vegetables are easy to cook, and they are very good for you. Consider eating not until you are *full*, but until you are *not hungry anymore.* It's OK to feel hungry in between meals. You're not going to die, and eventually your body will adapt.\n\nDiscipline your screen time. If you're getting bored of TV or video games, read instead. Or exercise, or do something creative, or call your friends, or listen to a podcast, or listen to music. It's OK to turn off your brain every now and then, but don't become a couch potato. Don't get used to living in a fantasy world. The real world is far more compelling.\n\nMake sure you have a creative outlet, whether it's writing, visual art, music, or another craft. This is a great way to channel your emotions so that you're controlling them; they're not controlling you.\n\nSTRETCH. Every day when you get out of the shower, put your foot up on the sink, or every night before you go to bed, try to touch your toes and then reach far behind you to arch your back. Yoga is hugely underrated because of its new age stigma. Achieving a full range of motion with your body will improve your posture and reduce your risk of injury.\n\nAlways keep an open mind and be willing to try new things. Listen to others when they speak, and try not to interrupt them. Don't always be the one driving conversations. You will be surprised what you discover. Do you ever feel like everyone is stupid? If so, you would be correct. Everyone is stupid -- including you!\n\nDon't smoke weed until you graduate college (or turn like 23 or 24). Like other psychedelic drugs, weed is a mind-altering substance that will give you sensory experiences you cannot experience without it. Once you "press the button," you can't go back to not knowing what weed feels like. Wait until you are happy with your life plan and your brain is fully developed to try it.\n\nDon't drink alone. Alcohol is for social situations. Don't drink to excess.\n\nMOST IMPORTANTLY: Think about what you want from your life. Meditate on this concept very deeply. Ask yourself: how do you want to impact the world? In what ways do you want the world to be irreversibly changed once you've left the earth? Maybe you want to be a therapist, or an engineer, or a business owner, or a doctor, or a scientist doing research, or an author, or a musician, or any other number of careers or passions. Choose the one you really, really love, that will absorb your thoughts for weeks at a time, and DO NOT let others sway you from that path. You are the only one who's ultimately driving your body and mind, so you get to decide to use it however the fuck you want. Use it to change the world for the better -- by doing the thing you love most.\n\nGood luck on your journey. You are very, very young. Enable the success of your future self by forming good habits of body and mind now! The right decision is not always *satisfying*, the right decision is *fulfilling.*
15	Try to understand the F types as soon as you can. You don't have to be like them, but knowing how they operate will let you make things happen faster. 
9	Your mental health is important. Learn how to take care of it: track your moods if you feel like you are constantly depressed/anxious. Speak with a parent or a doctor if you reach the point where you think medication will be helpful. You are stronger than your mental illness, and despite feeling like it much of the time, you don’t actually want to die. \n\nDo your homework. Pay attention in class. Ignore high school politics: after high school, none of that matters. The world is much bigger than that one building. \n\nJournal, if you don’t already. It helps you keep track of your emotions and it can help you work through some things. 
3	Practice relating to others and try to feel the love people are showing you
2	Learn mnemonics and how to do a mindmap so you cruise though HS and university with brilliant marks. It will give you the habit of working smart instead of stubbornly hard, so you can achieve more, better, quicker. Tony Buzan wrote nice books about it, you only need one in general, they are all very alike.
2	Don’t take life so seriously, enjoy being free and minimal responsibility while you can!
1	Kids these days. When I was your age, I was 16.
1	Read as much as you can, pick up books that explain how the world works and how people think. Remember Knowledge is power. Learn to understand that life really is a game but you need to learn the rules to succeed. Learn to drown out the noise in HS, there is so much nonsense that happens that honestly won’t matter the second you step into college.

5	xNTJ can't tell if i'm INTJ or ENTJ	I've taken a myriad of different test and watched countless videos and I definitely relate a lot more to ENTJ's than I do INTJ's yet I normally score as an INTJ on cognitive functions test and ENTJ on a like personality test. I took enneagram and scored a 3w4. I'll post my scores below, in your opinion am I an ENTJ or INTJ. For those of you who also struggled between choosing ENTJ or INTJ. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLittle background: I'm def a TE dom but due to mental health issues growing up I had no choice but to develop my Fi over my Se even though it's still extremely weak. I'm a 20 year old Systems Engineering major trying to develop myself and improve in every aspect of my life and mbti was a great way for me to do this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/mqrnej68ald21.png
10	Youve answered this urself. Ur a Te dom with mental health issues growing up. So ur an entj with mental healths issues while growing up.\n\nUr Preference to use Ni is way too low to be an intj
4	>due to mental health issues growing up I had no choice but to develop my Fi over my Se even though it's still extremely weak.\n\nI feel you on this one... I'm 5 years further down the road and Se is *still* difficult. I'm also in systems engineering by the way! \n\nAnyway. I was at a similar point, except that I was convinced that I was more of an INTJ than a ENTJ because I'm actually quite introverted and need a lot of alone time to decompress from social interaction. This was before I realized that social introversion has nothing to do with E/I in MBTI typing.\n\nMy realization came about the same time I slowly moved into systems engineering. I realized that my mind sorts things 'out there in the world' and not 'inside my head'. \n\nMy 'light bulb moments' were always linked to seeing, hearing, discussing something currently happening/being a reality. My Ni was used to connect all those individual experience 'in real life' and gain greater insight on how to improve systems 'in real life'. \n\nFrom a systems engineering perspective, it goes a bit like this:\n\nAn INTJ would have a much more formalized internal framework of 'reality as an optimized system would look like x' and the INTJ would work to change reality to fit x. In this case, creating the vision of what x *should* be is their dominant Ni at work (supported by Te to make it viable).\n\nI go 'reality can be seen as a system currently organized as y, but could be improved by changing functions and interactions between subsystems to have the system organized as z instead' and act to make reality fit z. In my case, the iteration from system design y to design z is my dominant Te at work (supported by Ni for 'whole is greater than its parts' insight).
1	You are in your house. You are alone. You can't watch TV or play video games. How long before you start to go crazy?
17	INTJ and ENTJ friendship fallout	I’m an INTJ and I was really close to an ENTJ for a long time and we had a gradual fallout and for various reasons. Most of which being we both have been busy and whatever. Although One night I think he got upset cause I didn’t invite him to my birthday dinner and then we gradually stopped communicating so much and then now it’s turned into this pride thing where neither of us wants to talk about it or act like we care but both of us have enough intuition to know that we both care. \n\n\nI know for damn sure we aren’t gonna sit down and have some gross mushy heart to heart and talk about how we miss each other so I went ahead and tried to just hang out a few times and I bought some peace offerings when I was out of town to kind of break the ice. I got nothing back.\n\nWe really are two of the strongest willed people around who have no problem cutting people out of our lives. It’s unfortunate because the longer we don’t talk the less the chances of ever talking again. \n\n\nAny advice? \n
28	I never understand what you INTJs are thinking when you do things like throw birthday parties and don’t invite your best friend and then act shocked when said best friend gets pissed off at you. I’ve had this exact same thing happen to me.\n\nIf you want to be friends again I would recommend you sincerely apologize. We aren’t above forgiveness just because we are strong willed and stubborn. Say you’re sorry for your part in it (as long as you really are sorry and sincere about your apology) and see where it takes you. If he doesn’t accept it, then you are no worse off. \n\nGood luck! 
7	As an INTJ you should understand more than anyone the value of an inner circle.  If this guy was as close to you as you claim and you didn't invite him to your birthday, then trust me when I say he probably took that personally and probably re evaluated your worth to him (thinking you didn't value him as much as he thought you did).  Like you guys, we are fiercely loyal to our true friends who are often very few, and we expect the same in return.\n\nIf he is worth it just explain how it all transpired and say sorry for the misunderstanding.\n\nWhy do I give this advice? I am in a relationship with an INTJ woman and have been for years.
7	Why didn’t you invite him to your birthday dinner? 
5	Be obvious and ask about the problem straightforwardly. We only understand (and appreciate) direct talk and won't react on shady attempts.
4	You’re probably already leaning one way or the other, but my only advice is to check in with yourself and ask if this is a relationship worth fighting for. Is it valuable enough to you? If so, be the bigger person. If not, the way he is currently acting speaks for itself.\n\nDon’t know if this really helps, but it’s my $0.02.\n\nEdit: grammar
1	my guess is that its all in your head, and you created a selffulfilling prophecy.   \nthats my experience 
1	my second guess, is that maybe your intimacy / attraction for him wasnt that great, as most introverts suck at not being validated. and you slowly distanced yourself to make him come to you and offer validation. a bit like girl strategy
8	Do ENTJ Women Attract Controlling Men? Dealing with Power Struggles	I’ve noticed that a lot of the men I encounter become OBSESSED with trying to dominate me in relationships. I think they like that I’m independent, smart, and challenging at first, but then it devolves into them trying to control me too much.\n\nI know how to attract a man, but I don’t know how to keep it from continuously devolving into power struggles. \n\nI think me like the idea of an ENTJ woman more than they like being with one.\n\nDo you all have this experience?
8	Maybe try to find a guy who does not feel useless around you, someone who accomplished more and someone who does not constantly have to artificially look like an alpha next to you because he knows that you won't outshine him\n\nSounds like a petty power struggle but that is how humans evolved. We are a dimorphic species.\n\n
8	Oh man 100%, happens to me a lot. Men professing to like my independent, goal-oriented personality, only to eventually get threatened and either try to nail me down or get me to submit in weird ways. \n\nAt this point, I stop listening to what men say and watch what they do. Any guy who has gender role hangups, who cares too much about what other people think, or who is super anal about minutiae is an automatic no for me. \n\nI think it's just about finding someone who meshes with you. I've had two relationships with zero power struggle issues, my college boyfriend and now with my current SO. Both guys are super chill and laid back, dorky and sappy, and don't like having to conform to the societal image of "a man."( For reference, I think my ex is ISFP and my current SO is ESFP). For contrast, my current SO has had similar issues with gender roles and expectations when dating. Because he's extraverted and charismatic, women project an image on him as this dominant, high-powered executive type, when he actually hates being in charge of people, can't plan more than an hour in advance, and is adorably whimsical and frenetic in day-to-day life. 
7	Find an INTP
2	I’ve only really been in two ‘real’ relationships, and in both of them it involved the guy trying to belittle and make me feel small.\n\nThe first one said I was ‘rude’ and ‘arrogant’, thought girls that wanted to go to the gym ‘butch’ and was an all-round hypocrite. He tried to tell me what a controlling person I was and tried to control me so...\n\nAnd the second got 0.5 higher on his ATAR (Australian SAT, basically) so thought he was entitled to make snooty and arrogant and make comments to make me feel stupid as well as control me into making choices I wasn’t ready for. \n\nSo yes, I agree? I think our extraversion and confidence  is attractive at first, then they just want to ego trip themselves in breaking us down 🙄
1	What happens if you talk to them about it?
1	Try going for males with a more feminine energy like INFPs and even INTPs.  They are both on the passive side and would be the yin to your yang (Te dom women are more on the masculine side).

5	Anyone play musical instruments?	Hi ENTJs! Just wondering if any of you play any musical instruments? If so, how did you start? What tools did you find useful to learn about playing music? Reason being my bf is one of yous and I want to help him learn how to play ukulele (for a start) and then slowly guitar, and then piano (he always wanted to play). I learned to play guitar and piano when I was a kid but I've always play by ear and my theory is not that strong. I feel like a horrible teacher because apparently he does not understand my method.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny tips would be very appreciated! <3
2	I play guitar. Learnt by ear and reading tabs. I think learning guitar first would actually be easier since it’s a standard tuning that makes sense in a similar pattern across strings. \n\nSome basic theory regarding major and minor notes will help, but isn’t necessary to begin with.\n\nI’d suggest starting off with some chords like A, Am, E, C, G and D. Just strumming these in different patterns will cover a number of songs and be rewarding for quick progress.\n\nIf you have access to a nylon string guitar it’ll be easier on their fingers.
2	Classical pianist and opera singer here. I’ve been playing the piano from an early age and I’ve been singing since I knew what singing was. Had many years of lessons/training in both and practiced extensively. \n\nMy advice is regardless of how anyone learns, make sure to practice consistently. I know it sounds so basic but it’s the best advice I’ve ever gotten and it will inevitably lead to results. Practice, practice, and practice. \n\nAlso, *never* be afraid to ask for help if you need it! Learning music theory and so on can be difficult for a lot of people, don’t be afraid to ask around. You’d be surprised at how many people are around that are willing to help people who are genuinely willing to learn. \n\nWhen I was learning music theory what I did was do a lot of reading about it, I read the books my teachers gave me from cover to cover even when I was quite young, which rendered a couple of them speechless, heh. I also practiced a lot of scales and chords for piano, I had to learn how it looked, felt, and sounded when I played the notes. I had to connect in my mind what the hell the key of f minor (for example) was not just on paper but also on the piano itself. I had to learn not just what it looked like on sheet music but also what it felt like when I played it, what it looked like when I played those scales and chords, and most importantly what it sounded like.\n\nAnother thing I did and still do when I’m learning a new piece is that I’ll get the sheet music, find a recording of the piece in question, and read the music as I’m listening to the recording of it. It works quite well for me. Just throwing that out there. \n\nOne thing I discovered about myself though that is unusual that really helped me, is that I have perfect pitch. That put me ten steps ahead in so many ways, but most people don’t have that and they still make it just fine in the musical world. \n\nThere’s nothing inherently wrong with playing by ear, a ton of people do that and do it well. I’ve been able to pick up a hell of a lot by ear myself (some sight-reading purists would call that cheating but I call it being efficient, heheheheh). But for someone that’s new to music I’d recommend starting with some books for beginners about music theory and so on, and get books geared towards whatever instrument he wants to learn of course. He’ll discover his preferred method of learning as time goes on. Everyone learns differently as I’m sure you know. \n\n*Edited to add a few things and to reword a few parts because I’m under the weather at the moment, stomach bug, yikes!* 
1	Session musician here, primarily a bassist but I play a bunch of different instruments. I started on violin but got really interested while playing guitar - most of my learning was done through trying to play songs that I liked, and I think a driven ENTJ could probably get on with that on their own. But definitely set him off on the right track with chords, and show him how to play some tunes he enjoys, particularly if they're easier to start off with.
1	Piano and Saxophone baby. All about getting into the groove
1	I play Trombone, Piano, Uke, Bass, and Acoustic Guitar. Sorry lad but the best way to start is when you're young. Music is a language more than anything else. You have to train your ears in each situation, you have to train your mind to be willing to sound *like shit*, and you need accountability. The piano is the best to start with because every other instrument falls in place behind it and intonation will be fantastic quicker. An ENTJ doesn't usually do well learning from a peer, but if you were to set him up with an older teacher that might help. The accountability of having someone to call teacher will probably help. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPiano: Hook yourself up with a teacher or buy children's piano books (theory, recital, lesson, technique, and an actual beginner's solo book, or this: [https://www.alfred.com/alfreds-adult-piano-courses/b/](https://www.alfred.com/alfreds-adult-piano-courses/b/)) and take time with the basics. Attention to detail is very important and pacing is very important. One to two pages per book a week, practice at least 15 minutes each day.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGuitar and Uke: balance between the important skills: fingerstyle, strumming, and scales. You can do that just by learning how to read tabs and listening to songs with good (easy) guitar parts. Pace yourself, guitar books are a scam. 
18	Chicken wings?	How do you guys feel about chicken wings? This entj woman i know really loves my chicken wings...I mean, she's really REALLY into them. Says she "can't get enough" of my chicken wings, really emphatically. \n\nIs this a common or normal entj thing? Is it just her? I would like to think that maybe there's something special about my chicken wings in particular. \n\nAny mbti info on this?
23	[deleted]
16	This subreddit is so unexpectedly funny sometimes, lol. 
11	So are chicken wings how I capture an ENTJ woman in the wild? (For myself and the overwhelming flood of INTPs here lately)
8	If your ENTJ doesn’t love *your* chicken wings...\n1) they are not your ENTJ\n2) are they ENTJ to begin with?
6	Raw or cooked?
5	I find them tedious and unhealthy. I'm way more into filling myself up with disgusting amounts of hummus. ;)
4	What does KFC have to do with being a dictator
5	Whose mans is this lmao. Gotta love the INTP silly side. Chicken wings is the price we’re all paying for having such a boring mbti sub. And also for people having too much time on their hands at work. WORK THEM HARDER PEOPLE. 
3	I think it's a human thing. 
3	If you like chicken wings, you are most likely not an ENTJ, just an ESTJ that believes she/he is an ENTJ. Anyway nobody is an ENTJ here. Except me. You are all not-ENTJ and I am the only one exceptional being that fits the paintings of Margaret Thatcher and Gary Kasparov on the wikipedia article. Even if I like chicken wings.
2	Went to Buffalo for my BA.  Duffs FTW!
2	What’s crazy is I was juuuust thinking about chicken wings. I went vegan for 6 months and I literally had vivid dreams about chicken wings. I buy the big frozen bags of wings and bake them on baking sheets. You may be on to something here. \n\nAlso, I know everyone goes crazy for lemon pepper or an southern style chicken wings, but Koreans are the Underrated Champs of Fried Chicken for real for real. 
2	I wanted to call you ridiculous but wings are actually my favorite food lol

7	Entj men x intp women	Okay, all you special snowflakes.. I need to know EXACTLY what you may enjoy about a relationship with an INTP and what you might not. Especially INTP women. And I'm fishing for compliments here.\n\nI'm in a relationship with an ENTJ (total space case, ex-party crasher and professional gamer) and I just can't talk about relationships with him too much because he gets irritated. We can talk about philosophy, politics, history, social injustices and a whole list of other things, but I think I just get too soppy talking about relationships and feelings too much.\n\nSeeing as it's a safe place to share here - tell me all about this pls.
11	Chicken wings
7	Cant really generalize, but i know this infp with an Se blind spot like intps and she needs to shower and take care of her appearce more. huge turn off for me when a girl doesnt groom herself
4	What’s the end goal you are trying to achieve by talking about the relationship or feelings? It might get annoying if it’s all talk that doesn’t go anywhere. If my partner talked to me for hours about their feelings just because, I’d be outta there. \n\nIf they tell me they are telling me these things because they want me to understand them better and it’s an effective way to better our relationship, I’m all ears and then if I care about the person, I’ll devise an action plan to validate those feelings so they feel appreciated. \n\nI like INTPs because I find they’re the quirkiest of the NTs. There’s something adorably awkward about them that makes me protective of them and want to be affectionate towards them.. but only if they shower and keep themselves groomed. Some INTPs can be gross AF.
1	You kind of like go close with each other in a short time.. And then back off... \n\n

2	entjs ....?	entjs how good would you say you are at manipulation and influencing others?
14	I am better at eating sandwiches but not bad.
11	I’m not manipulative but I unknowingly influence others, I’ve noticed. I just do me and out of the blue, people start telling me how I inspired them to do something they were afraid to do. Or people just start copying what I do/ become my followers.\n\nI think it has less to do with manipulation and more to do with perceived maturity, enthusiasm and confidence. 
5	not really interested in manipulating people. when i tell people to do something, they'll do it because it's something that needs to be done, and they recognise that it is best done the way i have suggested. 
5	So good to the point where i dont even notice that im doing it\n\nWhich is why i spend most of my time alone
5	I influence the influencers.
3	manipulation and influence are separate topics. entjs are the type to go for aggression not manipulation. but if need be, sure, ill manipulate. its a skill , depends on ur context, but i think u would turn ENFJ if u had to do it so much .. 
2	I'm quite good at influencing people, it comes naturally. For a long time I didn't realize I was doing it. When I did realize it I started doing it intentionally and it's definitely a useful tool. 
7	ENTJ and ESTP relationship	Have any of you guys been in a romantic relationship with an ESTP? If so, how was it like? And if you could choose, would you rather be in a relationship with an ESFP or an ESTP?
5	I haven't, but I know the sensing types are prone to live their life according to their feelings. I've seen that from an ISFP. It's a very different approach on life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall:\n\nIt's up to you.\n\nPeople have a lot of factors on top of their mbti-type such as personal interests, history, genes etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn general:\n\nESFPs are sensitive, ESTPs are not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you want to live your life as a party everyday, ESFP.\n\nIf you want to live your life with risks (good and bad), ESTP.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn relationship (main role):\n\nENTJ -> supportive-role -> ESFP.\n\nENTJ -> cooperative-role -> ESTP.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs far as planning goes, the judging type (In this case, ENTJ) will / should always be in charge of it.
4	ESFPs are lots of fun. They will appeal to your hidden romantic notions, but their emotionally is exhausting once the new wears off of the relationship. Also, their infatuation with new things and people tends to fade, and they have a hard time making sense of why. Their own confusion becomes troubling and they delve into Se trying to find the next fun thing.\n\nESTPs have more long term potential, I think. They are fun and adventurous without being exhaustingly sensitive, and they provide a great dynamic for witty banter.
3	I had a deep seated disdain for ESTPs until I actually dated one. He was actually very sweet, a lot of fun.. and probably the best sex I’ve ever had. Had enough in common to get along, enough differences for it to be exciting. \n\nDidn’t work out because I work 60 hours a week and his lack of planning and love for spontaneity = me being extremely difficult and snippy because too exhausted mentally and physically to want to go on adventures with him. \n\nMy best friend who claims to be an INTJ also somehow flipped a switch and started testing as an ESTP.. but he’s also great, and we work really well together, he lets me have my way and has accepted that I am right 99% of the time.  Hah.
2	i have an instinct to want to fight them, even though i know they're actually OK people
1	Lol I meant the above to be for the original poster not a reply to the comment!
1	Once hit on a female ESTP on personality cafe, the conversations got sexual fast and she wanted to come meet me. Julius Caesar with Cleopatra.
1	I’m dating one now–met him in consulting–we travel together, like the idea of moving from city to city all over the world. \n\nWe have the same values, I (ENTJ) plan = lead/make long term decisions. He (ESTP) makes all the immediate decisions and daily/everyday decisions. \n\nI give him 1,000% freedom, autonomy, and open mindedness so he can be himself judgement free. He in turn places my career first, makes sure I take care of myself through discipline at the gym, taking vacations, practicing mindfulness. \n\nHe saids I tame him and provide perspective he other wise wouldn’t have benefited from because he doesn’t use his Ni very much.\n\nAny-who, it’s working out thus far but I don’t add pressure to the relationship and we take it one day at a time. \n\nAll I can say is that I appreciate him even if he is a high risk liability on many if not on all possible fronts lolz
6	INTP here: in criticism of the LTR of ENTJ-INFP romance	Hi all, same INTP here that was forwarding the ENTJ-INTP romance. I have recently read a decent amount of INTP and ENFJ LTR relationships and have marked about how they can last for years until they eventually break(neediness claim by INTP, not enough affection claim by ENFJ). Some of these people have used poly relationships to cover the gaps.\n\nI wanted to say a couple things about my own relationship with an INFP to see if anyone could relate but also to give some possible insight into what might be long term problems for the ENTJ-INFP relationship.\n\nI'm a Ti dominant obviously(INTP) which means I build a subjective logic framework to represent reality. This subjective reality creation is guided by my Fe goals ultimately. I don't just latch onto some random object and devour it until I understand it...that would be stupid. I'm looking for the most ideal/efficient way to solve the problem I am currently looking at...if I wasted my time analyzing the leaf on the ground and then the rock and then the asphalt I'd never finish my goal. I only analyze those things if I believe they offer a greater value towards my goal than anything else at the time. Te users will likely share this as well. They do devour large amounts of information like the INTP, but it is still ultimately guided by Fi.\n\nSo lets look at INFP. They don't feel what anyone else feels. To make sense of this for you(since you use Fi too), an ENFJ will often remark about how they don't think they even have their own feelings...this is all Fe users. An ENFJ's mood will come down just by being around people who are down in mood. They take on the emotions of others. Fi, by contrast, makes a subjective emotional map of things. An ENFJ just feels the current mood, they don't go beyond that and start assuming how people will feel in other contexts. Fi users do, they build this whole map of a person. Think of an Fi user as spending large amounts of time around the ENTJ and after knowing enough about the ENTJ they could fairly reliably do things like "ENTJ will feel x emotion if he was in a cave and was given the option to save either his mother or his sister by murdering psychopaths"\n\nSo in a relationship with an ENTJ, the infp will give direction to the Te of the ENTJ while the ENTJ will give the INFP some realistic plans that are confirmed truth. They NEED one another. And this is crucial. They become dependent on one another it would seem. They will mutually cause enourmous amounts of growth, just like the INTP ENFJ. The problem imo is that the growth is not long term. It is only within the context of "meaning and feeling" that INFP is valuable. Similarly it is only within the context of achieving something that the ENTJ is valuable. The problem with this being...that Fi or Te do in its pure form. A pure Fi or Fe baby would literally just feel all day and do nothing. Similarly, a pure Ti/Te baby would just conceptualize all of reality without direction or eye to efficiency and would also do nothing.\n\nThis is good respectively for both Ti/Te in each relationship because sometimes we get lost. We don't know what we want to achieve next or why and thus we analyze, we solve the problem of not having a problem. Enfj and INFP give us a direction to go, but at some point you will have your life direction figured out...\n\nI ran into this problem my INFP partner and you will too. We(entj and intp) love problem solving a competitions, but INFP and ENFJ don't. They are not geared for it, just like we are not geared for understanding the emotions of others(it doesn't motivate us...or at least it does but only in a big picture sense. For me this is : I want to help people...duh... but this is not initially obvious to intp or entj likely.) What this natural disconnect in how we are geared leads to is that we became stale. We talked about everything, and what is left? Hobbies. Recreation. Your day. But it was hard to enjoy those together because everything I dominated at she sucked at and vice versa. It leads to bitterness, but not only bitterness...it leads to understanding that the hobbies each of us want to do are entirely different. We had to constantly sustain "meaningful" conversations in order to talk at all, otherwise it had to be humor(natural enjoyment). You can joke around for a while but eventually you just don't have shit to say that will still be meaningful to the other person. Now ENTJ will not have this, they extravert their Te so naturally will restart conversation, but this disconnect in hobbies and what is appreciated will persist. The question is whether the INFP wants to talk about Te, but I would say: they don't. Infp and ENFJ when talking about their day just wanna talk about everyone's emotions they "experienced." In other words, mutually thinking one another are vapid and concerned with largely meaningless things.\n\nThe further you both get into "meaninglessness" the less you will share. All our societal problems are temporary in the timeless sense. Everyone loves doing what they are best at, but what ENTJ/INTP and INFP/ENFJ are best at is complete opposites. When the day comes for you to settle down into the meaningless hobbies, there will be no hobby between you two. You don't want to sit around talking about feelings...you want to achieve and you want to talk about what you achieve not just in a feeling sense but in terms of the process of doing whatever it is you do(why do you think INFP want to talk about how everyone felt when something happened during their day...they feed off it while you tune it out naturally).\n\nI would suggest INTP/ENTJ spend their younger years with their counterparts ENFJ/INFP respectively. Learn life direction and your inferior. Once you are comfortable with your inferior, meet up with INTP and achieve endless things.\n\nIf you meet up with INTP too early, you will be a train...but also a wreck. You'll both demolish anything in your path, but you won't know how to help one another with finding the path to take. Your strengths will compound and your weaknesses will to. This is only a problem when you need your weakness(i.e. you need help finding a path). One day though, when meaninglessness sets in, your path will be purely competition and self mastery. You will not need Fi or Fe further guidance, as the value is intrinsic in serving your team to victory. When you don't have your weakness to a sufficient level of strength you'll feel the tug to answer(when you hurt the fuck out of billy bob's feelings cause he can't screw on a lugnut...), but you won't know how, and the INTP won't be able to help you as much as you need at the time.\n\nThe goal isn't to make yourself dive deep into your inferior imo. The goal is to get it to a point where you can reasonably respond to it and recognize when you need to dive into it(versus simply ignoring and moving on).\n\nWhen you do have your life direction, and you start getting into hobbies for enjoyment too...power couple. Infp Entj is not a power couple. It's a balancing act and it'll lead to moderation.\n\nFor the ENTJ especially liberal in taste, you could always do a poly relationship and achieve everything with me and make a emotional support relationship with the INFP too ;) but that might lead to an general lack of emotion for us so it's risky business.\n\nYou also might check out ISTP relationships. They will be more aggressive physically than INTP. They also handle day to day things well so that you don't fall into the long range planning but nothing done INTP-ENTJ pitfall. I just sometimes feel braindead talking to sensors because the topics seem minute. This can sometimes be good for balancing acts again, but again..if you are gonna orient yourself to your maximum strengths, it will be idea competition. Not physical competition like sports(despite appreciating the competition aspect). That being said, this is REALLY deep into maximizing outcomes. I've heard good things about LTR between entj-istp, and the shared Se-Ni will make for easier communication(focused). The Se and Ni being middle functions will mean about equal strength which means you can stomach talking about the other topic for longer(unlike the Inferior which you'll run into with INFP)\n\n"My .02" as an ENTJ in my last thread put it.
9	An interesting piece. I'm a little surprised that you seem to take it as a given that there will be harmony between the Te and Ti styles of ENTJ and INTP, since my own experience is that I have limited patience for the Ti mode of analysis.
3	for example, two ENTJ-INFP right now already have a meaningful relationship at the age of about 40, they're both already comfortable with their inferior. Do you recommend them to break up and then find themselves a "shadow partner" so that they can enjoy life more?
5	I really dislike when people fixate on the compatibility of certain types. My INFP and ENFJ friends can talk for hours about what actions we can take to solve problems we see on the micro and macro level. My ENTJ and I enjoy these explorations too, although I do find that my ENTJ only adopts my conclusions after he’s had time to ponder the ones he originally found incorrect (it could just be a guy thing, though). What I’m trying to say is, good, meaningful Te/ Ti conversations can be found with anyone willing to explore them with you. Compartmentalizing the various personality types into what they will/ won’t explore isn’t the proper use for MBTI. 
2	I actually have concluded this recently as well (not all of the details of course, just the general INFP first then INTP as mates for ENTJ). My conclusion is just based off my life experiences and isn't scientific of course. I have dated a *lot* of men, but my three most serious relationships were ISTP, INFP, and INTP (in that order). \n\nISTP and I were not good for each other, but we were both young idiots. I appreciated his even temper but we were really unhealthy otherwise. There was a constant struggle for control of me and he gaslighted me and it was not good. I have dated other ISTPs and they have not been insane like he was. Our discussions were very boring and mundane. Sex was boring (sex with most sensors  is boring, just sort of two fleshy bodies rubbing up on each other and very little context/banter/creativity).\n\nThe INFP and I felt so comfortable, but he was not willing to look after his health (physical AND mental), and I just couldn't deal with it any more. He had very unrealistic career choices and would not adapt for economical reasons. Terrible with finances, just awful. We were highly dependent on each other as you surmised. Our discussions were always passionate, but he would not ever DO things. He was HIGHLY sensitive to his own moods and would never just "suck it up" so we could get shit done. He was unreliable, especially if times were stressful. Sex was pretty great.\n\nThe INTP and I are relatively new, so I can't claim this is exhaustive. Type aside, he is a little insecure (and would therefore never do an open relationship). He hates to be helped, whereas the other types appreciated it (he likes the politeness of me offering to help with a task, but hates the implication of needing help because he's unable to do the task alone). He values that I perceive him as competent, and he values that he perceives me as competent. I've been with incompetent people for so long I forgot what it was like to be able to rely on someone. Sometimes we get competitive over being productive (he'll do a chore and I'll do a bigger chore then he'll do a bigger chore etc). He never minds if I need a lazy day (whereas my ISTP ex really hated it when I had lazy days). He values manners/etiquette SO MUCH MORE than me, but my INFP ex already helped me learn bf/gf manners (ENTJs sometimes don't value manners at all........ but INFPs are pretty good at asserting their needs). My INTP boyfriend would have been much less forgiving of teaching me that I need to value politeness even at home. I still slip up, the routine of saying the same things everyday really isn't my thing... I wish I could automate manners.\n\nAnyways where he and I shine are at conversations. We have really interesting, winding conversations that never end. I could talk with this man forever and ever. He does not like emotionally close conversations (and discussing things like disturbing facts about someone he knows aka "public secrets" - except I LOVE talking about shit like that and I have so many secrets like that in my brain). Because of that, I have to initiate and force emotional conversations about he and I, and it goes good enough haha. We are pretty great at sex and neither of us is judgmental. 
1	I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:\n\n- [/r/mbti] [What do you all think of this?](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/akpt9e/what_do_you_all_think_of_this/)\n\n&nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))*
1	INTP here. I had a FWB relationship with an INFP and I'm currently 2 years into a relationship with an ENTJ. I relate to a lot that you're saying.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWith the INFP, he and I clicked immediately but ran out of things to talk about after six months. And I felt like I had to always watch my tongue so I wouldn't offend him. I love joking and teasing, but never felt comfortable with him.\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nThe ENTJ is completely different. There is no joke off limits. Before getting together seriously, we we were coworkers sitting next to each other for two years and we've never run out of stuff to talk about. (However, I think this is just how extroverts are. They're always talking.) It's always really interesting conversations though, unlike the ones I've had with EXFXs. I've noticed we both are more interested in what we have to add to the subject, but that doesn't seem to be a problem. We very often disagree on things, but we're both pretty good about accepting each other's differences. \n\n\n\nWe make a really good team in mutual projects. We have complimentary hobbies and we're always collaborating on stuff together. He's great about getting me motivated even in my solo projects. It helps to have someone who will say, "okay, let's get back to work." And I'm pretty good at spotting the little details he's missing. I'm his draftsman and he's my project manager. It's like our strengths align perfectly so that we both get to shine without directly competing.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI will say, I used to be married to an ENTP and there isn't the same mind melding with the ENTJ. With the ENTP, it's like we were finishing eachothers thoughts. With my ENTJ, we're always coming together across a divide. By our very natures we see everything from different perspectives. But that keeps things refreshing and I think it keeps us practiced in trying to understand each other. With the ENTP, we understood each other effortlessly, except when we didn't and then we had no clue how to resolve it. The ENTP and I were also really toxic as a team. He wanted to always come up with the ideas and resented input or changes that weren't his to the plan. I was expected to do all the leg work, which I sucked at. \n\n\n\n
12	ENTJs, as a 21 year old ENTP I need your help to create and organise realistic goals	I have always been told you guys are the best at this, and after trying (and failing) to do it on my own I have decided to swallow my ego and actually ask someone who is more capable than me.\n\nMy biggest problem regarding this is creating short term goals that bring me closer to the long term ones. And the fact that I am probably aiming way too high doesn't really help at all, so this would be my second issue, not knowing if a goal is realistic or not.\n\nFor now, I have four main goals in my life. Three of them I want to complete before I turn 30, and the other one before I turn 40. They are the following:\n\n**Before 30:**\n\n**-Creating something that generates enough passive income to be able to pay for things that are not really important but I do enjoy, like going out to drink something with friends or taking my car and driving to a nearby city.**\n\n*I haven't started with this one yet.*\n\n**-Graduating with a CS degree in the 4 years it takes and getting a Masters in Artificial Intelligence after.**\n\n*This one is not going well. I do believe I can get both, but due to some serious procrastination issues that I am dealing with I believe it will take me about 1 or 2 years longer than expected, and I really do not want this to happen.*\n\n**-Finishing a personal project I am currently working on related to AI**\n\n*This one is going quite good compared to the other two, but I do believe I could do much better. For now I do not have any small goals for it, which means it's all unorganized 5-6 hours programming sessions every few days and even weeks sometimes.*\n\n**Before I turn 40:**\n\n**-Generating enough passive income to sustain myself and my family.**\n\n*I would say this is the most important one, because the other three can be seen as parts of it. They are all related and when I started each of them I had this in mind.*\n\nSo, as I said before, I have thought a lot about the long term, but I am unable to create short term goals. This makes me feel that I am stuck; which, combined with all the small things I have to do in my day-to-day life that I currently struggle with quite a bit (I do not feel proud to say that the messy and unorganized ENTP stereotype is true for me), gives me the feeling that I am useless at everything I do.\n\nDo you guys have any advice that can help me with those issues?
14	1. Wake up early.\n2. Exercise.\n3. Work more.\n4. Repeat step 1.
4	Develop a routine!\n\n\nObligatory plug to JBP, his book “12 rules for life: an antidote for chaos”, as well as his future authoring program, are phenomenal!\n\nDopamine fasts are worth trying too, simply look it up on youtube.\n\nAll this, along with things like drinking a healthy amount of water, eating healthy, exercise, taking multivitamins, etc etc actually do wonders for your productivity. Healthy body healthy mind!
3	2/2:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs far as passive income goes, there are a ton of different sources available in life. Most if not all of the truly passive sources involve a large amount of capital to begin, so I'd recommend figuring out how to improve your income to the point where you can comfortably invest and snowball. I live off of my rental income, and the money I make working (I work in the RE industry, Sales Assoc., Flipper/Rehabber, and Transactional funding) I reinvest into my business and investment portfolio (Which is 100% RE, simply because I know more about this industry than any other one). This is the way I pace myself and is continually rewarding. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot too much lifestyle creep either if you make a conscious effort to take more enjoyment from the 'little things' in life, I meditate, cook my own food, work out, etc etc not because I have to but because I'm perfectly content with it. Although I will admit I spoil myself when it comes to clothes and cars haha.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs far as procrastination goes, refer to my other comment. The psychology on motivation is known and studies are out there. It's as simple, and as complicated, as having a vision and connecting the dots. Leading a healthy lifestyle makes it about 100x easier though.

1	Get house. Rent house.
1	Look into creating SMART goals. \n\nTo make sure your goals are clear and reachable, each one should be:\n\n• Specific (simple, sensible, significant).\n• Measurable (meaningful, motivating).\n• Achievable (agreed, attainable).\n• Relevant (reasonable, realistic and resourced, results-based).\n•Time bound (time-based, time limited, time/cost limited, timely, time-sensitive).\n\n[Source: Reflektive - SMART Goal Examples](https://https://www.reflektive.com/blog/smart-goal-examples/) \n
18	Has to be said, Mad Men is one of the best ENTJ-authored shows that get to the heart of a Self-Preservational ENTJ in Don Draper.	I felt like I related most to Don Draper than any other character in film, books, shows, or music. Anybody else who has seen the show feel similar? I mean, how many people can argue that Don is anything other than a solid, tried and true ENTJ to the core?
9	...Don is a total narcissist. That overshadows his personality more than any other theoretical classification. Regardless, Matthew Hoffman did a fantastic job with both Mad Men and the Sopranos. Sopranos was my favorite show for a few years and when I watched Mad Men and it bumped to the #1 spot, it blew my mind to learn they were from the same creator.
7	Early season Frank from House of Cards was my favorite ENTJ, but I really enjoyed watching Don’s complexity and his self created identity. He was so brilliantly calculated, but made it look simple. 
13	He’s a great example of an ENTJ, especially for people who tend to mistake Extraverted as someone who is very social and outgoing. \n\nE means you just get more energy from being around people; that’s why Don loves being around women and working in an office. \n\nHe’s man of few words, but he is not usually a loner. \n\nCharismatic is obviously an ENTJ trait that fits. Also cold and ruthless.\n\nHe’s definitely a big picture person. While his pitches seem detailed and deeply meaningful, it’s because he usually “gets” the ultimate idea or feeling the client wants, even though he often waits until the last minute or even wings it when he pitches (efficiency). \n\nHe respects hierarchy and challenges, but often butts heads with his bosses (especially Cooper who is very detailed oriented and artsy / emotional). \n\nHe recognizes the skills in others which is a huge ENTJ trait. Especially with creatives. \n
4	Yes but he is like ENTJ x100. Borderline narcissist. Also lots of ENTJs I've met have been quite chatty, definitely weren't people who said only a few words in conversation. \n\nThe way he processed emotion though was exactly my experience of ENTJs. Suppressing emotion which came out in sensory ways eg. Oversocialising, drinking too much, lots of reckless, casual sex, emotional meltdowns at times involving tears and yelling once pushed to that level. BUT quickly recovered and composed themselves afterwards... Very intriguing trait. \n\nOne ENTJ I knew constantly apologised after emotional moments for not being 'together' - a real need to contain themselves and their feelings at all times. Don Draper did A LOT of this. \n\nThis can be unhealthy. I once pushed an ENTJ to recognise their real feelings and they broke down crying and all, only afterwards to say they felt a release and were grateful for me recognising their feelings. It was the only type to ever have this reaction. \n\nVery sentimental and sweet to people they love eg. Don Draper with his second wife in the early stages or describing how he feels towards Betty when he first met her to the real Draper's wife.\n\nA optimistic attitude with little time spent feeling sorry for oneself, but as an INFJ I can usually tell when they are putting up a front in face of adversity. It's then the optimism starts to grind my gears because I sometimes feel you just need to sit in your own and others' negative emotions in order to process them. 
5	Emotional people keep going.\n\nENTJs move on. \n\nSee everyone this is a CLEAR example. Please take notes. 
3	Mad Men is one of my favorite shows, surprisingly I see myself in Don at times and I'm a female. 
3	I recently marathon watched Mad Men for the first time.  I really relate to both Don and Peggy.  I'd lean towards Don being an ENTJ, but am on the fence...perhaps an unhealthy ENTJ?  \n\nAs a female ENTJ, I mostly relate to Peggy.  Some scenes that solidified this: Peggy coming up with great ideas on the fly, when Stan tells Peggy he loves her and her response is "what...?", her interactions/relationship with her mentor (Don), her practical wardrobe, buys a whole apartment building as an investment, her relationship with her mother, etc. \n\nIn addition, she gets along with the men in the office more than women (except Joan, who is a woman she respects) and treats men as her equal, she's forward thinking, has awkward relationships with other women in the office, is career-focused, pragmatic, excellent bullshit detector, doesn't share her true self other than with Don and eventually Stan, emotionally robotic, open-minded, control freak, gets shit done when needed, works hard/plays harder, is confident, knows what she wants,  etc.\n\nSome of the explanations that I've read online, arguing that Don is not an ENTJ amuse me.  For example, one person argued that Don isn't an extrovert because he was uncomfortable with Megan throwing him a surprise party.  Well, I've got news for you...a surprise party is one of my worst nightmares, especially if it was in my own home.\n\nIn watching the series, I had many many moments with both Don and Peggy thinking, "that is so me."
4	Don Draper is not an ENTJ. \n\nHe doesn’t have a long term...anything lol \n\nHe just wants to be the best, kind of sounds like an ESTP...think about it.
2	I haven't seen Madmen yet but will definitely check it out. So far Harvey Specter from Suits is my favourite ENTJ.
2	He’s a great example of an ENTJ, especially for people who tend to mistake Extraverted as someone who is very social and outgoing. \n\nE means you just get more energy from being around people; that’s why Don loves being around women and working in an office. \n\nHe’s man of few words, but he is not usually a loner. \n\nCharismatic is obviously an ENTJ trait that first. Also cold and ruthless.\n\nHe’s definitely a big picture person. While his pitches seem detailed and deeply meaningful, it’s because he usually “gets” the ultimate idea or feeling the client wants, even though he often waits until the last minute or even wings it when he pitches (efficiency). \n\nHe respects hierarchy and challenges, but often buts heads with his bosses (especially Cooper who is very detailed oriented and artsy / emotional). \n\nHe recognizes the skills in others which is a huge ENTJ trait. Especially with creatives. \n
1	Like I said not an ENTJ based on what you said above, also how do you know what the character wants? \n\nIsn’t that the entire point, that we don’t know why he IS but we can speculate. All these qualities I’ve seen from a handful of other personality traits. \n\nI argue he is not an ENTJ because those qualities are interpretations of a DRAMATIC character lol 
1	I suppose I just don’t care and that’s why you didn’t get an explanation.\n\nYou presented the same amount of info I did...only you say more words. \n\nYou presented Mad Men as context and then just connected a few points based on interpretation. \n\nWhy give you my interpretation if you have yours? I do not see an ENTJ—mute point. \n\nMaybe I’m trying to force you to force yourself to look at it differently. Maybe that’s what’s needed instead of more fucking low validity opinions rooted in nothing lol 
1	That was emotional you must just be ...emotional. I’m an ENTJ because I was right about not engaging there is all but feeling here and no logic. 
1	Don is INTJ.\nI know there are many reasons why u might think he is one of us (ENTJ). But realize that the frenetic Sex and cheating, the unhealthy impulses to start over is the Se as undeveloped 4th function.
0	Why are you still responding aiming for an emotional response...you’re embarrassing \n\nWhat is done is done so just shut the fuck up\n\nOr keep going I’m going to respond just to see how ridiculous or how far you’re willing to go...
2	ENFP dating ENTJ	      Hey, I’m an enfp female. I just started seeing an entj guy. I never usually maintain interest in one specific guy bc I prefer to casually date. However, this entj has grabbed my full attention where I have zero interest in anyone but him. (Which is a rarity for me.) \n       One giant problem: he cannot talk about emotions in person. He shuts down immediately. I’m so open with my emotions, so one of my biggest strengths is his biggest weakness. He is only comfortable expressing emotion in text messages. Every conflict has been due to our difference in processing emotion and objective facts. \n         We had a little argument today, and he said “I saw the way you were dressed the day we met. I know you dress super nice. But you need to watch what you say to me. You don’t know who I really am. I’m dangerous.”\n\n🔺So 2 questions: 🔺\n1. What are some tips for an enfp to help entj be more candid about his feelings instead of dropping hints and playing mind games with riddles? It just seems way more efficient and less time-consuming to be upfront. \n 2. What annoys you most in relationships with feeling dominant partners...so I can be more aware/vigilant \n3. What in the hell did he mean by the comment in quotations above ? It made no sense with the context of what we were actually talking about. Maybe a fellow entj would have an idea. \n\nThanks 😋
5	OP, I had a phase in my life where I'd make those type of comments. I'd process my feelings privately for some time, playing a movie in my head about the meaning of various things the other person said. Then I'd say strange things like the quote you shared from your ENTJ. I don't think it's necessarily something all ENTJs go through, but the low Fi probably makes the issue worse.\n\nI will attempt to put myself in his shoes by remembering why I behaved that way and answer your question from that perspective.\n\n1. I dropped hints and played mind games because I didn't know how to ask for personal space to work through my feelings. I was afraid that asking for personal space would signal disinterest so instead of admitting my weakness and insecurity I tried to dive in and control my way through the problem with tactics and strategies (TeNi style).\n2. Feeling dominants were frustrating (not annoying) to me back then because I hadn't sorted out my own "feeling boundaries" yet. I \*felt\* a pressure to conform to ideals that I perceived as "illogical" (or in violation of my authenticity). I wanted to seem cold and ruthless and "hid behind" my ENTJ type because I needed external justification (Te) for my ambiguous attitude towards "doing the right thing" (Fi). I had doubts (Te) and guilts (Fi) about living in the moment (Se) too much, about being a bit shallow and being attracted by appearances (Se) more than meaningful relationship (Feeling). I reasoned (Te) that if I could defend my attitude (Fi) and lifestyle (Se) with solid logic, then I win. This didn't work because, ultimately, it was inauthentic (not in accord with Fi). What I wish Feeling-dominants could have done for me then is to convey to me that Feelings are not irrational, illogical or weak. However, as an intimate partner you might not be the right person to convey this to him. It would be better if his mentor or someone he respects or admires could enlighten him to this fact.\n3. I'm a bit embarrassed to admit that I have said something similar in the past. Here's my interpretation below (I'm making fun of him a bit, so don't say this to him). \n\n* “I saw the way you were dressed the day we met." (Se, I am very attracted to you.)\n* "I know you dress super nice." (SeFi, I feel that you know exactly how to dress to attract me and I feel like I can't control it)\n* "But you need to watch what you say to me." (TeNi, You are very open about your Feelings and that seems extremely intimate to me and I would never be that vulnerable with a person until I knew them very well because I am afraid that opening up like that will get me exploited or taken advantage of, and that would hurt)\n* "You don’t know who I really am." (Immature Fi, I haven't opened up to you about what's important to me)\n* "I’m dangerous.” (LOL NiFi, I am receiving your candidness about your Feelings as overtures of intimacy and attachment and my Fi values are making me feel guilty because I'm more interested in my ambitions (TeNi) and shallow fun (Se) and I'm not ready to cultivate my aspirational self (Fi) but this process I am going through is pushing me into it and I feel it is violating my boundaries (Fi) making me more conscious of these parts of me that are still inadequate or inauthentic. This freaks me out, so I might just break things off and forget you and you will get hurt and here I have warned you so now you know and therefore everything is fair (Fi).)\n\nFor that last point, perhaps it's not fair at all, but with that low Fi, he may not want to face that right now.\n\nI don't think he is dangerous, because people who are dangerous tend to hide the fact. That being said, do be careful. I could be wrong.\n\nI would show interest in his goals and ambitions. He probably doesn't know this yet, but his Fi is woven into it already, to some extent. You can figure out that part of him based on what he implies rather than what he explicitly says. If you do this right, you will know his Fi better than he does, and one day he will "open up" to you about it (though you will already know). \n\nFinal point, I'm pretty sure nobody likes feeling manipulated but for a poorly developed, barely conscious Fi it might feel like an identity crisis or a boundary violation and lead to extreme reactions. Give the guy some space on that front. Meet him with your Ne and Te and he will eventually warm up to you on the Fi side of things. If you can match your Ne to his Se, even better. You can use your imagination to get him deeper "into the moment" (when you're just having fun together and he's not busy working on his stuff). As he gets more immersed in Se moments, he gets closer and closer to his Fi, and it comes from a happy, enjoyable place of self-exploration. (By the way, there is a major difference between expressing Fi and expressing SeFi. The first one is a very vulnerable place and he most likely will not enjoy it in the slightest. SeFi is the mode I am in right now, which enables me to laugh at myself as I talk about my mistakes and past immaturities. He really does want to include his Fi in his life, he just needs some subtle assistance to figure it out (Te) for himself (Fi).)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOP, that's all I got for you, from my perspective. I hope some of it has been helpful. Best of luck to you with your ENTJ. If all goes well, look out for the moment when he reflects on the past and is ready to laugh at his mistakes. If he is laughing about it, he is ready to let it go - so maybe show interest and laugh along with him. 
3	I’m kind of intrigued by what he meant there too. \n\nAre you no longer dressing up around him and he likes that you used to dress up (ie put in effort to impress him)? \n\nThe dangerous part makes him sound like a tool. Or maybe a serial killer tool, but definitely a tool. \n\nI’d ask him what he meant by all that. Being an ENTJ isn’t an excuse to make veiled threats at someone your dating. \n\n
3	He's either a complete douche or immature.  
2	2 drivers dont make it work, especially when driving different vehicles. hes driving a jetski, ur driving a surfboard.  \neither give up control, or resolve ur emotions somewhere else.  \nif i hear dumb shit, and im attracted, ill try to protect you, and wait for it to pass. if u keep saying dumb shit.. aka emotional things. im gonna have to put u in place.  \nthis will ramp up in time , imagine a few years in. he wont have a filer, jusst straight criticism.  \nthe validation ur getting will lower imo. the NRE, usually gets x10 validation.   \nif u like it here, keep things distant.  if u want to risk and check ur compatibility, for which i estimate a 7%, push him
2	My basically twin brother is an ENFP, and we don't get along at all, but I have a good friend who is also an ENFP, and she and I do get along quite well, so I might have some good insight into what you're dealing with.\n\n1. I think you're taking the wrong approach when it comes to his feelings and emotions. You're kind of trying to change him, and your rationale seems a little misguided. Do we ENTJs conceal our feelings and emotions? Yes - to some extent. But the bigger "problem" is that we don't really feel our feelings and emotions much at all in the first place. They're perpetually on our back-burner, so to speak. So, in a way, you're kind of asking him to reveal things to you that aren't really there. You might consider asking him what he *thinks* about things. You might find that hearing his thoughts about things gives you just as much reward as hearing how he feels about things - maybe even more reward. Moreover, although everyone is different, we ENTJs don't really play mind games - at all. After reading his message, it sounds to me like he's afraid to tell you something, not like he's playing a mind game.\n2. I don't like when feelers are irrational and *especially* when they have opinions that are irrational. And, no offense, but I feel like it would annoy me a lot if someone kept trying to get me to open up about my feelings. Side note: one reason I don't like opening up about my feelings is that it makes me feel effeminate and weak, and I feel a constant need to be strong. (I have bipolar disorder, too, so it's not easy.) Maybe your friend has something similar going on. Make of that what you will.\n3. As for his cryptic implications which are very hard to decipher, I can kind of relate to what he's saying because I struggle with violent thoughts that are most likely due largely to both my bipolar disorder and to ENTJs' natural inclination toward anger. I don't have a boyfriend at this moment, but I think I would struggle to tell him about these thoughts yet feel slightly morally obligated to tell him about them eventually, and I could definitely see myself talking to my future boyfriend in a way similar to the way he is talking to you in those texts. Now don't misunderstand me: I'm not saying your friend must be experiencing violent thoughts. That's not what I am saying. Rather, I'm saying it sounds like he might want to tell you about something but is afraid to...Who knows?...\n\nA big reason my ENFP brother and I don't get along is that he wishes I would show that I care about him by reciprocating his caring affection, which is extremely unnatural for me. He doesn't understand, though, that that's like my expecting him to show that he cares about me by reciprocating my inclination to get in confrontations for my loved ones, which is extremely unnatural for him. I don't expect him to get in confrontations for me in the same way I get in confrontations for him because I know that would be expecting too much from him. Maybe you should step back and reflect on your expectations of your friend.
2	ENFP (26 F) dating my ENTJ (30 M) for the last 5 years. My bf isn’t usually very candid about his feelings. Opening up about them didn’t happen until the last couple of years or so. It really has to do with several things: his maturity level, the value he ascribes to opening up about emotions, how willing he is to work for the relationship, and the kind of space you’ve cultivated for him to open up. \n\nI’ve found that the more logical I am with my emotions, the safer he feels to talk about his. Communicating the importance for more openness about feelings, and showing him how much I valued that also gave him more things to consider. Eventually, being able to bring everything together with humor and light-heartedness has helped greatly. \n\nI think ENTJ’s take much longer to develop emotionally, simply because it takes a back seat to their intellectual development. If you can show them the importance of cultivating that with you, it’ll be much easier for them to bring that aspect of themselves to the table. \n\nEdit: grammar
1	Are you dating native English speaker person? 
5	Any of you had/have a romantic relationship with a male ESTJ?	I was wondering if any of you had any experience dating a male ESTJ? How was your experience? Do you feel as if you two were very similar or TOO similar? How was it dating someone who also has dominant Te and inferior Fi? 
8	I dated a 22yo female ESTJ. She was abrasive, had zero emotional intelligence, and appeared quite arrogant.\n\nThere were many good qualities about her as well - reliability, sharp mind, ambition and great energy. However I just could not see us being together. Maybe later in life it would be more compatible.
5	imo i don’t wanna date someone similar to me, i wanna date someone who’s an opposite so we can help each other in things we lack skill at! 
3	we were really good at social events together. power couple energy. pretty boring at other times though. also kind of chauvinistic/old-fashioned about gender roles. didn't really understand irony/surreal humor. 
3	mmm true but entjs like a challenge plus i feel like u would have more to learn from in a relationship if the person is opposite to u. for example, infps create the perfect balance for me 
7	Dating: Ever feel like you want to sleep with them more even though they say no?	IDK if this is an ENTJ thing, but I'm a female and when I hear a male that doesn't like me/isn't attracted to me it makes me want to sleep with them even more to change their mind. It's like a conquering thing. For example, if a white guy online says he's not attracted to black women I sub consciously think I want to change them and prove that I'm the best at everything. I've never acted on this and I'm not trying to say this right in anyway. No means no, people.\n\nAnyone feel like this?   
21	No. 
16	Nope from me. If someone doesn’t like me, I probably like them even less. 
20	No, it's not ENTJ it's creepy fucker
9	Sis, nah you’re better than that.
8	It's not an ENTJ thing, it's an insecurity thing. You're letting other people's opinion challenge your self worth. As you age and build confidence, that will fall away.\n\nUse your T when it comes to love - I *really* wish I had done this when I was younger. Observe facts about the person and yourself and end relationships if you don't think it will work. Don't waste your fucking time trying to drag some idiot dude along with you through life. Don't waste your time changing yourself unsustainably. There are SO MANY PEOPLE to date and many of them are going to be incompatible with you.\n\nAnd it's not the Sahara out there - have you tried online dating? 
5	What. 
4	If someone isn’t into me, then I immediately forget about them and move on. There’s too many out there that are into me and I’m not into wasting time or wasting my emotional energy chasing someone.   \nWith that, I have had a lot of fun with seduction, but the seduced needs to want to be seduced. 
14	....ENTJs love challenges, but the trick is to pick the ones that matter. Why would you waste your time trying to fuck a racist? 
3	Ha no. Look into the Enneagram. Type 8. Subtype: (sx)
2	This sounds more like an insecurity thing than and ENTJ thing judging by the responses.\n\nAnd yes, I find actively feigning disinterest works on a certain subset of girls
2	It’s an ego thing for me, rejection elicits a “WHAT?” response. Yes, it does make me want them more, but it’s likely not them, just the thrill of “winning”.\n\nI don’t pursue outright because that’s weird and desperate, I just ramp up the sex factor and make sure I look on point when I know they’ll be around. Eventually they cave, then I reject because I’m a vindictive bitch (lol) \n\nIf they’re really REALLY hot, I’ll give them the time of their life and then peace out. Drives ‘em crazy and it amuses me. 
2	that's a tiny bit rapey
1	I don't believe that it's something that we want to be rebillious about, rather than sex it self being a field were ENTJ's strive in.
1	yup. love to challenge shit. but more so conceptually, not putting myself in there. my attraction doesnt grow.. it lowers  .   \nbut if they start being flexible > u see virtue , so u gain a big amount of attraction. so its always worth to challenge  
1	Im great. If someone doesn't like me they cannot identify greatness and therefore are not great. 
1	Desperate times require desperate measures. All is fair in love and war.
1	You're a woman...
0	Hell yeah. I want what I can’t have.
0	I'm pretty sure this is a commonly-cited behavior of women.
4	entjs how good are you at reading people?	entjs how good are you at reading people?emotions ect?
14	There are scientifically validated tests online that evaluate how well you can read people. I score really highly on the ones that ask you to read people's body language and really lowly on the ones that ask you to read people's eyes or facial expressions. I don't know what to make of that. I do know that I've been accused of being socially awkward a good number of times, which I've read is common for ENTJs who have underdeveloped Fi. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe some other ENTJs (and probably many INTJs too) can relate when I say that when I'm socializing with people, I often feel like I'm doing a lot of social calculating - I feel as though I'm taking a sort of timed math or physics test for which I have to figure out the correct reaction for everything the other person/people say or do. I'm sure that anyone who has ever taken a math test knows: if you make a fumble, it's often hard to recover the ball, so to speak.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've always been a little awkward, but it seemed to be its worst after I had been unemployed for longer than I had hoped. After that, I became less empathetic, more callous, and more awkward..........maybe that's the underdeveloped Fi talking....
6	Solid. I test high-ish when I take EQ tests. I can usually tell what a person is really thinking by reading their body language and listening to the tone of their voice when they say it. 
9	Dumb as a box of rocks
5	I'm pretty good, I think it gives me an edge of some sort lol
4	Very good, as long as I choose to pay attention to them...
8	I'm better at reading cats.
3	It's difficult. I get that *something* is wrong. But I don't know what and I don't know how to fix it. And I am in the middle of my story sooo...
2	It should be fairly high.
2	I'm pretty good at reading people and situations, and I can do it quite quickly but when it comes to things I've never come across or new to like job hunting/interviews I don't tend to do well and my chance of interview feels like one in every 40 jobs I apply to.\n\nBut with my ability to read people I can tell pretty quickly whether or not I should make friends with certain people and what they will be like
1	Everyone is ultimately motivated, by something they care about. What that is however, is always different for everyone. From this alone, you know everything you need to know about anyone before you even meet them. After you meet them however, it usually becomes pretty clear, most of the time, what those individual factors are for any given person. Sometimes it's great, sometimes it's something you don't relate to.\n\n\nWhat's really amazing, is when you meet someone you can't quite figure out completely, those people can be absolutely fun!
25	INTP here, just wanted to say a few things.	I have this idea of what ENTJ are. I could be 100% wrong, but I really think INTP are the closest thing to you.\n\nIt doesn't seem like it, mostly because we are shadows. Everything you externalize, we internalize and vice versa. You likely see us as lazy, but really I completely understand the "work mode never turns off" for intuitive ideas. ESTJ and ISTP don't get that as much.\n\nThe number of times in my life I have said "what's next" is really defining of me. From the outside it looks like I lay around all day doing jack shit, but inside my problem solving never stops. I get on a topic and analyze it ENDLESSLY. And when I'm done I immediately think about what's next. What's the next problem? What would next yield the most value? It's not me wanting a problem. It's that I NEED the problem. When I don't have a problem I'm solving I feel depressed quickly. Constantly lost and like I'm wasting my time. My problem becomes not having a problem. I analyze to find a problem to solve.\n\nI have ideas pinned in my head for future analysis. Mainly business structure, marketplace competition, and people. I'm in college now so don't need those yet, but I have a rough plan of when I'll start diving deep into those. I have a dream to make a small(and perhaps big if I see the extra influence being necessary) software consulting firm. \n\nI guess I'm just trying to get across that I get it, always being on the go. Constantly getting that feeling of "I'm wasting my time." But I also get becoming addicted to fast paced problem solving. It's happened to me a couple times and I have nerve damage in my arms and hands from video games to show for it. Mostly shooters and MOBAs.\n\nSome day society won't have any more problems and you have to find problem solving within the context of meaninglessness that still matters. I found that in competition. Somewhat for my team yes, but also with myself. Of course being far enough in the future to have no more problems means we can change ourselves too, but I don't think I'd want that, at least not my personality and experience of being. I'd change my body and maybe my vitality, but my personality and brain would stay.\n\nI've always wondered if you are too rough(too blunt) on the edges for us to be in a LTR. If you are I wish you weren't, and I wish we could be closer because I feel like we do get one another's plights even if it doesn't tend to show. A lot of us INTP are socially inept at first. It can be appalling to you, as though we slow you down, but we don't have to be that way. We can understand people by reading about them a lot more which many of us tend not to do sadly. Reading books like "How to get rich and influence people" don't happen as fast for us, we just need to process it all and it will make sense and we internalize into how we naturally interact with others. Hearing "do this" from some respected source doesn't fit with us, we have to know why we are doing it in order to believe in it.\n\nYou don't have to shut off work mode. It's not a matter of learning how to. You can't. But why would you? You love it. It's what makes you feel alive. Having a goal is being alive.\n\nI love your deadness inside. I relate to it so much for jokes. Not needing to hold something back is refreshing.\n\nHope to see you on the battlefield. Enlist us as your advisor.
13	This is why a worldwide, government-sponsored "INTP/ENTJ marriage program" should be a thing.
10	I tend to lurk here more than post, because usually it seems like the majority of people who post on here are mistyped which is frustrating to me. I can tell you know yourself well from your writing.\n\nI've studied Jungian typology the last eight years or so when I began recognizing flaws in MBTI, and I became hooked. Last year, I began venturing into the Enneagram. I find that Enneagram and Jungian typology are eastern-meets-western systems which complement each other incredibly well. Taking both these systems into account can answer a great many questions the other cannot on its own.\n\nI am fairly close friends with two INTPs; one since high school, and another I met a few years ago. I can talk endlessly with both of them, and the mutual appreciation is substantial to say the least. I appreciate their precision and (when they are healthy) their consideration of community effects over individualism. I think they appreciate my propensity to take action and my instincts; and my ability to rationalize those instincts in ways they readily understand (even if I cannot articulate them immediately). There is a lot of trust there.\n\nI say all that to encourage you to look into your Enneagram. My INTP friend I met more recently is a 5w4. This means his path to personal growth is my type: 8. If you are also a 5, from your ambitions you sound like a very healthy INTP who is walking well into your path of growth.\n\nMy friend and I are in the beginning stages of launching a startup because we recognize the valuable strengths and balance we bring to each other. the INTP/ENTJ pairing is indeed a special one. I can't speak to romance, but perhaps there too. I am hopelessly an ISFP fan myself. They're my jam. Have you dated any ESFJs?\n\nHope my $0.02 has been worth it to you. Godspeed in your studies. Sounds like you have a great future ahead of you!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: grammar
4	I live intps, I want to marry one and yes of course, appoint her as my ideas girl and advisor! I've loved my intps always! 
1	this thread is a mess. be more concise  .  \n1 profiles are subject to change / context.  \n2 most of our contexts swing between intp ideal and entj ideal > analysis and execution   \nstrive to develop both personas, become awar e of ur contexts ans ee whats ditting. keep growing
18	ENTJ and INTJ romantic relationship: yay or nay?	In your opinion, how would an ENTJ and INTJ relationship look like? What should both types look out for in order to secure their relationship? What are advantages and disadvantages of E vs I relationship? Real life examples highly appreciated! 
13	I have an ENTJ brother in law and he’s been married to an INTJ woman for like sixteen years. Apparently they got pregnant right out of college and decided to marry. The first seven or so years were very difficult but now they seem like really good friends. If I had to describe their dynamic, I’d say they’re like brothers (even though she is a woman, a feminine one at that...I mean, for an NT woman.) \n\nThe ENTJ fucks with her constantly and they tease each other in a way that bothered me when I first met them. I thought my brother in law was a bully to her, made fun of her, tried to bring her down.\n\nBut now I see that’s how they show affection toward each other. Whatever works for them I suppose.\n\nThey’re  incredibly intelligent, frugal, responsible, earthy, and fascinating af. The ENTJ stays at home homeschooling the kids and pursuing all kinds of hobbies and making investments and flipping houses and researching stuff.\n\nThe INTJ woman is the breadwinner, some kind of chemical engineer or something.\n\nThey have four daughters. The oldest is an INTJ who I believe is a certified genius. Next in line is a gorgeous ISFP who never takes her nose out of a book, pretends to listen to ear buds so she doesn’t have to talk to anyone, and spends her time hiding in various places on the the family’s farm, often on the pier or in the woods.\n\nThen they have an ESTP daughter who pretty much acts like a rough and tumble boy and a toddler who might be one of the cutest things I’ve ever seen. 
9	I had one.  It was rough.  We were both stubborn and analyze things in a similar way, so we had a hard time conceding to the other person when there was a disagreement.  The ENTJ in me (F) wanted to resolve it ASAP to move onto the next thing; the INTJ in him would rather go be alone (and be right in his own mind) than discuss it to a resolution.
8	Lots of sex, adventures, projects and mental trips. \n\nIt’s very much a power couple situation but none of that ‘uncomfortable’ growth and that’s where it falls short. 
5	Nay for me
3	They would probably work very well. One of my best friends from school is an INTJ. I'm pretty sure DaveSuperPowers on YouTube is together with an ENTJ, and he's an INTJ but I could be wrong.
3	I'm an ENTJ woman and have been married to an INTJ for 14 years. It works for us. It's definitely more of a cerebral relationship than I think most would be happy with, and not overly emotional or sentimental. We've had to learn to communicate directly with each other without being overly blunt, but actual conflict is rare. If an emotional need crops up, we verbalize, handle it, and move on. I have to be careful not to bulldoze, and that has been probably our biggest problem as a team. 
4	ENTJ male married almost 17 years to an INTJ female, here.\n\nA good friend summed it up for us a few years ago when she said: "I used to think you fought all the time and your marriage was in trouble. Now, I think that's your foreplay!"
2	the measure of functionality to me is how u handle ur worst conflicts : cheating, polianory needs, important toppics.  \nif a person > intj, main dangers are   \n1 not able to express themselves.. as they much rather draw conclusions directly and just gain control (autism)   \n2 not able to analyze the situation vs rationalizing their feelings
2	I wouldn't say my husband and I are emotionless.  Rather, we understand how the other has a tendency to pack emotions in a box to be dealt with kind of the way you throw a box in the attic. It may be opened soon, or maybe never at all. If we need to open that box, we're able to help each other really process it because we understand how the other processes those emotions.  \n\n But the conversations are exhilarating.  We're always pushing each other to grow and develop, and complement each other well in a partnership. The work is distributed evenly and logically, decisions are made rationally... I find it quite harmonious. 
2	Pros: Great conversations. You just \*get\* each other. Intellectual intensity. Very little emotional conflict or confusion.\n\nCons: You both have a strong sense of self-interest, and are results driven. So it can only be great as long as you are both moving the same direction. 
3	ENTJ male and INTJ female might work better. INTJ males would likely not like being bossed around or out-earned by a significant factor.\n\nThat said, people are not merely 16 buckets. There is a lot of variability. It could work just fine.\n
0	Boo\n\nOnly for emotionless people.
8	The struggle of teamwork (what a pain!)	Both in Uni and at work I have dealt with a good bunch of team projects, usually witg around 5-10 people. Recently a bunch of new methods have been introduced that have made the whole ordeal less efficient, , such as reflective and teambuilding meetings. Thats one aspect that has been painful for me.\n\nAnother one is conpromises. Let's say I have an idea that would bring the project to great success. I tell the team in a respectful manner as I know that ENTJ can quickly become villains. However, they reject the idea and vote for something I perceive as mediocre, as everyone wants to go the way of least resistence and not opt for the more visionary aoproach. I am now expected to put my drive into completing the mediocre as best as I can and be credited for the ok result, knowing that it could have been great.\n\nWhat do you think about these typical situations? I feel like Entrepreurship is thr only way to truly be in charge and use your potential, not being slowed down by corporate rules.
3	I listen take unwritten charge of the team and listen to people's inputs then make a compromise... I'm very commanding to people don't usually disagree with me and they let me take charge usually... If not I let them fuck it up on their own and when they do I give my idea and we do it and complete it... Takes long the second way to I make sure I assert dominance quickly. 
3	Please watch! 9m 42s [Does anyone really like teamwork? Gavin McInnes at TEDxBrooklyn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fUhMIzvpQk)\n\nSchool will end. Just minimize the damage. Here is an idea: start working for yourself our a start-up right after you graduate.\n\nWhat do you do for work and what are you studying?\n
2	Don't take for granted that your approach is better than the others. Regression to the mean is a real thing.
1	grow softskills if u want to grow ur vision. softskills is not about manipulation, its more about understanding all variables, covering ur blindspots..
4	Entj and infj	What has been your experience ? 
13	The INFJ I knew was extremely good at reading people. I learned quite a bit from her. Eventually she became paranoid that I was monitoring her activities, even though I have never monitored anyone. Looking back, I think I was quite rude in telling her I could never possibly be interested in monitoring her. She has never contacted me since. She gave me a very funny mug for Christmas, though. It's still sitting in the cupboard but it's too big for any normal use.
9	I usually get along well with both INFJs and INTJs. One of the kindest women I knew was an INFJ, who sadly passed away. \n\nI do find INFJs can take offense to things you had no intention of offending them about, so that would be the drawback of the friendship/relationship. Overall, I appreciate that INFJs can tell it like it is, but with a softer approach. 
4	One of my best friends is an INFJ. I treasure her tremendously because I find it so rare to find a genuine human being who is sincere about being good and kindness into the world. On some levels, I also feel that she understands me more than I understand myself - and she plays a big part in checking my own hubris, arrogance and abrasiveness.\n\nThe biggest flaw to this relationship however is that the INFJ is more sensitive than most, and in some of our unthinking moments - it is highly likely that we may offend them unknowingly. Following that comes a period of passive-aggressiveness, which, in spite of our own propensity to confront issues directly, will result in prolonged awkwardness because they dislike outright confrontation.\n\nOverall I think that this is a fantastic pairing of friends - but might be a recipe for disaster in terms of relationships because of the two type's attitudes towards confrontation.
3	I like them and we get along great until they get offended by me. (females)\n\nGet along swimmingly with INFJ males. 
2	My best friends are infj, I love them
2	My wife is an infj :-)
2	Can be cerebral narcissists in their own psuedo-enlightened way, Can be too agreeing. Smart people, but at times not as understanding as they think they are. They ignore the shit out of Fi in my experience so they can overly rely on Fe in a very unhealthy way where it just becomes insultingly door matty. I wish the could be simple at times? 
1	My sister is an INFJ, easily the most trusted person in my life, the only problem is she gets offended very easily and tends to avoid conflict too much even if it starts being on her own expense, very caring and nurturing but also very messy and tends to explode emotionally at times (not sure if the last one is an INFJ trait so please correct me if I'm wrong).\n\nEdit:I'm an ENXJ and tend to jump between both rather than be in the middle so I hope my insight is better than nothing.
1	not a typical infj, dont want to get in the theory of temporary profiles , especially infjs.  \nbut > hypersensitive , patternforming , low selfesteem > selfconscious > low empathy.  \npretty much a spiral as those patterns keep forming and most of them are wrong
-2	What is even the purpose of asking this?
16	What about us ENTJ's allow us to be very perceptive of people?	For example, we are very well able to read someone authenticity level and see right past phoniness. Why is that?
11	Seasoned ENTJ here and this strength has won me many enemies in business/corporate worlds. Something to watch for if you’re trying to climb ladders, but all in all a nice trait to have. I’ve found that the fake people who are attempting to claw their way through work/life by any means necessary, get identified by me quickly and I refuse to play their games. Sometimes they are successful with others, putting them in higher positions of power - but when we connect to chat one on one - they are clear without me even saying anything that I am onto them. Sometimes it earns their respect, many times they find ways to work around or attempt to remove their ENTJ ‘problem’. The best part is that we get to sleep peacefully at night. They don’t.
8	Positions that aren't founded on objectively verifiable evidence and fail to evince coherent logical understanding are basically impossible for the ENTJ not to engage with—when bullshit is on the horizon, we *tilt and ride*.\n\nWe'll pretty quickly determine if the speaker can back up their promises, and if they don't measure up, we place them in the category of fools.\n\nOnce you determine not to deal with fools, it doesn't matter what the specific foolishness is, just spotting the fools.
7	Extraverted Thinking paired with Introverted Intuition. Mature ENTJs are better than less mature entjs at being perceptive because they’re better at using their Ni  instead of looping with their Se 
12	NTJs are sensitive to false positives (for example hiring an idiot) but probably aren't that concerned with false negatives (aka not hiring a genius).\n\nSo it is not that NTJs are super-perceptive; it's that when you pay a lot of attention to one thing (sniffing/rooting out for incompetence), you tend to become good at it.\n\nWe are quick to write off a genius (and I mean much smarter than the NTJ) passive un-athletic awkward non-confident nerdy iNTP as an idiot unless said INTP cares enough to exert energy toward proving that your first impression was wrong.\n
4	Im not so good at it, so I’m curious how you do it as well
4	Introverted intuition (Ni) and Extraverted thinking (Te) as mentioned before. But I would also add our Extraverted sensing (Se) in there as well. Let’s put it this way, ENTJ’s are about willpower, not necessarily about discipline. We use confidence, mastery of talent, or general persuasion to get what we want, and we expect others to have some level of that confidence and persuasion within them. If they don’t, they are seen as weak or not serious about what they want. \n\nWe will give them one more chance by seeing what they hold value in or to whom (hopefully us) they are loyal. That second chance our brain gives stems from our (Se). It allows us to keep the information we have accrued with our Te (visual observations and accrual of short term memory) in the person (physically; as if they were a vessel or physical trigger of all that information) and then use our Ni to make sense of it all. \n\nMature ENTJ’s as was said before can do this fairly quickly and get really good at it once they’ve had many vessels “created” by our (Se) to find a pattern for the next one. We have our judgments for most people based on criteria in our collection of those vessels and our mind is impeccable about keeping them separated while also being available for recall. The ENTJ willpower resurfaces in actually continuing to keep those vessels there to help us to “figure out” or “perceive” or observe/analyze others. \n\nThe problem as u/nutconspiracynut had said, is that we can often be really good at finding the truth of one or the other: a positive or negative trait, but not both at the same time. First impressions impact our ability to do both at the same time and influences the difficulty in doing them in succession. A great book to try and strengthen your perceptive powers would be “Thinking Fast and Slow” to gauge the systems at play beyond your MBTI and then learn to check yourself. \n\nSo in short, yes, our introverted intuition is always analyzing others from whatever data our extraverted thinking has gathered. Our extraverted sensing takes into account the persons actions, words, and demeanor to provide new data from which our (Ni) makes a conclusion. It is this rapid (and for some mature ENTJ’s almost instantaneous) process that allows us to perceive others in a light that gets to the heart of who these people are. We just need to be cautious and remember:    people don’t always show their true selves, so checking our processes’ work (like in math) is always something you should be going back to before you’ve made a conclusive call about another person.
5	I would say well developed Ni.  Introverted intuition is basically pattern recognition on a subconscious level.  The more you experience different things the more patterns you start to recognize, and the more gut feelings you get that something is off.\n\nMy girlfriend as an INTJ so Ni is her dominant function while Te secondary, and while we ENTJs use our Ni to direct our Te and look for things in our external environment to support our gut feelings, she is able to almost predict the future with no tangible proof what so ever, it really is amazing.\n\nOne of the best ways to develop Ni I have found is to start trusting your gut a bit more when the Te can't always prove that what we have intuited is correct.
2	i look for authenticity in people, and their ability to articulate and communicate their own thoughts/ opinions to me. if i feel they are too invested into adhering to social norms, or agree with everything i say, i quickly write them off as in-genuine or underdeveloped in the sense i will not be able to have a stimulating conversation with them (where we both learn something from each other)  and will likely not pursue a close relationship or friendship with them  
2	Inferior functions have more ability than people give them credit for. Js. 
1	It’s the NT probably 
1	I'm very much like this. Sometimes you have to play the game to get to the top.
1	There's a part of the brain linked to audition that is used to perceive people's authenticity in their voice. Though we're not the only type who strongly uses this part, you have to add to that our introverted intuition which is the intuition of time or how things lead to another. We also make judgements extremely fast, you could follow two conversations at a time for example because ENTJs are able to follow people's thought sequencing as well as their point. You can follow people's sequencing because their thinking would look like yours as they've come to perfect it. Well if the topic is known that is. Anyways when you can get so privately deep into people's head it's easy to spot the flaws. 
5	I have very little respect for anyone. Especially the average Joe. How could I change this?	I don't even know if it is incorrect for me to think most people don't deserve respect, but let's assume they deserve respect how would I change my mind or emotions?
11	One day, you'll care for someone and they'll shatter your world and you'll suddenly remember all the things that you may have done that made others feel that way. That's the worst case situation. Appreciate people for what they bring to the table, it may not be what you are looking for or focused on, that doesn't invalidate their experiences and their value in life as an individual.
5	> I don't even know if it is incorrect for me to think most people don't deserve respect.\n\nI don't think it is incorrect either. The end.\n
5	I have a basic level of respect for living things as I love every living thing... But people don't deserve respect, that shit is earned! 
5	First, determine who you respect now, and the reason why you respect them. Now you have got what it is you really respect. Now change that item to something else, and you will respect a different set of people.
2	What do you think of when you say respect? If it is a strong, admiration-like respect where you look up to the person in question it would definitely make sense that you don't see a lot of people that way. I sure don't, I'd need to know the person before I can think that highly of them. And I don't think *everyone* deserves that kind of admiration-respect anyhow.\n\nFor me to say I respect the average Joe (in the sense that you seem to imply here) means that I aknowledge that there are many many different things people consider desirable and worth having and not all of them are ever going to make sense to me. And yet these different values exist and continue to guide people in what they do, therefore they have power, and power - whilst different from the power that drives me and perhaps you - is still power. If this makes no sense to you no worries, it isn't the main point. That's in the following paragraph:\n\nI should probably mention that someone deserving respect and respect being something that has to be earned are somewhat foreign to me as concepts. To put it more plainly for me there are two types of respect, this basic one that I cover here (and assumed your question was about. Sorry if not, that would make my entire post rather pointless) and then the more intense admiration type that perhaps has similar aspects to what you've very briefly described. Anyhow back to where I was: things that have little value to me can have great value to others even if I don't see why or how. Accepting and admitting that value is what basic respect means to me and to me it reflects my own abilities of understanding and not the value of others. I don't need to agree with everyone, only accept that my view on the matter is not the ultimate truth and act accordingly. Something like that.

1	The average Joe is only average for a second. Then you get to know them and suddenly they’re the only one you love. ENTJks can be haughty, but that is ridiculous mate. Some people don’t deserve respect (duh) but the average Joe keeps the world running. For me respect is earned, but is don’t disrespect people I don’t know.
1	If average joe is behaving like average joe instead of above average joe, should u be treating him like above average joe? \n\nThe answer is obvious: No.
7	Who is your confidant?	Is it easy for you to trust people?
13	I have a few female friends who I confide in... I don't trust them even. I don't trust anyone. 
5	I trust people by levels. Think of it like circles, the largest circle being the largest group of people that I trust the least and the smallest circle in the center being the least amount of people that I trust the most. \n\nFirst circle: \n\nI have a fairly large outer circle of acquaintances and people I might consider friends in the future that get to hear about day to day stuff that I don’t mind everyone in the world knowing about. This is the group where I’ll deal with social niceties like small talk and so on because I don’t interact with this circle as often as I do with the others. \n\nSecond circle:\n\nThen I have a layer of friends that I like to go out and do fun things with a bit more often than the first circle, I’ll tell them bits and pieces about say, what’s popping at work and what I’m generally up to and so on. Light stuff, nothing too deep. They’re friends but not particularly close ones. I trust them to not be backstabbing assholes/bitches as a general rule but that’s about as far as it goes. \n\nThird circle:\n\nFriends that I share my more personal interests and passions with, and share my ideas and plans with. These people are “on my level” so to speak. I’ve known most of these people for years, and if I haven’t they’re people that I instantly hit it off with for whatever reasons. We talk often and we definitely have a lot of mutual trust, though even then there’s a lot I don’t share with these people. \n\nFourth circle:\n\nLong time friends and family members that I don’t hate (my mother and my sister for example), people I’ve known for a decade or more. This circle is the smallest, and these people are my true confidants and the people I trust with almost everything. \n\nFifth circle:\n\nMe, myself, and I. Why? Some matters in this life are things I only trust myself with, and I wouldn’t have it any other way. :) 
2	Easy to trust people, but do think I have a good bullshit detector.\n\nI don't confide in many people, as the people I would are people I respect and don't want to waste their time with problems. \n\nI find it generally easier to talk about personal stuff with women though. I have a few good guy friends, but generally don't get along well with groups of guys / people that are just acquaintances. 
2	I have never trusted anyone completely throughout my life. I specially don’t trust family from personal experience. \n\nHowever, I think that I can genuinely say that the only person that I can potentially trust in my life is my significant other. Until he pisses me off, then I’ll just get rid of him ;) (insert diabolical laughter)
2	My sister is my closest confidant. But, even then, I don’t tell her everything. Other than that, I trust people to be people, who are untrustworthy, so....    \nI have an amazing bullshit detector and I can read people like a book. 
2	My therapist—mostly about all my trust issues.
2	[I drop hints about the things I've done on the internet.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOVQPtuKRs4)
1	Haha, no.  
1	My INFJ friend. We've been through a lot together and she knows where the bodies are buried.  
1	I have a small support group on FB of friends that I’ve made from other MBTI groups. I don’t tell them everything, obviously. However, it’s healthy for me to be able to be supportive for them and to be able to at least feel as though I could share my problems with someone if I ... could. 
1	My journal. I hope to never lose it.
1	Yes I trust very easily. \n\nWhat’s the issue.
1	I trust myself and some close family to an extent. I don’t confide in anyone but myself (via recordings) and proceed from there. It’s all internal anyways 
1	I can’t pass off complete trust. There is always a shadow for doubt, but I can get close. I can fake it. My group is my family and 4 choice girlfriends 
1	Nobody. =(
1	ENFP bff.
9	What would your life be like, if you could get EVERY business associate you deal with on the phone EVERY time you dial them?	
7	A breeze? Hahah
4	I would had been millionaire 5 years ago. In the top optimistic case.
2	My business would be BOOMING!
1	Is this an big issue? I used to run call centres last decade and was curious how difficult it is to get through to prospects in the smartphone era. I almost never pick up my phone to a number that isn't in my phone's address book
0	Too vague of a question. What kind of business associates?\n\nThese people would have to drop everything they are doing at a moments notice, flash their mental stack and get out of the zone if they were in it. They would have to live their lives as if you can call them at any moment, be they at their grandmothers funeral or having passionate sex on a remote beach or trying to get away from a California fire in a car they stole from their neighbor or changing a diaper or dealing with their child's flu or ...\n\nNo matter what, some ENTJ is a lot more important than everything else they are doing.\n\nWhy would not an email, a text message, a Slack or a Skype message suffice? Why should people live on call 24/7/365?\n\nWhy do you always prefer to discuss things via voice? You get no transcript after the fact and 6 months later nobody remembers who said what and to whom.\n\nTo answer your actual question:\n\nI would go on a major power trip and would troll my associates into eventually committing suicides. Don't give me that kind of power.\n
3	Does anyone else piss into the shower tub instead of the toilet right before job interviews and important events?	I am a perfectionist and if I piss and I miss, I have to clean it up or the rest of my day will go sideways. I am super busy and sometimes I have no time to waste. There are some meetings you just can't be late to regardless of the weather, traffic or earthquake situation.\n\nSince I never miss the shower tub, it is my go-to tactics if I absolutely have to hit my target. Bonus points - I can do it completely hands-free so that I can spend the valuable time talking business, reading about the stock market, getting an Uber ride, etc. I also save the valuable time washing my hands.\n\nIs this an ENTJ trait? Does anyone else?\n
12	Why not do all of your business while in the shower, and just waffle stomp it down the drain? Such efficient.
7	Lol
5	Wtf
5	Time your poops and pees so you can do both at the same time and catch up on the stock market. Personally, I think it’s disgusting to pee in your shower but that’s just my preference.

2	How can I learn to trust people	I have noticed that I am always looking for signs in people that they are untrustworthy. How can I stop this and give them the benefit of the doubt.  I can’t trust my business partners as I always think they might screw me and I can’t trust my girlfriend which will effect our relationship. \n\nI realised this isn’t only me but mostly young ENTJ’s. Anyone cracked it? \n\nFor reference see this video from 11:20 onwards \nhttps://youtu.be/WracDPYfTww\n\n
6	This guy in that video is really great about describing the functions and how they interchange with one another, but he gets a little too carried away in his explanation in this video because he’s obviously been impacted by a relationship he had with an ENTJ. He is a ENTP himself, so he’ll talk at length and get distracted, but you won’t hold it against him unless you’re looking for something incredibly specific about the type.\n\nTo answer OP, I think the whole getting screwed over is a process of human interaction and emotional stubbornness. Whether or not those interplay with ENTJ’s extraverted functions, I can’t say much about because I’m certain it’s happening unconsciously for me. The real question should be: what in the past of the catalogue of experiences we have accumulated lead toward the treatment being experienced now? Have I been pigeonholed into being an enemy to or for this person? Have I been marginalized and labeled the so-so girl/guy? And then try to defeat that by turning it over or disproving it. 
4	The funny thing about this post is that every time I get close to an ENTJ  I start to feel like he shouldn’t be trusted and often that fear ends up being well founded.\n\nI’m not sure if it’s because we share the same functions and I see right through the bullshit, or if my own suspicions end up making the ENTJ suspicious of me as well. 🤷🏼‍♀️
2	you will never able to trust people unless you have the ability to get into their mind.\n\nthe difference is how it affects your decisions. If you really want to get over your insecurity, the only way is to give the other person the ability to make the decision, give it 100%.\n\nSo sit down.\n\nBut you'll never do it, right? To do it you'll have to access your Si, do nothing and just watch how it goes (Ne).
1	Same!\n\nThis quality has worked great for me at work, school, all activities until... relationships. After many painful breakups I realized I keep thinking the girl I am with has ill intentions. That just doesn't work!\n\nI'm seeing a cognitive therapist now and it has gotten better. I am still super vigilant, but I try to put 2-3 people in the full-trustworthy list (best friends, relationship).\n\nMy current best friend, an ENFP girl, has helped a lot. I feel as if she is the one helping me learn what is true trust. Step by step.\n\nFor everyone else I'm still looking out for hidden motives, testing them and observing.\n\nEDIT:\nTo answer your question: choose 1-2 people you are really close with (gf, friends, sibling etc), tell them this and then work together. I personally also see a therapist, but that's optional. A close friend is enough.
1	Throw them under a microscope for a year, observe them, test them, see how they act toward the people they do not need anything from. Only then let them in.
0	Entj in competitions	What are you best at in competitions? What competition subjects do you think intuition excels in? I'm talking hobbies here, obviously corporate climbing is a cake walk. Do you think you compete with sensors in athletics or do you think you are motivated to compete, but can't meet their level of athleticism? Do you do better in board games/computer games?

4	Seeing ENTJ traits in lifetime behavior	I am an ENTJ. I have received this result on every test I've taken. My results are also usually 96-98% Feeling, which I find interesting, but identify with.\n\nI was wondering if anyone else noticed any particular traits or actions throughout their life that correspond with those that are common in ENTJs. I have excelled in school (although I've heard many ENTJs do not perform well in high school). I am graduating high school this year with a 5.1 GPA, and all of my classes are dual credit college classes. I received a 108.9% average in a college psychology class, despite taking the majority of the exams stoned. I am pursuing a master's degree in computer science. \n\nI find myself naturally taking place in leadership positions in nearly every area and social situation that I am in, whether it is leading a team in a software dev project, or my position in management. I exhibit all of the ENTJ characteristics I have read, such as being blunt, coming across as emotionless and heartless, lack of empathy, thorough planning, ambitious, confrontational, etc.\n\nDAE notice any similar traits? 
8	Yes.\n\nAnd if you can develop humility, compassion and empathy you will be a category killer. 
7	My GPA was 6.9
11	Office Politics	Just got fired for the first time due to a micromanaging recently promoted ESTJ manager. I know bc I made him take the test.\n\nReasons why it may have been personal:\n\n1.	Had better sales than him when we were in the same position but due to me being young and a student, I couldn’t get the project manager promotion.\n2.	Me and my former manager were close and my ideas really helped upper management. \n3.	Would always try to correct every little thing I did, would throw a fit if I pointed out something he could do to make things run more efficiently. \n4.	ex-Military and would always bark orders. Any attempts to offer more possibilities or asking of whys would be met with anger and power tripping.\n5.	I got fired a day after we had a disagreement. \n\nAny how, I just got a taste of the real world and wanted to know how you guys handle office politics. I know he cozied up real quick with the owners do lesson #1 I guess. \n\nI’ve been reading a lot about how ENTJs just don’t get along with ESTJ managers/bosses so information about that would be helpful too. 
11	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit,_Voice,_and_Loyalty\n\nCongratulations, you get to experience exit. You did not choose it and do not know yet what comes next but it will be better. So yeah congrats.\n\nJocko Willnik, an ENTJ owns an MMA gym. He could have gone to someone else's gym but he built/bought his own so that everything in it would be exactly the way he wanted it.\n\nHe also does say "Play the game". You can look it up. If you want to get along with ex-military, you better play the game.\n\nBut what's in it for you?\n\nWhen you "own the gym", it is so much better. Things will be for the most part exactly as you want the to be and you will not have to share the profit with so many other people.\n\nMost people are incompetent or barely competent. If large companies can afford to do stupid and counterproductive things all the time. Imagine how much more profitable you would be if you did not have to drag all that weight.\n\nLook up https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Perot It is relevant.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Perot#Business\n\nAfter he left the Navy in 1957, Perot became a salesman for IBM. He quickly became a top employee (one year, he fulfilled his annual sales quota in a mere two weeks)[10] and tried to pitch his ideas to supervisors, who largely ignored him.[11] He left IBM in 1962 to found Electronic Data Systems (EDS) in Dallas, Texas, and courted large corporations for his data processing services. Perot was refused 77 times before he was given his first contract. EDS received lucrative contracts from the U.S. government in the 1960s, computerizing Medicare records. EDS went public in 1968 and the stock price rose from $16 a share to $160 within days. Fortune called Perot the "fastest, richest Texan" in a 1968 cover story.[12] In 1984 General Motors bought controlling interest in EDS for $2.4 billion.\n\nDid you catch that? He filled annual sales quota in two weeks and yet his supervisors ignored his ideas. EDM was founded in 1962 and was bought for 2.4 billion USD in 1984 - 22 years later.\n\nExit is awesome. It's an opportunity.\n\nLeave the no talent ass clowns behind. You can be rich and happy.\n\nJust don't forget to have kids. Your genes need to out-reproduce the NTACs.\n
3	I've experienced enough office politics to leave me nauseous for the rest of my life. My refusal to play the game, buddy up to the right people, and kiss the right asses got me passed by for 3 promotions/transfers with the company I worked for at the time. I had the lowest error rate and one of the highest efficiency rates in the division too.\n\nEventually I quit, after voicing complaints regarding the incompetent and unqualified people who were getting management positions within my division. I'll just say there was a direct correlation between how much time you spent in a certain assistant director's office shooting the breeze and your chances of being promoted/getting a raise.\n\nI found out several months after quitting that she was arrested for running a meth lab ring in town and was convicted by the state, awaiting conviction by the Fed. I felt very good about my decision to leave when I did. Do I regret not playing the game? No. But I do see that I could have done certain things differently that might have impacted me in positive ways.\n\nMy piece of advice to you is this: don't let the Myers-Briggs system determine how your relationships with anyone play out. Use it to try to understand others better, and understand yourself better. But never be deterministic about your chances with someone (i.e., "well, they are ESTJ - I guess I'll never get along with them"). If you know your type and theirs, that actually gives you a leg up to improve your relationship with anyone from family to co-workers.\n\nMy youngest brother and I never got along as kids. We hated each other. After each taking the test, we learned that our type-relationship was described by one site as "anathema." Ever since then we understand each other and get along great. Neither of us has changed, but we don't let something as trivial as a personality type get between our relationship. We learned to work around our strengths and weaknesses.\n\nIt may be a one-sided effort on your part, but if you can learn to use this system as a tool to improve your relationships, you'll find yourself becoming very effective in all aspects of life.
2	Looks like you went head to head with another tank.\n\n#1 You should’ve acknowledged your new boss’s goals.\n\n#2 Allow your new boss to save face by asking questions with him in private instead of chest to chest to make a scene like some chimpanze.
1	Office politics is a skill.  You've just had your first lesson.  It's a great opportunity to learn.  Chalking it up to power tripping or it being personal is not helpful for that process.\n\nConsider this: Why would upper management allow you to be fired for petty reasons?  They made a value judgment and your side of the equation came up short.  That doesn't necessarily mean that you are lacking.  I think it is more likely that the ESTJ is bringing more to the table than you are allowing yourself to see.
17	ENTJs having bad rap for always ‘having beef/falling out’ with people?	ENTJ female in mid 20s here.. and I’m just wondering if anyone else has the same experience of seeming to always be in some kind of confrontation with someone? \n\nI’ve always been an extremely loyal person, but I also don’t take any kind of bull shit or mind games where I have to guess ‘what I did wrong’ with a friend instead of having them tell me upfront. \n\nBut somehow, it always seems that I find myself in uncomfortable situations where these people end up being so awful to a degree that I eventually had no choice but to cut them out of my life because I didn’t want to play that ‘what did I do wrong/ pls stop ignoring me’ game.\n\nI don’t ever try to seek out drama, I never talk shit about these people behind their backs and I go out of my way to always encourage them, help them with whatever they need (and you KNOW ENTJs can get shit done when needed) and yet SOMEHOW I still always end up offending someone who decides that their response should be to start playing weird/ghosting me.\n\nI even introduce these people always to my existing friend circle, try to include them and make them feel welcome (both times they were people new to the city) but again somehow our friendship ends sour, and they even try to keep my closest friends (which obviously my closest friends always ultimately take my side), but it’s still just so frustrating and upsetting! \n\nSo many people think that ENTJs don’t have feelings because we are more blunt and we don’t mind the truth even if it hurts, but we DEFINITELY value our friendships and it’s so sooooo annoying that people use that trait of yours to make you feel like you’re just confrontational / not nice etc. \n\nArghh.  A very sad ENTJ who just had to cut a friend off. \n
12	ENTJ here, got about a decade on you, still happens to me... but less frequently.\n\nI find nowadays I can quickly determine if "this" person is going to be a good friend.\n\nFirst red flag I politely confront them and explain my position.\n\nI check myself before the conversation to ensure what I'm about to say and do isn't "aggressive" but rather to the point.\n\nIf they take the opportunity to turn it into an argument or get upset, that is strike two and I basically end the conversation in the nicest way possible. Explain to them I was only seeking answers and my intention isn't to argue or hurt feelings.\n\nThen I don't talk to them anymore.\n\nIf I see them in a social circle, or out mingling with my friends, I am nice with them but I don't initiate any conversation. If they ask me a question, I will answer it, in as few words as possible.\n\nIf they ask me a question and I know it is going to upset them, I answer as directly and forthcoming as possible, knowing that it may upset them.\n\nI don't stop being me because they aren't able to accept differences in people, even if our personalities clashed, causing us to part ways. Getting upset is a personal choice and if they personally decide to do so, that is on them.\n\n**Be selfish about who you are.**\n\nedit: grammar
5	Yes sorry, I cut off people really quickly and easily, the quality of the people you surround yourself with is directly correlated against the quality of your life. 
6	what I’ve noticed:\n\nENTJ conflicts with strong Fe users for being perceived as rude, abrupt, bossy, or unforgiving.\n\nENTJ conflicts with Si because ENTJ only abides by rules and acknowledges the status quo when it is advantageous for the ENTJ to do so...but ENTJ can just as quickly cut corners or discard rules he deems irrelevant to his goals...which Si naturally finds offputting af\n\nENTJ conflicts with people in the workplace because ENTJ is ambitious and effective. Poses a threat to insecure coworkers.\n\nENTJ has conflict with strong Fi user because ENTJ appears dismissive, inattentive, negligent, or - in some cases - does something that goes against the “internal value system” of the Fi user and refuses to acknowledge guilt or actively do anything to fix the problem. (<—- I’ve only seen this happen when there’s been an attempt by the two parties to move toward a closer and more intimate relationship. Otherwise the Fi user isn’t affected enough by the ENTJ’s decisions to have a strong opinion one way or the other.)\n\nAll this is purely anecdotal and might be bullshit but I hope it helps.\n
3	I completely understand this. When I was in my early 20s it was a problem.  I remember my best friend at the time liked the same girl that I did.  I asked him if they were anything more than friends and made clear my desire to pursue her, he didn't have a problem with it (or rather, he didn't say he did) and then later on he started ghosting me and being extremely passive aggressive once her and I got together.  He even just outright cut me off without even confronting me about it after him and I had been joined at the hip for years.  What can I say other than yeah, it fucking sucks, and I feel your pain?\n\nNow that I am in my 30s I can usually determine whether or not I am compatible with someone after a few interactions with them. I usually show my confrontational and outspoken nature to people right away and see how they respond to it.  Usually people either back down and feign agreement with whatever I'm saying even when I can tell by their body language they don't, or they get emotional and react to something I say as if it's controversial or taboo.  The ones who are able to retort or to carry on the discussion in an objective manner are the ones who get my attention and potentially turn out to be my friends.\n\nJust to clarify as well, feelers are most definitely capable of doing the latter.  One of my best mates is a feeler and even though he does sometimes get a bit too soppy on me he is perfectly understanding of the blunt nature of thinker types.  The biggest benefit of MBTI in my opinion other than better understanding of one's self is to better understand and cooperate with others.  We all just need to communicate a bit better.
3	Fellow ENTJ female here. I have found this to happen a bit too often when it comes to female (mostly) friendships, sadly. I don’t do the chasing around game or actively trying to have someone forgive me for something I didn’t do or makes no sense. \n\nCutting people out of my life has come much easier with time. At first I thought it was me and that I should be more forgiving towards others. Nowadays if they have an issue of not being emotionally intelligent I just won’t bother and go my way. People who feed on drama and are surrounded by it are not who I want to associate with.  \n\nThe few close friends I have I would not trade for anything and I am as loyal as can be. Always think quality over quantity when it comes to these. 
2	I’ve personally been told you are good at understanding why others behave the way they do, but can come off unaware of how I come off to people. 
1	I feel like my interpersonal skills are behind the other personality types. For some clicking, feeling and connecting is more natural.
1	Very relatable although seems to happen less as with age I've moved on from aiming to control the group dynamic in my social circle (work and such provides enough of that). People (even friends on occasion) will try and portray you as agressive or unfriendly and it is honestly infuriating, but at the end of the day it isn't you and your actions are a response to people's behaviour. The easiest way often, isntead of having a confronation with them is just to distane yourself from people who play these games, exhibit such behaviour. Unless you think they are toxic to the group (in which case you can show that to others quite easily, afterall you knwo them well and there is loyalty there) they are usually fine being kept around just at a distance, offering some benefits as non-close friends, without you having to deal with unnecesary drama. \n\nNowadays there are people in some of my friend groups who I really don't care much about or interract with closely while some of the friends like them, so no harm there. You are a good friend to those you care for, and deserve the same treatment in return so stay close with the friends you have, and occasioanlly people will come around who will enter that circle naturally (often as a plesant surprise to you). Good luck!
1	Maybe your personality was too strong for these people and they were afraid to discuss openly Bc they don’t like confrontation.\n\nYour story reminded me once of befriending a guy that had just moved to town and he was so overwhelming that I just couldn’t breathe. 
1	I thought I was reading about myself- seriously. You’re definitely not alone. I’ve come to learn, especially being    In my 20s, I want friends who will last my lifetime. I might have been remorseful aft first when cutting certain people out, but after processing it, I realized it was a weight of stress off my shoulders. It gave me more time for me to spend with the people who matter most and who exemplify as much loyalty to me as I give to them. 
1	I've accepted that I'm always going to be lonely person since no way in hell am I going to tolerate other people's nonsense in a 'friendship'. So really, a few friends is already a record. Sure there's not many of them, but everyone one of them gets me. I would hate to have more friends if it means there's a percentage of them that upset me. 
1	That’s really interesting, I didn’t think about it that way! I think my friend was an ISFJ :/
1	I thought this was mainly a female thing but I guess not! (Which is also good to know)\n\nMy best friends are definitely more feelers and they have taught me so much about how to talk about feelings. Talk to others about their feelings, and they have always been very honest with me about how I made them feel if I accidentally said something very insensitive etc (I guess because they understand that I never mean it in that way!!!) and so I’m definitely super thankful for them! Those who love you for who you are and also aren’t afraid to tell you when you may have upset others unintentionally are keepers for life!
1	Not ENTJ, but I've observed this happen to your kind and it's the freakiest thing I've seen. I've seen an otherwise normal person, type unknown, despise an ENTJ, former friend, solely for not returning a greeting once.\nOverall, my take is due to two things: ENTJs are usually looked up to, to whatever degree, and people get more sensitive to your actions and reactions. Second, you guys have a thing of being unaware of your emotional reactions. Most of the times ENTJs think they don't have them, but they do and everyone else picks it up. ENTJs then act like everybody else is taking crazy pills. 
1	Hahahahah that’s probably a very accurate observation!
1	Maybe you attract the phenomenon known as “frenemies”? Near as I can tell, it’s like Game of Thrones court intrigue. I can’t relate to the mindset, but I’ve observed it before. If that’s the case, I can see your approach would throw them off, as they operate covertly.\n\n
1	something pearls something pigs\n\n90% of humans are meh
29	I am an extrovert who wants to be left alone - mostly	It seems crazy to type this, to be honest but I am hoping other ENTJs here understand.\n\nI have tested as ENTJ several times and it is most definitely my personality, however, I just cannot agree with the whole idea of needing to spend time with people to recharge. If anything, I need to be left alone to recharge, especially after a huge drain of energy. I can pull my weight in social settings when needed and can strike up a conversation with just about anyone about anything, but that doesn't mean I like to or even want to. Most times I do it out of necessity and because it's easy. After meeting some people I am left completely drained and annoyed and I need to just be left alone to get my energy back to where it used to be.\n\nWhile there are some people who never drain me and I can be around them almost every day, it's still nice to have some alone time to do what I want to do. I actually look forward to having a weekend sometimes where I have no plans and can stay at home, alone. Can anyone else relate to this? 
11	I see extroverts as people who feel the urge or need of expressing their feelings/thoughts outwards. Also, you may be extrovert but very close to introvert, does your test show a percentage?
9	100%!  I love working with people on team projects at work, and then I don’t want to talk to anyone when I get home.
7	Definitel and people misunderstand what extroversion means. 
5	Me, too.\n\nFor me, I see the extroversion come out when I am making a decision - it’s easier for me to get my thoughts in order if I can bounce ideas off other people (or myself via a notepad and pen).\n\nI also once worked in an office of introverts. Over time, I became really restless and drained. Even though I didn’t particularly love my coworkers, I would visit their offices to chat. I became super talkative to any and every cashier. I finally realized that things had switched - too much introversion now required me to need to talk to people as much as possible.
6	The extraversion in mbti is not the same as being extroverted. It means you makes sense of things by relating to the world outside of you instead of inside of you, you like to externalise thoughts.\n\nI am socially adept but by no means am i extroverted. Hanging out with the right people does rejuvenate me but i do also need to be on my own to decompress.
3	(I’m not ENTJ, I’m here bc I love you guys v v much. I’m INTP) \n\nThe shadow of INTP is ENTJ, and vice versa. I’ve thought I was ENTJ bc I act like one in social settings but when I’m alone after I can finally breathe. \n\nI’m by no means doubting you’re an ENTJ, but something to consider. Maybe you’re an INTP with a strong developed shadow? 
2	Extroversion and introversion are both on a spectrum. It’s not a you’re either always surrounded by people and talking incessantly *or* you’re a recluse that never leaves your house and never speaks to anyone who isn’t your mother kind of thing. Obviously I’m exaggerating here but you get the idea. \n\nI’m of the opinion that extroversion and introversion are both still widely misunderstood, they’re both extremely complicated psychological functions and are way more complex than the social aspect which is always overemphasized to some degree on these tests (some tests are bigger offenders than others). \n\nYou could just be a less sociable extrovert. \n\nPersonally I love socializing, it energizes me. But even for me, sometimes I need a break also. It isn’t as often as most people, but still, every once in awhile I need a weekend of alone time and if I don’t get that I can become very unpleasant to be around. 
2	I need to be left alone as well to recharge. Generally I am not a fan of people, but I go insane if I don’t socialize enough.\n\n
2	People conflate social with extrovert. There are four extroverted cognitive functions; do people really think they all interact with their environment the same way? I think it's absurd to think so. 
2	Honestly I believe there are certain types of interactions that will give you energy and other that will drain you. Personally most types of social interaction energise me even just being around people or being in a crowd. But not all interactions energise me talking with people I don't like and being in situations that intimate me or where I don't know slot of people and am too shy I don't feel energised I feel drained.
2	E is from energy. having the framework to express yourself and mold your context   \nhaving the autonomy to regain thtt energy and risk it over and over
2	I am hugely E (95%) and I need solitude regularly to recharge from the frenetic energy of being with other people. Don't get me wrong, I love it but I can't spend my entire existence in a crowd. 
2	I’m right there with you. I’m 83% Extraverted, but I tend to be in my head more than not and hate being interrupted when I’m thinking something through. When I want to understand an idea or reach another level beyond myself I am better when I have others around to talk it through. \n\nThat said, I do not like people. Emotionally inclined, insecure, illogical, or just outright unconfident people make me writhe in my seat. So I prefer to stay away from them. I don’t care for the game of “praise and expect praise in return” that I see a lot of people engaged in when they converse. I will not praise someone unless they are deserving immediately of that praise. I just won’t. In my mind, praise keeps you from pushing yourself to be better and all it does is make you comfortable and hibernate.\n\nBecause of this, I push people away. I genuinely do not care for having more than say two friends that I communicate long distance with and of course my significant other. Other than those three, I have no others I care to worry about. The inevitable shortcomings of others ruin the relationship or interaction; e.g. intimidated male friends whom compete with me to feel better about themselves (note: they often lose and take it out on me later) or the talkative female whom pegs me as flirtatious when I’m really just looking for some mental stimulation talking about something other than small talk with guys because anything else makes them feel inferior.\n\nSo, I am closed off. I do get energy from others, but in the end, it’s a lifestyle choice to avoid drama and unnecessary headaches, and allowing myself to do what I want without others interfering. 
1	Perhaps the issue can be attributed to primarily having to be involved with draining people rather than because all people are draining. I have had issues with what defines an introvert/extravert for a while as a result.
1	It’s called an avoidant attachment style. 
6	Insomnia, anyone?	So, this isn’t an all the time problem by a long shot but every once in awhile I go through a phase of several nights in a row of not sleeping very well. The problem is never going to sleep, it’s staying asleep that’s the issue. I’ll wake up at midnight or at 3:00 in the morning or whatever and my mind for whatever reason will be wide awake and I’ll start going into planning mode and thinking of all the things I want to do and so on. When this happens I typically don’t even bother trying to go back to sleep. I just get up and go to my work desk and start working because I’m not going to waste my time laying in bed when I’m wide awake. It’s not waking up and being groggy, nope. I’m completely awake when I wake up in the middle of the night like this, I don’t feel tired. I feel rested and ready to get to work. \n\nIt’s not a huge deal, I can function on very little sleep if necessary, but I find it interesting that sometimes my mind just does this in the middle of the night without warning at times, usually when there’s a lot going on in my life at the time. \n\nThis reminds me of the saying, “there aren’t enough hours in a day.” \n\nIt resolves itself on its own and I’ll go back to sleeping normally. \n\n*I don’t have bipolar disorder. No need to ask.*\n\nDoes this kind of thing happen to any of my fellow ENTJs? 
4	Lack of sleep is linked to a lot of health problems, so I'd try and sort that out if you can. I occassionally do this, and all I do is get up and go to the bathroom, have a glass of water, and remind myself that everything will still be there tomorrow, clear my mind and go back to sleep.
3	Yes I have this consistently.\n\nHave you ever heard of second sleep? It’s the idea that back before electricity people used to sleep in two shifts, and they would get up for a few hours a night to chit chat, stole the fire, have sex, whatever; and then go back to sleep. \n\nThere are even studies that show in complete darkness people naturally do this. I think it’s a perfectly valid way to be!
2	Hmmm, tried meditation? 
2	Serious question: what are you working for?\n\nOther than to get that nagging feeling out of your system.\n\n
4	Advice for a frustrated ENTJ?	Hello! I'm an INFJ (f) and my boyfriend is an ENTJ. For the past couple of days he's been searching online for advice, hoping that maybe some people of the same personality type has felt the same way he's feeling right now.\n\nI told him to go to reddit and ask but he doesn't like asking for help (surprise surprise), so I'm asking for him! Here's the situation: \n\nWe live in a very depressing small town that has little to no opportunity. Jobs are scarce, unless you're an aspiring truck driver or nurse, so the only available jobs that do come up aren't usually very promising. We've been planning on moving to a different city for the past 4 to 5 years, and we're finally at a place in life where we're getting closer to actually moving (September or October of this year at the latest). \n\nMy boyfriend knows this, and he's excited, but he's having trouble suppressing his impatience. The job he currently works is about a 30 to 45 minute commute every single day and it doesn't make a ton of money, and to make matters worse it's a swing shift so he leaves in the early afternoon and doesn't get home until about midnight. He's been looking for another job but nothing has come up that will have the same pay, or at least close to, and that is also day shift. (Like I said, decent jobs are scarce...)\n\nHe wants a day shift so he can spend more time with his friends and family that live here before we leave, and also so he can have more time to take care of himself and have personal time without feeling rushed. It's hard that he gets home around midnight, we cook and eat dinner, spend a little bit of time together, and then suddenly it's 2 or 3 in the morning. So he doesn't get up in the morning until 10 or 11, and at that point he only has roughly two hours of free time. If he gets up earlier in the day he's too tired to enjoy anything and it results in sleep deprivation which isn't good for his health.\n\nTo get to the point (I'm sorry this is so long!), he's insanely frustrated with his life and has a hard time enjoying things because he's stuck and wants to move forward already. I know that ENTJ's struggle with being stagnant and not making any progress, especially when it comes to jobs/careers. He know's that he needs to shake off the negativity and just be patient for a little while longer, but he doesn't know how to get past this frustratred feeling thats weighing on him. Basically his morale is shot to hell and its causing him extreme unhappiness on the daily. \n\nAny ENTJ's who have struggled with this same feeling? Do any of you have any words of wisdom or coping strategies that will help? Thank you for reading my insanely long post and any advice is truly appreciated!
7	Quit and move now. Why wait 6 months? Change is good
3	In the words of Tom Petty, the waiting is the hardest part. I'm in the same boat, our lease comes up in October and then we're moving cities for the next stage of our life (exciting!). I'm stagnating here, and now that I'm mentally checking out the wait is excruciating. What's been really great is my partner acknowledging that this job is just a "placeholder", and giving me things to look forward to and plan for. I've redoubled my efforts at work so that I can leave on a high (and get a great reference), and we're starting to look at the logistics of clearing our house and shifting, prices in the area we want to live In, what our commutes will look and where we want to work. Give him small projects in the meantime to give him a sense of progress, getting fitter, saving money, learn a language or pick up a hobby. 
3	Being stagnant is just a product of his inability to grasp all the different ways you can move forward.\n\nPerhaps he should think about what it means to move forward, and why it is so specific, and why he is not fulfilling it. The solution for him may not be a dramatic change or a rush to change, but rather a change in thinking that results in him believing he is utilizing his time effectively to grow as a person.
2	I am an ENTJ (f) and my SO is an INFJ (m). We are in the step right after you; already moved but still don’t have the exactly job/schedule/free time we want.\n\nAs much as the waiting sucks, not being ready sucks too. I am in a position where I have just graduated and am looking for better work. He is making pretty much all the income now and has a 3+ hour round trip commute. It is hard, but I know what it’s like to be the ENTJ that fixated on “if XYZ happens, all our problems will be solved!” When that isn’t always the case.\n\nI would say focus on making the best of things. Plan your eating out so it’s special, like the end of every work week to celebrate. Have date night. Do spa days (if he’s into that, mine loves spa days lol).\n\nLife if in the little every day moment not in the big sweeping life changes.
1	1 prioritize health > zerocarb snakediet carnivore  \n2 listen to audiobooks when traveling  \n3 he is greedyy as fuck with his time. i doubt he is entj. time is used for growth not spending on fun and games  ENFJ?
1	Im in the same position. Ive been stuck in Poland for the last 4 years and in 2 months we are finally leaving.  Dealing with my resentment and depression has been a daily struggle but there are things you can do to make it more manageable to stave off the stagnation:\n\nKeep a journal.  Log your dreams from the night before, set small goals for the day, and just reflect on your thoughts and feelings.  Getting them out and down on paper is extremely good for extroverts and gives them more coherence.  It will also cultivate a general mindfulness as to that's going on within.\n\nMeditate.  Same reasons as above really, it keeps you orientated and centered, and it cultivates mindfulness of ones thoughts and feelings.\n\nIf he had a long commute, try podcasts and audiobooks.  The trap I fell into was looking at things too negatively.  Rather than seeing the commute as a bad thing use it to your advantage and do something productive with it.  If an ENTJ is learning he/she is usually happy about it.
1	If your job is less stressful, you could try to take care of other things. \n\nHe should not have to clean, cook and his sex should be good when he wants it haha. Sounds like patriarchy but you just needs to get through the 6 months.\n\nTake initiative. Make a plan for things you need to do before you move. You will probably need to sell a bunch of crap you no longer need, cancel utilities, change the address with USPS, rent a truck, rent an apartment, buy plane tickets, maybe rent a cheap crappy Airbnb till the end of a month once you move.\n\nYou could create a bunch of TODO cards in Trello, assign most of them to you and start working on them.\n\nWhat he needs to see is progress being made and Trello or even a simple Google Spreadsheet is good for that.\n\nWhat are your jobs? Why September or October? Are you saving very little each month? Perhaps you can reduce spending even further ...\n\nIf you are underemployed, you could find random gigs online.\n
4	Any professionals wanting to keep their team more in sync and organized?	I've made an app that helps keep your team organized and accountable regarding asks, action items, announcements, etc. Looking for any feedback, positive or negative. If you aren't interested in using this, please let me know why. [https://getpigeon.app](https://getpigeon.app/)
1	I am not going to try it sorry but I did take a look at the main page.\n\nOne thing I do not like is the visual mis-alignment of the UI. You have two phone screenshots where things are horizontally aligned to cluster in the middle rather than being left-aligned (the standard).\n\nThe "New Item" rectangle - it feels like it is a bit too close to the margins. I do not know what it is but it stands out. Maybe it needs a differently colored border or background color or something else. It sticks out though. It is not aligned with other stuff. Maybe because it is the only rectangle on this screen.\n\nYour screen, particularly on the bottom is too busy and too ... diverse. Everything is jumbled together.\n\nIt's the equivalent of having strawberry, apple sauce, octopus, pizza and hot dogs all one one plate.\n\nHow will you tame the complexity and organize everything as the lists and the number of lists grow?\n\nI am not a designer but I would rate the appeal and the intuitiveness of your UI at this time to be average or even below that. Not average across 7 billion people but average across people who get paid to make UI.\n\nGood luck!\n\n**EDIT:** Your web page is too big. On my monitor I need to scroll through like 2.5 pages before I reach the bottom. Give me the reason to keep scrolling. In fact, you could have the features scroll right to left within the same page so that the visitors can read all that without having to scroll themselves.\n\nIt is called a JS gallery or a carousel or something like that.\n\nMaybe my feedback is premature because I have not talked about the functionality itself but only the look and feel.\n\nWell, sorry but I won't try the actual app. The look and feel is the first thing that I notice.\n
5	Books	What kind of Books are ENTJ’s more attracted to. \n\nI prefer books which add to my knowledge as opposed to fiction. Although, I couldn’t put down any of the books from the game of thrones series. \nI’ve read Machiavelli’s the Prince - highly recommended for my fellow narcissistic future world leaders. The 48 laws of power was a big eye opener but I also like books like Sapiens and Homo Deus. I feel they prepare me for the world in a certain way. 
5	I enjoyed fiction as a kid. I can’t read it anymore, though. \n\nThe latest book I’m reading is called: ‘I'll Make You an Offer You Can't Refuse: Insider Business Tips from a Former Mob Boss’. \n\nI haven’t finished it yet, so I won’t recommend it, but he mentions Machiavelli and counters that philosophy with Solomon. You may find it interesting. 
4	I enjoy books about history because it repeats itself over and over.\n\nI also enjoy reading about persuasion and philosophy.
3	I actually really dislike most non fiction. I like a lot of outlandish dystopian/ post apocalyptic books about totalitarian governments, aliens, sickness, the future of technology, or who knows, maybe all three. I’m pretty picky though, but I stick with books when I find them. Occasionally I find an an epic historical fiction or fantasy book, but I usually dislike fantasy. It’s too unusual, even though I’ve read books like The Handmaid’s Tale and Brave New World. I did like fantasy once, when I was a little kid. 
2	Anything about the end of the world or a dystopian future.
1	The reading list is so dry on here, try something new and exciting like hentai, broaden your horizons son!
5	entjs whats your eq?	entjs how well do you score on emotional intellegence? eq?\n\nor how well would you rate your social skills in general?
13	I’ve got a very high EQ now, but it took a lot of practice and mindfulness 
6	I’d say I’m at about a 7. I am very adept at reading people’s intentions, desires, and thought processes, but I’m shit at recognizing when they’re getting angry, until they explode. I’m great on getting back to a good calm state, but the actual thick of the emotional reading comes just a second or two late. \n\nI’d say I can get a lot of people on my side and happy to have me around. I make their day bright and fun and I can usually get them to laugh. It’s when I stick my nose out and try to correct people’s flawed logic or test their annoyingly air-headed naïveté by challenging them to get them back down to my level that gets me into trouble. 
3	I was told I have very good social skills,( because I cultivated them living in diff cities and diff countries for years) , but in the end , these days I have no good close friends. It's weird. I never get invited much for parties with people I met several times, but those people I wish invited me to their parties, seem to always meet new people who get invited the parties I wish I was invited to.... it's bugs my mind. 
2	I've never taken the test. Too expensive. I it's good and my social skills are good especially. I lack self perception sometimes. 
8	Entj bully	I was using my entj traits negatively as a teenage girl. Luckily, I was able to grow out of it in time and regret my behaviour when looking back. Did you ever bully someone in school? Were you ever able to make it up to them? Whats ur story?
14	I wasn't a bully in school, I was the one being bullied until I finally lost my patience and beat the ever living fuck out of the leader who was doing it. Nobody fucked with me again after I did that. I didn't get in much trouble for doing it either, even the school authorities kind of conceded that the guy had it coming for years. I got a slap on the wrist and that was that. \n\nI have been a bully in other settings though, at work for example. However, the people I bullied were people who were being bullies themselves in some way or another. There was this one bitch who kept going around gossiping about everyone and pitting people against each other because of her nasty and always false rumors that she would start. Several people realized what she was doing but felt powerless to do anything about it, it was discussed when she wasn't around. She was creating a toxic environment and just being a terrible person for no real reason other than she seemed to enjoy the chaos she was creating. I proceeded to start making cutting remarks at her every chance I could get. I also made a point kind and motivational to the people that were victims of her shitty behavior and I was just on my best behavior otherwise so she would look utterly insane if she complained about me. In the end she wound up getting fired and I got a promotion. Tough luck cunt. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. \n\nHave I done things to people that I regret? Absolutely. There have been times that I've been cruel and it was unjustified, period. I apologized and made it up to whoever it was that I wronged. The fact that you can admit your mistakes and want to right those wrongs speaks volumes about your character. It amazes me that so many people are unwilling or incapable of admitting their mistakes and admitting when they've done something they shouldn't have done. 
12	No, I didn’t bully; I was the one standing up for others who couldn’t/wouldn’t stand up for themselves. 
10	No i never bullied anyone but I made a lot of friends protecting the weaker kids from the bullies and had older friends who had my back also, I hit people for dumb reasons and stuff though but never bullied. 
9	Today you can apologize to those you've hurt. \n\nTomorrow you can work on grammar and spelling. 
4	negative =  not getting results. its part of ilife, failure is eternal when it comes to people
2	As a kid I was very often bullied.  The first time it happened there was this one kid who was the ring leader and I started to bully other kids with him just to avoid being bullied myself.  Later on in life I forgave myself for this and I apologized to all those who I had wronged, and funnily enough, most of them didnt hold me accountable and were aware of why I was doing it.  Kids will do nasty things to survive in toxic environments like that.\n\nIn high school though it was a completely different story. I went to an all boy's school and in my very first year a few kids started to bully me.  So, I went right up to the ring leader in front of all his buddies and gave him 1 warning, he didnt heed it, so I kicked his arse in front of 30 or so onlookers.  After that they left me alone.  Two years later another kid tried it again, and again I warned him, again he didnt listen, again I gave out a fat lip, and again I was left to my own devices. \n\nLater on in adult life I have encountered quite a few female bullies in the work place.  This was quite a new experience as females bully very differently.  They gossip and back stab, and they talk down to you in a very passive aggressive way.  The way we dealt with that was to get the woman in a room with all of us and confront her directly by calling her out on her behaviour and telling us how it affects is.  She fled the room in fear as she had no doubt never been confronted like that before.  After that any attempt she made to talk down to any of us would result in an instant call out, and she lost any and all power she had over anyone.  It was great to see the people she bullied taking their power back.
2	I did in middle school to a select few. I was hit with karma hard as fuck in high school after that though. I learned to control my anger far better once I started working out. 
2	Good valid question but hard to empathize with that. I did not bully. When it comes to guys the bullying is more physical and more direct. It's the women who can play mind games and form alliances.
1	People don't forgive even when they say they do. Just try to do better and move on. You can't fix your past mistakes but you can do your best to make sure you don't repeat them. 
1	I was never a bully because I was the one who was bullied but I have hurt the feelings of people close to me unintentionally multiple times.
37	Wow I’m glad I found you	I’ve always felt so freaking out of place and people always think I’m blunt, bossy, unemotional.... \n\nAnd discussing personalities with a friend and I had taken this test for some work thing long ago but I never paid much attention,\n\nSo I  read up, felt like it resonated with who I am. I of course came to snoop on reddit and reading through the threads I couldn’t be more thrilled!!\n\nYou’re like me... I’m like you!! Almost everything I read is something that has popped in my head before!\n\nIm sort of relieved to be able to relate so much, I’ve always felt a bit displaced!\n\nGlad this subreddit exists!\n\nOk nothing to see here, move along
14	This isn’t the end of the journey. Continue to work on yourself. Meditate on who you are, not just what you are. Dig, and then keep on digging. Then, share it with us 
9	Visit also some of the feeler subs. INFP, INFJ. Learn how they operate. :D
5	Welcome, fellow ENTJ!
2	this is so wholesome
2	Hey you think like me! Lol that was an awkward realization. 
-10	Congratulations and welcome! You share the MBTI with our current president Donald J Trump.\n\nI highly recommend his book from 1980s The Art of the Deal. Here is the free PDF file:\n\nhttp://www.propmgmtforms.com/forms/ebooks/trump-the-art-of-the-deal.pdf\n\n\n**EDIT:** Of course the ENTJ conformists are going to down-vote me for having a different opinion. This is becoming so boring.\n
17	ENTJs who are always single ?	Back then, when I didn't know how to seduce a girl I felt like being in a relationship was normal for a normal person.\n\nNow that I know more or less how to do it and that I've become way more good looking, it's just seems useless to me. Probably because I still haven't found someone who would make a relationship really interesting.\n\nOther people in that situation ? Now that all my closest friends have a girlfriend they're always like "when does it happen to you ?", and I'm getting tired of trying to answer that question.
17	I feel you bro hahaha. Most people suck. Also I have ptsd and I'm a bit of a narcissist so I'm staying away from girls until I have therapy 
13	I’ve been single for years, guys have asked me out but I’ve taken to turning them down because when I haven’t? Lol it never goes anywhere, I always end up dropping them cold. It’s a waste of my time that is literally always best spent on other things of way more importance and overall usefulness. \n\nRelationships aren’t essential to me and never have been, it’s always been a “take it or leave it” thing for me and honestly? It looks like I’m going to leave it, barring an extremely exceptional person at the correct time and place. 
7	ENTJs have a reputation for not dating around until they've found someone they think is worth their time; effort; and, let's face it, money. I don't see the point in dating someone seriously unless I see marriage potential in them. I imagine some ENTJs who feel like they have no sexual opportunity unless they date (i.e., label someone as boyfriend or girlfriend) might date more often, but it seems that at least these days, most people have decent avenues to sex. I've only had one girlfriend and two boyfriends. I "dated" the girlfriend to see if I was straight. (I wasn't.) The first guy I "dated" was a really stupid ESFP whom I dated because I wanted some sexual experience with a guy, but I never really liked him. The second guy I "dated" was an extremely aloof, French ISTJ who spoke no English. I thought we were just fuck buddies, but then he said he had experienced love at first sight with me (*coup de foudre*), which made it awkward for me to say I didn't feel the same way toward. (I said it down the line so as to lessen the blow.)\n\n...After reflecting on this, now I feel like an asshole....
6	Dating is a fun challenging game. I don't have that many good friends to go out with, so I just go on dates with girls to various nature or culture events.\n\nI really love flirting, so that helps.
5	Relateable 
5	As someone who was in a relationship with someone directly opposite of me, I’m giving myself some time off to figure out myself and also I need to regain myself back. I’m an only child, strong willed, and unyielding with my goals. I need space at times. That doesn’t mean it’s you or you’re doing anything wrong. She was more go with the flow, constantly there,  and no life plan. We broke up due to various reasons but my take away was I was too rigid and focused and I never took a step back to look at the whole picture of us. She felt she was just wedged into my overall plan. I felt she softened me up more than I was comfortable with. Not to say there wasn’t love but we took a lot out of each other. I’ve gone out with younger women since then and they seem skin deep to me. Age has hardened me (not that I’m old, early 30s) and there’s shit I don’t put up with now that I did when I was young. Flaking, spinning wheels, and making me chase and jump hurdles past what’s normal. Don’t waste my time, be yourself, we shouldn’t be each others entire worlds, be kind, love each other. Don’t rush it let it happen. 
3	I don't have problem with seduction or anything, I am simply not interested in getting into/being in a relationship. I've always been like that, I just don't need it.  \nGood that you mention the "Friends" because no one seems to understand this about me, they're constantly trying to guess and figure my sexuality, what's my problem etc.  \nBoring, as you said. I find pleasure in different things and a relationship would be a burden to me, that's all.
2	Serial dating is how average people hedge their bets. \n\nYou know what you want (or what you don’t want). There’s nothing wrong with holding out for someone who you have an instant connection with. Chances are you’ll move quickly when you find someone who ticks all the right boxes :)
2	Have you ever been in a relationship? 
3	I have been single for quite some time now. Dated a narcissist and it was horrible, so a much needed break was taken. \n\nUntil recently I would met guys, in general, and never felt like I wanted to get to know them better. There was literally nothing about them that I found interesting or appealing. I swear I do not mean that in a negative way, just saying that there wasn't anything on a romantic level. As a person in general they were cool but I could not see it going anywhere further from that. Then, if I met someone I was attracted to physically, I could always talk myself out of it because there was just something that didn't feel right. \n\nI wouldn't say that I am picky because I am not but I think I just felt like when I found someone I would know. Hopefully you ENTJs understand what I am saying. I met someone about a year ago who I instantly liked and trust me, I was and still am shocked. We are friends, and I am hoping for more, but if it doesn't work out, I will be on this single train until who knows when. 
2	I was single for a long time because of high standards and I was also being berated by friends and family about when I would find someone.  So much so that rumors started to circulate in my family that I might be gay (not sure how being single translates to wanting to fuck other dudes, but ok).  I just constantly reiterated the fact that I was waiting for the right person, and that I wasn't interested in chasing the run of the mill girls in my town.    \n\n\nAfter a few years of being alone I met an INTJ who lived on the other side of the world and I was so sure about her that I flew all the way over there to meet her.  We were in a LDR for 6 months after that until I finally moved over here to be with her.  5 years later we are still going strong and only getting stronger.  She isn't just my lover, she is my team mate.  \n\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is, keep your standards high, ignore the normies who interrogate you about it, and if you want to stay single until you meet someone interesting enough, I would say with 100% certainty you are making the right move.
2	I’m the same, age has hardened me a little bit or maybe I am only just now realizing I need more space in relationships. Either way, I’m pretty typical ENTJ except post-divorce I’ve lost some of my ego. Currently in therapy trying to regain what I’ve lost. I’m still strong willed, stubborn, and accidentally take over whatever room of folks you put me in. Just needed to step back because it’s hard to be boss all the time in a relationship. I just mean, I let myself get too controlling, I guess, and didn’t notice til it was too late. That’s what the therapy is for. \n\nAnyways, single for now and for a good while longer, I suspect. There’s not a ton of dudes who can handle (or would want to handle) my bullshit so I’m enjoying the time to myself to really get into my work, really focus in on stuff. It’s honestly nice not having to worry about somebody else’s crap. A real breather that I didn’t realize I needed until I got here. 
1	Can relate. All of my friends, in various friend groups over the years, have told me "I can't imagine you being in a relationship." Bothered me, and I still don't think they're right, but... I haven't been moved to date people long enough to make one happen. Over the past 5 years, I've had countless infatuations with people I've dated, but I think they were primarily sexual in nature. Dealing with some of their personalities was excruciating, and that, as well as having too little time, is what led me to stop.\n\nI had one actual love during that period, but it wasn't meant to be. He drunkenly confessed feelings for me, I soberly confessed mine back some weeks later, and then he didn't have much to say to me anymore. Makes me think it was all some cat chase mouse game. And now that it's over, looking at the stuff he posts makes me think he's a chump. I think that the whole thing left me a bit jaded, but also made me learn to really enjoy being single.\n\nNow I've been accidentally dating someone else and we have similar ideas about lifestyle, family, and other general life goals. I told him directly that I'm reluctant to let it go further, but he insisted. Now I'm thinking of just letting it be because he's a positive influence on me and we have fun together. But I've turned into a commitmentphobe now, so it feels inappropriate to let it go on because I don't want to hurt anyone.
1	I've found that it takes about 10-15 minutes of conversation on a date to figure out if I'm interested in something serious or not. \n\nI don't seriously date anyone because honestly most of the women I meet aren't that interesting. They are all about partying or just can't carry a conversation. It's not terribly exciting to me, so I stay single.
1	Single female here. Lots of people assume that I have 100s of bfs but the truth is I'm lonely AF and I have zero guys interested in me. \nBTW has anyone tried the dating app Happn?
4	At what age did your personality and social skills mature?	When I was 16, I moved countries and into a new high school in a big city.\n\nI grew up in a dysfunctional home but I was also pretty sheltered because I grew up in a small town. At the time, some of my peers in my new high school didn't like me and I couldn't understand why. I became traumatised by my new high school experience, because in my previous school, I was the popular one and now I was the weird outcast. At that time, I felt like everyone was out to get me, but in hindsight they gave me lots of chances and tried to include me but I just misread them and looked for every possible hint of social rejection because of deep-seated feelings of shame. I was just this reactionary empty vessel with no sense of identity.\n\nBut then again adults always remarked at how mature I was and well beyond my years. But I didn’t feel that way, because I wasn’t like my peers.\n\nIt's not until 5 years later (with intensive therapy and self help books plus some more socialisation) that I now realise that their maturity level back then is what mine is currently now. Now my mind is crystal clear and I can easily connect with people nowadays whereas before, I had this permanent fog to my mind where I had a mix of OCD, ADHD and anxiety which resulted in extreme shyness and me inadvertently appearing rude because I had an uptight personality (a coping mechanism)\nI feel so despondent because I missed such a vital part of the growing up process (late adolescence) where most people had their first girlfriend, became more independent and seamlessly transitioned into adulthood. And high school where I am currently now forms the basis for most people's lifelong freindships. They were good people that wanted to be freinds with me, and they would've been a wonderful social network for me. I wish I could go back in time and set my life on a different path.\n\nAt what age did the bulk of your personality and social skills form?
3	I missed out on my adolescent years also in many ways, but for different reasons (I have a mental illness that had an early onset and it fucked up a lot of my plans, I had to make a lot of adjustments and reassessments and so on; and I was *not happy* about that to say the least). The good news is that it’s never too late to learn and change, and to grow into the person you truly are. Don’t believe the narrative that you wasted the “best years of your life” or whatever, because that’s bullshit. \n\nMy social skills matured far more normally than I realized at the time (and far more normally than anyone in my life thought they would have) considering everything that I had going on in my life at the time, but it was rough going for awhile. I won’t sugarcoat that fact. \n\nHaving said that:\n\nYou may be better off than you think you are, it’s all a matter of perception. I’ve been there with the insecurity, it plagued me when I was a teenager and a very young adult. But I realized something at a certain point. I realized that my perception of not being where I wanted to be was an illusion. It was a flaw in perception that I had. When that fog lifted I was so much better off. It was a self-imposed limitation that I had the power to remove so that is exactly what I did. \n\nMy personality started maturing at the age that’s normal: in my mid twenties. \n\nI know it may sound trite but I have found it to be true: it does get better. I’m not lying or just trying to make you feel better with some bullshit platitude. You’ll be amazed at the amount of things that do work out and resolve themselves as you age, and with the effort you put into your personal growth. You’ll get there if you put the necessary effort and time into it, and from what I read in your original post and the comments it looks like you’re more than willing to do that. You’ll get through this and be the person you want to be. 
1	Was language barrier a factor?\n\nThe cool thing about college years is that you can leave all of the HS drama behind.\n\nYou can waste a lot of time wondering about the missing past.\n\nThe funny thing is that most people in this world are only one step above from being retarded. Wait 10 years and you'll see a drastic difference between yourself and some low-IQ popular girl from high school who now works as a waitress. Even if people were nice to you, being afraid of their judgement is dumb. Where does their coolness come from? Did they discover relativity?\n\nYou are still far from being in your prime but that of course is not a reason to sit on your ass and do nothing.\n\nYou have to turn a negative into a positive, lone ranger. Dust builds character.\n\nDon't hate yourself or others; just work toward positive goals. You still have a bunch of time left on this planet and if you are to believe the hype (don't), life extension is right around the corner.\n
1	You haven't missed out on anything at that age, or at any age really. Just talk to everyone you can about anything that mutually interests both of you. It leads to new exchanges of information, and teaches you how to effectively communicate with different types of people. Communication is a skill, and like any skill, the more you do it confidently, the better you get at it.\n\nAnd some people will be rude and make you feel unwelcome, but that behavior won't phase you anymore if you have a strong sense of self. It more often has to do with their own insecurities. From what you said, I think you could relate to that, as you feel like you ostracized people who gave you chances due to your own perceived shame.
18	Anyone of you have INTP partner?	My lovely arrogant ENTJs, do anyone of you have INTP partner? If yes, how's it in terms of relationship. Do you enjoy their company and get along well? What do you like and dislike about INTPs?
16	This week's post of circlejerking between INTPs and ENTJs. Speaking generally, ENTJs are narcissistic while INTPs are immature and self-centered, the perfect combo where both individuals feed off each other's self-absorption like two species in a symbiotic relationship.
9	I’ve been with my INTP partner for over 10 years now. He’s the love of my life, I can’t imagine being with anyone else. I can’t imagine being able to live with anyone else, let alone find anyone else who’s able to live with me. It started as a whirlwind, and remains the single most rewarding, mentally stimulating, meaningful relationship in each of our lives.\n\nOur views of the world are very similar, but our approaches are different- especially when it comes to the maintenance aspects of life. We assign different levels of urgency to problems, and address them in different ways. If he’s neglecting to take the necessary steps required to solve a problem that I know requires action, I think he’s disrespecting my happiness and peace of mind. This is the source of the problems we do have.\n\nI think it’s also worth noting that we are actually quite affectionate with each other. It embarrasses me if he talks to me in public the way we talk to each other in private. His ESTJ sister jokes that we are still in the honeymoon phase.\n\nAside from his maintenance issues and the occasional social faux pas, we couldn’t be more perfectly matched. Would recommend.
10	Whether there is love or not, there will be a lot of mental stimulation, conversations that run deep into the philosophies, sciences, and predictions of the world. Their imaginations and overall intellect is outstanding to behold and they will trade realistic subjects for fanciful ones at the drop of a hat. \n\nAs an ENTJ, you may have frustration at times with some conversations that you’ve already had in the past, with others or yourself, wherein you’ve already answered much of the question or understood most of the puzzle and want to give your two cents, and they will thank you for giving it, but they’ll want to keep the conversation going. For them, it’s not about finding a solution, it’s about understanding the question and uncovering all of the possibilities of the answer that would provide a solution. So you have to be on your toes a little bit, swallow that need for a solid answer, and keep up. Gives you time to work on patience and to fully engulf yourself in your imagination.\n\nThey are easily upset when they don’t get their way or when they do not succeed at something because they don’t want to feel inferior or they don’t want to be placed in a position of fault or loss. So you need to help them with patience too, and figure out what they need to hear without belittling them or making them feel like your being condescending. \n\nYou’re right, they’ll quit all of it, throw the board up in the air, so to speak, which means you have to give them positive reinforcement at times, and other times just let them be. \n\nBut, that’s all inconsequential in the end, and the beauty of the relationship will be someone who’s loving, loyal, and truly fun to be with and talk to. 
9	I’ve had an INTP boyfriend in the past and one of my close friends is an INTP. Mostly our relationship was great in terms of communication and the fact we could talk for hours and he didn’t mind if I worked on little projects. What sucks about both my previous relationship and my close friend is that they always think they’re right, if they feel they aren’t they change the topic or avoid the conversation by physically moving somewhere whether that be in another room or just leaving altogether. I find it childish but I’m assuming that may be a quality to these specific INTPs. 
3	I have an INTP friend and she annoys the heck out of me because she puts no effort in and gets better results than I do and I work way harder than her. The people around me always compare us and I feel like people like her more even though they don't see what I see in her they only see what's on the surface. Beyond that she's alright she's quite friendly, always has an open ear, considerate and is very helpful. But we also don't see eye to eye on issues but it doesn't stop us from being friends. 
3	both bad at communicating feelings which was a major roadblock in my past relationship with a intp 
3	(I’m INTP) I mean it’s all relative, which types do you communicate best with when you’re at your worst? I can have fun with most types at my best, but on a dog shit day, out of all my coworkers it’s the ENTJ who gets me genuinely laughing. There’s something about how animated you guys are.
3	Not a partner, but my best friend is an INTP! We go hand in hand, and our other best friend is an ISTP. She has to put up with us having the same conversation three times a day, because I forget I ask the same question and he forgets that he answers it.
3	Intp here also gaining interest in entjs. Would like to meet, chat with some entjs to verify hypothesis about high computability.
4	My girlfriend is a INTP, and I think we really are two compatible types. If you love a challenging mind, curiosity, and talking for hours about a topic nobody cares about except you two, an INTP is a perfect match. As for bad sides, if you're a control freak like me it can be difficult to give them free space, and they're also indecisive and fucking disorganized. But to sum everything up, my relationship is truly awesome, and I hope my experience will help you !
3	Intps are the definition of efficiency. so a relationship works if the context is right.  \nmeaning distance, resources, ease of movement and interaction, pragmatism involved, level of stimulation and autonomy , health , work etc.  \nif the context fits, u fit, they just adapt.  so create a context that works for you  
42	I worry that people will think I am arrogant if I behave like my true self.	I am tired of feeling like this, I try to act nicer and it’s really annoying that I feel like I have to be reserved all the time and really control how I behave in public - to people I don’t care about. \n\nAlthough what I have mentioned comes with maturity, how can I fix this as I feel like I am losing a big part of myself ? 
20	Don't you worry - if people don't like you for who you really are, why would you want to be friends with them anyways?  People tend to react strongly to ENTJs one way or another - they either love us to death or hate us.  Just avoid the latter. \n\nPeople may think you're being arrogant, but that's not an issue - it's only because we actually ARE better than everyone else.  ;) 
10	My INTJ sister tells me to ask myself: \n\n>Does this need to be said? \n\n>Does this need to be said *by me*? \n\n>Does this need to be said by me *right now*?\n\nUnfortunately, I always think "fuck yes it does." \n\nJust be smart:\n1. Don't burn bridges. \n2. Be polite and respectful, even to people "below" you. Some personality types place a lot of importance on manners, it's weird but unfortunately true.\n3. Confirm data before acting on it. \n4. Try to ask questions rather than declaring something.\n5. If you declare something, do so in a way that doesn't invite debate (unless you want debate). \n6. Sensors like to talk about sensing things. We look like fellow sensors to them. Don't alienate them by talking about NT things, because that's usually when they feel like we're arrogant. S doesn't stand for stupid and never think someone is dumb because they are a sensor.\n7. Declare your emotions more, particularly positive ones
8	Ive been like that also for most of my life. It was like I led a double life. I was so worried about what others would think of me if truly reveled my true (ENTJ) personality. So I became agreeable and reserved. But I paid a high price in the process... \n\nI lost my true self in the quest to fit in and be liked by others. However,  the pain and weight of not being able to express my true thoughts nearly ate me alive as the years passed by. \n\nWhen I realized the weight of not being able to be my authentic self was too much to bear, I decided enough is enough and I slowly began to assert myself more in conversations. I voiced my opinions more often and expressed how I see the world. \n\nSome people clicked with me and liked the “new” me, and others said I’m too intense and they drifted away. But that’s ok...ENTJ’s are not everyone’s cup of tea. \n\nBut, by staying true to myself I feel much more authentic and happier within myself. And if the price is to lose some people alone the way, but find myself — I’m good with that... \n
15	I came across this problem in high school and honestly I just didn’t care anymore and started being exactly who I am. You may lose some people but who the fuck cares you’ll gain more friends later on and it’ll be worth it to be yourself. 
6	This is me too. However, I work a job where I have to continually make people happy and not offend them. I have already failed a few times because of some accidental external thinking. Sometimes my thoughts just come out and do relational damage... even though I am generally right.
8	Assuage people’s feelings with body language and choose your words carefully, rehearse them in the shower if necessary
5	Then refuse to feel like that anymore. Be you! If they have a problem with you then you don't need them in your life. People who matter don't mind, and those who mind don't matter. Whoever came up with that had the right measure of things.
4	I guess I have an unpopular opinion here, but I think there's a difference between being arrogant & being your true self.  You can totally be your true self without being arrogant. \n\nI totally modify my behavior.  I don't have to share my true feelings on things, nor do I want too.  I reckon non of us do.
2	I don't 
2	Just figure out how to spot Fe users and tone it down around them if you care about them. otherwise be yourself
2	istp, but i'm the same way. i've tried it, and it's better to "act nicer"
2	INTP here.. Be yourself but you don't have right to piss off anyone. Maturity is all about finding your true self, live your true self and learn to cater your true self for others. This is my analysis on my close ENTJ friend. She seems arrogant at times. But in my later analysis, she's just being honest in her own way, yet it hurts.. Don't worry about being arrogant right now, you will adjust over time. And the right type of people do see it through your "arrogance". Just be your self, and let the age take care of your assumed problem.
2	You are who you are, why stifle that? People will think what they think no matter what you do or don't do, and the people who don't understand you are irrelevant. Don't worry about that nonsense. It doesn't serve you.\n\nBeing true to yourself is way more important than what some idiots think of you. 
1	Yeah same, but that's only for acquaintances and first meetings. 
1	Effective leadership manifests in different ways. As an ENTJ we are very polarizing people, something to be mindful of is that while we don't necessarily require tact in conversations other people do. There is a difference between being reserved because you don't want to unnecessarily hurt someone's feelings and hiding who you are because you want the approval of others. Which situation is closer to why you are being reserved?\n\nThe people who like you will like you and the people who don't won't. Don't go around acting like an asshole for no reason, and you shouldn't have to worry.
1	Stop worrying about what others think about you. All you can do is be logical and be kind/fair to everyone. After that, their perception of you is their business, not yours.

3	entj in highschool	hi entj ppl\n(can i tell my life?) (sry 4 my bad english im french) \nwhen i was in first year of highschool i’ve become a « true » entj like, a true dictator u know. the next year i’ve been accused of being a bully, being egoist, greedy, intolerant...etc. The administration of my school put so much defaults on me that i lose all my self esteem and im now in a pseudo-depression. Today im more shy and lonely and i dont like myself, so im here to ask u if im an isolate case or if its normal and habitual 4 an entj  \n\nand, if u lived the same thing, do u have some tips 4 me? thanks in prevention! love u all 
8	People think we're assholes or they love us, we can make anyone loves us but it's not natural, I think you need to work on not giving a fuck what people think. Look for books or the internet. 
3	French ENTJ here (18 years old), nothing personal but being French isn't an excuse for your writing to be unreadable. Let's say you're only in high school and you'll get better at it later.\n\nBut, to solve your problem, I'd say that many ENTJs have their "shy" period (I personally did, back in middle school), and it's normal to be quite private after all, you should simply remember some things :\n\n1. Sad news, you're surrounded for a large part by idiots. Live with it, don't expect them to become geniuses (equals don't bully them neither), and don't let them let you down. Just improve yourself and learn from your errors.\n2. Don't be the caricature of an ENTJ some websites like 16Personalities want you to be. You're human, hence you've got flaws, so again don't forget to work on them.\n\nThat being said, *que la force soit avec toi poto*.\n\nEdit: just hope I didn't make any errors while writing this because I'd definitely look like an idiot.
1	I get you. As an ENTJ i know we have to dumb down a bit sometimes, but you have to accept that. You are an extrovert first, you need people, people need to like you. Smooth out the edges and be mature. Reach a level of control where you can be polite and incredibly strong. You have a grand intuitive brain second: you know people. You can understand them, use it. You are a thinker: you can make a way around this. Lastly, you are judging: know when and where to act on urges. \n\nControl yourself. You can’t blame your issues on a personality type.
0	If you don't want babies, then why prefer a normal stable relationship over a series of one night stands or sex robots?	Why would you cry when your pet pig dies of pneumonia? You can always buy another one.\n\nYou actually want babies. QED.
13	Ok I'll bite. How did you come to this conclusion? It would seem that the dots you connected are unrelated. Having feelings is not equal to wanting children. And not wanting children doesn't mean that you don't want to be loved. You're assuming that the only purpose of a stable relationship is to reproduce. That is false. There are many other ways a stable relationship can enrich your life. I would even argue that wanting children isn't a good enough reason to be in a relationship. You should be in a relationship because you love that person and care about them and want to spend time with them. Not because you want to use them to achieve your goal of reproduction.
8	Oh, I don't know. Maybe because relationships are greater than the sum of your biological urges. Because your understanding and love for each other grows over time, and gives you a greater quality of companionship. Because human needs are greater than just sex or procreation. Because owning a pet is a relationship with a specific animal, not necessarily a replacement for a child.\n\nWhy do you always give off this creepy Red Pill women's-role-is-to-make-children vibe? \n\nEdit: This line of thinking is purely ideological, and not based in any fact.
3	Your logic is non-sensical, and you overlook two things that lead to normal stable relationships.\n\n1. Long-term companionship is extremely valuable and most of the successful people you meet will have relationships like that. The value that comes from having a partner that compliments your weaknesses, offers different perspectives, and can be there with you through difficulty can't be overstated.\n\n2. People love. If you have ever experienced this, then you know what it's impact is. From what I've seen you write, you haven't experienced love so you won't have the benefit of understanding how it impacts decisions like that.\n\n3. It's clear you don't really value other people outside of what they can offer you. That impacts your understanding of relationships as well.
3	Passion	Hi fellow entjs.\n\nI feel really un-passionate about literally everything at the moment, only really mountain biking and my hobbies are fun. I really want to get into real estate and I may have an interview coming up.\n\nI understand that to have money and success, you need passionate obsession about stuff, I don't know why I don't have any anymore. Can people help me by saying what they are passionate about?\n\nThanks 
2	You could be merely competent. Some of my hobbies are not monetizable. That's nothing to be ashamed of. Just be careful about which hobbies you want to disclose. Mountain biking is a fine activity - keeps you in shape.\n\n> I really want to get into real estate and I may have an interview coming up.\n\nGood. You have a direction. If you end up hating it, you can always look for something else. You have to try something though.\n
2	I am passionate about money and success. I can’t imagine how I’d ever get much of either without the passion for it. It’s hard work. 
2	The only really real passion I have right now is travelling. But that comes from a desperation for some good old fashion escapism. I've been connecting with my inner free spirit who doesn't often get to come out and play - especially in the last year. But now, while I'm on holiday I'm taking advantage of being free for the first time in a really long time. I'm finding a passion, or a lust for life I haven't felt in a very long time.\n\nOtherwise, things that keep me busy are my usual reading (philosophical and psychological concepts), cooking, working out, makeup (also my job) etc. The passion for those come and go, but mostly they're just things I kill time with.\n\nIn the past my ultimate passion was my old job in retail management, but I left just less than a year ago. Life hasn't been the same since because I no longer have the sense of duty or purpose that job gave me. It's like I left a piece of me behind when I left that place.
2	I don't have a rabbit hole passion. I'd say i'm most "passionate" about just living my best life mentally, physically, and spiritually, and being a net positive on society. 
59	Detachment from Ego	Something I've noticed about myself and other ENTJ's is that we tend to view ourselves as vessels that exist to be optimized and made as best as possible in all areas.  I think this leads us to being detached (to an extent) from our opinions and values on a personal level, which is the root of a lot of the stereotypes for ENTJ's.  What a lot of people perceive to be arrogance is really just us voicing opinions that we believe to be empirically correct after lots of research/consideration, not an extension of ego. \n\nFor example, I remember a time years ago in Middle School when a teacher prefaced the Greek myth of Narcissus by semi-joking to the class that the story would really resonate with me.  I was totally shocked and embarrassed by that at the time, as my thought processes were, and still are, not narcissistic in the slightest.   Looking back, my young and untamed assertiveness probably rubbed people the wrong way at times.  \n\nENTJ's are obsessed with self-improvement and making others better (basically striving for maximum efficiency), and I think a lot of the time this gets misconstrued as egotistical behavior.  Generally when we claim to be correct about something, or take a leadership position, it's because we think we're the best option in a particular scenario to maximize outcomes. Contrary to popular belief, I think a lot of us become fairly detached from our egos as we grow and mature.  This is part of why we hardly ever take personal offense to criticism and expect the same from others. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoes this sound accurate to your experiences as ENTJ's? \n\n&#x200B;
28	Finally someone who understands me/this. I couldn't have summarized it better.
8	I can definitely agree with this. In fact, people tend to take it as I think incredibly highly of myself when it’s the other way. I don’t think I’m good enough even though I’ve mastered many things in my life.\n\nOn a separate note, and please let me know what you all think, but something that I find mildly irritating:\n\nWhen ENTJ’s are described with jargon you hear describing computers or machines. I think it’s a little too reductionist of our type. If anything, words that surround self-improvement and ambition are better but not necessarily as they are used in business. More so like in fitness. We improve, adapt, master, overcome. We don’t recalculate, maximize, optimize, or refine. Many ENTJ’s are less emotional and it’s because we view the world as a means to temper what we think is lacking.
9	I have also been fingered as narcissistic and for a time even believed it myself, very good reflection, thanks for sharing!
8	I definitely agree that we are more detached from our egos than people give us credit for. \n\nI always think of the difference between egotism and egoism. Egotism is an overestimation of self, indicating that one isn’t in touch with what is real. Egoism is the pursuit of rational self-interest. \n\nPeople who have deeply self-sacrificial/altruistic values think we overvalue ourselves. To me, they appear like they undervalue themselves. \n \nThe most annoying/offensive thing about being called egotistical is that it implies I’m not in touch with reality, because that’s all I ever strive to be. 
5	> my thought processes were, and still are, not narcissistic in the slightest\n\nTotally this. \n\nIf anything, we are the opposite of narcissists. Narcissists have this deep rooted insecurity, so they adopt a "false persona" they project to the world. The way they perceive the world is filtered through their dysfunctional lens. Narcissists *appear* confident, but being genuinely confident doesn't make you a narcissist.\n\nWhereas as for me, I am strictly objective as my ego doesn't come into it. I understand that everything is relative where you need to read in between the lines rather than black and white, so I can see both the smaller details that build up to the bigger picture. When I come to a conclusion, it's generally right because I have an astute judgement as my perception of the situation is crystal clear and I think systemically rather than filtering it through a presupposed set of biases. \n\nI am completely myself all of the time and I only just recently realised that most people wear "social masks" - that's why I find most people to be inauthentic, but it never occurred to me to be afraid to be who I am or stand up for what I believe in. And I don't mean that in a "let impose myself on you" kind of way to achieve dominance because of a need for control, but kinda like "here's who I am, hopefully you'll like me but if you don't, then I guess it's not meant to be". 
4	This really resonates with me. You summed this up very well. \n\nI'll admit I was taken aback when I read the part about being compared to Narcissus because that's happened to me before. More than once. 🙄 
2	100%!!!
2	Yeah, I think we're put in a tough spot with that infirior Fi and no Si. Theres a poor understanding of emotions and not a lot of importance placed on them, because why do they matter to us? If you ask us something like 'what are you feeling' we say: nothing. Because the answer is so unimportant in our brains that it doesnt regester as one that needs a well thought out answer. So nothing is the least complex and most efficient. Dont worry about it, its not your job, its mine. I also hate it when some of the more tenacious Fi hound me like the fucking canine unit about my percieved emotions. Calling them on the spotlight. Yes I HAVE emotions are you happy? Im not a schizoid robot. Will you see them? If you're nice and know me long enough. Until then the answer will be nothing, and if you KEEP asking.. well lets just say youll get the flaming breath of the dragon
2	I'm the exact same way. I've definitely been constantly misunderstood as being arrogant, when I'm really just trying to get shit done efficiently so we can all move on to something else, not babysit everyone's feelings on the matter. 
2	Wow, this is exactly how I feel.\n\nFor example my friend was taking the LSAT. (Which I have already sat passed and currently in law school) \n\nAnd I automatically got excited he was taking it because joy lies in achievment ( am I right ENTJS! ) and started giving  advice from my experience with it and how I got my first paralegal job. I was excited for him and I wanted to tell him how I discovered the best methods to get a highest score etc \n\nHe thought I was being arrogant got extremely offended and said I was looking down on him ?! It took me at least 40 seconds to calibrate what was happening in that moment. 😂\n\nP.s of course these things must be taking with a grain of salt but he’s 5 years my senior and a ESFP.. 
2	I’m an INTJ and one of my best friends is an ENTJ . We share this is idea that everyone and everything can be optimized and made more effective and efficient. It’s just the way we are and  the way we see things. \n\n\nIt’s a blessing and a curse because on one hand we tend to influence the lives of many people and encourage people to not settle. On the other hand we struggle with nitpicking absolutely everything and everyone including our close relationships. \n\nNTJ’s are a small percentage of the population so we tend be be misunderstood considerably. Our strong intuition and desire to get things done is almost always going to be perceived as arrogance and ego driven mania, by atleast a few people. \n\n\n
5	Yes! That's why I prefer to move forward synergistically as well as strategically.
1	Im an ENTP, and relate fully with this
2	conflict with dear person	hypothesis  \n* she has low Ne  \n* she is tired all the time (priority on hard work)  \n* she gets defensive easy  \n* i want to grow her selfesteem and second our intimacy  \n* she doesnt like writing\n* she expects me to be aggressive  \n* she doesnt ask good questions   \n* we can only chat on IM   \n\n-----\nim usually in good shape, not sure what happened, but i was low on resources and didnt realize it. so i got triggered and abused her with a bad attitude.  \nbottom line is that i need to make a shortcut for those priorities i mentioned above in my head for this interaction instead of letting my defaults kick in. which ok .. needs to happen in a low resources triggered state.  \nmy only plan so far is talk / think enough about it till my intuition takes hold of the idea better.  \nive already settled im ok with giving up arguments logic truth for her selfesteem and our intimacy. meaning im ok with delaying indefinitely a specifici truth that might help her if this is not the right context for it
3	Reads as if you are drugged out of your mind. 
1	What's the name of this game?
1	Please get help. You’ve abused her already bc you were low on resources and you want to “grow” her self esteem. \n\nBoth of you get help. 
20	How private are you as an entj?	I'm pretty private, I love to be around people and make connections but I like to keep everyone at arms length... I think it may be because of my abuse as a child and it doesn't feel healthy, maybe it is and maybe this is the best way.\nI just want my other ENTJ's thoughts on this, thanks 
21	I have a few close friends I’m genuinely almost fully open with, everyone else I keep relatively at a distance. In fact even when I feel like I’m being overly open it seems I’m overestimating that (based on people’s feedback).
13	I like to think of myself as responsible with how I share information. Open but tactful. 
8	Open book.
7	I tend to find extraversion in proportion to how much value/joy I feel might come from the interaction. With my closest friends and girlfriend, for example, I find that I'm almost always the talkative one and I'm highly motivated to continue spending time with them. Business-wise, I find myself very driven to network with individuals whom I think add professional value to my career.\n\nWith everyone outside of this, however, I avoid like the plague.
6	I seem like I am an open book, but I’m not. I am very private. A lot of people seem to easily open up to me though, even when they are known to not be very open.
5	not sure what u mean by private.  \ni am anty privacy. want eeverything made public.  \nbut i dont interact much with people.. as most people are unstimulating  \nim sharing a lot on facebook tho
4	I also like to keep everyone away, but I'd learned to let people in once in a while. That strengthens relationships and is great for building trust and achieving goals. 
5	I'm an open book, don't get me wrong, I just don't maintain close relationships... 
3	For me there's levels to it. \n\nI'm fairly open for the most part with most people unless they come across as blatantly untrustworthy (or unless a situation calls for being more private, such as one of my jobs but that's different than my personal life), but naturally there are certain matters I do keep private except for the people in my inner circle. There are a precious few things I keep entirely to myself. 
3	I'm mostly public, though there's a few personal things I'd never tell anyone.
3	I'm open with a few people whom I absolutely trust, but I don't give all my personal details to everyone. I usually keep my coworkers, and acquaintances, at arm's length because I feel they don't need to know my business. 
2	I need to tell everyone how I feel in order for it to make my day, but only if it's people I'm comfortable with.
2	privacy in what way? I'm private about my passwords. 
2	i’m really unreserved lol 
2	I think I need to be more reserved.  I feel like I share too much!
2	I'm actually really open to my close online friends but irl I'm really not... 
2	It really depends. On superficial things like what I did as a kid/where I studied, or even more heated stuff like my political opinion, I'm very fairly open. But the moment the discussion turns to full out feelings and vulnerability I shut off completely because it feels like weakness to me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt sucks because I realise to most people it makes me look like an arrogant cold female at school. 
2	I like to pretend to tell people a lot but in fact tell them about 5% of my lifestyle so people think they know me well enough and they think I am open but I am one of the most private people in my school. I can pick up on small cues in peoples behaviours because of my tert. Fe\n\n&#x200B;
2	I'm generally pretty private. The majority of people simply aren't that interested in knowing all the details of my life. The people who are, are family and close friends. There is nothing wrong with not putting your business out for God and country to see. Most people genuinely don't care.
2	I'm an open book with some people, then sometimes I'm not.  I tend to be very private, and not tell people my problems.  Then again, I might choose one person to share with, who isn't necessarily my friend, but someone I can keep at arms length to listen and provide feedback, but doesn't know enough about me to provide an actual answer.  With my home, I'm generally very private, unless we host parties.  I don't appreciate people dropping by and almost never invite people to my home just to hang out.  \n\nI flip flop between being completely reserved and sharing too much with random individuals.  It makes me uncomfortable when people know too much about me.    
2	Layers.\n\nI'm more-or-less open about anything because I dont think that me disclosing that information can hurt me in any way, and sometimes it might be a bit much. But mostly it's about the fact that it's not going to hurt me in any way or/and give someone advantage over me.\n\nAnd at the same time, I have another layer where I keep some things very private. I have a couple of close friends who I share this with and discuss.\n\nI also joke a lot and people told me that it's hard to tell when I'm showing my real-self and when not. But ultimately, it's me, a mix of open and closed things with ambiguity thrown at.
3	I am very much an extrovert.
1	Very private. Even private with family. Only 1 person truly knows who I am. 
1	THIS
4	Is this woman an ENTJ?	Has anybody been following the Type Police Series from Youtuber **Talking with Famous People**? Anyway, he typed this one Youtuber female as an ENTJ:\n\n[Type Police! Thais Campos = ENTJ?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dphxs73Zl9M)\n\nHe notes that you might be thinking that she's talking about a lot of Si stuff but what he sees are basic Ni truths. He also notes that you could argue she's ESTJ but her Fe is way too good for that. In other words, she's got polished Fe or polished practiced Fe which is the sort you'd expect to see from an ENTJ. 
3	She seems like an entj, a pretty cute one that is.
3	What does Fe have to do with anything? It occupies the same position in ENTJs and ESTJs. 
6	"I Love You" in less than a month	Is it normal for ENTJs to say 'I love you' when we've only been dating for almost a month?
15	Like many people are saying, it depends on the person. However, ENTJs tend to be really direct about this sort of thing. He probably loves you. It's OK if you're not there yet, but he would likely appreciate it if you were also honest with him about however you feel.
17	It depends on people. MBTI doesn't say everything about a person, far from that. Each individual is unique and MBTI only gives patterns of thoughts-processes.
12	Why does there have to be a time frame to loving someone?\n\nI think an ENTJ definition of love is synonymous with the word care. If we tell you we love you it means we care about you, respect you and will be loyal. In other words you have been approved and you’re in the inner circle. \n\nRemember we love to analyse people and we tend to figure out people very quickly. So obviously you have traits which your ENTJ likes and values. 
4	Maybe they actually feel that way. Or maybe they are saying that because that’s what they think you want to hear.
3	Yes, it is suspicious. Maybe he is putting you on a pedestal. Maybe you dwarf any of the gfs that he had previously. Maybe he is a virgin.\n\nYou are right to worry about "buyer's remorse" ... but the pedestal as well.\n\nThere is no formula to love/life though. It could be legit.\n
3	Funny you ask.  I told my significant other that I loved him the week we started dating...and we are now married six years later and still madly in love!  Who knows?!
2	It depends on the ENTJ and the person they're with. There's no absolutes with matters such as these. \n\nWhat I'm wondering is why you felt the need to ask if this is normal ENTJ behavior or not? Just curious. 
2	I told my husband of 5 years I love you within the first month. Before that, I had been dating guys on and off for a decade and had developed a very good idea of what I wanted in a significant other (or more accurately, a series of things I didn’t want)\n\nYou know when you know. It’s ENTJ to not care about the appearance and just get it off our chest and get on with advancing the relationship. It’s also ENTJ to think it’s better to address it now (to ensure you feel the same way before committing further)... and not consider how that would make you feel if you aren’t ready to return the statement. 
1	If that’s something they want to say, then sure. 
1	i can say it in seconds. ps  \nlove gets lost. its how brains work. its a function of context
5	Confused about an ENTJ	I just made this reddit account to ask this question. I want to know if this is a normal behavior amongst ENTJs. There’s a guy who seems to be interested in me. He hasn’t said anything but makes it very obvious. Small things that he does are sweet and chivalrous, but the things that he says are exactly the opposite of how he acts. For instance, he questions my passion and the career that I want for myself in the future. He asks why I would rather do something that involves physical work that can potentially hurt me. Then he continues by doubting my intelligence and my ability in school. Says things like you’re body has to suffer since your brain can’t do its job. Is it because this specific entj is too cocky? Or is he saying this because he actually cares? \n
13	Guy sounds like kind of a snob. He might still like you, but lack the self awareness to know when he's being an asshole. 
12	You made a reddit account just to ask ENTJ’s if a guy likes you? \n\nAnyway, the guy’s an asshole and that behavior isn’t solely closed off to ENTJ’s. That sounds like a narcissist who’s trying to belittle others.
8	> He asks why I would rather do something that involves physical work that can potentially hurt me\n\nA lot of people people think that an office job that requires a degree is better than a trade/hands on work. It means he is immature and unwilling to diverge from the status quo, because he can't recongise your own individual interests. Seems a little narcissistic.\n\n> doubting my intelligence and my ability in school\n\nHuge red flag. That is extremely toxic behavior. If it's already like this, it's only going to get worse over time. Think about it - he was encouraging you to do non-physical work, then he belittles your intelligence. If he thinks both is true, then that means he doesn't think very much of your potential but more likely, he's probably trying to get you dependent on him so he can have full control over you.\n\nDump him. He might be charming at times, but he isn't an emotionally aware or mature person. And that has nothing to do with being/not being an ENTJ.
3	> He asks why I would rather do something that involves physical work that can potentially hurt me.\n\nHm ... like what? [A firefighter?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WY62Vfxu5g#t=2m55s)\n
3	How old is he? He likes u but damn he needs to mature. And u need to move on.
2	He sounds like a toxic person, I would get away from this guy as fast as possible if I were you. 
2	[deleted]
2	What a rude comment of him to make. Honestly, even if does like you, do you really want to be with someone like that? If I were you, I would move on. Being an ENTJ doesn't mean you cannot be nice, I don't want to lumped in the same category with someone like this.  
4	Sounds narcissistic, and it's lacking a bit of info for me to judge the type he is even if he states that he's ENTJ himself.
1	You're thinking too much about this.  He's toxic and that's why you're seeing inconistencies in what he says vs how he acts.  These are signs to run away.  The few sweet things he does is called, "hoovering," it's a common narcissist strategy to keep their victims on the hook enough to not lose them.
1	idk what his type is but dude sounds like a dick
1	It sounds like he is an asshole. I wouldn't spend any time around someone like that who was constantly tearing me down.
0	He cares, in his own way, but not enough to commit.\n\nSarcasm is the thin veneer that allows an ENTJ to offer caring through criticism. If they don't care at all, they don't bother or stick around, joke or jest, etc.\n\nInferior Fi takes a long time to attach to someone in a committed way of that caliber, as in, a union or 'emotional' relationship. So for now, the game is letting you know they care by offering criticism and being chivalrous and sweet at times they find convenient.  \n\n\n\*I will also amend this to say, if they care to the point of serious commitment, the cruel jesting typically stops and there's more an effort to avoid doing harm that way unless they're frustrated to the point it comes forward in this manner, and it's rooted in caring.   \n
19	Overcoming Bitterness?	How do you all overcome bitterness?\n\nI had a couple of severe personal and professional failures at the end of 2017 and I’m realizing I’m still bitter as fuck about it in 2019. Long story short, my ex boyfriend had been lying and manipulating me for 2 years. AND my boss had been lying and manipulating me, for 2 years, and I almost got fired based on complete lies. I ended up quitting and breaking up with my boyfriend in a span of 2 months. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI think maybe part of my problem is I may have tried too hard to make things work. I think it truly is my worst ENTJ traits in play because I don’t have a “give up” bone in my body and I worked myself ragged. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nNow I see they were insincere all along and I should have seen the signs sooner but I really thought I had it figured out and could handle things. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI feel very, very, stupid for trying so hard at something that never would have worked out anyway because it wasn’t supposed to. I feel very very angry at my old boss and boyfriend for dangling a carrot on a stick that was never meant for me to catch. I feel bitter from being so loyal and having wasted so much time and energy and lost out anyway. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nENTJs what’s your advice on processing this unending bitterness and doing better in the future?
7	The way I tend to look at it is that every experience will somehow or another end up in our Ni (introverted intuition) and affect our perception of the world. I think it’s hard to say if/when you’ll stop thinking about those bad experiences. What’s important is that you get back to doing what you do best. The most ENTJ thing you could do is to find an environment/project that you enjoy and forces you to think positively about the world. Get engaged in life and good emotional experiences will come that will counteract the bad. You’ll drop the bitterness eventually, but it will take time.
8	As someone who also has that “never give up” quality (which causes me to do everything no matter what the personal cost), your post spoke to me. A few years ago I worked in (what I will lightly call) terrible manager related conditions. I stayed on for 1.5 years (no one else had nor has stayed in the position for longer than 6 months) and it took me years to get over it. I was a physical, emotional and mental wreck. \n\nI was also so disappointed in myself (simultaneously) for leaving but also for staying in the position for so long (ENTJ - super hard on ourselves!?).   \n\nWhat I have tried to do is focus entirely on what I gained professionally from the experience (I.e. skills that I did not have going in) but also have viewed it as a lesson in life that I NEEDED to learn. That lesson was that I will never, ever again allow myself to be treated like that, to be more confident in myself and my skills (imposter syndrome, anyone?) and to know that there is a time to walk away and/ or say no and that doesn’t mean failure.  I also learned balance - in that no amount of career and/ or professional success is more important than physical and mental health and well-being. This is a continuous journey for me, because my natural inclination is to push-push-push no matter what. \n\nIt has also made me aware of how I treat others, and to be more measured and more understanding.  In a really weird way, by focusing on those things, that experience has made me a stronger person and (with hindsight) I would not undo it. \n\nI’ve also chosen to feel sympathy for the manager involved - as behavior like that must come from a dark and sad place. \n\nI hope that this helps, good luck for the future!\n\nTLDR: making an active choice everyday and every moment to feel gratitude, sympathy etc as an alternative to bitterness. It is an ongoing battle. 
3	Ah yes. We do love to get bitter don’t we lol. I have to say that as I’ve grown and come to realize that others do not think like I do, and, are, in almost too many ways, governed by emotional hang ups like insecurity, guilt, and pride, I’ve come to resent almost everyone generally, to the point that now, the one person I don’t resent besides myself is my significant other. \n\nWhat I am getting at is this will happen. Especially if your Ni and Te are further to the extreme on the spectrum. You need to take the time to look around in the moment. Distrust others in the moment and ask yourself why they are treating you this way or that, what do they want, and whether they (in business) want you to have what you want (usually not if you both want the same thing).\n\nThe way you get past it is by following Don Draper’s iconic motto, “Keep moving forward.” Another redditor here said how to apply that. Find a positive environment that stimulates you, your interests, and, I’ll add, do NOT depend your enjoyment on the presence, interaction, or contributions of others. It’s on you. Maybe I’m a little too jaded by my experiences with people, but with the brain I have and being around similarly smart people, I’ve learned that people are not what you want in life if you’re looking to be happy. They’re necessary to enjoy a healthy mentality because we are social creatures, but can be limited to as small a faction as one or two on an experiential basis if need be. 
3	I get the same thing and will linger on stuff for years. It's the worst when it is something you don't expect. I had a clearly shady boss who kept bullying me to try and get me to quit, and it didn't bother me because I saw it coming. But more recently a guy who I thought was really nice threw me under the bus at work- and I lost my job, and that's the one that stays with me because I felt more betrayed. 
3	1. change your actions so that those issues can never happen to you again\n\n2. complain about them until you're sick of complaining\n
2	The others have offered good advice. I'll just contribute that it also takes me many years to get over bitterness for any given event, and I acquire new sore points as fast as I get rid of old ones. I'm working on it.\n\nGood luck to you.
2	I can relate to this one, I've been there and right now I am here in my own life circumstances. \n\nAs for how to overcome it, I believe in facing it directly. I make a point to not avoid it or shove it down so it can fester. Not my style. I prefer to deal with it by turning it into something I can actually use. Bitterness is a form of anger, and anger can be a source of raw energy that can be channeled into something new that you want to create/build in your life. \n\nWhen something like this happens to me and I'm in that bitterness I start thinking, "okay, so here I am now, where do I want to go next? What do I want to do next? Because I know that I don't want to remain in this place of bitterness and loss, I want to move forward." I start evaluating what went wrong, what lead up to the situation ending how it did, and I start looking at the lesson(s) being presented because there's always something to be learned from a failure or something else going wrong. I incorporate those lessons into my toolbox so to speak, and then I start looking forward again to my next project, my next goal, and that bitterness ends up transformed into renewed determination to succeed in whatever is next for me in my life. \n\nBitterness can take awhile to fade, it doesn't always happen overnight. I am dealing with a situation that will be resolved as of 16:00 today but I won't lie, the bitterness I'm feeling is probably going to stick around for a bit. I also know though from experience that eventually it does pass. \n\nI wish you all the best in overcoming this, I know you can do it. 
2	That was bad luck.\n\nI recommend some sort of "mental palate cleanser" like pickled ginger is used in-between different types of sushi.\n\nPersonally I'd chill the fuck out for a month or two. I'd discover food and alcohol I have not had before. Training for a marathon and running one might also be on the cards. On the other hand, if you are able to feel the rhythm, then learning to ballroom dance can make you feel quite sexy and wanted.\n\nMeanwhile I would work on processing the negative memories. Once I have nothing else to learn from or worry about I would move on.\n\nThe unexpected change of work can be a good thing. You should not get used to being stuck in the same place. I do not mean moving up necessarily. There is also a danger of losing your job due to poor economy, so a shake-up can be good. It forces you to update the resume and to practice your interview skills.\n\nAs for the personal relationships - I guess you'd have to be more selective next time. It's tough. Perhaps consciously think of the sort of dude you would like to meet and go to places where one might hang out.\n
1	Peggy is most definitely an ENTJ. Lol Matthew Weiner at a round table made that whole show make COMPLETE sense. He is the epitome of ENTJ’s as writers. He basically took over that table at a table full of INTJ, INTP, ISFJ, and INFJ. There was maybe one ENFP in there. It’s on youtube. Search round table matthew weiner, vince gilligan and Andy Sorkin, and you’ll find it. 
1	You cannot control what others do, but you can control what value you put on them. A liar is worth as much as nothing because you never know if they are telling the truth. No accountability, NO respect. See what I mean. Value only what is useful.\n\nPeople who lie to my face and manipulate me are second class in my world. I dont miss them, I dont let them effect my state of mind. They are a lesson learned. No need for useless feelings or distress. 
1	Meditation! 1,000% x 100\n\nI don’t know a more effective method of addressing and resolving mental and emotional states.\n\nAlthough there is a possibility an introvert like myself might take to it with greater ease. No harm in trying it out to see if you get results...
1	Just something I read a couple of days ago on (lol) ThoughtCatalog. \n\n**ENTJ: Forgive yourself for the times when you were not enough.**\n\nThere have been challenges, ENTJ, that even you have failed to rise to. There have been dreams you couldn’t fulfill, loved ones you couldn’t protect and opportunities that you have not cashed in on. Because you were not enough – not smart enough, quick enough or industrious enough, to make them work. And it’s time you forgave yourself for all of it. You are not always going to be the best, ENTJ, even when you are trying your hardest. And it’s okay to accept the innate humanity within that. It’s okay to sometimes let yourself place second.\n\n&#x200B;

1	I've failed at everything I've ever done, but each time I've ended up more successful and better off than when I started. As soon as I stopped looking at the failures as reasons to be upset, and started looking at them as lessons and experiences that made me better and allowed me to improve where I was at in life.\n\nMake a concious effort to focus on the positive lessons learned and see where you've gained. As you do that and focus on more positive friendships you'll find it's easier to put the bitterness behind you.
1	A bit late to this train. Here's my 2 cents:\n\nI'd recommend the two-step method. I call them *impactful events, the ones that you've listed.* If your inferior Fi is becoming hypersensitivity amongst other symptoms, then it may mean that you've under stress for a very long time.\n\n**1. Allow your emotions time and space to** ***air out. (FI)***\n\n* a non-judgmental and supportive space to vent/rant/go on tangents (this is done with someone you trust, close friend/family)\n* experience all of your emotions (so instead of reasoning or rationalizing it away - let it come out)\n* support from others\n\n**2.  Write it down. (TE)**\n\nThis is a *game plan*  for your Te to do. Leave emotions out of it, take a look at it from an objective level.\n\n* What happened?\n* Where did you go wrong?\n* What did you learn?\n* How to prevent it in the future?\n\nThis needs to be incorporated with **who** you want to be too. The point of it is to work with what happened, and to create a plan that will bring you **closer** to you, and not further away by repressing, and dismissing.\n\nForgiveness takes time, sometimes it may be a lifetime.\n\nWhat helps me is to think:  if I become a certain way because of these events - they win. And it motivates my ass into doing something more than resentment.\n\n**Don't let them get a hold of you.**
6	No compromise in love	I am at a stage in my life where I am in the process of building a better future for myself and my future family. I am so focussed that I don't go to parties, clubs etc because I feel that it is a waste of my time.  I refuse to compromise my values for anyone and it has served me well. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI expressed my values to my girlfriend a few months ago and she told me she would be fine with me working hard so long as I tried to make time for her. I did this and it went well for a few weeks, I really fit her into my schedule and spent time with her at odd times during the day whenever I had a free moment.  Now she's demanding more and states that I don't give her the 'intoxicating feeling of love she expects in a relationship' because I don't set up dates spontaneously and call her all the time etc.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can't change her and I think that in time she may get bored and seek something more thrilling because the only way I can give her the relationship she is looking for is if I compromise on my hard work ethic and please her by spending most of my time with her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI do really like this girl but I don't want to comprise on my values as I won't be my true self but rather a version of myself that she wants. I know in the next few years once I am established I will be able to do more things with my girlfriend but at this moment in time I am so fixated on my goal and I do not want to compromise on that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs it time to end it?
17	Well your post title was "no compromise in love" so it seems like you answered your own question. This isn't am mbti thing in my opinion, this is just dating and being a human. You gotta figure it out for yourself. There's no entj cheat code 
4	If the idea of breaking up is on the table, it’s for a reason. Do you.
3	It seems like she wants you to be more of an EXFP. Personally, I find your dynamic unsustainable. You want someone who breathes fire into your soul, not strangles you with restrictions. If you were an ENFP, you'd be thrilled about her requests - but you're not and they sound like a friggin chore. \n\nDon't be that person who wasted their 20s with the "wrong" person, when they could've been experiencing life with someone more compatible. Lots of early thirties break ups are due to ignoring fundamental differences which over time start to wear and crack. Of course, there is a limit to seeking the next "better" thing, but we ENTJs tend to choose our partners too soon imo. Give it time, reflect about what kind of partner you need (not just want), reflect on your deal breakers. Always walk away if your date violates your deal breakers. 
3	if you compromise, you're going to end up resenting her
3	What decision would you advise someone else to make, in this situation?
6	That's a tough one. Maybe open up a conversation with her about all of this and ask her if you guys should end it. If she likes/loves you enough then she'll be willing to compromise more and keep the ball rolling. Always be willing to compromise in a relationship, too though. I know you compromised already, but maybe there are some more creative solutions that can be considered. Maybe try to include her in the things you're doing for self and future improvement. Making her part of that process could be a huge help down the road, potentially. Either way, good luck! 
5	Love is a human construct to explain the tri-connection (mind, body, soul) with another. It takes work to foster love and to ensure it endures. One way of doing that in life is to compromise given our innate human tendencies to stubbornly stick to the status quo. If you’re not willing to compromise, you’re not ready to foster that love further, which means you’re not able to continue loving that other person. Now, she might be demanding a lot more, but if she loves you she would understand your limitations and accept them. If she’s not willing to do that, then she’s not ready to be in the relationship with you either. Regardless of how much you love each other now, if you can’t accept the other and compromise for one another, then you’re stuck. You have three choices: continue on until your love deteriorates while stuck in that limbo of non acceptance and uncompromise, compromise after a long conversation about limitations and expectations, or split now and endure the heartbreak. \n\nNote: Love needs to run its course timely, and to ask it to hibernate while another needs more time for themselves, is to risk it dissipating in its current state. Both members of the relationship must run at the same pace and because love needs to run at a consistent pace to remain alive. The whole “love is patient” quote is for people whom are willing to accept limitations and allow the other to slow the pace of the relationship. Something to think about. \n\nThis is coming from an ENTJ whom has been in a few long term relationships and always worked things out as rationally as possible. But I have to agree with a prior response, this is more a life thing than a MBTI thing. If you as an ENTJ wanted a MBTI-based response from an ENTJ, then you want a response centered around rationalization, hence the above response. 
1	I’m not always one to tell people to find answers by reading books, but in this case I was eerily reminded of a book called Attached by Levine and Heller. I think you both might benefit from it from some of the statements you wrote. 
1	Just focus on what you want and need to do. Let the other things be secondary and just don’t give a fuck.
0	How about a third option: You keep providing for her and you can have her once per week and I will fullfeel her needs the rest of the time. win-win-win
4	What's your strategy when it comes to synergy?	I've been maxing out my efficiency like mad lately using a variety of self-improvement techniques but now I need to scale it up and integrate the proven approach into the larger vision. Thanks.
3	What kind of synergy? 
3	I don't really understand what you're saying here. What is the bigger vision, if not many smaller pieces?
2	It depends on that "larger vision" how you should use the whatever knowledge and those techniques.  Every situation is different and has to be handled in the appropriate way in order to succeed.

32	Anyone Else Frustrated That No One Else Appreciates Your Vision?	I often feel that no matter how educated I am or how well I communicate, people do not take me seriously. I have an MBA and have an entrepreneurial spirit, but other people just want me to be stuck in a 9-5 like everyone else. I don’t know if it’s because I’m a woman, or because I am young (27, so not that young) or what, but I feel like no one believes in me. \n\nI often feel it’s better not to share information with anyone about what I do until I can no longer keep it a secret.\n\nI am wondering if other people with this personality type feel frustrated because no one is on their level when it comes to vision.
15	Results, and execution. It's what ENTJs are good at and why they are often respected. If you create results they will take you seriously, and believe in your vision.\n\nMost people are stuck in the 9-5 thing, and wanting to break that mold is probably more of an entrepreneurial tick than anything. Most entrepreneurs by nature are a little misunderstood anyways until there vision has some traction. \n\n"I am wondering if other people with this personality type feel frustrated because no one is on their level when it comes to vision"\n- Yes, but this is actually just our egos 🤣\n\n
8	> I feel like no one believes in me.\n\nProve them wrong.  Simple as that.\n\n>I often feel it’s better not to share information with anyone about what I do until I can no longer keep it a secret.\n\nThis is almost always the best policy for several reasons.  First, everyone has ideas and hearing about someone's ideas is only one level above hearing about someone's dreams they had last night in terms of boredom.  Also, telling people about ideas gives the teller an endorphin rush akin to telling people about an actual accomplishment...a lot of people get addicted to this (ENTJs are not immune) in lieu of actual accomplishment.  Further, ideas change with more information -- if you tell people about ideas too early in the cycle, when they change, even if they change to something better, they might see you as not executing on what you said you would hurting your credibility.\n\nKeep your goals to yourself until they are done or until that person needs to know.\n\n>I am wondering if other people with this personality type feel frustrated because no one is on their level when it comes to vision.\n\nThis is our curse.  But in other people's defense, the world is full of flakes with plenty of 'vision'.  What separates the wheat from the chaff is execution.\n\nAlso, don't be afraid to put your money where your mouth is.  There is a big difference between 'I have this great business idea and I need your help.  Can you get on board?'  vs  'I have this great business idea and I need your help.  Here's a check.'\n\nAlso, practice compassion.  There are a lot of perfectly good reasons to be 'stuck in the 9-5'.  Perhaps they value their family time over taking a chance at making lots of money (potentially).  Perhaps they like having lots of hobbies so leaving their job at 5 needs to really mean leaving their job at 5.  Perhaps they had a very tumultuous childhood and a steady, decent paycheck seems like heaven. \n\nIf you imagine that they are making different choices than you would make because they are somehow just dumber than you, you are very likely mistaken and that's a lazy way of thinking. \n\nThat goes the other way, too, though.  If they can't imagine your circumstance and think their choices should be your choices, too bad for them.  You have your own circumstances and motivations and they can pound sand.\n\nBut I wouldn't dismiss them so quickly...there's always a nugget of truth to be found.  Perhaps they've heard a lot of talk from you without much visible execution.  Perhaps they see a different path that might lead you to your goal faster (for example, getting industry experience before trying to jump to the top with a mere MBA).  \n\nAt any rate, it boils down to action.    As Steve Martin said 'Be so good, they can't ignore you.'
6	I get I have to earn my chops at work and do the step by step to get anywhere, and I’m cool with that. Corporate work is about the long game not making shortcuts, and making people like you.\n\nWhat I am frustrated with is I feel like when people come to me with their ideas for a business or an investment or whatever I listen and say “this part sounds good but this part needs refining” and try to give good constructively feedback; you know, take them seriously. When the tables are turned, and I come to them, I hear “why don’t you just focus on today” from the same people! Why is it ok for YOU to bounce ideas off me but not the other way around? Seems unfair.
5	Its not easy to pin down why people don't believe in your vision. Maybe its too far fetched for them, maybe you didn't explain whats obvious to you but not obvious to them, maybe its because you're a woman(yes, some people are that backwards), maybe you're simply trying to convince the wrong people. \n\nIts people you're trying to convince. Watch their facial and body expressions. It might help. Or just ask them why they simply don't believe your vision. Some persuasion tactics and concrete statistics and logic may help in convincing people too.\n\nJust my 2 cents
3	I’ve been in a similar rut and likely you’re right about it being age related. I remember one infuriating experience of being told by several managers and senior staff that “you know nothing, this is your first job” - 5 years working in industry, I was the contractor called in to fix the mess. \n\nActions speak louder than words and your worst attempt is better than the best thing you could think up of so if you have the entrepreneurial urge start working towards it everyday. I’ve been wanting to be my own boss for years and in 2019 I’m working towards taking the plunge not much younger than yourself.\n\nYou’re not going to care what those people think when you have millions in the bank doing something you love while they are stuck in the 9-5. Use it as motivation, when you’re told you can’t or you’re too young and prove them all wrong! Be the best! 
3	Consider changing your circle. Hang out with the ambitious, rich and successful. Then execute your plan to achieve your vision. Deliver results. Let success speak.\nNonetheless, please always do a reality check now and then to prevent yourself from being illusional.
3	Yes. And everyone is always surprised when I tell them what I’ve accomplished. Especially since I’m a mom and have little kids, so they assume that I just sit around all day. Except.. I don’t. 
3	I've so been there. I was there a few years ago. I could have written this five years ago. \n\nFor me I had to accept that no matter what, some people aren't going to take me seriously/listen to me/appreciate my vision and ideas/give me the time of day no matter what I do. And you know what? Fuck them, I don't need them, and neither do you. I proved all those people wrong over time, and I believe you can do the same thing as trite as that may sound. \n\nSeveral people who are no longer in my life said I'd never get anywhere and that my ideas would never gain any traction much less bring me any success. Well, I got the last laugh in the end, and more success than I know what to do with at the moment! (things really took off very rapidly for me in the past few years and I'm like OH YEAH THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT!) 
2	I resonate with a lot of what you’re saying. Why does it frustrate you?
2	I've learned to accept that other people will take time to see things the way I do. I felt the same when I was younger, at 22 I said I was not going to do the 9-5, I had a vision. I lived that vision. I made it happen despite what anyone else believed. It didn't matter.   \n\n\nBut.. in the same way that we can see this vision, it is easy to get lost in it and ignore the finer details in what it takes to execute this vision and safeguard it. I've learned through many mistakes and it is easier to help people get on the same page when they can see how you get there. In doing that, also be open to what others might have to say, because their input might actually save your ass if you let them. 
2	Yes I feel you. But from my experience, being able to achieve what you want will slowly look like a 9-5 anyway. The difference being that you are now working with what you would prefer to spend time on. 
2	I'm close to your age, and I feel the frustration. What I've tended to discover with myself is people can't see the bigger picture as easily as you. It's as if you're looking to the horizon with binoculars, and what's out there is clear as day, but the person beside you looking has no binoculars, and maybe their eyesight is a little poor as well.  I think as ENTJ's we sometimes try to steamroll people to trust that things will work("Don't worry we can see what's out there"), instead of taking the time, compassion, and communication to give the other person our binoculars and help them see. Because as ENTJ's, we will set out for the grand horizon, but then trip on the pebble two feet in front of us.
1	> I often feel that no matter how educated I am or how well I communicate,  people do not take me seriously. I have an MBA and have an  entrepreneurial spirit, but other people just want me to be stuck in a  9-5 like everyone else. \n\nIt kinda feels like you're talking about two separate contexts here? Could you give an example?\n\nAt work in the professional arena 27 is still very young, you're not quite a junior yet but you still haven't really spent your time in the trenches, so to speak. If you want the level of respect you desire at your age then you're going to have to knock a few balls out the park first. \n\nIt is true that men have a distinct advantage in the corporate world because they are naturally more assertive, so perhaps the fact that people aren't as keen to follow you on your word is because of that, its up to you if you want to be a battle-axe or if you want to take a more subtle approach to getting your way.\n\nIn the personal arena, most people dont have the entrepreneurial spirit and dont have any interest in continuous improvement. They just dont. And they'll be very quick to shut you down if you mention anything out of the box career wise, because its just not their jam. If you ask the right kinds of people though you'll get more of the response you're after.\n\nBut really, you're gonna have to chug along on your own steam. You cant afford to be waiting for people to believe in you. You got to believe in yourself and others will automatically follow.\n\n> I am wondering if other people with this personality type feel  frustrated because no one is on their level when it comes to vision \n\nYeah, definitely, but you just need to find a better crowd. They're rare but they're out there. \n\n&#x200B;
1	Ha. I think I am the rare person who wants to be super successful but also loves children. I think there is probably a way to make your business flexible enough or keep your schedule strict enough that you could make time for them. And I’d be the mom in this scenario so if I did have a kid I’d be expected to juggle both most likely.
1	Thanks for the motivation! I feel we live in the golden age of opportunity and it’s being wasted by so many people. I want to be free to do my own thing and make my own mistakes, but the world wants you to take the safe route.
1	u clearly need more vision. i suggest neuroscience  \ninterpersonal / softsskills are essential. though u should seek the onres that dont need filters. fellow NTs.  \nmost respond to validationn, and slow pace
1	Yes I hear what you’re saying, thank you for the perspective. I did not mean to imply that a 9-5 is somehow not good: it’s an ideal work environment for a lot of people. There’s huge advantages to having a set schedule and being able to plan your life around those hours.\n\nMy point is only that it doesn’t work for me, but others still think I just “haven’t found the right industry/location/company, etc.” I have a pretty charming personality, but put me into an office cubical and I’m like a caged animal.\n\nAnyways, yes I agree with you. Maybe I come off as being a flake and I should just keep my mouth shut more often. But I’m at a point where I did all the leg work and the research, and now I HAVE to tell people what I’ve been up to even though there’s not much to show for it yet, otherwise it is suspicious why I’m getting so many phone calls and why I’m sneaking off to meetings on the weekends.\n\nI feel like when a man does these things he’s seen as ambitious and a real go getter. When a woman does it she is seen as someone who thinks she is too good for x, y or z. At least that’s how I feel.
1	Like some other people were saying results really matter. As a woman in corporate/STEM fields, we may not be taken seriously but people (rational people) value evidence. It may not be fair but it seems you'll have to invest in something more nearsighted and use the good ol' "Foot in the door phenomenon" so people can trust your more visionary goals. 
1	Talk is cheap
1	Very. When this occurs, I prefer to drag them into a heated debate to convince them or at least help them to see with my eyes.
1	https://chat.whatsapp.com/0hJG0PHR8gO1uN8eOjWUv3
1	Came here to say yes, I feel this all the time - \n\nENFPs are great types to find if you want someone to help you feel ‘seen,’ potential believed in, or just understanding of your vision. 
0	Start your own business. You do not have a lot of time left to start having children though.
8	ENTJ leaders, how would you convince your boss to give you a leadership position?What advice do you have for being a good leader?	ENTJ's who are or have been in positions where you led a team, department or company, how did you get that position and what are some lessons you learned in the process of becoming a leader/leading others?\n\nObviously competence is important but there are plenty are technically strong people who never obtain leaderships positions.\nIt would be helpful to NT's who are not as naturally charismatic as some ENTJs.
11	Earn the role. If you have to convince someone you already work with to give you a leadership role then it's likely you haven't earned it. I'm speaking on very general terms here though.\n\nIn a previous job I applied for the Supervisor role two or three times before I got it. When I was rejected I huffed and puffed and got pissed off wondering how I could get rejected, I'm perfect for it. Little did I know that while I was competent for the job, I needed more practice in leading a team. And more importantly, sometimes when someone rejects you it means they think you're not a fit for their personality. I would rather someone reject me because I don't match their personality than because I'm not competent. There's nothing worse than forcing conflicting personalities to work together.\n\nWhen I finally got the job, I was just offered it - I didn't have to apply or ask, my manager walked up to me and simply just said the position is available and he wants me for it. I earned it through work ethic and personality. My manager had vision but didn't know how to take the leap from vision to action. When he saw my work ethic and how quick I was to take action on implementing solutions, and more than that, how bubbly/positive I was when I needed to be and how I could hit hard on difficult people when I needed to, he offered me a position in his team which no one knew was available until I was offered the job. People in his team were seriously pissed off and treated me like pure shit because I got that position. I laughed it off and got one fired, another transferred and the other demoted. \n\nThere are those who get into those positions without earning it - in that job I convinced two managers to promote of those three people who treated me like shit because it meant that he would have to transfer to another branch and I wouldn't have to see his face every day. The asshat didn't have the balls to lead a fucking sock. I pitied him because he had no direction, nothing to wake up for in the morning, he was half arsing his way through life and couldn't give a shit about his current job. He needed a challenge to rise up to, one that would break him down (in a good way) and give him something to really try damn hard to succeed in. More than anything he just needed something that would break down that god damn ego of his which he built from a lifetime of insecurities. This something would have done exactly that whilst building up a real sense of confidence. Or at least I hoped. It wasn't a miracle cure, but the few times I saw him after that he did seem slightly less pretentious and a little bit more confident in his abilities.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Mistakes are good. Make them. Learn from them. Don't make the same ones twice.\n\n* Play the long game. You're not just there to lead, you're there to learn from every challenge and success.\n\n* Do the things you hate the most more. Master the skill. Learn every aspect of the job. You can't effectively lead a team on tasks you know nothing about. \n\n* You'll learn more from those who make your life difficult than those who give you an easy ride - that includes difficult people in positions above you and below you. By rising up to the challenge and making a success of it, you enable self growth, professional growth, and those who treat you like shit become loyal and gain respect for you. Earned respect holds more value than assumed respect.\n\n* Don't force yourself to become a leader when you can't deal with arseholes. And you will deal with the greatest arseholes who won't trust your judgement, will try to undermine you, will second guess you and attempt to get the weaklings in your team to turn against you.\n\n* It's okay to crumble under pressure, as long as you don't do it in front of your team and you pick yourself back up again. If you crumble under pressure and give up, you're a bit of a shit leader.\n\n* Your team are your work family. Treat them like a professional family. There's days where they're the worst people in the world, but most of the time they're going to be good to you as long as you're good to them. \n\n* Show compassion for the most part. Don't be unjustly cruel. And if you are, don't make a scene of it and don't boast about it. Tell the loud mouth about it, and they'll do the boasting for you. It makes you seem less egotistical.\n\n* Be prepared for the worst case scenarios, then the ones that aren't so bad will be easy piss to deal with.\n\n* Everyone can tell a kiss arse. Don't be that. A kiss arse in a leadership position always becomes the lackey and never the leader in the eyes of those above them.\n\n* You don't just have to prove to those below you that you're a leader, you have to prove it to those above you.\n\n* Have a strong work ethic. "Follow the leader" isn't an overused saying for no reason.\n\nI could go on but I'll stop here.
3	umm just ask? When they ask why, blow them away with competency.
2	I feel like if they need additional convincing, it's not the right fit.
1	I spent years doing the work alone, while the practice grew to the point where I can no longer do it all by myself. My first team member starts later this month.
1	Well, my experience was on a much smaller scale. I was being groomed for a leadership position, but a change in managerial chain caused personal tensions. Therefore, I asked for the promotion point blank. I didn't get it, so I posted two weeks notice then and there. Within a week I got a better paying job. \nA lot of it was luck in finding that new position, but I saw that I wasn't going to move up, so I played the gamble, failed, and succeeded in another manner. 
1	Perform at the level of the job you want, be likable, and get things done.
10	Any ENTJ mucisians?	I'd just like an ENTJ's take on musicianship (practicing, preforming, the role of music in your life)
7	Yes, I'm a musician, it's a hobby. I played in a band a while back but I just play now to decompress. 
6	Violinist of six years!\nI play with my school’s orchestra and chamber orchestra. I practice consistently, an hour and fifteen minutes for Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays, an hour for Fridays, and Mondays are my busy days, so I listen for my part in the car when I’m on the go. \nAs much as I love music and violin, I’d never consider doing it professionally. I like my hobbies out of the workplace and being a violinist honestly doesn’t feel like I could learn new things about people and take charge. 
3	Music was my after school activity while I was growing up, playing violin mainly and doing choir and stuff like that. While I was never dedicated enough to make it into anything beyond a hobby, music is a part of my life, and I will always be, even if I'm just listening to records on my headphones.
3	Playing guitar and singing has been a really big deal in my life. I'm still nowhere near having a musical career, but I'm working on it.
4	Yes! I have played the cello for 15 years and I also sing and act! I also teach private lessons for all string instruments. 
3	I love music. I study to earn enough to play music my way and not have to worry about "making it" in the bussiness. \n\nAs someone who tends to be rather cold towards the world, having a way to express my feelings in a creative way is amazing. I'm borderline obsessive with music. When I wrote my first album I went back and scratched things over and over until they fit. I take musicianship very seriously and can't deal playing with people who don't show the same respect to the art as I do.
3	ENTJ songwriter here, I've been writing for a year and a half. Quite hard to be frank but that's also where it's thrilling.
3	I've been playing the french horn for 6 years!
2	ENTJ professional singer/actor/teaching artist here! 
2	I make sounds I like to hear. If it turns out someone else also likes the sounds I post them onto SoundCloud. Strictly a hobby. 
2	Viola for 5 and it was something i considered professionally but not anymore. I still love it though. Will def continue to play for the rest of my life 
1	Professional musician here. :) 
1	Metalhead here. Play bass, guitar and on vocals.
1	I play as a hobby. Started learning classical guitar when I was in elementary school. 
1	Piano teacher :) it's a fun hobby and a side gig. 
1	Guitar and singing, with and now without a band.
1	It seems to me that many conductors are ENTJs - which makes sense. I enjoy music, and if I found a career in music I would be a conductor.
1	I'm a rapper and lifetime ENTJ.\n\nI treat my music career like a business. I just want to win and be the most famous and efficient everything. Very ENTJ of me.\n\nMy work (especially Raging Ego) might speak to folks on here! https://thelexiconartist.bandcamp.com
6	Big 5 correlation question (Conscientiousness)	Does anyone else who functionally types as ENTJ score low on conscientiousness? Or is this an ENTP signal?
5	No idea about what’s common.\n\nI score really high. Really really high on openness and conscientiousness. Low on agreeableness. 
4	I scored high on everything but neuroticism.
2	I'm not sure, I got high on conscientiousness, back when I took it i found a chart that would translate the big 5 back to MBTI and it gave me ENTJ again. So I don't know what the mix up could be. 
2	I got low conscientiousness, I was in a rush when I filled it out and didn't find the results to be particularly accurate for me. It described me as someone who doesn't like analysis and is very impulsive, neither of which are true. Probably user error.
1	Which test was this for? A non-free one by Jordan Peterson?
2	What test do you find this out on?
17	Monopolizing conversation	Have any of you ever felt like the vast majority of your conversations have been one-sided? I have never had anyone call me out on it yet, but I feel like I'm always the one blathering on about some inane thing, and lately I've been feeling a little self-conscious about it.

5	I usually escape from one sided conversations fast. I'm not one to blather on, and if I do then I'll be aware of it and keep it short and actively involved the other person. I don't like being the only one making any effort and if it seems to me like the person I'm speaking to isn't reciprocating and making an equal effort in the conversation then there's no point of me making any effort. I get bored easily.
5	Good thing you figured it out! Try to listen more than you talk. It will help in so many ways.
4	Honestly, you're right. My therapist stopped working at the clinic I went to a few months back, and I've been meaning to see her again at her new practice. Come to think of it, that's right around the time that I started oversharing. Thank you for bringing me some clarity. 😊
4	Sounds like you need a passive aggressive INTJ coworker who has taken more math classes than you.
7	The last couple of years I have noticed that I monopolize almost every conversation I am around. It’s incredibly hard to realize it in the moment because I am really passionate about a lot of subjects I’ve taken the time to learn about. The truth of the matter is that some people don’t give two shits about what you have to say—they just want to be heard. I mean, I am the prototypical scavenger of information who holds it all in their brain and doesn’t let it go for years at a time. While some may find it interesting, most find it frustrating.  \n\nNote to all ENTJ’s: people don’t like it when you have something to say about everything...\n\nThe lesson in all of this: pay close attention to why the people are having the conversation and if you’re about to go on a long rant, feel the room out first. What do they want from the conversation? Do they want a valid contribution? Do they want your opinion? Your experience? A witty jest? Or just a plain, boring “wow, really?”\nI can’t tell you how many times I’ve feigned ignorance for others amusement. It’s a fucking nightmare when I have to do it because the ENTJ in me is in full force wanting to somehow correct or redirect or even argue with them on something either known to be false, known to be misguided, or known to be more a matter of opinion than fact. \n\nSo, to be short about it, lol, distrust people’s intentions of a full discussion about any one particular thing. And share fully when you know it’s deliberately asked of you. \n
3	I’m actually a quite open person with life situations that I’m no longer emotionally vulnerable about. I feel like talking about it helps make it more impersonal. \n\nMore like a fact that occurred than an emotionally taxing situation. So I guess I can be “oversharing” I that sense. Plus it’s kind of hiding in the open, people are more trusting of others who share vulnerable life stories. 
2	No. I say what needs to be said and not too much more.\n\nIn a non-professional context, I prefer asking the questions and listening. I gain more by listening to others than I do by talking about myself.
2	Yes. They even told me I am overwhelming and intense when I speak so they rather stay silent.  \nReason why I have mostly INTJ friends, they are the only ones who can keep up with my "style" and dare to interrupt me. Maybe the INFJ friends too, but they'd never interrupt and let themselves be dominated in a convo. Little they know what I would absolutely appreciate a little more confidence or whatever they'd call it.
1	The conversation tends to revolve around me because I am usually doing things that are more interesting than others.  I am buiding an art career and promoting free markets with a decent following, so the questions i get from people are endless.  The first time I had lunch with Steve Forbes I felt as though I was talking the whole time (for 3 hours) but we've done this a few times already, so guess im not as boring to him as i may fear.  TLDR: talking a lot is ok as long as you see that your audience is engaged in what you have to say.  Especially if they keep the questions coming.
23	Are You “Politically Savvy”?	I seem to always get tangled in the snare of workplace politics. Mostly because I don’t “play the game” and occasionally suffer from foot in mouth disease. I’m also a tad on the confrontational side; not angry or mean, but I address issues head on. Mostly because I hate passive aggressive people with a passion, and also because I always seem to be the person who notices the mess first and wants to clean it up and straighten it out. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nUnfortunately, passive aggression is a valuable workplace skill, that  all the best players seem to have mastered. I hate it SO much, it’s an inefficient waste of everyone’s time, but it’s a completely necessary skill. I’ve learned a few of the basics like “Never outshine the master”, but I stumble a lot. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nHow do you navigate office politics as an ENTJ? 
12	You're right about this.  I never stoop to their level and use passive aggression, I simply address it head on.  Passive aggressive people will get intimidated by you if you ask them questions about the true meaning of their words and actions. But I understand that it can be a horrible environment to work in.  I see it as a challenge to further develop my intuition.\n\nWhen it comes to outshining the master, you do need to play the game a bit.  There are times when you need to pull your punches and show them you know your place, and there are times when you need to tell them what they dont want to hear.  It all depends on who they are and what the situation is.
9	Humor. It's a step above passive aggression.
8	I have a very good gut instinct for the power dynamics at play and each person's personality and their underlying motivations. But like you, I "don't play the game". I'm very open minded, non judgemental and trusting which has unfortunately burned me before, in my first job. \n\nA female manager decided she didn't like me anymore (presumably because she saw I had strength of character as some of her statements didn't add up, so I asked her to clarify) After that, she slandered my name (saying I looked spaced out and unintelligent) and every single mistake (I didn't make many, especially compared to my coworkers) were written up and blown out of proportion because she was trying to find a justification to fire me. It wasn't just me, but more than half the workers in that office went through the same thing - I think she was insecure and trying to keep everyone under her control through perception management and the threat of being fired if you step out of line.\n\nI'm lucky to have found and moved to a workplace filled with INTJs and ENTJs where straightforwardness is the dominant culture. I love it! As rare as it is, there is something out there for everyone - you just have to look in the right place and be persistent for long enough before you eventually get there.
5	With more practice, yes.\n\nI like real world war games because strategic thinking is play to me. I consider office politics some of the most entertaining war games. It only works if you're in it for the long haul though\n\nThe best way I get the upper hand in the beginning is by staying quiet, getting on with the job, and achieving excellent results. When you're a nobody, power comes through success and achievements.\n\nWith results comes trust from those above you. That results in relationship and network building. Work relationships work like dominoes. If the person/couple of people above you like you, the respect will ripple and those above them will respect you without any effort on your part.\n\nWith relationship building comes learning weaknesses and strengths (mostly weaknesses) faster. There you learn who's really liked and who isn't. Who's the talker, who's the worker. Who's the idiot in a position of power who thinks he has actual power but is worthless and easily replaced.\n\nIn the beginning, the idiot is the enemy you want to rid and replace. If you don't like them, it's likely their management doesn't like them.\n\nGod I miss retail. By going through this process, obsessively reading about military strategy, tactics, Machiavellianism, The Art of War, etc. I became the silent force in my team, getting people like my Area and Regional Managers to make decisions which benefited me, and in turn, the store. I was never in the game for myself, but for my store. When I wanted my Assistant Manager fired, it was because she was ineffective. When the next one proved to be worse I got him demoted because he became a tyrant.\n\nIn the beginning it was a completely different story. I wasn't trusted. I was often belittled, even screamed at by said tyrant. But I eventually got the upper hand and learned to play people at their own game.
3	Passive aggression is not a useful skill. It's a lack of ability to communicate effectively and diplomatically. Almost all of the time it results in miscommunication. Direct and open communication is always best. IDGAF if it hurts feelings, we are adults in a professional setting, grow up.
3	I’m just aggressive aggressive. 🤷🏼‍♀️
3	Play the game a bit, save $, start your own business.\n
1	My colleagues would say I'm a leader and very politically savvy in the workplace. Part of the ENTJ orientation, I think, is understanding situations and people on an intellectual basis, rather than an emotional one, which is well suited to political interactions I think. I understand what people want and can rationally analysize situations in ways that are advantageous for my allies-- or ideally for everyone, as I don't care about "winning" or necessarily how everyone feels in the end, just getting to the goal that I'm seeking.\n\nThat said, I work in an industry (higher education) that prizes rationalism and evidence-based decision-making over personalities and emotion. It's a good fit for people like me, who often end up in leadership roles in academia.
1	Open your own business and you don’t have to play these games or worry about outshining anyone. 
0	What’s your sign?	I’m a Virgo and I’m curious how many differs types of ENTJs are out there. 
26	We're NTs. We don't believe in astrology....
8	Pisces, literally the opposite of virgo.\n\nAm ENTJ and don’t believe in astrology.
4	Virgo Sun, Aries Ascendant.  \n\n\nOther poster can speak for him/herself. I believe in Astrology, and a lot of other woo-woo stuff as a means to help me analyze other people and have a rough guideline as to what to expect. Proven effective for a majority of the time, so I keep with it.   \n\n\nI don't rely on Astrology predictions, though. Too many variables in interpretation.  \n\n\n&#x200B;
3	I’m a Scorpio. Most are surprised by that, but I also don’t believe in astrology 100%
2	Leo sun Leo Moon Sagittarius rising \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm an astrology enthusiast. 
2	Leo and yes I do like to study spiritual stuff too.  \nIt's so much fun to clash my spiritual side with my rational/material one and enjoy this little inner debate.
1	[I'm positive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai4b7j5a_7M)
1	Virgo
1	I too am a Virgo. Seems to be a pattern. 
1	System is somewhat consistent so I’m open to it. Wouldn’t depend on it though. \n\nI’m an Aries sun, Libra rising, and Capricorn moon. 
1	A big danger sign with skulls and toxic symbols 
1	You're not an ENTJ.
1	Also a Virgo! I don’t really\nBelieve in astrology and horoscopes but I do find myself reading them time to time out of boredom/curiosity. I never read too much into it. 
4	Questioning political science vs. comp Sci/ engineering	I find I used to have a major passion for politics and dream of making an impact there one day. Yet in my plan I fee I must learn about computer science and electrical engineering anyone else find it hard to balance these interest or faced a question that led them to making a decision?
6	> major passion for politics\n\nThat's a hobby; you don't need to study it though\n\n> dream of making an impact there one day\n\nPlenty of good politicians are not educated in polisci and come from more concrete disciplines.\n\nPlenty of politicians are lawyers though. Chances are that you won't end up liking politics 10 years from now.\n\nHave a back up plan - study CS / law. In the worst case you can make a killing working as a patent lawyer or something like that. Well, look up what the salaries are.\n
3	I majored in computer/electrical engineering. I landed a great job at a top software company and recently switched to a six figure cloud software consulting gig. I’m 24. I’m not try to brag because I worked hard as fuck to get to where I am. Get the engineering degree. It makes a huge difference to see “Engineer” on a resume versus anything else. After the first job I’ve found to get ahead you need field relevant certifications and people skills, but I would have never had the same opportunities to be where I am so early in life if I wasn’t an engineer 
1	Omg yes!! Although I have that conundrum with Economics/philosophy. Question: why do feel you must learn about computer science/engineering?\n\nAs for me, I will be majoring in comp sci & eng because I genuinely love programming and engineering and all the possibilities they provide.\n\nMy advice would be to take as much electives in political science/ pre-reqs for law school. You can make impacts without being in politics per se for example you can create a non-profit and knowledge gained from your elective classes may help navigate that world. If you happen at some point in your career as engineer you decide, “hey law is really where it’s at for me”. Apply to law school with those pre-reqs. \n\nYou can decide to specialize in Intellectual Property Law to use your engineering background as the technological aspect of law is a bit muddy atm.\n\nSo basically use your passions to make your career as meaningful as you want. \n
1	Think of college as return on investment. How likely will you achieve what you want to achieve by getting pol sci vs engineering for the amount of time and money you are going to put in? This is what I asked myself before college. I chose comp sci and don’t regret it. I listen to political news on the side as a hobby. 
1	You really don't need to major in politics to do politics.  Go for compsci or EE.  Both is a lot.
20	ENTJ + ENTJ Relationship	My partner and I are both ENTJs and plan on attending couples therapy as “preventative maintenance”. We don’t have much to talk about in the way of “problems”, however we understand we have blind spots that may be more salient to a neutral party than to us. \n\nThe (non-anecdotal) consensus seems to be that ENTJ dual relationships result in a lot of competition and headbutting (perhaps we don’t have this problem due to a 7 year age gap).\n\nHave you been in an ENTJ dual relationship? If so, what pitfalls did you encounter and what solutions were applied? 
39	Compete in the bedroom, in the end you both win.
12	Last time I dated an ENTJ like myself, I saw a lot of problems in the “I want to control you” department. It pushed me into full ENTJ mode, so to speak. It’s like anything else, communicate a compromise and stomach the insecurities and pride whenever you can. It’s best to think of it as being a team and taking on the world together rather than using each other as a standard. 
6	Hmm. I find this interesting.   \n\n\nI've always wanted to be in a relationship with another ENTJ, I'd love to have someone who is competitive, but I don't position myself in a place of competing with my partner. It would be more of an 'us against the world' type scenario. I don't think I would be with someone who constantly competes with me, because I love winning. But the way I see it.. two ENTJs in a healthy relationship should want to see each other win and figure out how to best help them get there. That's just my take, though.  \n\n\nHeadbutting is like foreplay to me lol. Love a man who can stand their ground and respect that I'll do the same.  \n\n\nNow to go find an ENTJ to see if my theory is right or if I'm just looking for trouble. Hah.
5	I have dated ENTJ and an ESTJ. Complete tiring fight for power. Did not like it at all. Would not recommend. 
2	Sounds intense
2	I love seeing the substitutes for ENTJ symbolism and the BEAR is often what gets attributed to an ENTJ. Strong, dominant, intelligent, persistent, etc. Recognition of that in other people leads to some understanding that compromises will need to be made somewhere down the line. 
4	How much of your personality do you attribute to your MBTI?	
35	[deleted]
10	It only defines my cognitive attitudes. Not my actions, desires, or whatever.
4	Knowing the description of an ENTJ, how much would you say you fit that description? I don’t believe the MBTI allows us a way to stereotype others—however I do think it helps us to compel ourselves to be patient with others who are different from us. That said, given the information surrounding your MBTI, how much by way of percentage would you say you fit to that
3	I’ve gone through a lot of growing over the past couple years thanks to various experiences over a number of places and my boyfriend who is an ESFJ. I still have the functions of, and identify myself as an ENTJ but I’ve placed so many filters on my thought process and have learned to outline my plans through discipline for maximum efficiency that people have difficulty attempting to type me through my actions and intentions (even if I didn’t ask to be typed). I honestly don’t care what type I am which is why I can say I don’t attribute my personality to MBTI, and I don’t need to fit in the stereotypical box of a certain type. I attribute my MBTI type to my personality. 
2	I think of it as the canvas I paint\nOr as the foundation of my makeup haha\n\n
2	I use the MBTI description of my personality type as a way to assess flaws in my perception that I may just assume are “the way things are”. 
2	I've used the MBTI as a self fulfilling prophecy to actively change my personality. It was easier when I was younger but now I'm getting to the "set in my ways" point, I just wanna stop fighting with myself and start finding some sense of inner peace/acceptance.\n\nThe ENTJ personality was what I needed a couple of years ago, and it's the type that has given me the survival traits I've been lacking but desperately needed for almost a decade. Now those traits are ingrained in my personality, I think I can finally stop depending on the MBTI to tell me who I am. Maybe.
1	I think personality is like an empty chart that you fill in over your life. You’ll have widely different things filling in your chart than others in your type but you’ll start in the same areas. When people reach 85-90% maturity, they’ll have a little in every section, but some areas will be waaaaay more packed with content. (Ex: an ISTJ versus an ENTJ). \n\nThe chart is the cog functions, the order you fill sections in is your mbti, your personality is the details you put in. 
13	How do you guys combat or deal with burnout?	How do you lovely people get yourself back to work after burning out?\nI think I burned out a couple months ago and didn't even realize it. I kept going but now that I've been on break for the past three weeks, I can't seem to get myself to get back to work. I've been working out often and relaxing but I feel exhausted. Three weeks is plenty of rest. Am I lacking discipline or is this a common symptom of burnout?
14	I’ve been getting over my “burn out” recently and I’ve found what works is physical exercise and socializing to the point of exhaustion. \n\nIn the mornings I go to CrossFit, in the afternoons I run a mile with my dogs, in the evenings I usually go out with friends (that can involve group painting, paintball, cooking, videogames, we even played manhunt in a state park recently and the game lasted all Saturday). Any free time I have I’m making plans, reading, or watching Southpark while getting in a few push ups. My body is on an endorphin high a good portion of the day and I feel like I could crush a mountain with my bare hands. 10/10 would recommend and I’m definitely doing this again next burn out. 
11	I combat burnout with new goals and best friends. Not necessarily in that order. I typically get burnt out when either my professional or personal life is unsatisfying. Setting new motivating projects to work on or recharging with my peeps sets me back on course. 
5	I like to completely immerse myself in a different environment.  Visiting and staying in a new place is ideal.  Meeting new people works well, too.  Trying something completely new and fun is the next best thing.  Mixing those is ideal.\n\nThe idea is to not give yourself a chance to fall into any habits, good or bad.  Complete immersion in the new to give you distance and perspective.\n\n
4	Motivational videos helped me a lot in staying motivated when I'm burning out. These kind of videos can make you know that everyone feels tired but those who are successful are those who always move forward. I say try some of those as mental booster.
3	Take a short break and then make the same mistake all over again by overworking myself to death.\n\nThe best way to deal with it is to not let it happen in the first place - moderation and all that jazz. Do that at your own peril. I personally like overworking myself then taking a break then doing it all over again.
2	Find something you are passionate about and do that.\n\nI have a high stress job, that can kill me if I fuck it up and spend 80-100 hours a week at work, so I burned out hard after about 4 years of that. What I found made a huge difference was engaging in my passion for ballroom dancing twice a week, and once every six months going on a two week vacation where literally the entire focus was travelling, hiking, seeing things, and my friends. I've also found that taking time to talk to my close friends, even when they are far away is a good way to stay positive and charged. Ultimately preventative medicine is the best medicine, but the way you prevent it also will recharge your batteries.\n\n\n\nFor you, the passions might be different, but if you find them and spend time doing something you enjoy that makes you feel good, you'll be much happier. It helps to put it into your schedule.
3	Smoke weed dude 
1	I have no advice to give you except to commiserate because I am in the SAME situation! Just got back from winter break and I’m struggling to get back on track because I was so over worked. Glad to see it’s not just me! 
14	My best friend (ENTJ) has largely ignored me since entering a relationship 3 months ago. Advice?	Just for reference I’m an ENFP so I feel... a lot. I just wanted to get some insight from other ENTJs and whether you’ve found yourself in this kind of situation.\n\nSo the two of us are in college together and for the last year or so we’ve been each other’s best friend- like the most important person relationship-wise outside of family, I truly consider her a sister or as we joke, “platonic life partners”. 3 1/2 months ago she got into her first healthy and likely long-term relationship and their SO is actually great and very complementary to her... but- for the last three months she and I hang out like 80-90% less than we used to and she rarely makes an effort to hang out with me unless her SO is unavailable. Also, when she is spending time with me she’s texting her SO about half the time anyway.\n\nHanging out less wasn’t a problem at first-\nI knew it was maybe a case of the honeymoon phase so I wanted to give her space to figure out this new relationship. I didn’t want to give the impression that I was a needy friend or just outright jealous, so I backed off. I just accepted our friendship and our time together would be different now but at this point it feels like it’s slipping away. I’ve talked to some mutual friends and they agree that my friend’s relationship is pretty much all-consuming to the point where other relationships don’t even cross her mind. It’s not just feeling/being ignored, I feel so taken for granted. Like I was just a step for personal connections until she found a romantic one. \n\nI just don’t know what to do. I feel like she thinks I don’t care for their relationship, but really, I just want my friend back in some capacity. I’ve tried to broach the issue on a small scale but the problem is, it’s only an issue to me. I know she’s in love and her spending most of her time with her SO is not an issue to her or she just rationalizes that she never sees her. Also, I’m her closest friend by a country mile so none of her other friends are in my position. \n\nChiefly, I want her to be happy. But, I can’t invest in a friendship this deep without more from her. \n\nI mostly just want to know if any of y’all have found yourself in this spot before? How do your long term romantic relationships affect your closest friendships? How should I approach her about this issue? Just general other advice or self-anecdotes? \n\n  
14	I tend to do the same as your friend...and, generally, I'm not the best at maintaining relationships.  But I am also the type that can pick up a relationship years later like a gap never happened.\n\nBut, for me, all it takes is a gentle reminder that relationships need maintenance as far as most people are concerned.  That's usually enough for a priority reshuffling and making time.\n\nSo, invite your friend to do something and have that chat.  Unfortunately, you might have to re-remind them every once in a while but the first mention should get you a bit closer than you used to be for at least a little while.
8	I haven’t been in a strong relationship before so I doubt I’ll be a lot of help in describing why she’s becoming this way.\n\nPerhaps reminding her of why your relationship was so important in the first place will help. People usually say it’s cold but I tend to choose my small volume of relationships according to how valuable they are. I love my friends and family because they help me maintain my “human” side; my love of art, music, and the humanities, morality and continuous self growth, innocence and compassion yada yada yada. Find something you both loved to do in the past and plan it with her more often. \n\nWith the matters of getting more friend time with her saying “I need my friend back” is too ambiguous. A better strategy would be to ask her about her schedule and find an availabilities in it for both of you. \n\nSaying something like “I would like to FaceTime with you 30 mins every weekend” or “We should have brunch once every two weeks to catch up” would sound better. It doesn’t even have to be cyclical; ask her when next she’ll be open and plan something for then, preferably 1-2 weeks ahead of time. \n\nENTJs (I included) prefer exposing a problem and having a solution for it as well. It may not be as spontaneous as you want but at least you tried to do something about it. That’s all you can really ever do, anything else outside your control will sort itself out. 
10	They are in the honeymoonphase. Try to Get closer to some other friends. Your ENTJ will probably want to spend more time with you eventually. 
5	Unfortunately. The best thing to do is to be happy for her and respect her new relationship. If you come at her being needy, she will probably think you are jealous or trying to ruin her happiness. 3 1/2 months is just the begging of the honeymoon phase. Friends come and go. She will eventually come back closer to you, just give her space
4	My ENTJ friend does this when he gets into a relationship. It's unhealthy but it's him. He married a wonderful woman almost two years ago. They ended up in counseling and he is now trying to spread his time out in more healthy ways. Don't give up on your friend. Still text and all of that stuff. They might come around or the relationship will end because it's unhealthy, either way they are still wonderful people. 
3	I feel for you sooo much. My best friend is an ENFP girl, and she just started to see apromising guy. I really don't want to lose our close bond, but I just know that an SO is more important... don't think that she took you for granted, that's a horrible bad thought. Just try to tell how you feel.\n\nHonestly, just wait. Wait for a bit. Part of being a best friend is also understanding that you now might need a step back. But it will most likely pass. Do not think bad thoughts. I know how bad it must feel, but Aim up. Live for yourself, support your friend and aim for the best. :)
5	ENTJs are notoriously bad at putting themselves into other people's shoes until they experience the same thing. This leads them to be dismissive or assume they understand even when they have no idea how it feels. I'm not telling you to abandon or ignore her but use it as an opportunity to make new friends or pick up a new hobby now that you have more space in your life. She may be great but there are other great people out there, you will be alright without her. Good luck!
2	Tell her you miss her. Ask her to plan a day with you. Start by planning it clumsily yourself and then your friend won't be able to resist jumping in.\n\nThis is normal honeymoon phase stuff, though. I wouldn't take it too personally. I recommend you use it as a chance to get to know other people a little better.\n\nMy ENFP friend complained that she's not "special" to me. She complained that because I have so many friends that I care about, that means I don't care about her?? Those things don't follow imo but maybe the problem is that you feel less special to her? But that's how it will be with extroverts, most of us have a giant friend circle. 
2	On the other end, I remember after I started dating my entj a few months in, a couple of his friends were saying similar things to him. In my case, it evened out over time. While it wasn't quite like it was before, he started hanging out with them again a few times a month and sometimes it became group hangouts between all of us. (Ironically his best friend was also an enfp and we became close too.)\n\nThe fact that they're in nearly constant communication is not a good sign though. She should be present for your one-on-one time, no matter how long she's been in her relationship. An occasional text is fine but half the time? So rude, also looks a little codependent. And who knows, it's possible she doesn't have 'use' for you anymore and the friendship will fade away, but I wouldn't assume because this is pretty typical. Happened in my case, evened out over time, you can still be the best friend - but don't expect to have center stage in her life if this relationship is really working for her.
2	ENTJ’s tend to go H.A.M. when they find someone they genuinely find interesting and normally that’s someone they choose to date. While this is true of a lot of ENTJ’s, it’s not explained by an ENTJ-explanation. There’s more at work there. Length of time spent alone prior to the relationship, mental stimulation, lack of spiritual connection, sex, novel emotional outlets, possible manipulation or attempt to control, instability in a settled lifestyle, or more. \n\nAs an ENTJ, answering from an ENTJ perspective only, the issue is complete and utterly uninterrupted attention and dedication to something new and beneficial that the ENTJ wishes to better by spending more time. Mature ENTJ’s will also pause to reflect and if that’s happened they’ll have a very astute reason for the distancing of others—which can range between disinterest in the person to inconvenience to put more effort than usual into the relationship with other friends and their initiate relationship. If she’s the one that used to head over to you or had to be the one that had to speak to you to set up hang outs or initiate conversations, you’re going to have to put in that work she’s not able to contribute anymore due to this new intimate relationship. Otherwise, she’ll see you as disinterested in doing the work she’s been always doing because she cared, and for\nyou to not take that initiative is a signal to her that you don’t care as much as she did, and so it’s better to just let you hang dry. \n\nSo, if you’re not putting in the work to keep the friendship consistent with the way it once was within reason given this new partner, then it’s that. Otherwise, any of the reasons mentioned above could be a factor.
2	She may just be putting time into her relationship. ENTJs contrary to a common perception are very romantic and sincere. And im guessing that since its been 3 months they are intending to be with him for the long haul. Just let your friend progress in life and wish them the best. She will still probably do anything for you if you are courteous to her space and desires.
2	I tend to focus heavily on one thing at a time and when I've been in a relationship with someone I was really attracted to and compatible with I wanted to spend a lot of time with them. I've always made it a point to try and focus on maintaining my friendships as well.\n\nI would talk to her and say that you feel like the friendship is being neglected because when you hang out she is always texting and busy and it seems like she doesn't actually want to spend time with you. Then suggest that when you hang out that you guys spend less time on your phone. \n\nIf she values the friendship, you should see some results there.
2	It is natural.
-5	Get even at her. Find your own bf. Should be easy. Attend a men's rights movement on campus or something or come listen to Ben Shapiro.\n\nEdit: I checked your profile. You know, the fact that you are bi is relevant here.\n

11	Intuition/ Gut feeling help	How do I know when my intuition/gut feeling is genuine or fear based  as I am in the middle of making an important decision and I can't tell. 
14	Follow the facts.
9	There are time where I just know. There's no logical explanation to it but I literally just know how a situation will play out. In recent years, I have decided to take note of times that my intuition has made me feel some type of way and how the situation played out. I have been right in many cases. I don't get those gut feelings very often so when they do come along I pay attention to them. 
7	Do you wake up the next day and the day after and still feel the same way? Then it's genuine, don't ignore it
3	Intuition is making leaps of judgement based on the facts and evidence you have gathered (sometimes subliminally) over the course of time. You know what’s going to happen because you’ve got a non linear queue of evidence and experiences that’s is allowing you to make your decisions. \nAn ENTJ is great at adapting and making decisions on the fly as a result of your co-pilot function Ni (introverted intuition). \nThe ENTJ leading function is Te (extroverted thinking). \nIf you’re unsure about your decision making based on Ni, use your leading function, Te to talk it out with someone. \nFor example, I lead a team of 6 and I generally go talk to them about a decision I want to make to flush out the ideas before we put whatever action into motion. \nThere are a lot of instances where I need to make decisions on the fly and don’t have the chance to talk to my team, so this is where Ni comes in. \n\nI’ve spent a lot of time listening to Personality Hacker (podcast) and I can’t recommend it more! They explain everything I said above much more eloquently. You should check it out. 
3	Fear: Fight, Flight, or Freeze.\n\nSo, if your gut is telling you to fight something, tear it down, and be destructive without a creation aspect it is likely fear.  \n\nIf it is telling you to run away and 'away' means just that -- running to some unknown and not toward something specific -- then it is likely fear.\n\nIf it is telling you to wait.  But why?  Who knows, but its safer to just do nothing...that is probably fear.\n\nIf, however, it is telling you to create, to move to something specific or to take positive action then it is likely reasonable or 'genuine' intuition as opposed to an unreasonable fear response.\n\nThat said...fear isn't always unreasonable (though, in the modern world it generally is).  If something's not going to kill you or put you at great risk you can almost always recover if you find you've made a mistake.
2	When paired with a more than adequate level of intelligence, your intuition will lead you to the right answer a little more than 80 percent of the time. You’ll have a demon in your head that asks you to question yourself or check the facts, that’s your “imposter” function that appears because we want to be right before we speak more than we care to actually speak. 
3	My intuition is 80% accurate at best. Magnus Carlsen, the current World Chess Champion & the highest ranked chess player in the world somehow "knows" what the right move is almost right away, but sometimes takes several minutes to verify that his intuition is correct. Time is generally a precious commodity for chess players.\n\nSo as Ronald Reagan said: trust but verify.\n\nYou could also consult the appropriate competent people online.\n
1	Fear will exist in your inferior function Fi.  Use Te to build a systematic approach and rationale through what exists in the facts and thoughts of others - especially those whom the decision will impact.  Especially if you’ve already resolved to yourself and have taken personal responsibility what you might like to do.\n\nDiscussion will help move the scales out of your hand and onto (arguably) more objective middle ground.
1	its irrelevant what ur intuition is, focus on gains > results.  or rather  rationalizing the situation well
1	Often times its your brain recognizing patterns or logic that you aren't consciously tracking.\n\nI find that I can see a pattern or follow logic that supports the intuition if I start focusing on it. If you aren't sure, write it out, then ask someone who isn't invested in it to look over your assessment to see if they think it's accurate.
5	Interact with 23 year old intp brain	I Was sent here from another dimension with orders to distract you from your goals and show you the light\n\nedit: 2nd self-aware comment to show I'm cool\n\nedit 2: 3th meta self-aware comment to show how cool it is to be meta aware of meta awareness to the nth degree to the nth exponent
7	Man you guys are nerds xD :D What sort of interaction/insights are you looking for?
3	The view from that far above is an unnecessarily lonely existence. Use with caution.
3	It’s a pretty open question. I just happen to know two intps closely and one is often insecure whereas the other is often downright arrogant and I’m mostly opening the subject with you to see if I can get a hint :D that said, if you have a different topic you’d prefer - I’m here.
2	This is why I love my INTP girlfriend. We get weird because we’re smart as fuck. And it’s fun. 
3	Do you believe in evolutionary psychology? I have found that I can manipulate people very easily if I apply it to how people will react to my behavior. I don't manipulate people unless they deserve it or as self defense.
3	You should be slaying pussy instead of this.
10	What did/do you study?	What did/do you study in college or university?\n\nI’ve gotten the impression that most ENTJs are more into STEM than anything else, but personally I do the best in humanities and am thinking about studying politics. 
12	Sociology and Data Analytics
12	I started out as a biology major but then quickly realized the error of my ways and switched over to what I was drawn to as a child, philosophy. I think that it’s a stereotype that ENTJ‘s prefer STEM courses or careers. I think many of them like to play with language and would be drawn to humanities because they would get to the underlying causes of things and yet still provide a phenomenological explanation of how it fits into the over arcing scheme of the world. Philosophy really helped me learn how to critically think and to look beyond the surface level information that’s readily presented to us. I personally don’t know where I would be in life if I didn’t have philosophy. 
8	I was always best at humanities (history, English, etc). I hated stuff I had to memorize because I understood nothing and had no idea what the memorization had to do with thinking (sciences, math). Then I took calculus senior year, which is basically just an intro logic-of-math. It clicked, and I realized I wasn't qualitative over quantitative, and I was actually very good at quantitative stuff, I just wasn't suited for memorization.\n\nNow I'm a big quant guy, although I'm pretty good about not getting distracted by the details like most of my peers. 
7	Computer Science and mathematics
4	I studied finance but liked anything that had to do with numbers and analysis. If I had to do it again I might’ve done actuarial science. \n\nEveryone is different though and a lot of people study what they study for utilitarian reasons. 
5	Finance major (and degree) with economics/politics/law electives on the side.
6	Public Policy, so politics, sociology, economics, and law. \n\nPolitics is *interesting*, but you need to think about why you're spending money for this degree and what you're going to do with it for a career. I have a specific paid gov't internship that I want, with a clearly defined trajectory from there. A lot of politics majors leave university and don't work in politics because they didn't have much of a plan.\n\nFigure out the job you want and work backwards from there.
4	I’m a dietitian. Studied Human Nutrition and Food Science but started as an art major 
4	Early childhood education but I work in telecommunications lol
5	Human Communication, planning to go into Media. Ended up connected to the STEM fields and love it.
5	Computer Science, hate it, backup career.. I trade currencies and hope to make it full time before graduating \n
4	Even though I loved the humanities in high school and was fairly good at them, I found nothing fascinated me as much as biology and chemistry. Graduated from med school this year, the fascination lasted throughout the entire (quite torturing) process. 
5	International relations and literature, now in law school. Never cared much for STEM. 
6	Business - Information Systems 
3	Information & communication technology 
3	I’m in college right now and will try to major in Computer Engineering. If I don’t meet the requirements I’ll major in Applied Math. \n\nIf you’re thinking about studying politics then do so. I’d once entertained the thought of majoring in philosophy and I might still minor in it. Humanities are enjoyable too but I NEED to be creative in a practical way so which is what led me to find love in math/physical sciences.\n\nFigure out what your end goal is first and set the blueprint for getting there first if you are going to major in politics (I’m guessing you mean political science).
2	Psychology and sociology
2	Architectural Engineering 
2	English and then Photography. As for my career - Agile Coach.
2	I'm a history professor but with interdisciplinary training...piles of course work in history, environmental studies, law, theology, economics, political science, geography, etc.  I actually know a lot more ENTJs that are in the humanities and social science than STEM (by far) but my sample is almost entirely college faculty so is skewed.
2	I studied anthropology in college and did some research while I was at it. I also got a minor in linguistics, but that's mostly because I fulfilled the requirements by accident. 
2	Undergrad: Commerce (Management)\n\nPostgrad: Medicine\n\n\*yes a non-science premed is possible just extremely rare and non traditional - exactly how I fancy it
2	Political Science ->Law
2	LAW, boi.
2	I'm currently study economic Psychology and I enjoy it so far  (I'm only in my first semester). \nI can decide later if i want to go to human ressource Management (I hate job Interviews, but I think I will enjoy it when I'm the one who asks the question :D) or  market Research. \nNext semester I'll have math. Yeah 
2	I doubled in political science and philosophy in college, realized after the LSAT I didn't want to do law school, so I did the corporate thing for a while, then I joined the Navy and studied Electrical, Mechanical Engineering and computers for my job. My preference is still working with people, because to me people are more complex and interesting systems, there is just a lot of bullshit to be found in the humanities that I didn't enjoy eg. stuff that doesn't line up with reality and the like. The only thing enjoyable about the engineering side of things I do is WHAT it is and when I get to troubleshoot and solve problems. I hate the mundane routine that is a lot of my STEM experience. \n\nOut of all of it, studying history and philosophy was what was most useful to me across the board in every career.
1	I study physics. I have an associate's in general sciences and am working on my bachelor's. I was going to switch to mechanical engineering, but that would potentially add an extra year on to my studies, because I'm very close to the getting bachelor's in physics already, so I said fuck it and stuck with the physics. \n\nI was also considering anthropology, but the professors at my University informed me that it's a field that's not easy to get jobs in. So I do take linguistics classes on the side and other sociology classes just because I like them a lot. 
1	I double majored in economics and graphic design. A tad bit counter-intuitive, although under the pretense of wanting to be an art director or a gallery curator, it's actually not a bad combo.\n\nUnfortunately, I learned that a lot of design clients and designers themselves get on my nerves...
1	I'm getting a PhD in molecular biology.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPost-PhD plan is to make a killing in industry; there's a place I know where a friend of mine makes $250k a year doing essentially what I do.
1	American Sign Language Interpreting (BS) and Communication & Media Tech (MA)
1	I study film. Was in medical school but I dropped out because I got fairly bored. I think most mbti-enthusiasts I know think it's rather weird to see an ENTJ in an art school but I guess what they fail to realise is that in film there's a whole hierarchy of rankings (which of course I usually make sure I'm at, or close to, the top of)
6	Are there any ENTJs who are also hopeless romantics? Or is that not in your nature	
16	I was just told by my INTJ bf that I am the least romantic person he has ever dated, and I have been told that by every single man I have ever dated.\n\nHonestly, I would like to improve on this. I feel like people need it, and it’s something I should put more of an effort into. Unfortunately it makes me feel awkward and uncomfortable. Any tips would be great.
14	My romantic ideas are basically thinking about our future together. What kind of parents are we going to be, and hopefully growing old together. I used to love grand gestures, but as I get older I realise that's not as important as good old fashioned contentment. Secretly I like poetry and romantic song lyrics, but I would never share that.
9	I'm secretly a hopeless romantic but I'll never ever admit it IRL.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPretty sure however that there's a difference between entertaining the perfect romance in your head and actually being romantic; quite certain most will never admit to the former (despite this being a pretty much 99.9999% anonymous forum) but I'm also quite certain that 99.9999% of us suck at the latter. It may potentially be a reason why so many of us fancy INFPs
7	Yes and no. It's a weird combination of romanticism and cynicism. 
3	I'm probably in that category. I rarely fall in love. But when I do, I'm 200% in. I feel like I'd be ready to take a bullet for her. But when I'm in love, I get unproductive and gets me on nerve so I usually rush thing cause I'd rather get flushed than be on the wait. Which is why I'm still single, but oh well. I guess I'll eventually meet someone who's able to know what they want and don't need weeks or uncertainties to decides. 
3	Only during winter and I think it's because I get stuck inside and starved for human connection. Thus a lot of biological processes compel me. Also less vitamin D.\n\nBut those are just [excuses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qooWnw5rEcI) : )
3	I am! I have tested as an ENTJ a few times but there are areas in which I cannot relate one of which relationships.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel like if I am really into someone, I am more of an ENFJ. It's VERY important to me that their feelings are taken into consideration and that I do things that pleasing to them as well. I mean, it's not just about me in the relationship after all. Seeing them happy literally makes me happy and I would go out of my way to make sure they stay that way. 
2	There’s a point in the relationship where a switch flips up and the romance kicks to high gear. Usually planning out future stuff and non-sexual touch
2	The way in which my romantic side manifests is that I am a remarkably sexual woman, and very dominant and assertive about it.\n\nThe INFJ and INTP men love me.
2	I wouldn't consider myself to be a "hopeless romantic", as I don't spend most of my time fantasizing about "the one", nor do I develop feelings for people quickly. I'm really slow to enter relationships, because it takes me a bit of time to overcome the "feelings are irrational and I need to focus on myself" attitude, but once I get to a certain point I'm invested and do what I can to make my relationship succeed with my partner.\n\nI have two categories, people I seriously consider investing in and they become a part of my long-term plan, and people I simply have sex with because I have needs. There is no in-between and hardly do I ever meet people who are a serious consideration.
1	Me 
1	I used to be like this but now I'm the exact opposite, so I guess it's a perfectly normal way for an ENTJ to be, even though I'm not like that any more.
1	I'm a huge hopeless romantic, I will save a memento from our first date until the relationship ends, write love letters, do little things to show I care because I'm very sentimental. It's not something most ENTJ's show, probably because we don't want to appear weak and vulnerable, but it is there. \n\nI've learned from experience, that most women don't seem to want the romantic gestures until later in the relationship when they are worried about commitment. I usually repress the urge to do more than hold doors, remember things she tells me, and pay for the date (usually something under $10) until its a more serious relationship. At the end of the day that makes sense as well, because I'm not wasting time and energy on someone who isn't serious about the relationship.\n\nI think most people are casual in their use of the word love and by extension are more cavalier about the expression of it.
1	I am the most unromantic woman you’ll meet!\n\nI think when I’m considering getting into a relationship with someone it really depends on if I can vibe with their personality. I tend to be fiends with them first before I date them because I need to see their personality over a long period of time. I’ve gotten burned by dating someone I didn’t previously know for long and mistaking their personality during the courting period as their true personality. I don’t choose my partners based on looks or “love at first sight” or anything like that.
1	I'm a hopeless romantic in the sense where I do hope to find a happy long-lasting relationship. In fact, the earlier I can marry the better for me. But I'm also just not the most outwardly romantic person. The moment a relationship stops making sense for me I tend to just call it quits.
10	What are you passionate about?	
15	I was about to write alot, then i just felt like I don’t really care. Depression symptoms are creeping up on me lately.\n\nIf I felt good I would probably say: cats, sports, learning, looking outside of the norm, veganism, definitions and educating yourself before you run your mouth on a complex topic.
13	Exposing Hollywood pedophiles and the inter-dimensional lizards who are hell-bent on reducing the global human population and keeping the planet and its resources all to themselves.\n\nAlso I'd like to invent something cool that did not exist before.\n
8	Learning.
7	helping this shit world 
8	Giving creative people the opportunity to create to their heart’s content in financially sustainable ways. 
4	Vegetarianism, cooking, card games, video games, music (both listening and performing) and general well-being/self improvement.
3	being a net positive on society
7	Clean energy, helping disabled people be 100%+ mobile with robotics and augmentation.
3	Animals, especially exotic pets.
3	Becoming the best me and self improvement 
3	I own my own business. It helps kids and my local area. Ideally, that.
2	Learning, writing, fulfilling my potential, feminism, philosophy, music, politics, animals, sports, reading and tea. 
2	Using my skills and knowledge to climb up the corporate ladder 
2	Learning and teaching; helping; reading; eating. Spending time with my kids doing all of those things together. 
2	- Educating children early on personal financial literacy. A teaching mix of Sir Ken Robinson and Ray Dalio.\n\n- Health\n- Meditation\n- Investing\n- Learning random things\n- Spending time with people important to me
2	Music
2	Helping those that can't help themselves. I'm currently a youth worker primarily working with teenagers with mental health issues because I feel I need to compensate for their shitty upbringing and give them someone positive and sincere to look up to.
1	Learning math, science, and Chinese. I also enjoy arguing about music. 
1	Medicine, dogs, social/economic systems, clean energy generation, self-sufficiency/homesteading, combat sports, guns with just a little bit of world domination sprinkled on top
1	capital flows
1	Writing, learning, and movies.
2	Opinion on women (ok, men too) who share nude photos of themselves on Reddit?	If you need to be fully honest, please create a throwaway account.\nDon't ask me to link to those sub-reddits. There are plenty and a quick search would reveal it. Most posters make sure to hide the face.\n\nIn my estimation most posters are not earning money from it; it is just a hobby - something that they like and perhaps even need to do.\n\nSo, would you post / comment? Why or why not?\n\nWould you date someone like that? Why or why not?\n\nWould you help taking pictures / videos? Would you swing together?\n\nThanks.\n
10	I personally would never do it, it could be used against me in the future especially in our current society. However if it’s something they enjoy doing and they’re not hurting anyone, what’s my business?\n\nAnyone who participated in the subreddit is doing it because they enjoy whatever the hell is happening. \n\nIf I were to date someone and realized they did that, I would understand their rationale behind it. If it’s something like exhibitionism as a kink then I wouldn’t really care as long as they weren’t doing it while dating me. \n\nIf I thought it was because they were seeking validation, they probably seek validation in other aspects of life. I don’t like that, it’s a dealbreaker. 
7	I'm a woman but I find voyeurism and fishing for compliments pathetic and gross. If the person owns it then I'm more amendable and if they're doing it for money, more power to them, but needing a lot of external approval isn't attractive to me. Selfies in general are a turn off. 
3	Degenerates that belong on a cross.
2	[deleted]
2	I wouldn't post them to Reddit nor seek them out, just not my thing.\n\nSure I'd date someone who'd shared nudes in the past, I wouldn't date someone who was currently doing it though - it's indicative of a need for validation from strangers. \n\nHard no to taking photos, it sounds lame. *Unless* we were into BDSM and it was something they got off on, then maybe. Maybe to swinging, again depends on the dynamic. The only problem I have with humiliation and objectification, is that I genuinely lose respect for submissive people over time. I could definitely do it with someone I wasn't in love with for a bit of fun though.
2	I don't really understand it, but I'm not opposed to it either. It just seems kind of irrelevant to me to judge a person's character based on pictures that don't hurt anybody. 
8	How do you process feelings	Do you suppress feelings, and then act on logic \n\nOr do you genuinely feel and act through logic 
18	Feeling emerges > I ask myself "what is this and where did it come from?" > I continue about my business as usual and by the end of the day I have a few viable answers.\n\nWhat I do next depends on the feeling and the answer.
10	I take a moment to myself to figure out the following things \n\n1. What am I feeling? Sometimes that alone can even be tricky, but once I figure it out it helps.\n\n2. Why am I feeling this way? \n\n3. Can I change the situation? \n   If no to 3 then I normally take a few minutes to let frustration/anger/sadness wash over me then try to move on with whatever I’m doing. It’s important to feel those things when necessary!! 
4	 Keep them in check, then write whatever’s going on down in my journal.
2	I identify the feeling and try to understand where it's coming from. Then I accept it and continue to do whatever it is I'm doing. 
2	First: is the feeling good or bad? Good feelings can be appreciated while I’m doing other things. Bad feelings have to be explored down to their origin and I also want to know if I’m projecting a past fear or lack onto the current feeling. \n\nFor example, this weekend my husband was very dismissive about things I value (objects) and I realized that by explaining their worth to him - and being dismissed as unimportant (he later donated the items despite me asking him not to) I felt as though I was explaining my OWN worth to someone - and being brushed off.\n\nTo go further back, it made me think that I absolutely hate being in relationships where I have to prove myself. Where I go from there, I don’t know, but at least I was able to continuously work backwards to get to the root of the feeling. 
2	Up until recently, I had been letting feelings pile up until the end of the day, to sort through one at a time. This is not very efficient, but letting feelings affect my daily activities has been less efficient. \n\nI have been practicing interweaving some of my feelings into my interactions with those close to me. It has been very helpful for processing, especially because the feeler types in my family can give some good advice. \n\nI have also been practicing just sitting with a feeling, if I have the time. Not dismissing it, suppressing it, delegating it or analyzing it. I give it my attention, acknowledge what it is and sit with it. This can be very interesting with the especially positive feelings. 
0	Scenario 1: what's this feeling? > is it worth feeling > no > move on.\n\nScenario 2: what's this feeling? > is it worth feeling? > yes > be very careful with feeling the feeling, don't let it go out of your control\n\nScenario 3: DANGER! DANGER! WHY AM I SO HAPPY?! TURN IT OFF! TURN IT OFF!
2	ENTJ or INTP (or any other personality)	 \n\nHi guys,\n\nso I've been studying MBTI and Jungian psychology for a while now and I'm stuck, since I can't determinate if I'm an INTP or INFP or any other type. I'm 17 years old guy, it that helps.\n\n* I'm pretty sure of the Ne-Si and I think that maybe I have stronger Si, in other words, I'm pretty nostalgic. It's one of the things, that makes me cry, besides relationships and really deep movies. I can recreate an older experience, or the feeling I got from it (mostly recreating dates with my ex in my head). Also under stress, or when I have to come up with a solution in a short time my mind switches to "come on! what have worked in the past? Think!". But at the same time I like change.\n* I tend to be idealistic, I have this dream in my mind, that sometime in future, everything will work out, and I'll have a stable job and a lovely family and it's a goal I want to accomplish. I've been told that I attract the most "autistic"(meant as an insult, not a diagnosis), flawed people around. Also, for idealism, for example, I like my school, my job, my boss and his attitude (he's a phlegmatic to heart), even though they have their flaws, I'm okay with them. And people around me constantly b\*tch about those things. Like yes, I too sometimes like to complain, but most of the time my mind is like "if you've chosen to do this, please suffer in silence". For example one night my friend from school was constatly complaining about our school and teachers, even those that are really great, and I didn't have any problem saying with a cold expression on my face, that if she cant handle it, she should quit and go study tailoring, but if she wants to do this, then she should just shut up and let it be. She was offended by it, very unexpectedly.\n* I hate overly emotional people that tend to cry after every slightest insult. Then I have the urge to apologize, and I dont like that. Also I cant stand people, who really forcefully try to be funny, but they just ain't. I cant stand them. And also stubborn close-minded people.\n* I'm pretty short-tempered, especially, when somebody micro-manages me, or speaks againts my way of doing things. I tend to explode, but I use to cool down in pretty short time and sometimes even regret it. Sometimes, when somebody really grinds my gears, I tend to explode and say every reason why he's horrible and stupid. Sometimes I do it I regret that, sometimes I do, I'm proud of it, but it happens like once every 2 years or so.\n* I've been told, that I have the ability to make people talk about things, that really matter for them, even complete strangers crack opened in front of me, but then I dont know how to emotionally support them, I'm not empathetic. Most of the time, if they open up while messaging, I tend to write a really long message, covered in beautiful words, that offers a solution. But when they come to me again and again and again with the same exact problem, I dont have anything new to say to them, because my last solution is, in my view, still great.\n* But this applies only when Im dealing with other people's feelings. When I deal with mine I tend to be an emotional mess. I've found out that writing poems and essays about the person tends to really help me, and when I've shown them to my friends, they didn't believe that I have written that, because in their eyes it was really great and romantic and stuff like that.\n* I'm a really romantic person and I think it's because in my early teen years, my mother forced me to watch romantic movies with her every weekend, until I started to enjoy it. And my soul animal is probably a crying teenage girl.\n* I tend to go out of my way to help others most of the time. I even remember learning how to control a completely new program, while I was going to town to meet my friends, and at the same time explaining how to control it to my other friend on my phone, since she couldn't understand it (and use google properly for that matter, but it doesnt matter, I liked to offer her help)\n* I've been told that Im overly critical about other people, but cant handle critisism myself, but I dont think thats true.\n* Sometimes people ask me why I'm so negative, but most of the time, Im just discussing every possibility, and they've just heard the most horrible one. I call it realism.\n* I tend to brag about things.\n* I'm a meme-lover, day-dreamer, tend to miss details in the physical world around me and value alone time as much as time spend with others and have tend to not miss social gatherings.\n* I'm perfectionist, highly critical towards myself, and always have been straight-A student, because learning came always natural for me. I also don't have any problem cheating on the test in order to get the best results, even though I see cheating just as a backup plan.\n* I can't hide any of my emotions, when I'm flirting I'm the last person that realizes it and I dont have any problem opening up to a complete stranger.\n* I'm either talkative and expressive as hell (which happens most of the time, especially around my friends) or I'm reserved and quiet.\n* I'm accidentaly rude to authorities and waitresses.\n* I can seem to be pretty insensitive. For example, when I was on a school trip to Auschwitz, after the tour, most of the people were moved and silent. But me? I was deciding what Im going to eat, while I was thinking about every innapropriate joke about jews. Yeah, I was moved too, and the things nazis have done were horrible, but my reaction to deal with serious topics, unless its talking about relationship, is to make fun of them. I think of it as some sort of defense mechanism.\n* Most of the time I have a problem keeping secrets. I either dont realize it was a secret and even if I do and I really try to keep it, it somehow slips out of my mouth in some cue.\n* When I start explaining something, I use my whole body to do it. I'm a visual thinker, my mind tends to thing about everything: concepts, math problems, etc. in images, and using my hands helps me to describe it.\n* I like to be the grey mouse, in clothing, in music style (for example I have a "socially-acceptable" playlist, to which I don't listen to) and in many other different things and I want to be liked.\n* When I want to buy new cloth, I tend to sends pictures of it to my friends in order for them to choose what suits me the best, since I cant decide this myself.\n* I have this friend of mine, that's like the complete opposite of me in his opinions, and we use to argue about everything and that's probably the thing, that our friendship is built on. Most of the time it's really fun, but when we go on a week trip together somewhere, at the end of it, when Im really tired, I tend to shout on him something like "why cant u just be normal" when he still tries to disagree on everything. He is somewhat used to it and accepts it. I sometimes say a ridiculous idea to him, that we start to discussing it, which goes like me: \*says idea\* ... yes, but....yes, but...yes, but...fine, you are right. And because of that some people make fun of me, since they think that I agree with him on everything.\n* I dont have problem meeting new people. I tend to fit everywhere and nowhere at the same time, but I really wouldn't say that I'm popular. In new groups, I use to find someone, to whom Ill be his companion. Most of the time its somebody, who made the first move, since I'm somehow too shy for that and its something I want to change about myself.\n* I somehow have the ability to synchronize with person. For example, even though me and my best friend are not the same, we have the same though proceses, same taste in woman and design. We didnt have that before and our attitudes are completely different. We are in a bromance, I think.\n* I know a heck lot of people, but my circle of friends is really, really small. I dont burn the bridges with other people, I just forget to maintain them. My thought process is like "okay, so because u havent contacted me in the first place, I dont want to bother you."\n* I'm the extrovert of the introverts and the introvert of the extroverts. If I have the feeling, that my point of view will be listened too, I dont have any problem expressing it or lead the conversation, and most of the time I'm the loudest one around. But when I'm in a different setting of people, I can be really quiet, tend to just sit and listen to them for hours at a time, without saying much.\n* Im judgemental about people even though I dont want to, but most of the time I create my opinion about somebody (like hes a musician, hes a technician and that person is a sportsman) from just looking at them or speaking to them for few minutes. Im wrong sometimes, but Im right most of the time. I thought most people do this, but then I found out, that for some, it isnt natural at all.\n* I feel like I'm a walking contradiction. I'm working as a swimming instructor, love playing violin, writes poems, love technology, is good at maths, loves fantasy and video games, love talking about relationships (some friends of my make fun of this and say that Im a woman, because there are "sparks inside my eyes" every time someone starts discussing relationships), works with design and our schools yearbook, newly like psychology (I was obsessivly researching about it for past two months) and I kinda want to see how it all works out.\n* I'm really good with kids, and I have been working with them for past 4 years. I would probably study pedagogy, but in my country that job is poorly paid, so I'm going to study informatics, because much better paid and I like it and understand it.\n* With everything I do, I tend to have a all-or-nothing attitude. For example I either binge-watch a TV series, or don't watch it at all. For me, to start something, most of the time, I need to have the mood to finish it right here and there, or I won't even start\n* I really suck at arguing, since I tend to speak before I think and then somehow contradict myself in every other sentence and cant back my opinions, which in my view contradicts with this ENTP sterotype. And arguing with my ex was like saying a statement, then apologizing for it. I was like a puppy. Until I got really mad about her and cut her out of my life. I still have feelings for her, but in order to secure myself, I just dont want her in my life at all.\n* I'm indecisive and second-guess all my choices and its the other reason, why some of my friends say that Im a woman\n* Most of the time in order to fully understand something, I tend to study about it, understand it with my own logic, then discuss it with somebody in order for my logic to be fixed by the other person's point of view.\n* I don't think of myself as creative. When I paint, I like to capture reality or re-paint, copy, someone else's work. I dont come up with new ways and methods to do something. Most of the time, when Im presented to a system I tend to augment it in my own way that I thing is the best, but it really isnt a new way, just slightly different. And when I come with something like this, I always stick to it. For example, I used to submit a laboratory report (describing the experiment) every month, and I used to do it in the exaxt same way - the method, font, etc for three years.\n* I use to create my own routine and way of doing things and I somehow like it this way. For example Im eating the same musli with milk for breakfast for past 6 years or I created my own way of teaching kids swimming, augmenting things I've learned on a course, and I think that its pretty routine work now, but it still isnt, cause every kid does different set of mistakes and u have to adjust it to them. Like the scheme is pretty much the same, or the exercices, but u still adjust it and correct different mistakes on every child. I most of the time tend to be strict, in order for kids to improve, but I dont have any problem playing stupid games with them and actually enjoy it.\n* I think that Im a bad person, full of flaws, but I kinda like it, since at least my life is interesting this way. Also I want to fix them.\n* I've been tested for ADHD, since our school psychologist thought I have it, but negatively\n* I have written this in one session\n\nI would really apreciate your help, because I can easily manipulate most of the MBTI test, so I cant trust them, and on the 16personalities test, which is completely wrong in my view, because it measures the letters, not cognitive functions. I've got 50% on almost every letter. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese are my results if that helps in some way or the other:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMBTI test:\n\n* E/I depends on mood, with preference for I, most of the time, around 60%\n* N over S 80%\n* T over F at around 50-55%\n* P over J at around 60-65%. When I 've first done MBTI test I've scored highly on J, because I always keep a mental schedule inside my head and like to plan some things ahead. But I've realized that when I plan something, most of the time I fail misserably to actuay follow the plan, also have no problem spontaneously adjust my schedule and hate detail-planned trips.\n\nCognitive Functions test\n\n* Ne and Si, pretty sure about them, Ne being stronger than Si\n* Te preference\n* The Fe/Fi is slightly complicated. I think that I have just under developed Fi, since I'm still in my teenage years, but on things that I have an opinion, I have a pretty strong one.\n\nThanks for your help, I apreciate, if you have read everything I had written.\n\nSorry for my english
5	You seems to be an ENTP. ENTPs are known to be the most introverted extroverted. You thinking of many possibilities indicate Ne dom. You eating the same food for breakfast for many years sounds a lot like inferior Si. So you are right with being Ne and Si user. As for your emotions it seems that you have Fe as your third function. Thinking visually in your head seems to be Ni. Writing this in one setting seems to also be an ENTP trait (found somewhere that ENTP tends to start things at perfect time and do the whole thing in one setting).Not winning arguments does not immediately disqualify you as an ENTP because there might be some other factors involved (ex. your knowledge on the topic). I could be wrong though and I'm happy to hear other's opinion on this topic.
4	Dude this is way too much information for you to be a Te user much less an Ni user. \n\nI don’t need the details. Summarize in like 3-5 paragraphs. \n\nI did skim over some of your points though and I can already pin point Fe usage. If I said something I knew was factual and it hurt someone’s feelings, I’d only do it more. \n\nYou also show high Ne so I’d go with ENTP over INTP. 
3	I'm an INTP and this is like reading my mental diary from 11 years ago when I was your age. You're an INTP bud.
40	Can't seem to have quality female friendships as an ENTJ female?	I am really lonely, and do have great guy friendships and a marriage to an INTJ, but something is missing from my picture. Quality female friendships without feeling like complete total crap because of the drama they pull or the girls just straight up being catty. If I made a mistake (even small) it's like hell, I get gossiped about, and really all I want is to just avoid that. Am I really just that different than most females? I feel like there is more to life than just how my skirt looks or hearing about "how awful" my personality is even though I literally don't say really anything. Seriously is there something I am missing?
21	About 60% of women type as xSFx.  They will make you want to rip your eyes out.  xSFx and xNTx do not mix well.\n\nSeek out NF/NT ladies, maybe ST ladies.  They are around.  They're generally a bit quirkier (or, in the case of ST ladies, they will seem like she-bros) and you'll know it when you've found one.\n\nI'm a straight woman.  My best female friend is an ENFJ.  We get on like fire.  When her social smoothness and eloquence and my incisiveness and straightforwardness (and our charisma and intelligence) combine, we move mountains.
10	wanna be friends OP?
11	Get an ENTP. Funny and with a lot of ideas. Not judgmental. And appreciating your driven personality. \nMe ENTP. Best friends INFJ and ENTJ. 
10	I think that we true ENTJ females are fairly rare and I also find it hard to maintain multiple fellow female relationships but the few I have are very strong. My male boss once commented that I “thought like a man” which I don’t really agree with but could see why he felt that way. Don’t put pressure on yourself to have friendships other than those that come naturally. Reach out and try to meet other feeling females halfway,  but don’t feel like you’re anything less than for not having a “squad”. You are you and you are special and rare and unique. Your real true friends will appreciate that about you. 
9	As a female INTP, I can relate so much. We're both "masculine types," so naturally we have a difficult time fitting in with most women. I personally am more awkward like a dude, and I strongly dislike gossip/drama. I find it illogical and pointless.  I'm in high school at the moment, so I have to deal with this nonsense frequently. \n\nMost of my friends are guys. Just know you aren't alone in this, and there are other women dealing with the same issue. It's certainly not just an ENTJ problem.
8	It may just take you a little while to find your people. It gets easier in late 20s-30s when people tend to cut the bullshit and appreciate the no nonsense vibe that ENTJs put off all the more.  Just be you, put yourself out there, meet people, be open, and you will find them. NF ladies tend to be great mediators for new friendships, btw.  Idealists care about things that matter, and with maturity, tend to surround themselves with good people.
6	that‘s most SF females you‘re talking about. try out befriending NF or NT females, i believe it will be a totally different experience. or actually ST females make gread friends too. no offense but everything but SF females
6	another entj girl here. my closest friends are an infj, an enfp and an intp. i agree with u/itspeoplethatihate \- you have nothing in common with xsfjs, stack or function wise, so there is no opportunity for give or take - what you might give to each other is often untranslatable, and what you might take from each other is usually not mutually valued. there are xsfxs i am reasonably close with, but there is always a barrier, and it's not worth my time or effort to break it down. with the infj and enfp i have common functions, but also counterpoints, and with the intp, we share similar ideals, but opposing conceptions of what reaching them entails. i find all 3 of these friendships really enriching, and i am confident that you will be able to find something similar. (edit - typo)
5	I don't think this has anything to do with your MBTI. I have two good ENTJ female friends and both have great relationships with other women. 
5	I understand your concerns. Can you define genuine for me? From your own subjective perspective. \n\nI inadvertently actually end up connecting with men more. I can drink with them. I can speak to them. I can present an idea to them and for numerous reasons, they don’t fall prey to the many traps built for women. But perhaps, that’s because of the societal expectations and actions that they either expect, or don’t expect women to have. It’s such bullshit, women have to exist within a narrow framework of norms or assumed ways of behavior. I think that’s why you have such a difficult time making friends with women. They don’t question much and so many of them will just fall into the basic territory. It’s not that men are more special than women, it’s just that women are conditioned to be this way and it’s infuriating to see and experience. 
4	Befriend an ENTP female.
4	I can completely understand what you’re saying. \n\nMany ENTJ traits are considered “masculine” and are not always viewed as positive traits in females. I often find my straight forwardness and honesty (and well, sometimes bluntness) make other females run in the other direction. I have also been told a few times by female friends that they viewed me as intimidating when they first met me. This may be happening to you as well and you don’t even realize it. \n\nI do try and make sure people know I’m friendlier than I look by always saying hello first and sincerely complimenting them (I like your blouse, I liked your presentation, I liked that piece you wrote, etc. etc.) and that seems to soften them towards me. \n\nI do think the key to friendships is recognizing the strengths of your friends and also where their limitations are. My ESFP girlfriend is always down for some serious fun, but I know I’m not going to be able to talk Politics with her, it’s just not her thing. My INTJ girlfriend is great to have career development conversations with and go to places together like science museums/art exhibits, but she’s literally the last person in the world I’d drag to a bar with me. My ENFJ/ESFJ girlfriends are great go-to people for relationship/social advice, but I’m not going to ask them what stocks they are currently investing in.\n\nMaking friends at any age is hard and we all have experienced rejection. I consider myself to be pretty confident and have a thick skin, but even I had a teary moment recently when some potential Mom friends invited me out on a play date. I got excited because I don’t have a lot of girlfriends with children. After the play date I left thinking  we all hit it off, but after trying to friend them on social media and sending texts, they totally dodged me.  I was so bummed, but I also realize I shouldn’t let rejection stop me from putting my authentic self out there. \n\n
3	Be willing to give them grace for being sf. Then, seek out women in sales, stem fields, or entrepreneurial fields. Find women who go hard and care a lot. Find women who will snark back, motivate you, encourage you.  \nWhether or not it's MBTI related or not, those are the types of women a self identified ENTJ tends to want, and those are the women who leave cattiness behind and just get shit done. There's lots of us out here, you just gotta invest!  
3	female ENTJ here. we can be pen pals. My best friend/roomie is an INTP. She’s also not very girl-ish. we have meaningful discussions and laugh about weird shit. living with here is sometimes hard but i love her.  find yourself an intp! 
4	This is pretty much the same issue that I have with being friends with women as well. I don’t enjoy talking about the same superficial nonsense that they do and since I am blunt and have esoteric interests, any action I take gets perceived to be the go ahead to talk shit and make assumptions. It seems like they put on the social act and enjoy being catty, gossiping, having very instant gratification based interests and enjoy being incompetent. I don’t enjoy any of that and I don’t particularly care for superficial conversation. But I’m also aware that small talk is sometimes the way to get to the deeper underlying questions so I always find myself in a conundrum. I don’t get along with the xSFx types and they are the most common I believe. It used to bother me a lot more, but now I really don’t give a fuck. I’d rather be alone and stimulate my mind then pander to people who will never interest me in the long run. I’ve actually managed to break off a few friendships this past year because they were so unfulfilling and convenient. The female friend that I really got along with in the past was an ENFJ. Not only did she really balance me out but she really helped me learn plenty of new topics and showed me the emotional perspective of events. The chemistry that her and I had was immaculate so now I always screen who I am even going to bother giving my number out to. \n\nI’m sorry you have difficulty making friends with women. I imagine it does get lonely. I hate admitting that but I do feel it every once in a while. 
2	Istp female here. Miss my entj female friend. She was awesome. I was her “therapist” (her words, gave her good advice, apparently) and she got me out of the house. \n\nEveryone thought she was overbearing and pushy with her views but idk. No one can really make me do something I don’t want to do and deep down entjs for all their “pushiness” are just expressing themselves. They don’t actually expect people to do what they say, do they? Haha. \n\nI could see how we are supposed to be a good “match” if she were male, I’d be about it. 
2	I tend to stick to ENFP or INFP friendships w females :) they just work best for me.
2	I’m in the same boat so hi lol 
2	ENTJ woman here with close female friendships. I don't think it has to do with your MBTI.
1	I feel the same way right now. All my friends are SFs or NFs
1	ENFJ is a great girl best friend type for an ENTJ. \n\nAlso - haven’t had a chance to read through all your comments but I can completely relate with this! 
3	Opinion Question	For the group, if you’re significant other cheats on you... would you rather find out they were drinking or find out they were sober? Explain your reasoning either way. \n\nEdit: Let’s assuming you’re ending things. What would make it easier for you to process? Personally, I’d be more offended if the cheating happened while sober. My ego couldn’t take it. 
21	I'd rather find out when they're moving out.\n\nDrunk actions are sober thoughts.
12	I would rather find out they were... No... Wait... Don't care.  You're dead to me.
10	Drinking is no excuse for cheating. Don’t kid yourself.
5	I would be more hurt if done while sober. But I would lose all respect for them if done while drunk, because that tells me they are a helpless baby who cant control themselves. And by that point I wouldn't care enough to be hurt.
3	Cheating regardless of reason calls for instant break up/divorce
3	well cheating is pretty natural, dont really think there is a lot wrong with it as long as your honest about it and it is just fysical. so yeah it would not matter, you guys have to not get so emotional about these things. 
1	I think monogamy is unrealistic, so I expect cheating in my relationships. I've been in open relationships and would do again 10/10, but my boyfriend is opposed. So we will see, it's not going to come up this early in a relationship anyways.
1	If they were drinking. I don't really care so much about drunken hookups so long as my partner is honest about it after the fact and we've spoken about it beforehand. Lying and sneaking around is a no, being one of multiple is a no. 
6	Am I an ENTJ?	Hi guys, I want to know if I typed myself correctly as an ENTJ. I will keep this short and simple. Also I'm a highschool student (might be a useful information). I love to be the leader. I like to study lots of things in the same time but if I doesn't seem to be learning it fast enough I can be impatient and find another way to learn it quicker or just drop it completely (only to start learning again when I have time). I do talk to people nicely when I try to tell them what to do and if they don't I will just do it myself instead rather than forcing them ( cause they're probably gonna do it badly anyway lol). I joke a lot and is usually relaxed but prefer to be doing something all the time (usually reading or video games). I do have a goal but I can't really describe into a physical form but I can just feel that I am working towards it. Any help will be very appreciated.
8	I think one of the most defining qualities of ENTJs is the want of efficiency. I believe that's I bug reason why we take up leadership roles in day to day life is because we feel that things are not running efficiently, so we take the lead to try and make things more efficient. I believe this is also the reason we seam to get impatient easily. If someone is doing something or saying something inefficiently, we get impatient.
3	You should really ask yourself why you like to be the leader. Do you do it for leading the way for a more efficient and concrete way? or to be able to create the right plan to execute? do you do it because you want to lead for the right cause? \n\nI think ENTJ is defined way beyond just wanting to lead. There are many types that also likes to take leadership roles. The why they take it what matters.\n\nWhy do you get impatient? do you think this impatience is a product of your need to bring stuff to the external world? How do you feel about getting into abstracts ideas for long periods of time with no useful reward (something beyond "just for the sake of knowledge")\n\n&#x200B;
5	Take a Briggs Meyer test and get back to us.  I mean that is the true definition of what MBTI you are. \nJust asking this question usually would indicate you're not.
2	I'm a female ENTJ and I never got tests to type me correctly when I was younger. Because of the tests, I initially thought I was an ENFJ (I am not a Fe user). I studied a lot of stuff about types and I started to type my friends, family, and exes. Tests are pretty inaccurate, especially when assessing a male F or a female T, ime. Because society pressures us women to be Fs and men to be Ts, we often use a mental filter to screen ourselves. \n\nOP, I really like [this description of ENTJ children.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.personalitycafe.com/entj-articles/15174-development-entj-children.html%3famp=1) This was eerily similar to me as a kid, even down to the type of art I liked to make (huge, and on the wall). \n\nWe ENTJs can be moral, warm, and personable. The descriptions on websites are often simplified from books and therefore lack detail/nuance. For instance, we have a reputation for an erratic temper - but it makes sense to us when we're mad because we're connecting unique patterns. Other people just might not be able to see those patterns - and then label us as having an erratic/explosive temper. 
2	You sound a lot like an ENTJ. Do a test.\n\nAn ENTJ's confidence is built around achieving things and just knowing it will work somehow. At the same time our biggest problem is the feeling of not being good enough. That's why most of us are impatient, and hate wasting time because we want to achieve our goals. We rarely know when to stop and just relax, and so this is why we might think others are not as interested or passionate about things as much as we are, thus taking the leading role since no one else will fit it well (according to us). If you feel the same way here then you're probably ENTJ.
1	You’ll want to control when things aren’t efficient. You’ll want to be successful especially if it’s a challenge. You’ll want to drown out the voices of stupid people whenever possible or just not listen to them altogether. You’ll be impatient, but act patient on the surface (took me a while to get there lol). You’ll hold yourself to a very high standard and expect people to do the same for themselves. 
-1	I used [16personalities.com](https://16personalities.com) in the company of someone who knows me intimately well to correct any biases along the way; give it a shot!
-1	I am an ENTJ and what you describe sounds like it, too. Find an online Meyers-Briggs to be sure
2	Get Entj all the time when I take this test... friend who is an enthusiast of the test says I don’t have this personality type but I keep getting it on different platforms and quizzes?	I did start a bunch of groups and stuff in college and high school... like math and business and science but I like music too..? Whatever I guess lol 
4	If you don’t care then move along. If you do care then read more on cognitive functions for clarity. 
17	How to care for your ENTJ: Inspired by other MBTI subs	Many of the other MBTI subs have “How to care for...” articles for their respective types.\n\nMy first thought was “*Care?! We don’t need your stinkin’ care*”, but as I’ve grown I’ve realized we desperately need the influence of other types to avoid becoming  total a-holes. \n\n**So... As an ENTJ, what are some ways you’ve been well cared for?**\n\nFor me, my INFP partner is the real yin to my yang and while we are utter aliens to one-another, it’s good to live alongside one’s (almost) total opposite. She’s constantly caring for me by putting things in a more human context, and helping check my default assumptions and preferences.
32	I sometimes need to be gently talked down like a spooked mare. Hair stroking and hushing a bonus.
13	Maintain your own health so I don’t have to. It’s easier to take care of myself if I don’t have to spend as much time taking care of you.
21	I honestly need someone to ask how I'm doing once in a while. I listen to everyone else's problems and I suffer in silence with my struggles. 
9	Talk straight. Even (especially) if it's to say unpleasant things. Of course it doesn't mean unleash yourself from any form of politeness. Just go to the point.
7	Loyalty and the ability to listen to us and our ideas. If you do that, trust me; we will never let you go lol
15	Honest feedback
10	First one that came to my head: tell me when I’m being unreasonable or even an asshole.\n\nI swear I don’t do it on purpose and it just ‘makes sense’ in my head but my SO needs to tell me sometimes. 
3	ENTJ women in particular need to have it communicated to them (and sincerely - he has to actually mean it) by a male partner, if it is a heterosexual relationship, that said male partner will not try to hold more than 50% of the control and power in the relationship and that they want a genuinely equal relationship, and that said male partner supports and encourages and loves them for their ambitions and desires and goals.  (ENTJ men: take only your 50% of the control and power.)\n\nBecause we live in a society that is still so biased against powerful women.
4	I need someone to completely deemphasize work and success and let me be silly, relaxed, and take the lead in the relationship. 
3	I spend a lot of time worrying about how I interrupted someone during a conversation or railroaded a discussion with my loud opinion. I spent a good chunk of my 20s feeling like I am an obnoxious person. So a partner who provides positive feedback combined with constructive criticism has really made me flourish.
1	I feel like we’re going to have a hard time parsing out what we need from others.
2	How do I feel less egocentric?	I feel superior than most people morally, and intellectually. NOT ALL JUST MOST. I once had white hot lividness towards people for all of the horrible shit they cause or didn't help prevent. I got older, and the only thing that calmed me down was considering them as children. I just see, so many things that could be changed, and it just doesn't happen or it takes 20 years. It boggles my mind. \n\nIf I am wrong feel free to enlighten me. \n\nI don't want to be superior than most people, but I just feel like I am. Just like I think I have 2 legs.\n\nAn example is most people don't know how to have a conversation about anything serious without freaking out irrationally. Even if I tolerate them freaking out they don't even want to get better afterwards. If someone can finally have a conversation with me \nI either have to dumb myself down or they contradict themselves often, and their logical points are pathetic. Very rarely do I ever converse someone that can actually make sense even if I disagree with them that's fine, but at least make good logical arguments.\n\n"Darth Debate you aren't smarter than most people, and you need to learn some respect" If I am not smarter than most people why do people contradict themselves all the time? If you don't see people contradicting themselves I don't really know what to say that isn't rude.\n\n\nI genuinely want my mind changed. It would make me less hateful.\n\n   
8	>	NOT ALL JUST MOST\n\nSurround yourself with people you think are better than you intellectually and morally. \n\nAnother thing would be to remain open to other ideas despite thinking yours to be better. When you’re discussing with someone, don’t think of it as a competition. Think of it as a learning exercise; take out the main principle(s) of their argument and reflect upon it yourself. \n\nYou may find something you can at least agree with in their arguments and that will make you more appreciative of their perspectives. There is so much to learn from the people around you. \n\nMaybe don’t always equate intelligence to worth. People don’t really have any control over if they’re stupid or not. If you’re born stupid, that’s just the luck you got. If you’re born smart, that’s your luck. Find worth in other aspects of their lives. That may help you feel less hateful of others. 
4	 The only thing I can recommend is to learn to be more understanding of peoples differences and more open to allowing your brain and willpower to let go when it doesn't need to be at a 1000%. There was a time where I had little to no respect for anyone, everyone was too slow, inefficient, lazy, unmotivated and intellectually vacuous. As a manager of numerous large teams I've seen it all in terms of personalities, and I remember distinctly a moment when all my employees where all in the same room and I realized they looked to me not just for leadership but maturity, understanding and wisdom.\n\n \n\n "All I have is what I'm going after" (From the movie Heat) is a phrase that has stuck with me for ages and its how I lived my life, unstoppable drive and focus. I begun to realize that within that phrase held a deeper message, that what you are going after doesn't always have to exclude inefficiency, it didn't always have to be organized or concentrated. That the goal can be the group and the solution coming together. That the journey is important, as is meeting that goal or finding that resolution. I'll be honest, I don't think I will truly understand that wisdom being who I am but I try to take it into account, I make the effort.
2	I understand where you are coming from. Even though I couldn’t care for feeling “superior” or smarter than most folks since it doesn’t mean anything, it’s a pain having a conversation with people sometimes. When I jump into a debate I notice most people’s first intention is to humiliate and own you when in reality a debate/argument is meant to bring two groups to a understanding. People sometimes just speak out of their ass on subjects they are clueless about, and it can be annoying. Sometimes you want someone to converse with without having to dumb down your points. My advice to you is kill your ego but maintain pride and dignity. I know egos are hard to kill, but it will lead to nothing but toxicity in the final run. And secondly, be more picky on who you converse with. Before you jump into a conversation/debate, ask yourself:\n\n1) What is the goal of this conversation (for serious subject matters of course)\n\n2) Is the person I’m conversing with educated on the subject matter? (If you don’t know them, go into the conversation with no presumption, once you feel like they are not worth your time, change the topic without seeming like an asshole. *Thats up to you*)\n\nAt the end of the day, there will always be folks you can’t stand having dialogues with, because everyone has their strongpoints/weaknesses. One might know a lot about Basketball but be clueless in Music Production and vice verse. These are just two examples here. The problem is people will still argue on topics they know nothing about and I wish that changed. If you feel too egoistic, always know that the person who is “dumb” to you will always know something you don’t about another topic. You are not a god nor will you ever be one, either  handle people accordingly and learn how to confront them in a proper way when you dislike their form of thinking, or let your ego eat you up and prevent you from being a better version of yourself.\n\nI kind of vented out on here too, but just my two cents, hope I helped.\n\n\n

16	Fixation on Ni, too much of a loner	I had someone very close to me tell me I am a loner, and I am living too much in head. That person is very much correct. I am currently living almost entirely inside myself. I am constantly in a state of self-reflection, except for when I get in a "flow state" of doing something I'm passionate about, or something fun.\n\nThat person also told me I seek deep, self-reflective conversations, and I'm currently not having enough conversations like that. I think it's difficult to find people who are willing to engage on a deep level, and it is a risk to expose deep parts of myself to people, both because it makes me vulnerable and because I might freak out the other person.\n\nHow do I change to escape from this Ni fixation? What can I do to achieve deep interactions with others? How do I stop living inside myself? It seems like simply being social is not enough because so often interactions are surface-level, with no possibility of depth. Advice welcome.
8	it do be like that sometimes 
9	You're going to make yourself uncomfortable. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel you on a lot of what you're saying. I am perfectly content being at home, alone or with close friends, and not being bothered by others. Sometimes it is so draining. However, I had to tell myself that I could be missing out on meeting some great people or a lot of fun by staying at home. Some situations have been real flops but others have been a lot of fun and I'm happy I did it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou won't get those conversations you crave unless you get out there and talk to people. You have to get through the initial formalities to get to the deep stuff. That will take time, but us ENTJs can sense how energy feels around different people. \n\n  \nAlso, you do not have to expose your vulnerability to see if you're compatible with someone else intellectually. I am not sure what would make you vulnerable but I would like to think that you would be able to speak about the subject of it without making yourself the subject. That, or you can just give a little to see how they react, surface stuff. I do that from time to time to see how the act and gauge how deeper we go in conversation.   \n
5	I get this. \n\nMy advice: get physical exercise. It might balance your focus by also focusing on the physical. In the end we very much *are* our bodies. I get that this isn't advice that directly *solves* your problem or question, but I do think it could be beneficial to finding a solution. \n\nIf you don't like the gym or classes, just take walks. Also counts. 
2	Why do you feel the need for deep, self-reflective conversations? Do you feel comfortable only if you go beyond that surface level interaction?
2	ni is the most disfunctional function for 2019
2	If you have an over developped Ni it means consequentially an over developped Fe as well. You can't just do more if you favour Ni over Se as they're linked therefore you have to use something else. Technically you're not a Fe user but that doesn't mean it's not something you understand in your own way. You can be very charismatic if you're an ENTJ-Ni, it does take a lot of socialisation to get anywhere though. 
1	imagine not being a loner\n\nnow that's a horror show

9	Lonely at the Top	I never realized how true this statement was until I made significant strides at my university. During my first 5 semesters at school, I worked very dilligently to create the most opportunities for myself as possible in the realm of scholarships, internships, etc. After becoming one of the top students in my class with an ongoing internship at a Fortune 10 Company I realize how much it has cut me off from generating a trustworthy social circle at my school. I have two close friends there, everyone else is an acquaintance. I certainly run into people who I feel are befriending me solely for help in school, and others who are just intimidated by me. In a very honest way I’ve also been told I’m quite attractive, and this makes me feel so isolated from everyone else. So many people look at me like I’m an asshole, be it in class or around campus.\n\nThough I feel like a loner while I’m there, more people know who I am than I thought according to some. This is due to the fact that they know I’m am overachiever who holds his head high with confidence around campus. \n\nTo most, this probably seems like I’m being ungrateful for complaining about my achievements and my looks, but I feel as though ENTJ people would know more than anyone else what it’s like to be ahead of the pack with no one by their side. Most of the people I communicate with are friends from back home, as a lot of the other top students which I work with are simply like talking to brick walls outside of the classroom. Perhaps you guys could offer some insight as to how you might deal with being “lonely at the top”?
10	In my experience, ENTJs systematically underappreciate the effects on both social and work success of 'being liked'. At one point, you might be the 'best' in whatever you do, but people will prefer to promote somebody that has a strong interpersonal and likable persona, even if they are not the 'best'. They say ENTJs have 'natural charisma'. In my opinion, nothing is 'natural' about it. It is learned: learned by ENTJs who realized this and put a lot of effort in developing their personality and how their personality comes across. ENTJs who didn't do this are anything but charismatic: they come across as assholes to everyone but themselves.\n\nNow back to your post: you spend several paragraphs discussing your achievements (be it work, school, or looks) and not a single word is said about what *your* interpersonal value is to others. \n\nWhat is your value as a person that would make you interesting as a friend or love interest? Why would people want be your friend? \n\nYou say:\n\n>they know I’m am overachiever who holds his head high with confidence around campus.\n\nApparently that's the image you are showing in your non-verbal communication. Of course nobody wants to be friends (or coworkers for that matter) with somebody who thinks they are better than others simply because they work hard and lucked out in the genetic lottery in terms of intelligence and a disposition for discipline. *Why would they?*\n\nMy advice: have a careful look at why *you* (and not your achievements!) bring value to the table in interpersonal relationships and think about how you are communicating this to the world. 
4	>To most, this probably seems like I’m being ungrateful for complaining about my achievements and my looks, but I feel as though ENTJ people would know more than anyone else what it’s like to be ahead of the pack with no one by their side.\n\nI feel you.  Honestly, the way I cope with it is by having a significant other who I can trust with my life, and by simply coming to terms with the reality of having less friends the more I achieve.  We find it pretty easy to get lost in our work as well, but the loneliness can really set in if we have no one to share that with, so this will be easier to cope with once you find someone (whether it be a lover or a friend) that you can share all of your ideas and achievements with.  \n\n\nBasically I would say you just need to get used to it, and look for quality over quantity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
4	It’s lonely at the top because you’re not surrounded by people who aren’t on your wavelength which is a vast amount of the population (including your own friends). But is that what you want? To be surrounded by people just for the sake of being surrounded and validated?\n\nI notice that my friendship circle is ever decreasing and when I hang around my old friends I can’t have the conversations I truly want to have with them as they are more focused on speaking about trivial things. E.g other people, sports, tv shows etc. Not that it’s not enjoyable at times but it doesn’t add any value. \n\nI also think it’s lonely for ENTJ’ because we are naturally quite independent so the chances of us bumping into each other are rare and the chances of us liking each other is even more rare. However, I have a lot of friends who think and behave like me but they are also very busy developing their own ideas and businesses. \n\nAs I am young and I have met many young and successful people.  I have created a small network for myself and I know that in the next 5-8 years we will all reach great levels of success then we can all help each other out.  I try to meet each of them individually at least once a quarter and we give each other updates. \n\nIt is lonely but it will pay off. 
5	it do be like that sometimes
2	My father gave me some advice a while ago about that: you need a strong back. You’re at the top, you’ve made it. But the top is nothing without a base. Figure out who your base is and be an extrovert.
1	We are totally alone in this world and at the same time so dependent on others\n\nmaybe that's where loneliness comes from?
1	Any natural charisma you exude will be plenty to attract more people in the future! It’s not lonely at the top — it’s just lonely when you don’t socialize IE focusing solely on graduating top of your class and such. 
20	Tried to be nicer, now missing some ENTJ-ness	Ive basically worked on being nicer to people and less dictatorial because it led to me significantly hurting someone close in the past. \nI've worked a lot on fixing my emotions and personal issues which I'm very pleased with and I do still get positions of authority and do well socially, but  I worry I'm too nice, not sufficiently assertive and overly forgiving in leadership roles. Essentially like the additional emotional health results in reduced ruthlessness/selfishness where it is needed. Has anyone had a simialr experience and what advise would you give me?
17	Do you feel happier the way you are now? If so, stick with what you're doing. \n\nENTJs love objective success, but what we often neglect is the emotional side of it. If being less assertive yields a better emotional payoff to the slight detriment of the results then honestly, I think it's worth it.
8	Do whatever makes you happy man. \n\nWhat I would do: be nice in private setting, be assertive in work setting. \n\nHowever, realize that being nice doesn't mean letting people walk over you, I think a lot people confuse being nice with the latter. 
4	I failed pretty badly at my first academic leadership role because when my peers didn't respect my requests, rather than assert myself I just gave up the role. I do not regret the decision, as it was taking away from my personal time and my grades, however I do acknowledge maybe things would have went over a little smoother if I would have just addressed the lack of respect for my role and decisions. I will be taking this lesson with me when given the opportunity to lead a group again.
3	Approaching situations with their own merits is what you should be doing, not limiting yourself in such a black-and-white manner. Rationality entails the possibility to either be "dictatorial" or saintly. Sometimes you need to be forceful, and sometimes people deserve to be scolded, just be certain the reasons justify it.\n
2	That’s one of my goals this year— to be kinder. But I’ve given myself a caveat in that when it comes to work and killing it with climbing the corporate ladder, I don’t have to be nice since being a certain way at work (so that I can climb the corporate ladder) will already keep me in check as far as my kindness/ruthlessness goes. Outside of work, I want to be more kind to friends and family. Nevertheless, if anyone messes with me, you best believe I will seek revenge haha \n\nIn all realness, just be happy with who you are and be kind to those that are kind to you. Don’t worry about the rest. We are notorious for being hard on ourselves. Just accept who you are gift and know that you’re a good person! Then being “more” kind will come easy. 
2	I think the fact that you are conscious of this process, sets you apart. As E\_\_\_Js we are especially able to diagnose what makes people tick and coordinate social action. As an ENTJ, I am most successful when I understand the needs of my clients, the needs of my team, and catering as much as possible to these in the planning process. When I cannot meet someone's expectations, or see that conflict can occur, I bring it up and discuss it openly. Usually people will come up with the "right" answer on their own. My teams are relately small so this is possible, but the same can be said of any team units in big organizations.\n\nI read this article that mentions that being both highly results-focused and highly people-oriented is rare, as  "l*ess than 1%* of leaders were rate high on both goal focus and social skills". According to, [Should Leaders Focus on Results, or on People?](https://hbr.org/2013/12/should-leaders-focus-on-results-or-on-people), the brain might be wired in a certain way (as the mbti theory implies), but I have found that you can consciously alter this by knowing yourself and others well.  \n\n\nEdit: typo.
9	I really need some Fi advice (ENTJ-T 3w4)	Hi, I want to start of it might be a lot of details but please bear with me. I went through a depression since the last quarter of 2017 and the first of 2018. I had personal tragedies and the person I thought I would spend my life with dropped me as a brick without ever calling me out on my shit after I went into a grip period. \n\nAfterwards I worked the entirety of 2018 working on getting my education back on the rails, getting a nice job in the meanwhile and working on improving my appearance which I neglected and my social life. \n\nEverything went alright I met a nice girl and I lived as a workaholic. Got back into my school rhythm too. \n\nMy relationship went bad really fast after quiting my job to start an internship to complete my education. After this friends of me also went through troubling times.\n\nI can start my internship this month, I was supposed to start last month but had to get some documents cleared to be able to. \n\nAnyways I had a really crappy time because of all this around the holidays. I just realised I fixed my problems in an instrumental fashion last year. Like I learned myself most of the tools an ENTJ needs to bounce back from grief through therapy and such. \n\nI just realised my friends aren’t what they were anymore. I reconnected with some people from years ago and that actually feels really good again. \n\nThe months before I was pretty much only succeeding in goals like school and work but to be honest. I was living like an alcoholic and a drug addict in my free time. Succes is fun but not if I don’t truly feel it. \n\nAfter good talks with old steady friends I just realise how much I am seeking approvement in a toxic enviromment and that I’m disintegrating from 3w4 to a 9. \n\nI want to banish all unnessary pain for my life. I would also like to hear from ENTJ 3w4 how they managed to be true to themselves and set themselves up for life. \n\nI realise the only thing I’m missing is totally Fi related and all my addictive outbursts were pure unhealthy Se loop behaviour. When I’m om my best I actually act like a healthy ENTJ, but right now I’m afraid I might fall off. \n\nI hope y’all can give me some perspective or a nudge in the right direction. I googled some earlier posts about ENTJ 3w4 Fi gripping so I’m comfortable my peers would be able to. \n\nI want to thank you for atleast reading this and answering, feel free to ask questions. \n\n- Parang \n
8	I can relate to your situation.\n\nI found that relinquishing all ties of the past and friends, relationships, etc... come and gone; I was able to actually find myself on the map of life. I plotted my destination and started traveling upstream. \n\nIn short, nothing anyone can say here will really "fix" things. \n\nMy advice is to be true to yourself, accept where you are and why you are there. Figure out where you want to be and put your big ENTJ brain to work. You'll get there, even if you get there late. \n\nNever. Stop. Learning. 
6	You sound like me\n\nRemember ENTJs are tribe leaders. Surround yourself with good people.
5	If you’re an entj you should be assembling and moving people towards a vision based on common goals and expertise.  I think maybe being young, this can be hard when much of ‘proving’ yourself in school years is done solo.  You’re going to be at your best not just through personal success but in the success of others surrounding you.\n\nBest advice would be to be patient and understand the reward doesn’t end at personal success.
5	It is so, so hard to be a leader and a good friend when you’re surrounded by toxic people. And, it’s fruitless, as well. I’m so regretful that I didn’t learn that until later in life, but it could be that part of the lesson relies on maturity in general, and toxicity isn’t always recognized for what it is until a certain maturity level is achieved.\n\nThat being said, drop them. Drop all ties, block numbers if you have to. I took FB off of my phone as an app and I’m going to “hide out” for a year before going back and deleting a very close circle of friends of mine who are just fucking idiots. I don’t want to be associated with their mindset and I also don’t want to explain to them how weak they are. I don’t want to coddle anyone’s feelings, and I’m not going to change anyone who can’t figure out how to send an email to HR or take their meds on time. Not my problem, and it’s certainly not yours either.\n\nFind something to focus your energy on and remove your focus from the things that aren’t moving you towards your goals to something that will. Don’t be hesitant to cut anyone out of your life who isn’t moving you forward and who doesn’t contribute to your overall wellness. As you remove toxic people, healthier relationships will replace them, but there has to be space for them to enter. When you take the time to clearly define your boundaries, you will feel a lot better about who and what you allow to take up your valuable time. \n\nThat’s my main point: your time is valuable. YOU are valuable, and you’re an irreplaceable investment. 
1	Try Buddhism, if your goal is to banish unnecessary pain. However, you've been using a lot of escapism (drugs, alcohol)... Why? What thoughts are you hiding from? What is the worst thing that happens if you are home alone and sober? 
3	ENTJ Persistence	I'm an INTP guy and I've known this ENTJ guy for quite a few years. We're gay and have had sexual relations but also attempted to have legit relationships (twice or thrice) which have always been cut short by me due to me not wanting to trust him per se . He comes across as a player to me somewhat and I've told him and explained to him why I'm a bit hesitant to be in an actual relationship with him. He has never been negative or nasty about it, always understanding and usually says that's how people viewed him even while growing up. We've had a handful of other relationships between our droughts of contact but we always resume talking and meet up like nothing happened.\n\nWe have a great friendship and we feel comfortable to talk about anything really. He has surprisingly kept interesting all this time which is honestly very shocking in itself to me (I usually go thru periods of boredom with people). I'm assuming that I'm also interesting to him but I'd just like your ENTJ perspectives.\n\nI'm not trying to boast but these are context for my following questions. I'm physically attractive, fit (usually lol), have a good job and part time job, both potential careers. Generally Im aware of INTP flaws and actively try to improve on them.\n\n1) What do ENTJs strongly like about INTPs?\n\n2) Why is he so unwavering in pursuing me? Does he just really like our chemistry, physical or otherwise?\n\n3) I've had personal and offhand experience with ENTJ cheaters before. All the others I have typed were unfaithful (str8 & gay) to their partners, so in a way I project that onto him (which he is aware of as well). What are the chances of him repeating that trend? Will he just do as he wants when he has achieved his conquest? \n\nHe continues to pursue me even after 6+ years lol. He is never awkward or annoying about it but just direct. It's really odd to me tbh. Is such persistence normal for ENTJ folk? 
18	Let him love you!
3	Persistence is absolutely our thing, especially if we know it’s something that will pay off eventually, or if it’s something/someone that we need in our lives for balance/love/etc. My husband and I went through bouts of awful, awful fights before finally settling into a routine, but once that routine was established - it became the most consistent and normal relationship ever. It sounds like he knows and understands your apprehension, and that what you’re apprehensive about can only be resolved through a long-term, consistent display of reliability. He knows that, which is why he’s simply being an unwavering and dependable person. 
3	INTPs are hilarious. You may come across as laid back but you a generally quite smart and very witty. These are qualities we like. Personally I don’t always like that I take myself so seriously all the time, you are a nice escape because you think the same way as us but do it in a laid back manner. 
3	1. Intelligence\n2. We never give up, until we have succeeded on what we have set out to accomplish.\n3. Situational. Talk to him about why he cheated and what drove him to cheat. See if you can establish boundaries, promises and then recourse actions if boundaries are crossed & promises broken. \n\nGonna take some time to grow that trust, assuming you can get through #3.
3	Hey, glad to learn you've met an ENTJ (we r truly awesome). By that I mean we are very loyal and true to our values- loving individuals (not that others arnt so but Im speaking out of my own body and mind here). I am in ENTJ lady married to an INTP man and I couldn't be happier in life. The way my INTP husband makes my life so much better is something I never thought Ill experience ever (even gave up on that thought of finding the one for me before we've met). On my own I can get quite anxious and paranoid sometimes, not seeing the worth in doing regular routine shit or living a life on this planet (in a logical way) and what I like most about him is the freedom feeling and mind expansion that I get from our talks. He inspires me to seek knowledge and learn about the world from a fun optimistic perspective, allowing me to be who I am without any sign/intention of control. We never fight and this is perfectly fine because I hate wasting time arguing or destroying the mood. Just now I sent him to the wrong vet mistankenly and he says "now we know" but not in a crazy sarcastic way but in a really understanding not getting mad way. "We will cross that bridge when we get there" is one of my favorite "his lines". I love myself more with him in my life and I know Ive been praising INTPs more than ENTJ in this post but my point is: if he chases you then he must definitely like you but dont let him confuse your liking back for weakness. Stand your ground without imposing anything on him and let him be who he is, giving him time to process when it comes to feelings, no restrictions or too much planning (let him think it was his idea type of thing). He will appreciate you more for it and always come back. Be patient, its a match.
2	Well... what we ENTJs, set out to accomplish, we all have our own reasons. We don't do things without rhyme or reason.... ask him. Ask him what he plans on doing after he accomplishes wooing you.
3	I’ve met a lot of ENTJs, and liked them, but they were all cheaters. 
4	1 yes itts normal  \n2 stop thinking in MBTI context. ENTJ and INTP are 2 sides of the same coin , ultimate efficiency , ultimate vision.  \nits only fair to pursue every lead you have. dont see the relevance if u know ur number 50 or number 5. dont matter   \n3 attraction is about virtue. how much virtue the other perceives. might be there , might not be.. who knows.   \ni didnt catch whats ur problem? what the fuck are u waiting for?  \nalso, id suggest studying poliamory. its the rational ultimate standard for a relationship
14	How do I cringe less at myself?	Not sure if the question makes sense, but here's the situation:\n\nIn a few years (at the end of/after college), I'd like to enter industry that heavily involves social media and having a large following there, so my new year resolution is to revive my instagram account (small steps...)\n\nThe problem is I cannot post anything without cringing at it, for example; today I posted a picture of landscape with fireworks (in my country it's almost 2019) and I just have this urge to delete this, because the cringe is too overwhelming. 
6	Why do you want a large following? What's the motivation? I also cringe at myself so a large social media following is my personal idea of hell. 
6	You just have to do it and let the cringe reflex toughen up.  \n\n\nI'm doing it right now, on my personal FB ahead of starting to do video tidbits for my professional space.   It IS hard to let stuff stand that you'd rather not have out there, but it does get easier.  \nI shoot for two FB live videos a week, just to get used to being out there.  I know some SM folks do the "video a day for 30 days" to grow that muscle strong, but that wasn't me.\n\n&#x200B;
4	I'm the opposite of the other posters in here so far. I personally like my old posts because it documents my growth.
6	I have 900;000+ followers on facebook, but I am currently getting shadowbanned into Oblivion because of my political perspective.  I hate having to rely on the whims of these large companies.
5	Why would you want to stop? You're subconsciously recognizing that social media is a massive waste of time. If more people had the capability to cringe at the stupid shit they posted online, mankind would be better off.
3	I feel ya, everything just seems like bragging to me. I would get stuck between this is too trivial and this is bragging that I'd just cringe at anything I'd try to post. So I end up posting like 2 times a year. Something that sort of helps me is just taking photos with social media in mind but knowing you might not ever post it. Then just choosing one when it seems right. 
4	How good are you at controlling yourself?	And how important is this when controlling others?
20	I'm pretty good at holding farts in until the coast is clear, so pretty good I guess. 
14	If I need to achieve a goal, pretty good. If not I’m impulsive.\n\nI don’t care about controlling others, I care about controlling the variables of a situation. 
5	I’ve always been very good at controlling myself, whether it be in eating healthy, pushing myself to exercise, academic pursuits, and lust. \n\nI don’t have a need to control people. Though, I am unsure if this is ENTJ or enneagram 3, I am able to fit to people’s personalities to get something I want to achieve a goal in a situation. But even then, I am not trying to control to manipulate the person, just kind of match them so we have a good connection to get something done. \n\nWhen it comes to random urges though, like places to eat or a dessert, I can be very impulsive. I usually am not impulsive in negative-outcome-interactions with people though, because my subconscious has already thought out that ending and that keeps me from acting it out.
3	Id say unpredictable. Im pretty impulsive, and I have issues with modulating my emotions in general. But I usually have an attitude of responibility that speaks to me when things get to be too overwhelming.
3	Pretty decent, when I need to focus in order achieve whatever I set my mind to.\n\nI don't feel like controlling other people anymore, unless the situation is critical. Like someone else said I'm more concerned about controlling the variables (which sometimes include others).
15	MBTI Research Study	Hello all, recently I have been very curious in conducting some research on the MBTI, and seeing if perhaps anyone would be interested in the creation of a new centralized MBTI community.\n\nI have created a survey for you all to take, I would very much appreciate if you guys took it, thank you all so much in advance!\n\n[https://goo.gl/forms/Alu5VPDrbmGBfvGL2](https://goo.gl/forms/Alu5VPDrbmGBfvGL2)
7	there should be an option on the second question for "i think it is very popular in real life" because the options are basically its popular online, it’s not popular online, and i don’t know. \n\nfun survey tho !
2	Hello all! Please continue to take the survey and thank you for all of those who have replied thus far! When I’ve acquired a large enough sample size, I plan on sharing the results in a large analysis and discussing what we want as a community and where we can move forward from here!\n\nThe analysis will be found at r/MBTI\n\nWe have the makings of an ambitious project here! Godspeed.\n\n-jumbojet555
8	What is your love language?	Just curious if ENTJs have a similar love language. 
15	1) Quality time 2) Acts of service\n\nI am not a touchy-feely person, and gifts are last at a score of 0.
8	1)touch \n2) words of affirmation 
7	Physical touch then quality time
5	Touch and gifts towards others, touch and words of affirmations to myself. 
5	1. Deep talks \n2. Acts of Service \n3. Quality time \n4. Words of Affirmation \n5. Gifts \n6. Physical touch \n\nPhysical touch is last for me because it can be purely carnal and lustful. I don’t find it means love, and being unsure that a touch=love renders it no weight for me. You can also fake physical affection. 
11	lol y'all love to touch. 
5	Touch then Words. But I have noticed that it changes based on my partner and what I recognize their love language is. I become more open to their style. 
4	1. Acts of service \n2. Words of affirmation 
3	Acts of service
3	Quality time, physical affection, and acts of service. 
3	Touch and acts of service!
2	Physical Touch and Quality Time.
2	Physical touch and quality time. When you put the two together it's heaven.
2	1. Acts of Service\n2.  Deep talks\n3. Touch
2	Definitely touch.  I gernally don't like it when anyone other than my partner touches me, even if it's just a hug.  \n\n\nTalking.
2	1. touch. 2. acts of service, maybe words of affirmation is tied.
3	Also touch. Does anyone have an explanation for this? Seems most of us are all touch. 
2	Deep talks 
1	1. Words of affirmation \n\n2. Acts of service
1	Thoughtful gifts and time. 
1	Physical touch and quality time here too.  Both given and received.  Acts of service is close but that more shows caring and less actual love.  I've found many people can care but people who really love tend to make time to be close because it feels better in the presence of the one they love.  And bar none cuddles and sexy affection make the love world go round for me.
1	quality time 
1	Most definitely touch! In addition, words of affirmation and acts of service. 
1	1. Words of affirmation\n2. Physical touch\n3. Acts of service \n4. Quality time\n5. Gifts \n\nI love giving gifts and providing acts of service but they’re less important for me to receive... Also, if I’m receiving anything I generally want words to accompany, I’m just a really verbal person (chalk it up to a tendency to overthink if left to my own devices)
0	I read it but I didn't really feel like I fit into it because I couldn't identify specifically with a couple or one.
0	Spanish and heavy petting
9	Humility	How would one become more humble?
22	Existential terror.
21	Age and life experiences probably helps. I was a cocky little shit when I was younger, and I think I’ve mellowed since.
4	i was at camp once and i was talking to my mentor about how i was annoyed with my small group. i said something along the lines of "i’m just annoyed because they’re acting the way i used to act and i’ve grown out of it so why can’t they" and she said "remember that most of them have had far less support and far more stress than you have" (context: most of the other kids in my group were lower/middle income kids from boston and i’m from a wealthy rural town) and that was really eye opening. \n\nat the end of the week we did a playback theatre activity (where improv actors come in and perform your story to you in the form of dynamic tableaux based on info you’ve given them) and i told the actors i’d had a really humbling experience because i really how much privilege i have. one of the lines in the piece was "you took a different road to get here? your road had bumps? your road had potholes?" and being the literature major that i am i was really impacted by the analogy. \n\nthose two experiences were really helpful for me in realizing that my superior skills/intellect/dedication/emotional processing/whatever might not be because i’m All That, but largely due to circumstance and life experience. it also helped me realize that i can use the lessons i’ve had the chance to learn to relate to other people at their level rather than getting annoyed because they’re not at mine. \n\nsorry that got so long. idk if this is the kind of thing you’re struggling with, but this is what helped me. 
4	Arrogance < honesty > humility 
3	Learn to fake it. I find that people who are "humble" are frequently just insecure or have a holier-than-thou attitude - which they never explicitly flaunt, but it's annoying all the same
4	Realise that no one actually knows what the fuck they're doing. We're all playing a guessing game here.\n\nI like to look at it this way: If I'm ridiculing someone for getting something wrong and I'm putting myself on a pedestal for getting it right, then I'm the actual idiot. The person who got it wrong is still learning. We all make mistakes, we all learn. The only difference between the other person and me is that I learned that something before they did, but they might already be aware of a thousand other things that I've yet to learn. 
3	Get a mentor.
3	Failure and graditude. When you can feel and understand both of those things at the same time, you are on your way.
2	By listening. Always listen more than you speak. \n\nA friend of the family is a homicide detective and he has always instilled in us that if you truly listen to a criminal, you will understand how they thought they had no choice. \n\nTry to be neutral, if the situation doesn’t pertain to you. A lot of ego is caught up in the idea that you know better than others. Even if you do, it’s not THEIR fault that they haven’t had YOUR experiences. \n\nFinally, meditation. It’s healthy for the mind, healthy for the respiratory system. No downside to learning how to meditate. Sounds like you’re getting into Zen philosophy, wonderful stuff. 
2	Be overly arrogant and let life put you in your place.
2	Why do you want to be more humble?
1	Insight mediation is great for this. Drop in on a free mediation group in your area.
1	No.
1	challenge,fail,repeat
1	Apparently we're compatible, you and I.	At least socially. What can you tell me about yourself? Likes, dislikes, hobbies, careers, life purpose, goals? What do you *care* about? You know, instead of looking up a boring explanation on the internet, I'd rather get it first hand from real ENTJs. Not sure if I know any ENTJs in real life, since I dunno how you guys look, act... What are you guys like? Your demeanor, approach to things; I dunno, anything. It would help me and I think it'd be fun to know.
9	We are all different, even within the same personality type, and you will not be compatible with all of us.
3	Your questions are too surface level/broad to get the info you're looking for imo. People vary so widely on the stuff you mentioned. Try asking more specific questions? 
4	Confident, future oriented, money motivated, organized, creative. That fits the ENTJ pretty well but some things that I am that don’t necessarily have much to do with my type is: animal lover, interested in becoming an civil engineer, love sports and staying active, have a need to be social but don’t like most people, enjoy learning Spanish and I am not so feminine.
3	An elementary question. Personally, I guess I fit the ENTJ type, although I have been different types in the past and don't give MBTI much credence, but I'll give a rundown of me; So I'm 20, currently studying Criminology and Forensics at uni, final year. Next year, I hope to become a Royal Navy Warfare Officer, if all goes well. Massively nerdy about stuff like climbing, Warhammer 40k, sci fi in general, history, trivia, a few video games and also tv shows. Value wise, I massively appreciate honesty, candidness, reliability and openness. So, the opposites of these are enormous red flags to me. What's my demeanor? Guess friends often say I'm somewhat more extroverted, which I guess is because I like to get to know people, and I also love listening to what they have to say. Some of my worst flaws? I'm clumsy as fuck, occasionally say the wrong things and clear my throat more often then I'd like. Others who go by this type? As others have said, everyone is going to have different interests, occupations ect. so I can only speak for myself.  I am but one individual in a vast sea, but nonetheless hope to have provided a reasonable answer.
1	Honestly I’m constantly changing so my likes, hobbies, and dislikes come and go. It went from writing to music to painting and now it’s programming. My favorite subjects are philosophy, economics, physics, and computer science (a bit of math but it’s more for pushing myself). At least I’m finally 100% sure want career I want to do which is Robotics Engineering. I like that my job would be to continuously solves important problems for humanity. My overall life purpose is to get into space robotics and build robots for settlers when we eventually begin pioneering the moon/mars. \n\nIn real life I’m quite socially reserved but you can see my confidence when I start debating or discussing with others subjects that interest me or in at work/during a project. I tend to make friends easily, at parties I’m very gregarious and in comfortable social settings I seem eccentric yet detached and like most ENTJ girls, you can locate me from my occasional loud laugh. I tend to ask others a lot serious questions (goals and shit), and I’m often cracking really dark humor (with friends who can handle it). Most of my sensor acquaintances tend to think I’m cold and heartless especially as I prefer to have as little friends as possible. I have too much on my schedule and need really low maintenance relationships which apparently is weird. \n\nYou can find me in the library, at some art show, and when I really need it, houseparties. I’m also very vocal about my opinions and not afraid of who it offends. I like to get into debates and enjoy learning more from others. Some of my opinions lie with libertarianism, and I follow the school of stoicism.\n\nHow I look depends on my mental health, at my worst I wear the same things continuously and look like total shit. When more balanced I wear minimalist, comfortable yet bold clothes; lots of blacks and block colored clothing. I like to look put together but leave style my hair in colors or dreads. I don’t smile a lot unless I’m with my close friends who are usually ENFPs, INTJs, and INFJs. You’ll either find me with them or ESFPs and ESTJs. The last two are my only connections to reality.
9	what's your opinion on poetry?	
8	Boring
14	BORING. Don't listen to it or read it. 
11	Don’t listen to it or read it but write it. \n\nI keep em really safe.
7	very hard to get right. i have almost no patience with some of it but i’ve also read plenty of poems i love. very all or nothing w me and poetry. 
5	Like any of the arts, it can be amazing, or it can be drab as hell.\nI’m a musician, songwriter and lyricists. I think art is an innate ability in all people. It just has to be cultivated. 
3	Can almost guarantee you'll like Invictus.\n\nMost poetry is super dull though.
4	I enjoy it. I'm not very good at articulating my feelings, so I'm always impressed by people who can capture a particular mood. I like to read some classics like Robert Frost and T. S. Eliot and very occassionally see some spoken word or slam poetry in the right company.
2	Cheesy 
2	Hate almost all of it. It's too cheesy for my soul.\n\nSaying that, I love literature and do like to indulge in the works if classic poets (Yeats, Browning, Tennyson, Shakespeare, Robert Frost) purely because I love unraveling the poems, analysing them and going inside the poet's mind.
2	I like poetry, but sometimes it gets me right in the feels and I hate that.
4	My BA is in English and I have taken a few poetry writing workshops. A fundamental, proper understanding of the logistics of a great poem is truly life changing. 
2	i don’t like to listen to it, but if i have to write something for english, it takes up the most room in my notebook
2	Bukowski is my jam\n\n"If something burns your soul with purpose and desire, it is your duty to be reduced to ashes by it"\n
2	It can be a pleasure constructing a poem with a tight structure and multi-layered meanings. If i had to choose a favourite it would be 'Hawk Roosting' by Ted Hughes.
1	If you wanna get laid  \ndon't ask things of a forum  \nPick a girl that you like  \nand compose a poem  \n\nShe'll get instantly tame,  \nshe will give you her digits  \nShe'll respect your big brain  \nso much more than her teachers'\n\n
1	I see it as an indulgence that I ought to work hard to deserve, so my exposure is limited but I consider it to be highly valuable.
1	i like reading it if it holds my attention span\n\ni like writing it just to be absurd
1	I write poetry, but i dont get much out of reading it. It’s nice in songs. Song lyrics is often very much like poetry.
11	How did you decide your career?	Hi, XNTJ here. Throwaway account, but I'll still try to respond if I can. But anyway, is it wrong to be frustrated that you don't know exactly what you want to do with your life? Right now I'm like 20, and I'm working on two degrees that will give me a lot of range professionally, and I just can't decide which path to take and it's driving me nuts. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut let me turn the questions to you: to anyone out there who knows exactly what they want to do, when and how did you find out? Why did you pick your field/outfit? Are you happy with what you chose? Have you ever changed your mind? And do you think there's inherently a problem in being professionally directionless?
12	Not at all (to both your first and last question). ENTJs need time to assess things and gather data before committing to a plan/strategy. I feel like I was extremely unprepared for real adulthood, so it took me several years to adjust to things before I felt like I could choose a career (and commit to those financial loans).\n\nThings will align. Practice patience and diligence. Keep in mind that you can have a job that is "good enough" initially while you decide what you want to do/wait for opportunities. \n\nMy natural interests have always been in biology. I picked a "for now" career and then figured out what I wanted to do (just needed more data). I may change again to politics in like, my 40s. Who knows? I'm not too worried about it.
8	As a mid-twenties ENTJ who's experienced exactly what you are/have, my biggest piece of advice is not to get into the mindset that you have to "choose a path" and that once you're on that path you're on it for life. You're never truly locked into a career or direction (unless you're military, I guess).\n\nI've worked since I was 14 years old and since then I've been in fast food, a restaurant kitchen, been a commercial janitor, been a guitar teacher for a studio, owned my own teaching business (full time), worked for a gov't elected official's office for several years, worked at a church, been to college, been unemployed, and am currently in upper management of a small company where I supervise 20+ employees across several states. I'm in line to buy the company when my boss inevitably retires soon. \n\nAnd you know what? I'm not even done. I'm content where I am for now, but I haven't found "the thing" for me yet, so I know I'll move on in a few years. Honestly, I'm feeling drawn to self-employment and freelancing, and I think that's where I'll ultimately settle down, but I'm not in a huge hurry to set my destiny in stone. Try something for a year or six months, if you like it keep going until you don't. Then don't be afraid to change to something else.\n\nHonestly, few pensions or long-term retirement plans are worth the bondage of staying somewhere you don't want to be for 20-30 years. So what if you're 5 years vested into a pension? If you need to leave, LEAVE and find fulfillment. It's easier when you don't have a family (I don't), but even so, you owe it to yourself to do something fulfilling to you. 
5	Maybe this is not what you would like to hear ... but for me it was never really a problem to choose a direction. \nAll things that I did, I did with a lot of passion. From being a supermarket cashier to my final profession now as a senior process engineer in a Fortune 500 company, I was always very ambitious and competitive. For me it was really easy to focus on whatever I set my mind on at that moment.\nDreams and wishes change over time though. When I was little, I wanted to become a pharmacist. Then I had a phase were I thought being a nuclear physicist would be awesome. I finally settled on something that I call my dream job. But that‘s a mindset thing really, not because I think there is only one thing that I’d love or would be good at. \n
3	36 years old now.  When I was younger all I wanted was money and to “run” something.  I recently changed careers and am now a 5th grade math teacher.   \n\nJust racking up money felt hollow and I worked too much.  I’m financially set and have two young kids.  So I shifted to teaching to have time with family and invest in the lives of kids.   \n\nI love it.  
3	None of your choices have to be permanent. If you pick something and find it’s not striking your fancy, it’s totally okay to change. I spent 6 years getting a PhD in Genetics and doing a post doc in chemistry before switching careers to be in politics. It’s been seriously awesome getting to learn so many different things in wildly different careers. ENTJs love to be successful and in control of their career - but you can do that without being tied down in a career. 
3	When I was younger, one of the things I struggled with a lot was having to make decisions without all the data at hand. One thing I realized through the last 10 years of trying to figure out what I want to do - that most times, you can only get the data you need through experiencing things. Don’t know where to start? Try doing something in that area. If it seems like a good direction, keep trying things in that area. If it does not, try something else.\n\nOne thing that helped me a lot throughout the last 10 years (I’m 28 now fwiw) of figuring out what I want to do is my lack of ability to lie to myself. (And trust me; it was a winding path to say the least.. I went from wanting to be a lawyer, to a UN / NGO staff, to political think tanks, to a sociology professor, back to a lawyer again, and then finally ended up with doing my masters in HCI and now I’m a designer at one of the big tech companies working on conversational AI). But that led me to where I am, which is right where I want to be, for a long, long time. Lots of people will tell you what you need to make yourself happy; only you will know and can decide that for yourself. Your North Star (especially if you’re an ENTJ) is going to look vastly different from the majority, so keep that in mind when soliciting advice from different people. Also, sometimes people do tell you the same lies they’re trying to tell themselves.\n\nIn the same way that faith becomes stronger only when you question it, the same goes for professional direction. I don’t think there’s a problem with being professionally directionless; that’s where all of us start. I think it’s an issue if you stagnate there, which doesn’t sound like your situation.
2	I feel like I did it backwards. I kept finding myself at the top of ladders I hadn't intended to climb, earnt enough money to start asking what I was earning money *for* and realising I had no purpose outside of work. So I thought, what do I spend most of my time doing and what am I passionate about outside of work? Honestly, it boiled down to arguing with strangers on the internet, researching laws, scrutinizing government policy, and discussing social issues. So I went back to uni to study public policy. Not sure what sector I'll end up working in, but I'm open to starting from the bottom and pursuing something in this field, with the potential for non-profit, politics and government, or revolving door into the private sector. If you're really passionate about something look at ways you can turn it into a job, or what's around in that field.
2	Computers were the only thing I was naturally good at.  \n\n(Also, don't get into IT.  Trust me.)
1	I am in a lot different of a situation. Ever since I could remember I've wanted to be a pilot. Flash forward to a month ago(to the day actually lol) and I get my private pilots liscense at 17, along with my ground instructor certifications and get hired by my flight school. I will be continuing on with my training and earning the rest of my hours and certificates required for the airlines and corporate flying and hope to have it done by the end of college.\n\nSo to answer your questions, I've just always been drawn to flight and I absolutely love being in the cockpit, it was that feeling that's driven me towards this since I was young. That does seem to be a common theme amongst pilots though, when were young were just "bitten by the aviation bug" as they say. I am obviously just stepping into the beginning phase of this career but like I said earlier I truly do love it. However, I did and still had my doubts about if this is what I wanted. As I got older I was able to see the potential turn offs with the career and had a growing number of things that also interested me, but for now I will continue to pursue being a pilot. Later down the line I may switch to another career and make flying a hobby or have some other side business or activity while flying(senior pilots can end up with a lot of free time). So no I dont think it's bad or wrong to have trouble figuring out what to do with your life, it's a big decision but I think it comes down to figuring out what youd be happy doing, whether it's the actual job that makes you happy or the success that comes with it. With that being said I think it's also equally important not to over stress about it and keep in mind that you can always follow a new path if you become unsatisfied. 
1	What are your degrees?\n\nI had no difficulty picking a major because there were a few things that I was good at and liked very much (like math, tech) and it happens to pay ok, so it was a no-brainer.\n
8	Read	If you're like me, you've been an overly observative and critical person, quick to point out people's faults. In times of haste, I can also forget to observe my own behavior and whether or not what I am doing is right. Hypocritically, I am quick to point out whenever others are doing the same. \n\nReading "How to Win Friends and Influence People" by Dale Carnegie will help those like me. So far, the book has helped me understand social interactions and how to truly gain control of the people around you. It isnt by force, it's by cooperation. 
7	Honestly, we need more people like you. It bothers me that we are the ones who have to change to care for people sensitivities when all we are trying to do is move the project forward as fast as possible. 
13	35 and depressed for the first time.	I've always been a very happy, look on the bright side of things kinda gal. Even after my mother passed away, 7 years ago, I was able to keep a happy outlook. This year has been different. I feel depressed all the time. Trying feels worthless.  I've never felt this way. I've always had hope but I can't find it now. Is it an age thing? someone help me feel normal please. I hate feeling sad all day. I want to enjoy life again. 
6	You could have the [SAD](https://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/seasonal-affective-disorder#1)s. Not saying it is *the answer*, but a possibility or contributor.\n\nEdit: Did not know that was ad ridden. Try this [wikapedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_affective_disorder) instead.
3	A frustrating thing about depression is that it can come from many sources. Pretty much like a stomachache, you can get it if you ate something spicy or you're having diarrhoea. Trying to find the source of depression is a way to start tackling it. Is there a change in your life recently that you might think may be the cause of depression? Or is it a slow accumulation of negative stuff that eventually broke the camel's back? \n\nIf you still cannot find the source of the issue, how about changing your life bit by bit just to see what works better for you? Depression is simply having no energy to do anything. Just by a small act of changing or spicing up your life, isn't it as good as fighting depression?
2	Entj here - I found the book 'feeling good' by David burns really helpful- I got it from a Reddit recommendation, and it is often recommended. It's very logical, practical and actionable ( very entj) . I hope you start feeling better soon- I've had long struggles with depression and it is awful 
2	Hey, fellow ENTJ here. I am by no means depressed, but I do have days when I just feel like giving up, like it’s no use, and I just want to cry but of course I don’t know how to. \n\n\nSo aside from all the physical advice that has been given (which I feel is fundamental), aside from considerations regarding your past and what might have triggered depression, I would like to add one thing : what about your future ? As an achiever, future oriented, I have come to realise that my present self is very (very) sensitive to long term prospects, even if I haven’t thought about them in weeks. I need to know that I have a plan, not only for the next three years, but for my whole life. And it also works at a micro level : if I have a party planned on the weekend, I’ll spend a great week. If I don’t have anything cool planned for the next month, I’ll be having some of those days. \n\nSo yeah, what are your long term goals ? Reevaluate those you have : they might not be fulfilling enough (career goals might be too... how should I say... empty ?). Personally, I know that starting a family one day, and assisting my children in becoming flourishing adults, is my lifetime goal that keeps me happy on the deepest levels, even on my worst days. \n\nI don’t know if that helps, hope it does... \n\nStay strong !
1	Try reading Unlimited Power. At least the first 3-4 chapters. I feel like it made me think a lot on how I communicate internally to myself, and that was and is still the root of my depression at times, but understanding that helps me\nHope all goes well for you either way, if you're going through hell keep going :)
1	Could be seasonal? I get down myself during holidays and recluse a lot and self reflect...
1	Has anything changed in the last year for you physically? Moderate exercise + a multivitamin won’t fix Major Depressive Disorder, but as someone with diagnosed MDD I can tell you that it does help. 
1	I'm like that now, I lost my job, not in a standard routine anymore, friends aren't around...\nthat's just me. \n\nBut I find there's usually reasons. \n\nI hope this helps
1	Very helpful!! Wow thank you for taking the time to list everything out.  I don’t take pills. Never have. I’ve always been mind over matter and in control.  I’ll put this list and self reflection in to play and see if I can shake this “funk”.  
1	There are many different physiological causes of depression. I would highly recommend you go to a doctor and get some bloodwork done. Get your thyroid checked and your vitamin D levels checked. If they want to put you on an antidepressant, ask for a referral to a psychiatrist first. Consider that Genesight test thing first before playing a delightful game of picking the right drug the first time.
1	So sorry. I remember going through two different episodes of depression and it was horrible. I was so different from my normal happy self that I felt incredibly lost. I also felt like I couldn't tell anyone because it was so different from what they expected. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe first time, things got pretty bad because I was depressed and had HORRIBLE anxiety. Therefore, I had to take medication. I got better but the side effects of weight gain made me miserable. Overall, I needed the help and the fog started to clear and my anxiety calmed down. \n\nThe second time, I rode it out because I refused to go back on medication again. I pinned a lot about my feelings on Pintrest, which did help. I was also more open about my feelings with friends. I didn't feel as alone the next time around and sooner than later I started to feel better. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHave you spoken to anyone at all about this? Would you be willing to go on medication, even temporarily, to help you?
1	I know it's probably not what you want to hear but check your diet
1	I went through a bout a 2 year phase of depression felt like life was going nowhere.. hopeless.. but then I just started focusing on myself and what I wanted and tried to stop caring what other people thought and began to find happiness again. I felt good to put my time to something and lead me to new friendships and experiences.

7	forgetful	so there's entj dude i particularly fancy.  \n\nIt's so dumb but I liked him from afar. I never really initiated conversations with him, or anything so I knew I wasn't immediately relevant to his life, but damn at least I thought he knew of my existence. Like we've met before. Several times. We've literally had a whole conversation about my name. A couple days ago I saw him and he acted like he's never even seen me before. He shook my hand and everything saying, "it was real nice to meet you." Like wtf. I'm so confused because I know he knows who I am or at least has seen me before. We've met, several times prior. We've had whole conversations before. He told me he liked my name, he'd stare at me intensely from across the room regularly. Then all of a sudden he comes out of no where and asks me if I was new to the school. so trippy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo entjs have particularly bad memory, or is it just this dude?
23	Not in a rude way, but sometimes if I don’t have any interest in someone or they don’t stand out to me in any way, I COMPLETELY forget meeting them. 
13	Yes. We have Si trickster which can make us forgetful, with crappy short term memory. It's also possible he's just being a jerk.
12	Is this the guy you are willing to sell t-shirts for so he can run for all positions of government for? The hot, smart, and awesome guy? He doesn’t even remember your name after all these conversations and you throwing yourself at him?\n\nMove on already. Desperation doesn’t look good on anyone. This has got to be a troll...
4	I can attest I am particularly forgetful. Most short term things will go in one ear and out the other. 
3	If you like this guy, go and talk to him. Get him on whatsapp or facebook. Chat there for a bit. If you like him, then ask him on a date. You can't live life in fear and running away from things. It is that easy. And if he says no? Is not interested? Then just move on. You already will be stronger and be set up much better for next time. You can do it!
4	Well we don’t feel close to people in general and if we do it generates an intense positive feeling. This, I guess he is not interested.
3	If it's names, I will literally always forget them the first time unless they're unique or the person made a major impression the first time I met them. If I've only met a person a couple of times I will usually remember their face but not their name. Seems like this dude is just forgetful tbh. Also, it's possible he said "it was real nice to meet you" in the same way someone says "goodbye" and we respond "you too" awkwardly.
3	I am incredibly forgetful. I rely quite heavily on my calendar. I am most forgetful at small things and other people’s lives unfortunately. When it comes to my work/hobbies I have quite a good memory though. 
3	If I don't write things down, I usually forget them. I take notes in google calendar, and every client I meet I'll write their name down along with a note about them. For me it usually takes meeting someone a few times to feel comfortable around them and really remember. 
17	Emotional vulnerability	When we show our vulnerability to a special one but the emotions are not reciprocated, we withdraw and turn cold and distant, and personally I would wait till I recover emotionally and get back on track with that person.  I am pretty sure it’s because of our Fi function being one of the last two cognitions functions. Do you guys go through the same thing? Or do you react differently? And how do you recover from it?
13	I just let it fester until it makes me bitter and then I like to add in an additional emotional outburst. 
9	True friendship is basically a mutual exchange and acceptation of weaknesses. Many (me included) think that it is a prerequisite to a healthy love relationship.
5	I've been here before: [http://mbti-resources.tumblr.com/post/156272705006/entj-inferior-fi-grips](http://mbti-resources.tumblr.com/post/156272705006/entj-inferior-fi-grips) \- the 9th circle of hell. Because of that I'm pretty protective of my emotions and allowing myself to be vulnerable and it's a primary reason why my standards are so high with the company that I keep.   \nWhen I get emotionally vulnerable and it's dismissed or rejected, I tend to rationalize anything and get competitive to regain control of some sense of power in the short term and it makes for quick, hasty and sometimes not the best decisions. That's something I'm working on personally, but self reflection has taught me to sleep on things and let the long term be a goal. 
7	Yes, definitely. For this to happen is exceptionally painful for us. However when it will be reciprociated, the created bond will be immense.\n\nMy 2 closest friends, with whom I am emotionally vulnerable value our friendship very highly. It's worth it when it'll work out. 
12	There was a post on r/MBTI where someone typed over a hundred musicians and not one was an ENTJ. Why are we so underrepresented in the arts?	https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/a8m9z5/typing_musicians/?st=JQ2V0FCS&sh=9d47de32
22	we probably tend not to feel like it’s Practical enough to pursue as a career and/or we just happen to be better at other things. i’m a singer and i’ve done a ton of theatre but even tho i love them both with all my heart i’d never pursue them for a living 
19	because art is emotional and emotions suck\n\ni like to draw\n\ni don’t like to feel emotion, but i sure like to draw it
8	Probably because a lot of you try not to care about what you value (Fi). Neglecting your own emotions is stupid imo, because Fi is a great motivator. Think of all the entrepreneurs that used their own values to drive them to success. \n\nFi is dope because you don’t really have to reason with it. Quit creating an imbalance with your Te and Fi by Te-ing the fuck out of everything you heartless fucks
14	Lmao, you're all acting like: Emotions are irrational... Emotions are meaningless... Emotions suck...\n\nDon't undervalue emotions, I'm sure you think about the performance of emotions in business and logical situations (which are awful), but think about art, revolutions, changes in the economy, crisis, etc. They all involved emotions in a great measure. \n\nEmotions helped us surviving in primitive times where logic didn't helped and being so afraid that you were full of adrenaline helped you. Feeling empathy with that other human who was being assaulted by a wolf and you helped him which gave you a chance to join to his tribe and having a home. Feeling love with that woman which made you reproduce with her and share your gens. \n\nYou see that are tons of situations where emotions are a must have like social, spiritual or artistic ones. \n\nIn conclusion, don't undervalue emotions just because they are meaningless in business and logical situations, that is like testing a fish's performance into climbing trees.\n\nI'm an ENTP btw.
3	As much as I love practicing art as a hobby, it’s too abstract for me and doesn’t involve a lot of goal orientation. \n\nThe best artists are those who can just chill and “let the flow come to them”. I don’t want the flow to come to me... I wanna chase and capture the fucking flow! 
2	Because Fi in ENTJs is not exactly their strong suit and Fi is tied to self expression. My ENTJ friend used to do cover songs and insisted on simply copying them one to one because it was "objective" to do so. He was unable to appreciate other covers of the same song that brought an original flair to them (and which ended up being very popular). Ironically, he was objectifying someone's emotions as a logical system (the person who made the original song). 
2	I've always enjoyed making art as a child but I was always discouraged find my sister who claimed that I would be a starving artist. I finally bit the bullet a year-and-a-half ago, I declared myself and artist and within less than a year I had my first group show at one of the best galleries in the Hamptons. Follow your dreams.
2	Those aren't real musicians in the first place...\n\nPlenty of composers could be described as having very ENTJ-like personalities. Wagner, for example, was absolutely an ENTJ.
4	We're not quite as emotional as a type - not to say we're unemotional but you know what I mean. \n\nFor my part, I feel I'm creative in different ways. I can still write music, but as a session musician I focus on technical solutions such as running Ableton sessions alongside performing. Perhaps it's just not an area ENTJs go into, or if they do they may not be the 'star', the latter guess depending on the sample set typed in the other thread.
3	To my knowledge jay z is one of us. They list Lil Wayne as a predominant introverted feeler, his music is highly Se. so that list may not be accurate.
1	Halsey's an ENTJ though (apparently) 
1	I am an ENTJ and I draw, dance, paint, play music, sing, creatively write and am very much perceived as an artist type but I’m a 51-49 split between J and P. So I apply the iron ENTJ fist to creative projects but can also go to work and shut my creative part out and be empirical/lead groups and then go home and spin poi in my backyard which serves absolutely no purpose it is just fun and relaxing and I’m not even good at it and draw nonsense for hours. Above all else my main talent is writing fiction *shrugs*
1	I am a musician. (Not in like modern music or anything but I have composed many pieces and an fluent in multiple instruments). I suppose I am an xntj, so I don't really count and also you probably are talking about modern music, but still thought it was worth mentioning. Weird that entjs are not as common. I saw a post on intj Reddit about how contradictory to what most people think, intjs and art are more common than most think and a fair amount responded saying that they were interested in some form of art too. And because intjs are a minority type, I suppose it makes sense that they made up a small portion of the group. Still really surprised that there were no entjs. Weird. 
1	Because ENTJs are square
1	Why do people come in here trying to get ENTJs to be all emotional and more into art. That isn't what ENTJs are.
-13	Because we're the only type intelligent enough to realize emotions are irrational and hold no value? Art's gay and it's why I hate ISFPs and INFxs so much.
7	What do you dream about?	I’m wondering if we can see any patterns in what kinds of dreams ENTJs experience when sleeping. Please let me know about the themes of your dreams, the people in them and also what your nightmares are like! \n\nPersonality I almost constantly dream about social situations and dating. \n(I remember a lot of dreams because I have sleeping problems and wake up once at night usually. )\n\nIn my nightmares I tend to run away from bombs, have my dog get shot or just get a creepy vibe from someone and find out they’re evil.
8	I don't remember my dreams very often. When I do (maybe only 4-5 times a year) they're normally nightmares about the world ending. It tends to involve random family members and a few "made up" people. 
6	Thriller like fights, missions, various escapes. Logical puzzles. Basically Dan Brown novels with time travel.\n\nThese used to be 90%+ nightmares, but as I've worked to be braver and more competent IRL I think only about 20% are nightmares or even less now. 
4	my dreams are usually about (or at least include elements of) the book(s) i’m reading. that, or those memories from the back of your mind that you’re aware of but not thinking about. 
4	Lots of natural disaster and end of the world dreams where I'm trying to save the people I'm with or get to them to safety. Occassionally parallel universes, and big complex houses.
4	A lot of my dreams are crazy fantasy. A lot of time some kind of post apocalyptic, A LOT of “level” dreams. \nA recurring one I have is a war of owl-people hybrids that begins with a cave and then ends in an all out war in a fantasy city. \n\nAnother is another fantasy city and I am a vampire human hybrid, being chased by hunters, and it ends in a bomber being thrown at me.\n\n\nThen I have normal dreams of normal events with my current crush at the time. 
3	A mashup of everything happened recently, which make me waking up tired.\nBrain, Y U No let me rest during sleep?
2	I was thinking about types and dreams the other day, also. Some dreams are very common to most people - teeth falling out, going back to high school, appearing naked in a public setting, etc. \n\n\nI tend to have a lot of dreams about water, and I've had those dreams for years and years.  Some examples:\n\n\n-Sliding down a rocky river, sort of like a really long water slide. Usually will have family or friends with me and they are having a good time. It's usually sunny and nice outside.\n\n\n-Being engulfed by a huge, wide turbulent river. It is usually cold out, cloudy, the trees have no leaves on them. Other people are in the water with me, sometimes I know them, sometimes I don't. Feels very tense. Sometimes unpleasant stuff is hidden in the rivers.\n\n\n-Swimming in the deep ocean. Usually I can breathe underwater. Feels whimsical, lots of bright and deep colors. Sometimes there will be whales or other creatures. Rarely scary.\n\n\n-Arctic ocean, water is still and black. Always there is something lurking in the water. Occasionally it will turn out to not be scary, but most of the time that black, icy water is terrifying.\n\n\nI also have a ton of end of the world type dreams, but I read and watch a lot of dystopian-themed stuff. When I was younger, I would have a lot of dreams where I was a gladiator or fighter.
2	Often about being in a relationship.  Sometimes I'm dating, sometimes I'm married.
2	[deleted]
2	I have this one dream a lot (maybe once a month?), usually as I'm falling sleep, where I'm doing something where I'm falling to the ground, always in different situations, but then it goes slow motion. The ground slowly gets closer and closer and I know it's going to hurt the same even though I'm falling slower.  I can't do anything about it, so all I can do is watch the ground, getting closer and closer in dread. Finally right about as I'm about to hit the ground I jolt awake and I immediately jolt my arms and legs into the air so quickly still thinking that I'm about to hit the ground. Other than those dreams, I actually do remember a lot of them but usually they are totally crazy or based on reality. In the reality dreams a lot of little things go wrong. Crazy ones are usually good dreams. Reality ones usually not necessarily nightmares but just about working through a lot of little things that go wrong. There are also a few dreams I get from time to time about logical puzzles I can't solve. Occasionally I get a dream about action and thrill and adventure. These ones tend to be more nightmare like. 
2	> In my nightmares I tend to run away from bombs\n\nI think this is an indication that you are not actually sleeping 100%. I have this crap too where instead of restring I am constantly solving a problem, when I should be passed out.\n\nFigure out if you have sleep apnea. Maybe use Melatonin. Do exercise. Make sure that your room is actually dark at night and not noisy.\n
2	A lot of dreams where I can’t control things. Like I have a lot of dreams where I’m inside of a car that’s flipped and going over a cliff and I just have to be okay with dying. It’s actually very therapeutic to have that dream sometimes. It makes me feel okay with not having control. And then sometimes I have dreams where I’m back in school (I’m 26 and just graduated from grad school with a master’s)—usually middle school or high school or college and I have a test that I have to take and I’m not ready for it at all.
2	I don't laugh anymore, struggle to have conversations with people, when others find things hilarious I struggle to laugh a little even if I find it funny. I don't know how to enjoy myself and see happiness. How do I fix this?	I feel like I'm just surviving and not living. I'm by no means a pessimist, I'm just stuck in a hell of a rut and I don't know how to deal anymore.
2	So you are depressed. Why not start looking for a solid specialist that you would connect with?
6	What is the main difference between Fe and Te?	After many years, I am still trying to figure out if I am an ENTJ or ENFJ. 
17	One has 26 protons, and the other 52.
2	Fe is the most empathetic function.\n\nTe is similar but is going to be partial to thoughts, concepts and ideas.  So not true empathy by definition but mechanically similar.
3	ENFJ’s first function is Fe meaning that primarily they are concerned with keeping the peace in relationships, and making others happy while not expecting much in return. ENTJ’s first function is Te meaning what comes first to them is organizing systems and ideas in their head , unplanned events, sorting things into categories and executing activities that need to be done. Both are very different, since an ENTJ’s  very last function in the function stack is Fe, their Fi ( inferior) feeling comes before Fe. Hope this helps 
7	What do you do when you can't relate to your friends anymore?	I'm at a loss over what to do; I've been hanging around them lately, and it just seems like I'm in a totally different world from all of them.\n\nI think it's got something to do with my diagnosis for ADHD in December of last year; see, the role I played with my friends was that I was the goofy, sarcastic guy who cracked a lot of potty jokes. I'd say I was the comic relief, of sorts.\n\nBut in the past year, there's been a serious shift away from the mindset. With medication, a whole new side of me comes out that wasn't there before. Yeah, I can crack jokes like before, but it's like now, I have my own voice and there are legitimate goals and aspirations that weren't there before. I'm finding fault with things that I either loved or didn't mind before - unhealthy food, social media, etc. In other words, there's structure to my mind that wasn't there before.\n\nI think also, when I think back, that it felt like they didn't take me seriously BECAUSE I cracked the jokes I did. I think they still see me in that light, and I'm not sure if I have the energy to change their thoughts on me all that much. I mean, I know I've changed, people at school see me in the right light...do these guys really matter?\n\nAnyway, where was I going with this...OK, so, I can't relate to them anymore. What do I do?
8	People outgrow other people all the time. All of my close friends came from different friend groups they eventually grew out of and there’s nothing wrong with that. \nMy advice to you: see what the new dynamic is, do you have a place in your friend group or have you simply changed too much. It’s alright if you need to focus on yourself, your work and your new social life dynamic. Wish you success. Keep us posted. 
2	I came on Reddit to find the perfect post I can relate to and I did . This one . I just got done with a friend having a heated discussion.  The thing is I have outgrown so many people and the ones that pretend to care only like you as much as you make them comfortable. \n\nI don’t make anyone comfortable it seems . So what I can say is this ... revel in it shine your light and the ones who do respect you will come onto your path... focus on being comfortable breaking away from all That drains you work on your relationship with yourself ... you outgrew them for a reason . 
1	>do these guys really matter?\n\nIn the simplest terms: no more than strangers.\n\nThey once mattered, but the person you were then was the person who needed/wanted those friends around. But friends don't have to be around until death do you part. You grow, you change as a person, your friends change with you.\n\n> What do I do?\n\nFind new friends. It's okay to not want to be friends with your friends anymore. Find friends who you can relate to. This is just a sign you're maturing. Those who stick their comfort zone and never change friends find it harder to grow and develop. Good on you for wanting to grow and to develop. Now go out there and find new friends who are on the same wavelength as you.
1	People change. When they stop being useful to me I usually make soap out of them.
25	ENTJs here who speak (or used to speak) really fast ?	People always tell me I talk too fast and I can't get out of that habit.
19	I used to do the same. For me it came from a place of insecurity. When you speak slower, and softer, you can actually force people to listen more closely to understand you. 
17	Me exactly, since I have too many ideas and plans in my mind, and I’m too impatient for them
10	I speak as fast as my ideas come. When I have a lot, I often will skip over words that make actual sentences, kind of like only typing key words into a google search
5	I have had this issue also, I’ve had to consciously slow down my conversational pace and it’s taken a fair bit of practice and sometimes I still speak very quickly especially if I’m really fired up about something. 
4	I talk fast 'cause I think fast and if you want to get yourself out of this situation, you're going to have to act fast.  If I am curt with you, it's because time is of the essence.  -  Winston Wolf - Pulp Fiction -  Classic ENTJ
3	YESS and my best friend is also ENTJ so the two of us just bounce back and forth at bullet speed. but i do have another friend who’s ENFP and she talks almost as fast as the two of us...
2	Not entj, but yes. Really fast.
2	Yeah i speak really fast and end up on different tangents 
2	Yes. I do whenever im impatient or have a lot of energy.
2	I do speak relatively fast, and even faster when I'm pretty energetic..\nYou can learn to be slower by learning to relax, be less anxious and also try to have a certain adaptability to the person you're talking to, depending on how fast they talk/understand.
2	used to be a BIG problem. then i practiced speaking for half an hour every day like a good Te dom
2	People should learn to keep up! 
1	OMG I’m in the middle of dictating a PowerPoint and I’m amazed I can fit an entire statement into 2-3 seconds. I have to slow down! 
1	Yes. I've always been told this is a problem of mine, as a kid and now. 
1	Guilty 
1	I used to speak too fast and I still do if I forget to remind myself. When you speak succinctly and with pauses, it garners much more respect in the business world. Communication is about getting a message across. Just because we think faster, doesn't mean we should deluge people with too much information that they can't comprehend. 
1	I'm guilty of this 
1	It used to come from a place of insecurity and avoiding tribe hate, but then it became more so, just because my brain went that fast and I couldn't bear going slower. 
1	I speak really fast because I want to be efficient in getting my ideas out as quickly as possible to have them implemented. I also try to be fast and concise because I want to respect other people’s time when I’m talking to them.
1	Like ... faster than Ben Shapiro?
1	ben shapiro
3	running for every government position in America	so i have a crush on my entj guy friend who's really into politics and debate. in a conversation we had, i suggested that he run for every government position in office in the entire united states of america because of how awesome, smart, and hot he is. he smirked, called me silly and continued with the conversation. \n\nso i was just wondering if i raised enough money for his campaign to run for every government position in america, would he have respect for me and retaliate the feelings i have for him? i plan on selling t-shirts with his face on it in order to raise the money. how much money would i need for a campaign this big?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nas ENTJs, would you be inclined to respect me and love me because of my drive and big picture thinking? how should i go through with this?
21	is this a shitpost!?!?
4	This is the stupidest post I've seen all day.\n\nIf this isn't a shitpost, your crush is right, you're acting stupid and probably annoying him.
5	Drop the subject.\n\nHe's going to be remain "your crush" because you're going to come off as clingy in the very least if you don't drop it.  DO NOT MAKE SHIRTS WITH HIS FACE!  Unless it's part of a joke, that he's in on, and agrees to t-shirts... absolutely do not do this.\n\nBeing interested in politics/debate is completely different then wanting to take on the jobs.  Plenty of people are interested in politics/debate.\n\n> i suggested that he run for every government position in office in the entire united states of america because of how awesome, smart, and hot he is.\n\nAnd that's why he didn't take it seriously.  One doesn't run for all offices (not at once at least).  Awesome is subjective and attractiveness is absolutely irrelevant.  And your likely bias on how smart he is due to being attracted to him.\n\nHow much money?  Well if running for every office, you'll probably just need to win the jackpot in a lotto.  Though you could probably get away with far less, as there's likely a lot of waste in the spending, here's what your looking for https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_finance_in_the_United_States\n\nAs an ENTJ, no I wouldn't.  You want to get my attention, you need to be successful.  Strong, independent types.  I want a teammate not a sidekick.\n\nHope this helps.
2	Absolutely not. You’ll be a drooling “notice me, senpai,” fangirl!\n\nAre you for real?
2	Lol, this is cute. Find another way. Don't bow to him.
2	[deleted]
1	His qualification are how awesome, smart, and hot he is? \n\nI agree with your bf; you are silly. Or this is a shitpost. And no, this conversation kind of does the opposite of getting people to respect you. Lol.
1	I've personally found that I don't like cheerleaders, I prefer equals and if I'm going to be in a relationship, it'll be with someone that I find potential in to grow and shape; not the other way around. We don't need the growing or the push, we'll do it ourselves and if we're not doing it to those we choose, then we have an equal. Your big picture thinking is selfishly driven and for you - ours is holistically driven. 
5	What happened?	Hello, I'm an INTP girl who hung out with an ENTJ guy a few weeks ago. When we first met, he came up to me randomly in a fast food place and somehow, considering how standoff-ish I can be, we had a pleasant conversation. I even thought he was a fuckboi at first because guys just don't come up to me. Anyways, we traded social medias and we talked about everyday. Which is quite outstanding because I'm a terrible texter. Now, I will say that even though we communicated everyday, I would take 1 sometimes 2 hours to respond because I was busy doing what most INTPs do, which is nothing. After texting everyday for maybe 1 week, we met up again to hang out. We had an amazing conversation to say the least. We talked alot about philosophy and our way of thinking. I'd never talked to a guy about the topics we delved in to. We even had a great time talking about PAST relationships, which they say you should never do, but we learned so much about each other. After talking for maybe 2-3 hours, he said he had to go. He said he'd text me back later that night to talk again and gave me a hug. He never texted back. I texted him the next day, but this time he would open the message and not respond for an hour. He didn't do this before. So I figured he just needed time to be to himself. After a couple days he texted me first but our conversations ended after maybe 3 exchanges because he wouldn't respond. 1 week goes by and he ends up messaging me saying he was "thinking about me" but even after I responded more immediately, he still ended the convo after a couple exchanges. That was the last time we texted, and it was 3 weeks ago. I guess I'm just confused because I feel like I turned him off somehow but idk what I did, if I even did anything. Should I try messaging him again? Or just leave it alone because he isn't interested anymore?\n\nSorry if there are any grammar mistakes, I was in a hurry. 
9	Not sure this is what happened to you but as an ENTJ I’ve been on long dates where I talked  about my life and philosophy for hours but the whole time mentally I’ve decided I don’t want a second date. I love chatting with people and don’t know how to cut things off sometimes even if I’ve decided I never want to see them again. 
6	You never know what might be going on someone’s life. As an INTP, it’s natural to attempt to figure everything out endlessly analyzing every tiny bit and detail of information. Especially so when it comes to people, due to the uncertainty involved, and double especially so with people you’re romantically interested in, due to the ego. \n\nThe hardest thing to do sometimes may be to recognize and accept when we can’t solve something with our minds. \n\nMy personal read is that you’ve been downgraded to the backburner, or maybe “friendzoned”. Or perhaps his interest was only lukewarm from the beginning anyway. But my guess is as good as anyone else’s. Whatever the case, it’s painful, and I’m sorry sister. Don’t blame yourself. \n\nAnd wow - if you only take an hour or two to respond to people, you’re at least two orders of magnitude better than me. 
3	No I don't think he lost interest in you at all. I'm an INTP with an ENTJ who is awesome and I can't say enough good things about him and how compatible INTP and ENTJ are together, but I can tell you that if you cool off to him because you think he's shelved you into the friend-zone, he will eventually feel rejected which is something he hates and won't soon forget. If I were you just get used to his erratic texting cause ENTJ is always busy doing like ten million things but if they keep texting you that's a definite sign he's still into you and is just weighing your long-term potential and the cost-benefit of being in a new relationship with you. Now, as an INTP that may be scary to hear 'long-term' when you're just getting to know this guy (I can completely relate) but no matter how intense he seems it's totally worth it to see where this goes, just hang in there. 
2	I’d suggest to invite him to go out and do something fun or have a date. Sometimes texting just doesn’t cut it for me and I’d rather save all the things I text about for when I’m out with a person.\nThere’s no doubt about whether you’ll get along outside of the texting realm, but if he turns you down with an “I’m busy”, then forget about it.
1	could sth u said about ur past relationship warned him?
1	He noticed something he did like and moved on 
3	Work vs. School	I am 16, and I still haven't really worked a day in my life, which is quite bothering me, maybe for no reason at all. It's not that I'm not doing anything with my life. I've been playing the piano for 8 years, learning Chinese, Working out, Excelling at School and all that stuff that I need to say to suppress my inner need for people to think I am smart.\n\n The thing is, all of this has been made possible by my amazing parents, which pay for my tutoring and support me in everything I choose to do. As time goes on I see kids around me start to work in all sorts of things, and develop partial financial independence. Every time I hear about other kids working and earning money I have this twinge of guilt that I am not working myself. That I am such a "burden" on my parents.\n\nI have discussed this topic with them and asked their opinion. They both wholeheartedly agree that I should keep putting my effort in school and extracurricular activities and that I will have enough time to work throughout my whole life. Something in me is still not satisfied. I feel afraid that if I don't work at this age I won't have the work ethic needed to succeed later on in life, or the experience with a work environment. \n\nI am aware that this is an extremely privileged dilemma to have. I have the opportunity to choose and balance things, but which is more important? Do I need to sacrifice some of my study time or piano time to work?\n\nThe basis of this insecurity is in my environment, which makes me feel like I'm not good enough because I have no financial independence. It's me trying to be perfect at everything and the cost of that.\n\nDid any of you have similar dilemmas? How were you dealing with things when you were 16? Am I just overthinking a very simple dilemma like I always do?\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts
3	despite everything, idk how it is for you in China but in Germany if you don‘t have work experience it‘s extremely hard to find a job later on. most employers don‘t want someone smart who‘s only learned everything in theory, but someone who has practical experience too. but you‘re still young, i‘d say go for work experience once you‘ve turned 18
3	Hey man, I relate strongly with this. This was me the moment I turned 18 and took on student loan debt. I constantly obsessed over the fact that if I died while in debt, I’d have contributed a net loss to the economy. \n\nEvery single day of my college life, I just wanted it to be over ASAP so I could start making money immediately and stop leeching off society, in my view. \n\nWhat I’m going to ask you to do is look at this 100% rationally. \n\nFirst, consider this: what skills do you have right now? What is the greatest value you could possibly create for society *right now*?\n\nThink on it carefully and thoroughly. \n\nThen, consider the same question. Except, replace “right now” with, “over the course of your entire life.”\n\nWhat is the greatest value you can create, *ever*? Given your entire lifetime of acquiring mastery over skills, resources, and relationships?\n\n\n\nIf you have any ounce of optimism in your future (which I suspect you do), then your answer to your second question should dwarf your answer to the first to the point where the two are completely incomparable. \n\nRecognize that your need for contributing RIGHT NOW is an *emotional* need. A noble need to have, but an emotional one nonetheless. Does sacrificing your future to do something now ultimately serve your greatest goals, or does it undermine them?
1	What are you good at? You could start working for yourself part time over the internet. this way you can decide whether it is 1 hour per week or 10 or 20. Are you in China?
4	What ENTJ subtype are you? (test included)	Are you an extroverted intuitive or an extroverted thinker? Perhaps a thinking judger or an intuitive judger? These are apparently the 4 possible subtypes for the ENTJ according to Erik Thor. He has a personality test on his webpage that takes just under 10 minutes to complete. Here are my brief results.\n\nThe Searching Performer https://imgur.com/a/hVTUQi4\n\nObservant, Stress State, Seeker https://imgur.com/a/yGrTj1k\n\nI think my result, although interesting didn't surprise me much, an extroverted intuitive. I have always scored higher on Ni than on Te in socionics, perhaps that's what elevates my intuition. I can see a number of Lie-Ni getting a similar result. \n\nSo if you desire and are unafraid you can too find out whether you are an amazing, curious and innovative extroverted intuitive like me or the slightly lesser, borderline ESTJ version.\n\nHere is the link to the test:\nhttps://www.erikthor.com/test/personality-test-2/\n\nNOTE: To all ESTJs, and since most of you here after all are ESTJs - don't worry. You can take the test as many times as you want until you tweek your answers and get ENTJ. Good luck!
3	And I keep getting "INTJ"
3	The Searching Performer - Decider Subtype\n\n> The Decider subtype is focused on what is good and bad and what one ought to or ought not to do. Helpful, hard-working, inventive, they focus on problem solving, solutions, decisions and questions of what is right and wrong to do in a specific situation. Often goal oriented and focused on the task at hand. Like to be in charge and to design and control their surroundings and the people around them. Lead with Feeling or Thinking Judging or Perceiving.\n\nControl State\n> The control subtypes tend to have a high utilisation of the tertiary function. They are assertive and strongly aware of their strengths and abilities. They do their best to live up to others expectations on them and try to get praise and support from others. Confident but tend to be risk-avoidant and tend to avoid difficult situations.\n\nThe Doer – Thinking Judging\n> Hey! You show great talent for systems, planning, execution and management. You may do well in fields that require great control and organisation and knowledge of programs and tasks. You seem to be hard-working and resourceful, ambitious and goal-oriented. Learn more about thinking judging and how you can develop it here.\n\n
2	I got the same.\n\n
2	I got intj, probably cause I’m in a bad mood. Idk. 
2	How are most of us “ESTJ?”\n\nI just got ESFJ & I’ve taken the full MBTI (the official, paid version) 3 times & every time, I’ve gotten either ENTJ or ENFJ. \n\nMy T/F scale is 49/51 or 51/49 depending on the day. This makes sense to me.\n\nI was very confused & surprised when I got “ESFJ?”\n\nBut why, on an ENTJ sub would “most of us be ESTJ’s after all?” 
1	Still ENTP
1	Can you stop this?? I mean, who the FUCK care about whether they're ENTJ or ESTJ.\n\nCan you please stop identify other's personality without meeting them IRL??\n\nENTJ or ESTJ, both type have that small small feeling side, so show some maturity and STOP hurting everyone here, thank you.
0	Like normal I’m almost 50% on all, but always *NTJ. \n\nI think my mood effects whether the test goes I versus E. 
14	Dreaming?	*I’m on mobile this could be formatted weird, if so, sorry!\n\nI dislike sleeping. \nIt feels like a waste of time, and my dreams only feel inspiring less than a tenth of the time. \nI do lucid dream a lot, but it’s mostly something mundane like cutting apples in a white room or organizing my art supplies. \nI cannot hear, smell, or taste anything. I cannot feel anything, like if I were to cut myself while chopping those apples, I’d see the blood, but it wouldn’t hurt or anything. \nIt’s just something telling me while I’m organizing or whatever, “Hey bro, you’re not gonna remember this all that well. There’s no point in doing something cool. Just do what you’re doing.”\n\nAnyone else feel like this?
6	I think sleeping is great. Its a break from reality, so peaceful and tranquil. I think the key is that it is unstimulating which introverts prefer and extroverts shun from. Hence, the difference in opinion. \n
5	In regards to your dislike for sleep, I've said on multiple occasions that I believe sleep is a shitty trait that we should've found a way around, as its incredibly inefficient. In regards to dreaming, I struggle to ever dream. If I ever do, I hardly remember it.

1	You get a small amount of brain damage throughout the day that only sleep can cure. stay up long enough and you will be effectively drunk.  I suggest that you do sleep.
5	Entj	Hey guys I'm making a post because I think I've been an ENTJ and confused for about 25 years and I'm happy to be a part of the community
7	Welcome to the community! \n\n\- all MBTI types except real ENTJs 
3	Welcome! I felt very relieved to find out that I was an ENTJ, which explained a lot. 
3	All ENTJ's here - "Prove yourself!"   \nWelcome aboard.
1	I will post if this is false. Because I don't want to make a fool of myself. Also Hi lol
22	Christmas Party NIGHTMARE	A gaggle of xSxx talk to you for 30+ minutes about various facial creams and spa treatments, and you’re on your last spiked eggnog \n\nThere was no escape comrades 
11	I too, have known this pain. I was doing pretty well until I said that I'd used a night cream for the first time "Like an old lady" offending all of the night cream users within earshot. I also commented that I don't have wrinkles yet and I stay out of the sun to avoid sun damage, which caused visible discomfort to my fine-lined, sun-spotted companions. A few of them got botox and laser in the following weeks as a result. Worst small talker ever.
18	Learn to enjoy such light-headed chitchat. Smart people adapt to any kind of people.
6	Was it work related? I can't see any other scenario where an ENTJ would put up with this lol
1	Next time come heavy or not at all.
1	Take me as your date next time senpai <3

-2	I have said that many times. S are so needy and shallow. I cannot deal with them
3	INTP and ENTJ in bed	So, I'm an INTP girl whose dating an ENTJ guy and we have already slept together once. Before that, the sex was definitely built up with flirting and touching and foreplay and so on and so on. So, by the time it actually happened we were both extremely excited and couldn't hold back anymore. And, I love when the sex is built up like that because it just kept making me want him more and more. So, by the time, we finally made it happen, it was really exciting and overall very passionate. We ended up doing it four times in that one night. Not, gonna lie it was amazing! However, I had some draw backs about it that I finally told ENTJ guy about later on when we started flirting and talking about our next roll in the hay. He complained and rightly so that I was on my back missionary-style for most it. So, I told him that we can definitely work on that for next time, but that if he could slow it down (and by that I meant less animalistic and more tender which surprised me because for both the before/after he was very tender and affectionate as was I which is typical for me). And, then I told him how it was a little too rough at times and if he could be softer and gentler. He immediately said no problem. Which I kinda felt he would say anyway.\n\nSo, here's my question for the ENTJ community, this guy and from all the research I've read about your sign, all of you as a whole seem to be hyper-sexual and that I have no problem with I'm just wondering if ENTJ males act different when you love and care about a woman. Do your sexual inclinations become more affectionate and tender? I ask for two reasons, the first is that he was gentle and affectionate with me both before and after, and i loved it! I'm so cerebral and all in my head all the time so when I express myself in a sexual way it's always with closeness, hugs, kisses, caressing, touching, etc. I'm very affectionate behind closed doors in ways that I think might shock anyone who knows me in a non-sexual way. I like to feel close to my partner. So, as much as I totally enjoyed his energetic and vigorous love-making I'm concerned that it's a sign that he doesn't take me that serious and maybe sees me in a very objective way, in other words not long-term potential. And, let me add that I really like this guy. I think I could easily fall in love with him and while I'm not there yet I really want to be, so it would hurt to find out that he's just going to play around with me for awhile before being done and on to something or someone else.\n\nAdvise please?
8	you have nothing to worry about. entjs just like being aggressive. i'm aggressive as a female, so i can only  imagine a guy entj is the same except even more extremely so
3	I wouldn't worry, my relationship with my entj boyfriend started like this too. I was a little overwhelmed early on with how vigorous and rough he got during sex even though it always started and ended tenderly. I think it's a good sign, wild sexual passion--you want to feel that about a partner. :) it's taken us to some pretty crazy places. The best sex is a blend of aggression and tenderness imo. Can't imagine a better physical/emotional compatibility. You'll balance out over time (hopefully)\n\nYou should directly ask him if he's serious about you. He'll probably get more gentle with you if he cares deeply, but that aggressive drive will always be a part of him, thank fck ;)
1	( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\n\nINTP having sex? Are you sure you aren't a mistype? jk jk\n\n.\n\nHis behavior seems normal.\n\nIf you're curious whether he loves you, just ask him. Healthy ENTJ shouldn't have problems with being direct even in slightly uncomfortable for most NT types situations.\n\nGood luck!
1	The husband and myself are ENTJs and we are both aggressive. Don't worry about how aggressive the sex is and just put it towards passion. 
4	according to this chart.....entjs...?	according to this chart\nhttps://www.google.co.za/search?q=simplified+myers+briggs+type+compatibility+chart&tbm=isch&source=iu&ictx=1&fir=Y1f16oqE8ZvsoM%253A%252C-WPzHXRIEtVt4M%252C_&usg=AI4_-kRyHOB8BFAjRb_uoQhZq--uV5NZEw&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiC9MHJm7TfAhXPzIUKHRSjB5UQ9QEwAHoECAUQBA#imgrc=Y1f16oqE8ZvsoM:\n\n\n\nentjs are the most compatibal with most other types!\n\n\nso therefore logical by statistics.entjs should be the best at picking up women and women men.\n\n\nso entjs are you good at picking up the opposite sex?
13	CHAD MY GUY
4	Yeah most people are really easy 
3	Meh, I dated an INFP and we were oil and water.
3	No because I'm both female (dating's a bit harder for ENTJ ladies because the preponderance of men as far as I'm aware expect their female partner to play second fiddle instead of legitimately wanting her to have 50% of the control and power, and I WILL NOT tolerate that shit, particularly since I'm an abuse survivor.  Let this be a lesson to you, male ENTJs.) and oblivious to male interest (I have been the focus of interests that have been born and died without my knowledge, and did not find out about them until much too late, and I am dependent on Tinder and Bumble to figure out that men are actually interested.  Also, I tend to draw a lot of INF men, who are as far as I'm aware generally rather subtle).\n\nPeople have been legitimately surprised at how sparse my dating life is
1	Can u read charts properly? Wtf LOL
1	Every time I see your posts I cannot help myself. They're so funny.
26	How do i explain what i 'just know'?	So im prone to suddenly or instantaneously reaching conclusions and understanding deep concepts, sometimes without knowing how. I 'just know' and im almost always right, so much that i have come to trust myself deeply on this. In a work context this is fine as a manager, i mean at least it works because i dont have to explain my judgements or intuitions i can just give instructions, though it would be better to be able to explain it to subordinates in order to foster their learning or understanding.\n\nBut when it comes to having to make decisions in a team setting or having to try and explain things to superiors i really struggle. We could be talking about some problem in a meeting or a brainstorm session and i arrive at a point where i know exactly what needs to be done, i can articulate a set of instructions but i cannot always explain why its the optimal path. So as a consequence the team or my bosses dont follow my advice, i am unable to convince them because in that instant i am unable to lay out the pieces of information from my head in a succint, organised and coherent sequence for presentation to others. This doesnt happen all the time, maybe 4 / 10 times depending. But most of the time even when i do manage to convince i dont feel like i did a good enough job of conveying my ideas and that people are just letting me have my way because sometimes i come across as domineering. On email its no problem, i get time to unravel and curate. \n\nIm assuming many of you have this problem too? Is it the N part? Anybody have some tips or advice they could share?
20	I would practice articulating myself in a way that is sensible to the counterparty.\n\nUnfortunately for us N types - we don't live in a world of mind-readers that can carefully piece together the different substrates of thoughts that swirl around in our minds. Nor do we live in one where people care very much to understand something that is not immediately clear - against their convenience.\n\nBest strategy in a situation like this is to teach yourself to essentially "get the point across" as efficiently as possible. That takes understanding the person whom you are engaging, and a practice of our your own ability to articulate your thoughts well and succinctly.
6	There's no way around it, you have to rehearse explaining those things to yourself and others. Although you're probably right most of the time, you're not infallible. Reconstructing your thoughts and conclusions should help you better understand them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBtw it's more of a Ni problem, any type could question your judgement, even other Ni users. 
6	[https://www.truity.com/blog/intuitives-guide-getting-along-sensors](https://www.truity.com/blog/intuitives-guide-getting-along-sensors)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe are leftys in a righty world. 
3	Communicating your intuition is something that you will get better at with time and practice. If you can't articulate it in that moment, tell people you have a hunch about a certain path and want to ruminate on why it is the best path.\n\nSometimes I come back to people later with an addendum to something we discussed. Randomly, the insight of why I felt something was true will come to me.\n\nAnother thing that helps is visual aids. A good PowerPoint will help you break down the points and be easy for your coworkers to consume.
2	It’s true. We *are* always “right.”  :)
1	It's a skill that you just have to practice.\n\nYou happen to be good at letting your fast subconscious reach conclusions rather than your slow conscious mind.\n\nBut intuition isn't magic.  It comes from somewhere.  You have reasons for your intuition.  When someone asks for your reasons you just have to become good at reconstructing those reasons on the fly from the top down rather than the bottom up.  The first step is to trust that your intuition got you there by a solid path.\n\nThough, you often don't have to go that far.  After all, when you get to this point in the conversation you are talking about persuasion rather than a strictly logical argument.  A rhetorical, persuasive approach may be more than enough and perhaps even more effective in such situations.\n\nFor example, you have a flash of insight about how your group should move forward on a project.\n\n"Why do you think we should take that approach?" Meddlesome Person challenges\n\n"Well, because action is better than inaction and I haven't heard any better ideas.  Do you have one to share?"  \n\nYou don't have to explain anything and things get done.  People will learn not to tear down without having a solution of their own to present.\n\nIf you want to take a softer, more measured approach for political reasons there is no shame in admitting uncertainty.\n\n"Why do you think we should take that approach?" Meddlesome Boss Whom You Don't Want to Offend challenges\n\n"Well, it just feels right and I think it is important to make a decision and get started because of the cost of inaction.  But let me analyze the ins and outs because it is too important to leave to intuition alone.  I will think carefully about the alternatives and submit my thoughts and conclusions.  It won't hurt for the group to try to poke holes in it so we know what we are planning is correct.  That said, I want to reiterate that it is important to get started so I will get you that by close of business and hopefully, we can get everybody else's input by tomorrow afternoon so we can come to a consensus.  Agreed?"\n\nIf you want to inject your logic behind an intuition on the fly, a very effective persuasive technique, though you can practice by finding a conclusion you disagree with, a debate topic from high school speech and debate websites, for example, and practice building a solid argument starting from the conclusion.  
1	I close my eyes and raise my hands up like the Ancient Aliens guy and say, “it’s a long story how I know this but” and then just go full force. 
1	Even if you become your own boss, you still need to practice explaining things. Even to people who are under you. If they are competent, they would not want to just take your word for it. The things is that sometimes you would be wrong, so it is a good idea to spell things out. Maybe send this exact question to Jocko's podcast?\n
3	ENTJ x ESTJ	Anyone ever had a relationship with an ESTJ? Was it successful or did it fail and why?
2	ENTJ here, dated ESTJ for a couple months. Fell apart fast, but it could've been an age difference in play.\n\n1. She talked more than me, which I normally love, but it was always the exact same stories over and over which drove me crazy because I already heard it numerous times and nothing changed.\n2. She wanted to spend all of her savings to travel the world for a year and wanted me to join along with her, like I'm going to take off a year from my career and just "get another job" when I get back. No thanks\n3. She would get caught up too much in the moment and all I could think was chill out there is always tomorrow.\n4. She annoyed the shit out of me with pointless topics all the time, refer to point number 1.\n\nIt was awesome at first, but then it was this mindless pattern, she even asked me if it was a "chore" to hangout with her. I just told her we were on different levels of life and it wasn't a chore to hangout, but more like it was a chore to navigate boring and pointless conversation the entire night while she expected me to have any responses or feedback about the shit I already said.
1	Typing my husband	I think my husband might be a (somewhat introverted) ENTJ. Any telltale signs? How would I know I'm barking up the wrong tree?\n\nHe's a very practical person and sometimes is less than tactful by accident (Dominant T)\n\nI'm confused on the N or S though, because while he likes making long-term, somewhat convoluted projects, he's hyper-aware of his surroundings (at least compared to me).\n\nHe seems very much on the J side rather than P.\n\nP.S. I'm aware of cognitive functions, but I've got to take this one step at a time.
2	I would recommend not trying to do the dichotomies since they are useless unless the person is very far to one side. You don't have to jump straight to functions (though that's how you get highest accuracy), but you should at leasr look up the Keirsey temperaments (NT, NF, SP, SJ). This will hopefully narrow things down. I don't follow a procedure for typing people, though I usually start out very broad and then narrow it down slowly to ensure I'm not discarding possible types prematurely. The more you know about each type, the better you get at spotting nuance and asking better questions.
21	Building a dating site for ENTJs	We're building a dating site for people who are into personality theory because we believe compatible personality types have better chances of relationship success over the long term. Right now I'm looking primarily for NT types to help test the site. A good number of INFPs are already on the list -- a type that has been shown to be a great match for ENTJs -- but we still need a few more ENTJs to balance things out. Feel free to take our [5-point survey](https://melentp.typeform.com/to/EvaKNM) if you think you'd like to get involved.\n\n&#x200B;
12	Oh lord. I’d be happy to answer questions but your survey serves literally zero purpose other than gathering emails, weather this was the intent or not.
12	i wouldnt really date entj tbh
4	I don't mean to be negative, but OKC allows you to search by keyword - and you can just put in the type you want there. OKC will then populate results based off of percentage match. 
1	>We're building a dating site for people who are into personality theory because we believe compatible personality types have better chances of relationship success over the long term.\n\nIsn't that the basis of every dating site out there?
1	Ok this is epic
1	What is the source image for the form background? It's cool. I'm an ENTJ by the way and my most compatible type in reality has been an INTP. They are amazing when they are mature and reasonable. 
1	Do the other dating sites have similar analytics built into their algorithms? Myers-Briggs is a great thing to assess and match, but even as a fan I wonder how differentiated this new site is. Wish you luck nonetheless!
1	I have seen a few of these popping up recently and I can tell you nothing kills a dating site faster than not having enough active people on it.  Once you get it up and running for God's sake please make sure that you have an aggressive marketing campaign
2	Why do all of my employers treat me like a bad guy when I decide to move on?	Help me understand this people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am currently living in Poland (long story as to why, but I am from New Zealand) and a couple of years ago I had a management position here.  Anyway my contract was coming up to it's expiry date, and my employers had a habit of leaving people hanging until literally a day or two before the expiry date to let people know if they were going to be offered a new one.  They also had a history of letting people go at the last second in the same manner.  Anyway, they tried the same bs with me, and so I shopped around for some better offers, and I actually got offered a job with better pay, and so I approached them to let them know I had heard nothing about my contract, had been made an offer, and decided to take it.  For the whole time I was with them I was an upstanding worker, I was promoted twice during my tenure there, I smashed all of my targets, and they refused to write me a reference stating that I behaved unprofessionally by not giving them adequate notice.  In reality though my contract was expiring, so notice was not required.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward a couple of years, and I have decided it's time to head back home to NZ.  I informed my employer some time ago that I was considering this, and that I wasn't happy with things in the workplace (it all goes back to a few promises the CEO made me when he was trying to attract me from the previous place, and he never followed through, which I consequently called him out on and now he avoids me like wildfire).  Anyway, I gave them 1 month's notice (standard practice in PL) and today the CEO made a couple of announcements to the company, one congratulating someone on a promotion, and the other wishing another colleague good luck as he leaves at the end of Jan (just like myself).  What I noticed though is that he completely omitted me from the announcement, and he for sure knows I am also leaving.  I interpreted this as very passive aggressive/unprofessional behaviour.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have tried to objectively ask myself if I am the problem, but In both cases I know that I was an extremely valuable and high performing worker, and so part of me wonders if they are just salty because I called them out (and rightfully so) on their bullshit (the former with the contract games, the latter with false promises).  Do you ever experience this when you decide to leave a workplace?
3	I work in an environment that is heavy on social politics and unspoken ettiquette. I've learnt that most people don't want to confront subtext (Fe users do this naturally), so your employers are never going to think of themselves as bad people, if you're unhappy or an inconvenience they will blame you. When leaving a company, confronting them with negatives and seeming disgruntled just makes you look bad and they'll want you gone. \n\nYou have to frame what you want as a positive, and if they say no then they're the ones letting you down. I know that sounds absolutely infantile, but it works better. If they say no they can frame it as a business decision, and still feel good about you if you leave on a high. Leaving a company isn't your chance to air out your negative feelings, it's a time to be obsequiously grateful in order to get that reference and maintain the relationship for if you need to call upon them in the future. A better way to do it would have been to tell the CEO you have a vision and would like to get started on what you discussed initially, if they say no then shortly after hand in your notice and tell them that you have family issues back in NZ that need attending, it's been so great and you wish you didn't have to leave because there's so much more you wish you could have done.They'll know the subtext, but they get to save face, and wonder if they made the wrong decision. You get to leave looking good. Look at the employee who's leaving and see how they've maintained the relationship, faking Fe is really useful once you know the rules.
2	Yes.  Similar experiences here, and I don't work in IT.  The thing is, many employers want uncertain loyalty from their employees, but refuse to provide it in return.  They are the "bad guy" in this scenario.  Don't take it personally, and move on.  \n\nI'm going through something similar right now.  I've only told my immediate supervisor and people who will be impacted by my leaving.  I'm not telling their bosses till I have to, because those people treat me like shit and are self centered assholes.  
1	It may be that both of those workplaces are just toxic.  Twice in my life I was a high performing, well-liked employee who was treated poorly when I put in my notice.  One manager told me I was unprofessional for not giving her 6 weeks notice, lol.  The standards in the US is 2 weeks, she was a horrible manager and I basically got fed up with it and when another dept recruited me, I had to put in an anonymous transfer, bc managers were allowed to refuse to allow transfers.  Later on I put her down as a reference and she gave me a BAD reference, out of retribution!  I was naive and did not realize she would go through those lengths to screw me over.  Then I had a series of other jobs, never had any drama when I left those other jobs, and then the last job, which I left, I was given all sorts of shit about it, even though I left with my projects in order and laid everything out for my team and supervisor so they would know where everything was.  I left bc it was such toxic work environment, and only stuck around as long as I did, bc I was being groomed for a promotion that was taking forever to materialize and could hang on no longer.   As soon as I left, I was treated like enemy #1.  Some employers are just vindictive jerks, as much as they expect professionalism from staff, many are not themselves professional, nor do they have integrity.

5	Without delving too deeply in to it, I would say ENTjs and INTJs are definitely more intelligent than most, although I don't have the data to support that. Using chess as a measurement of intelligence however, is questionable.\n\nINTs and ENTJs are more equipped for any endeavour that requires strategic thinking or planning ahead, so it's no surprise they excel at a game where pattern recognition and being able to think multiple board states ahead of your opponent give you a huge edge.  Intelligence is the ability to acquire and apply knowledge/skills, and there are definitely other people who can learn and apply all the theoretical knowledge and the skills needed to perform at the highest echelons outside of just ENTjs and INTJs.   They may just need to put more time in and work harder.\n\nTo conclude I would say that ENTJs and INTJs just derive more meaning and satisfaction from playing a game like chess, since it's perfectly suited to their function stack. I wouldn't go as far as to say they are the supreme masterminds because of their aptitude for chess alone.
7	The NTJ component of these archetypes excel chiefly in strategy. That means an innate ability to conceptualise the myriad of repercussions from a single set of events, consider which of these consequences have the highest to least probability, and then organising these thoughts and abstractions into a single, high-probability plan of action (usually with back up plans, and back up plans for those back up plans).\n\nSpeaking as an ENTJ, performing the task above is as natural as breathing to me. It is the *NTJs superpower, so to speak, just as empathy and the ability to provide comfort is the power of some F types.\n\nBetween the two types, I suspect that the INTJ is better at the conceptualization component (being Ni dominant), whereas ENTJs are better at implementing these conjectures into action (what matters to me is how probable the plan is likely to succeed).
3	Entp and intp more likely.\n\n\nYou can say ntjs are most efficient people\n\nYou gave example of chess which is more about persistency than intelligence

8	Book Recommendations?	My interests include:\n- business insights\n- wisdom\n- self improvement\n- understanding people\n- learning to differentiate yourself\n\nFeel free to share even if it doesn't align with my interests. I'll give it a try.\n\n\nP.S. I am currently reading Creativity, Inc. by Ed Catmull
4	Thus spoke Zarathustra by Friedrich Nietzsche \n\nBeyond good and evil by Friedrich Nietzsche \n\nThe second sex by Simone de Beauvoir\n\nAmerica by Jean Baudrillard \n\nI have so many recommendations for you but I think these four are a good place to start. Feel free to message me directly because I can’t think of all of them at the top of my head. 
4	The Prince by Machiavelli. A classic if you haven't read it already. Pessimistic view about human nature but I have felt it to be applicable in leadership, business, and classical history.
3	Not sure what how this correlates to being an ent, but I'll try to skew my suggestions toward what I think is entj stuff that I love:\n\n- meditations by Aurelius\n- heart of darkness by conrad\n- currency wars (nonfiction, seminal economics book) \n- unbearable lightness of being \n- brothers Karamazov (very long but very rewarding)\n- sense of an ending \n- stoner
2	beyond religion by the dalai lama. about how we can become more compassionate (ft a fair amount of wisdom and self improvement). i read it for a class. i’m religious (as is the dalai lama obvs) but everyone in the class loved it regardless of religious background. 
2	The Laws of Human Nature by Robert Greene, all of his books are great, but this one is absolutely amazing if you want to understand human behavior. 
1	The Four Agreements by Don Miguel Ruiz and The Screwtape Letters by C.S. Lewis.\n\nThe Four Agreements is a great book for self improvement. \n\nThe Screwtape Letters are particularly neat as it is written from the perspective of higher up demon coaching his nephew demon on how to torment his human. It has good insights into the workings of the human mind whether religious or not, in my opinion.\n\nAlso, someone already listed Meditations by Marcus Aurelius. Excellent way to get into stoicism.
1	- Tribal Leadership by Dave Logan, Halee Fischer-Wright, and John King (understanding tribal dynamics)\n- What Every Body is Saying by Joe Navarro (learn how to read body language)\n- Spy the Lie by Philip Houston, Susan Carnicero, Don Tennant, Michael Floyd (Learn to detect lies)\n- The Black Science by Haha Lung (psychological manipulation, learn to protect yourself, scariest book I've read imo and it's not even horror)\n

12	I have no mission. Nothing to apply my Te towards.	Not sure what to do. I'm working 8 hours a day in engineering. I am in a role that requires me to build more skills if I wish to get promoted but...I barely care. I'm making bank as is. And getting a promotion would make my life more stressful for stupid "fuck you" money.\n\nIt's not that I am bored at work. It's that I don't see a point in getting much better. The recognition doesn't appeal to me because I get that feeling of accomplishment from playing competitve games. I just prefer how video games work and find climbing ELO ladders more fun than climbing corporate. This seems to be ingrained in me and not something I can change. But I need to pay rent somehow.\n\nThe problem is that I seem to perform better in these games when I play less. So I only spend about an hour or two on these games daily. If I focus really hard I do better than I would playing more. Unless it's a LOT more time (Like when I was in college). And I don't have that kind of time. So i'm stuck in limbo. And no, I wouldn't want to go back to that either.\n\nMeanwhile the competition is always grinding (both at work and in gaming) and I'm just sitting here doing things like going to the gym and cleaning my apartment. Playing single player games and eating food. Going on reddit. Getting "comfortable" and "happy" but not really challenged in a way that I find fulfilling.\n\nI used to get out of school and from 3pm to 8pm I would just play Gears of War, WoW or DotA 2. Now I'm living the adult life. And super spread out accross many activities. This doesn't lead me anywhere. I progress so slow at work, gaming, and the gym that it feels tedious, mundane and even the progress I make doesn't seem to mean anything with my current lifestyle.\n\nWhat exactly can I do to zero in on something. Or how can I care about work more? Honestly I feel I'm too NT to really care about work ethic. I realize it's a meaningless grind to make someone else rich. And I don't care WHERE you work.\n\nAny ideas on attitude shifts or perspective changes that would allow me to be more grounded and "accepting" of being mediocre? I feel I can't move forward without this.
7	Maybe you should take up something new? If you genuinely don't care to get better at your job then I wouldn't bother focusing on that.
3	Many engineering jobs can become mundane as the roles are often focused on such a specific technical domain and box within the organization that the job becomes easy, something which I think may be frustrating you. Two options that I can think of to help you:\n\n1. If you like your job and want to stay, find ways to take on additional responsibility, look for opportunities where processes in your domain could be improved, etc.\n2. If you're open to change, consider that there may be jobs that make better use of you than your current one (not sure what exactly you do, just knowing you're corp engineering of some sort):\n\n* A startup in your field that needs help (higher risk but more likely to allow you to define your role and pursue a goal)\n* A small business or boutique firm that could use your niche experience (this is likely lower risk but still provides you with influence in a small company)\n* A consulting job with a larger consulting firm (I think this would be your best bet, consulting is very project oriented and will make use of your skills, drive you 110%, and allow you the advancement you desire)\n\nRegardless, I hope you find what you're looking for. If you can say the industry you're in or what domain of engineering you're in, I'm happy to make more specific recommendations.
3	What about venturing on a business of your own? You could start  it small. If you need ideas come to us (INTPs).
2	I really like doing art projects or home improvement. I try to make it challenging and interesting though, like building a magic mirror from r/DIY. Or I like to just catch up with people and usually they will have an interesting side quest or two.

1	Find something new and **meaningful**, keep looking.\n\nE.g: Are you good with girls? If not, learn seduction. There is a whole world out there on how to **learn** and **get better** at making girls like you. It what drives me right now. Why am I mentioning this? Because at first I thought that this wasn't a thing that could be learned. Once people get to know that fact a lot of guys get hooked. Maybe this could replace your interest for videogames.

5	How do you guys feel about a relationship that you think will inevitably end?	Hey,\n\nSo I am in a relationship, I believe we are a great match, and both feel strong feelings to each other. We are both university students, and have different plans for the next year. That is, we are most likely to end our relationship before September 2019. And it bothers me a lot. I feel that as there is a limit date to our relationship, there is no point to it. I have a hard time to "just enjoy it while it lasts". \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat do you guys and gals think about relationships with "limit date"?
15	The point is that it's a shared journey that fuels your growth for however long you participate.  Whether or not you anticipate it lasting very long doesn't change that.  If you're still growing yet you expect it to have an expiration date for whatever reason, don't beat yourself up about it.  Great movies end, great books end, great conversations end, great *lives* end; the meaning or quality of your relationship doesn't have to be so intimately tied to its longevity; but if you choose to evaluate it like that then know you're treading down some nihilistic thinking which IMO is dangerous.  Stop and smell the roses while they're there, and then hit the road with some solid memories and an expectation of more roses in the future.  It's even more beautiful if that expiration is mutually and deeply understood.  That's how some of the best, healthiest lifelong connections form, even if they become inactive.\n\nHoly shit I sound like a self-help book.
5	If neither of you wants to compromise your plans or find a way to make it work then it's already over. You might as well enjoy it while it lasts, although the more emotionally attached you get now the harder it will be when it ends. I had a similar situation when I was 19, and we picked it up again a few years later. I don't date someone if there's no future in it, because it ends in heartache and is a waste of time and energy.\n\nDon't compromise on your goals for some college sweetheart. It's unlikely to last, so go and do you and you can always try again later if it turns out to be serious. 
2	I also had that limit date in the first stage of  my relationship.  We used to think  the same that we are not going to be this way forever . I waited even though I was emotionally hurt  by the fact that I've  to end the relationship with my ENTJ . Im an ENFP btw.\n\n\nWe are madly in love now and we survived the " limit date " nightmare . Turns out ,if you are really in love , life will find you a way . 
1	I am in a similar situation. I’m just enjoying it while it lasts. But who knows we could find a way. \n\nI expressed this to my girlfriend and she told me that there is no perfect person or relationship and it seems like no one wants to work through their issues together like a couple should. Rather they break it off and find someone else...
1	1. Be honest. 2. Use it to practice having amazing sex.
1	I always just think of it as if you both really want it to last, it'll last. Obviously it's very hard to do, but if it's real love, you will find a way to make it work together. I've been in this situation before, and neither of us were that invested, so we ended it, and now we're just friends. Just be open and honest, and ask the same of him/her. You'll be able to figure it out together.
0	Sorry, I don't understand getting hung up over relationships. If you enjoy each other's company, then by all means enjoy it. If circumstances make it so that you can't continue the relationship, then enjoy it while it lasts. Like.... I don't get the fuss
3	How do you let go of love?	This might sound like a silly question, but when you look at the base emotion of love, the love that you feel not just think, how do you let that go? I know for most people, they tend to run away from it, ignore it, get into new relationships immediately to bury it, internalize it until it disappears, just leave it unresolved....\n\nBut how do ya'll deal with it? Is that even something you can face head on and let go of? 
12	I like to remind myself that I was fine before I met that person, and I'll be fine after. Obviously it takes a long time to get over, but you just gotta keep on moving forward. 
11	I think at its core, love is a funny collection of neurotransmitters responding to some form of favorable intimacy that increases your likelihood of forming a lifelong bond with someone who will contribute to the persistence of your genes in one way or another.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n"Letting go of love" may actually be best achieved by replacing its source with activities that approximate those motives.  IE help other people.  Create something that helps others.  Volunteer.  Educate yourself with an altruistic intent.  Help others persist their genes by elevating their positions in life and I think the weird metaphysical interconnected nature of life itself will alleviate whatever anxiety you're feeling.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBasically, redirect your love - don't let it go.  \n\n&#x200B;
5	I don’t. I’ve found it’s a lot easier to just accept reality. I recently broke up. I still love him and will for a long time, and I realize he’s a totally shitty partner and not someone that I could have had a good future with. I think eventually I’ll feel like dating again and even then I’ll still love my ex and hope he’s doing ok. You don’t have to stop actively loving someone in order to move forward without them. I hope it’ll eventually fade though.

2	What are the differences between a 3w4 ENTJ and a 8w7 ENTJ? Thanks!	
4	I am above average to answer this:\n\n\n\n | 8w7| 3w4\n---|---|----\nBasic Fear | Of being harmed or controlled by others | Of being worthless \nBasic Desire | To protect themselves (to be in control of their own life and destiny) | To feel valuable and worthwhile \n\nBoth Threes and Eights can be aggressive in prioritizing their own needs. They are ambitious and they are pretty successful at being ambitious, but underlying reasons of doing so are different.\n\nEights are more likely to be aggressively ambitious for the sake of being aggressively ambitious for themselves. In contrast, Threes are more likely to be aggressively ambitious for others. The ego of an Eight is driven internally while the ego of a Three is driven externally.\n\nThrees also are aware of limitations, while Eights either do not know or ignore them. The prior is likely to either circumvent or walk around obstacles in their plans while the latter will bulldoze right through.\n\nWings aren't as important here and by that I mean the distinctions aren't as apparent. It'd be easier to describe the differences between 3w2 or 3w4 and 8w7 or 8w9.

24	Any other ENTJ-Ts? Being more sensitive to negative emotion (turbulent) goes against the ENTJ stereotype. How do you deal with it? This is what I'm doing.	The turbulent/assertive dimension is highly supported by the [psychological literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroticism).\n\n>Individuals who score high are more likely than average to be moody and to experience such feelings as anxiety, worry, fear, anger, frustration, envy, jealousy, guilt, depressed mood, and loneliness.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroticism#cite_note-Thompson-1) People who are \[turbulent\] respond worse to stressors and are more likely to interpret ordinary situations as threatening and minor frustrations as hopelessly difficult. They are often self-conscious and shy, and they may have trouble controlling urges and delaying gratification.\n\nThis is what has worked for me in order from most to least:\n\n1. Forcing myself to do things I'm afraid of again and again (volunteering to do public speaking, asking girls out on dates, stepping up to lead projects etc. etc.)\n2. [Identifying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4D-JjEiDrw) with the Jungian [shadow part of me](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_(psychology)) in a healthy way (that part of my personality which is strong and resilient and prone to resentment if neglected).\n3. Exercising every day (I try to do either 15 min yoga, some weights, some running everyday before work - in reality I do about 20mins 4 days a week).\n4. Logging my moods, exercise habits and goal progress in apps ([Daylio](https://daylio.webflow.io/), Trackendar, Daily checklist apps).\n5. Planning out my days (daily to-do lists) the day before.\n6. Trying to eat healthy - I'm so failing at this right now.... :( - it did actually help!!\n7. Trying to dress well and act confidently, have a good posture.\n8. Cognitive behavioural therapy.\n9. Developing fulfilling friendships.\n10. Meditation in the mornings (I do 5mins).\n\nI used to be afraid of everything, and I did not believe I would ever be free of that fear. However after about 2 years of hard work I finally feel like a real ENTJ. Yes, there is so much more than the type, but I'm at least no longer feeling like a fraud just because my biology is a bit more sensitive to negative emotion. I hope this post helps somebody.
3	Im not "turbulent" so I maintain my sanity by avoiding and removing negative people from my life as much as possible.  I appreciate that you are working hard not to be turbulent.
1	I agree with being emotionally sensitive to particular things, but I don't really relate to the constant fear stuff. I recommend a professional.
0	[deleted]
0	I've always thought of the turbulent dimension as trait neuroticism. This can obscure the natural strengths of any type and cause more eruptions of the shadow, making it harder to relate to others of your type sometimes. I've gotten less neurotic (turbulent) over time. keep working on it, you can get more balanced!
30	Think I met another one of you guys today	, and it was so darn invigorating. I'm a male INTP, and I'm in love. With all of you. Since I started hanging out here about a month ago, I believe I've met two ENTJs. Maybe the Law of Attraction works. If I'm correct, I now know three of you total. All are dudes my age (26), exceptionally kind, gregarious, and confident but with great humility. Really solid guys, all chill, funny, and a blast to be around. One had been my default travel buddy for a couple years. Best trips, total perfection.\n\nI love the way you don't get freaked out by my wild ideas and actively engage them.\n\nThrough sheer volume of observation, analysis, and conscious effort and practice, I've slowly learned throughout my life how to socialize after being hopelessly incapable and afraid of it growing up (whatever you imagine, it was probably even worse than that). But studying the way one of you naturally command the social energy of the room, in a kind way with a strong, firm directive and clear moral compass galvanizes me so much. I don't aspire to be the sustained life of the party or anything like that, but I am still often guilty of misreading the room and sharing information that nobody finds interesting except myself.\n\nPersonally, I become extremely excited in a competitive way when I perceive someone to be superior to me at something.  I have zero interest in besting someone weaker than me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I can, I'm going to start a meetup group here in Chicago specifically for INTPs and ENTJs to mix.\n\nGive me ten more of you in my life please (in any role), and I'll still want more. Also, I desperately want more of you to start your own businesses, you'll do great!\n\nEDIT: Plot twist. Several weeks later, found out from the guy who inspired this post that he tested as ENFP. A great example of why I am very hesitant to type people. Doesn’t change anything though, not my love for him, nor you all!

Strange how that works.

3	Would you guys not respond to message and leave people hanging	... and if yes, does that mean you’re still contemplating, or it truly is the end?\n\nI shall add that the message is not about trivial stuffs like asking to hang out or “how are you”.
7	I always try to respond, it makes me somewhat uncomfortable to leave an open message... I guess you could say that I like to have the last word, unless it's something irrelevant.
5	I always try to respond as soon as I've seen the message, but if I'm busy, I'll refrain from opening it until I've got time to reply. But if the message is open, I've got to answer it ASAP.
6	Will always respond. My phone is on me 24/7 and I find it incredibly rude for people to ghost or take a very long time to respond unless extenuating circumstances.
4	Never.  Communication is like a solid deal, you should always be closing.
4	Sometimes I would contemplate for so long that I forgot to reply. It doesn't mean that I'm not interested in what you're saying but probably texting isn't the best way? 
3	I've left people hanging when I've made up my mind. Either responding won't change anything, or there's nowhere to go from there. 
2	Yes, respond. That being said I have been ghosted by two separate ENTJs; my only conclusion is that they both must be inferior.
2	Thanks for the inputs guys, I appreciate it. Usually that person is a textbook example of how an ENTJ would behave, so it’s kinda out of character. I guess either I’ve crossed a line, or I’ve been door slammed.
1	I respond, and in a timely matter. \n\nI once was so busy with work, and sleep deprived, that I read a text and forgot to respond, thinking I had dreamt it. My friend responded days later with, “Oh my god are you hospitalized??? Which hospital are you at. It's the only explanation for why it's taken you so long to respond!”\n\nNot responding is disrespectful, and the feeling of having unfinished business is not a good one.
1	I always respond, I refuse to ignore people if I have something to say. If I don't have anything to say, I'll at least let them know that.
1	I do not always respond right away. I am busy and I have a TON of people in my life who all want my attention. I also take a while to think about some things (but usually I'll let you know if I need more time).
1	I always respond. HOWEVER, if that person has done something that has shown me that they don’t deserve to be my life, I have no problem dropping them from my life and not responding to a message from them (because for me, they are not worth any more of my time).
9	How do I stop micromanaging someone who is ineffectual and unwilling to change? Also that person is my SO.	\nFor context, we are both 35 and have two young kids (toddlers). We are both career oriented and driven, I’m in grad school (Educational Leadership) & he is in the military. \n\nI apologize for the wall of text, but I’m posting here rather than in r/relationships because I want advice that is straight to the point and familiar to my line of thinking. \n\nI’m having an issue with the way that my spouse  delegates his time/personal responsibilities. I would like to stop micromanaging him, but he is ineffectual at best and at worst, puts us in legitimate danger. Its hard to trust him because he’s not shown me that he is capable of making adult decisions. \n\nObviously his job is demanding in terms of the amount of time he spends at the office/traveling. His role right now requires zero leadership from him, he makes no major decisions, so his main focus is running. Guy runs 9 miles a day. He just applied for a job that would require even less leadership & travel time vs home time would be at 70% away + 30% home. ISTP, FWIW. \n\nI work with kids on the spectrum who are often non-verbal. Our kids are very young, as in still in diapers. They require a tremendous amount of planning and organizing - trying to dress two toddlers M-F is a little like herding cats, but they’re good kids, so long as you take control and have a plan.\n\nI often double up on grad classes as they are interesting & I have other educational goals that I’d like to accomplish in a timely fashion. I’ve been in education for 18+ years and genuinely enjoy it, and I would like to move into curriculum development for at risk youth and prisoners. That being said, 100% of my day is structured, data driven, and I have to make good use of my time or else it’s a waste of time. As a parent, this includes driving to and from activities, cooking, cleaning, and laundry. All of these activities under my care are methodical and organized because I can’t afford not to be, as my decisions affect our kids and other kids as well. \n\nAs the amount of responsibilities we have increases (home ownership, multiple subsidies for kids activities, volunteer efforts, etc) I’m finding that I’m doing much, much, much more of the planning and executing than he is. The smallest things have to be explained and reiterated to him constantly - brushing teeth, not letting the kids take bananas into their beds,  cooking meat before it spoils. Things that no adult should have to explain to another adult. He literally let our daughter take a banana into bed tonight, because “she wanted a banana.” In bed. She’s 3. A banana is not a toy, you do not take it to bed with you. \n\nI know - and he knows - that because I am with the kids more, and I work with kids as well, that our system is smooth and that he doesn’t have to do much planning. As a result, he’s just lazy and doesn’t take a proactive approach to *anything*. Emails? No. The electricity was flickering last week and he didn’t check on it, and yes, an outlet caught on fire. Luckily I was there to smell it and put it out, but before that event, he was home alone - noticed the electricity flickering (and outlets stopped working) so he stopped working on that side of the house. That’s all. Didn’t unplug anything, make a work order, check the breaker. Just moved all of his shit to a different location. I have a spotted gecko tank on that side of the house and I noticed its temp gauge was off (not ok) which is why he said something. If I didn’t see that, the gecko would have been frozen before I knew it. \n\nWhen I bring things like this up to him, he responds by saying that I’m too emotional and overreactive to minor situations. Such as fires, because that’s minor, right? Then, he will *congratulate* himself for accomplishing something that I did. He actually said, about the outlet, “this is why I calmly fixed the outlet.” I don’t know how to respond to that - he didn’t fix anything. He went to Hooters with his friends. I made the work order. Then he congratulated himself for “fixing the outlets” in a home we own - he didn’t fix anything, our PM hired her handyman. I pointed that out to him and he said “you’re being negative. The point is, it’s done”. But that’s not the point. The point is that I organized it all while he’s watching football and then he tells me what a great job he’s done. \n\nAgain, sorry for the wall of text. But his inability to plan and DO things is starting to just get dangerous. It’s annoying, yes, but things like ignoring electrical outages and not knowing who your kids pediatrician is - it’s just unacceptable to me. \n\nAdvice? 
9	This is almost identical to the situation I had with my husband and we are now going through a divorce. I did some deep diving to learn what I could have done differently to make the relationship work with my husband, so if what it is you want is to make you're relationship work, I'll give you the answer to that; but it's going to take time, patience, and personal sacrifice and you need to decide if it's worth the effort to deal with someone who is inferior to you.\n\n1. Do a deep dive into his personality type, yours, your cognitive functions, and pay especially close attention to the inferior cognitive functions because that's where a lot of resentment is being built up on both sides for you two.\n2. Understand that your expectations are currently TOO high. And be willing to settle with lowering them so that they are obtainable and within reach for him. I know for people like us, these are normal expectations that any functioning adult should be able to meet, but currently your relationship is not fostering the positive affirmation that people like him need in order to BE successful or have the desire TO want to meet those expectations. People like us tend to push and push to try and get our partners to become equals and sometimes it gets overwhelming for them which causes them to shut down - especially those S types - so they detach.\n3. Stating that you're too emotional and overreacting is just him projecting his own insecurities onto you. Your partnership has mutated into a parent-child dynamic, which corrodes mutual respect, unequally distributes life burdens, fosters resentment, and makes for an overall unappealing arrangement. You are both going to have to figure out why it is you do the things you do to find common ground to start building from again and learn to find respect within one another if there is ever to be growth for you both to become equals. But keep this in mind - the growth with him that you likely once saw is currently stalled and if he isn't ready or willing to get back on the growth track, there's nothing you can do. You only have control over yourself and no one else and that is okay.\n4. You're going to need to stop looking to achieve externally and focus internally. I read that you double up on classes and you have goals you want to achieve, but if you want to make your marriage work you're going to have to take a step back and focus all that effort on your relationship. When my relationship was beginning to get more disconnected and detached, I began running for political positions within my tribe and focusing on all these other community things I was involved with - which ultimately just took me further away from my relationship and it's issues and led to more disappointments with my ex because he was set up to fail since I'd have to delegate stuff to him that he had no interest in doing. Figure out what really matters here and if it's your own improvement right now, then your relationship will likely fail.\n5. Journal everything down - check out ReGain which is a couples counseling site that you can attend online and you can dump what it is that you're thinking/feeling/writing in the chat session with the counselor and it's at your pace; when you get things written out, go back and re-read things to dig further into why you feel the way you do. It really helped me process and get to the bottom of things like my own anger and frustrations. It also helped me realize when it was time to walk away and let it all go.
6	Yes! My “holy smokes” moment reading your text was when you pointed out that my own schedule is causing me to delegate tasks to him that he PROBABLY DOESNT WANT TO DO or doesn’t KNOW HOW to do it! 🤦🏻‍♀️ And yes, you’re 100% accurate about everything - once I started delving into real estate and our beefing up our joint accounts with focus, he sort of fell away from making *any* decisions, and retreated back to the gym. Sigh. Ok. Thank you. I have a lot of thinking to do. 
10	It sounds like you have three children, not two... I cringed the entire time reading your post. It doesn’t sound like you have a  true “partnership”. You shouldn’t have to micromanage someone who is on the same team as you. \n\nIt also sounds like he’s gaslighting you by calling you emotional when you want to discuss a legitimate issue. Gaslighting is extremely unhealthy and can cause some serious emotional damage - and at 35, he’s unlikely to change. \n\nMy advice? Try therapy together. It might help you decide if you can work these issues out or not. And I get that having kids complicated things, but kids are better off having separated parents that are happy than having parents that are together and miserable. \n\nAnother thing to consider is whether your life would be better with or without him. My ex was very similar to how you described your SO and I finally left him after 6 years together once I realized that 1) he would never change, and 2) my life would be better without him. \n\n
5	No matter the personality type, people do not react well to consistently being told that they are wrong. A good challenge for you would be to come at every disagreement for the next two weeks seeing what you could have done differently rather than looking at his inadequacies. In addition, I would try to think of one way you are thankful for him each day. This can help your perception. Right now I think you are focused on the battle (bananas, outlets) and not the war (successful family life). I'm sure he is feeling neglected with how much you have on your plate. Remember, constant work is not fun to the vast majority of people, and you can't expect him to feel similar to you in this manner. Take some time off, get a babysitter, and have some fun together again.
3	Is the sending a banana to bed with a toddler really just an ISTP thing because my ENFJ husband did the same thing?!\n\nAll I can tell you is that you have to be willing to pick your battles and I know that’s easier said than done when you are watching your SO do something very irritating which could be corrected quickly and efficiently. Relationships are hard work and you have to accept that you BOTH have quirks and limitations. \n\nFire/electrical safety is a battle absolutely worth having. Maybe some of the smaller things (toddler and banana) are not. I can’t tell you how many times I have to bite my tongue and leave the room over things I want to correct, but when I come back I usually am over it. If I’m not over it, I sleep on it and if I wake up still feeling the same way then it usually is a battle worth having. \n\nAlso just from one ENTJ mom to another. It’s easy for us full-time working ENTJ  moms to take on more than our fair share of the house and family work. We are just so used shouldering more of the burden and we do it so effortlessly. But please don’t forget to make time for yourself everyday. Even if it’s a small thing. You will feel a lot more calmer and less overrun with duties and to-do lists. \n\nIf all else fails and you really don’t believe you are communicating properly (or will be able to without intervention) then I would recommend marriage counseling or therapy. 
3	I divorced a guy like this
2	Not sure where to reply, but I've read the conversation here so far. I think your first priority is to get some rest and self care accomplished. And put off making any major decisions until you're completely out of this stressed state. \n\nRethink your household strategies. You need domestic help from someone other than him. Hire someone or ask a friend or relative to pitch in. Get a roomba and a scuba for floor cleaning. He's no domestic god and you can't ever expect him to be domestically inclined. Many men aren't. It's not a sexist thing. It's just the way things are. If you can afford the expenses of divorce and living separately, you can afford a maid service, grocery delivery and laundry pickup and delivery.\n\nThe purpose of marriage is not actually to have fun and romance. The children have to be nurtured in an optimal environment. If you can manage a respectful and cooperative relationship between the two of you, and have some fun along the way, all the better. As the children grow and become more independent, they'll require less care and can help with chores. It's entirely possible that you're just in a tough phase of life and working through some sort of process. There have certainly been times in my life when it seemed like things were standing still but in retrospect, I could see that progress was actually being made the whole time. \n\nRight now you still have him. He said he wants to stay with you. Do you know how hard it is for ISTPs to commit to a relationship? I'd kill to be in your shoes right now. Just take him on the terms of what he can and will offer for now and let it ride. See what happens. This is going to sound harsh, but a woman's sexual market value drops with age and especially with children. It's going to be harder to find a suitable partner than it was earlier in life. \n\nMaybe he is a narcissistic asshole and you're suffering from intolerable abuse. I just didn't get that about him. You need to give this adequate time and consideration before making this momentous decision. 
3	It kinda sounds like you are expecting him to be who you want him to be or who you think he should be instead of who he is and its making you both miserable. Why did you marry him? Not everyone is driven and ambitious, you cant force other people to be like you. Youre going to be much happier if you live and let live. I suspect that the other little things happening are becaue he is withdrawing underneath your onslaught.
2	I think you're going to have to begin to take a more conciliatory approach with your ISTP. I've read a list of your concerns and dissatisfactions. Now what would he like to see improve in your relationship and family life? Do you have any idea? So far, I don't see any actual betrayal or immoral behaviour on his part. He has a job and he runs daily, that's not actually laziness. Sorry, but a child taking a snack to bed isn't going to make or break your lives. Even if it was a mistake, can you tolerate mistakes being made by the people around you? It may be true that he's immature but it isn't clear to me from what you shared. \n\nYou need to scale back on your commitments in order to have some time and energy to devote to your family's needs. You're overworking like a stereotypical ENTJ and clearly in a state of stress. You probably have some unmet needs as well. Your kids are little now. They need you now. And what about him? How long has been since you had a long chat or a date night out? \n\nYou've had children with a Perceiver. And you're going to have to learn how to meet him half way to bridge that divide. He's also an introvert and needs alone time, he gets that by running. Give him the space he needs and he will start running toward you. \n\nISTPs get their energy and motivation in spurts with periods of....listlessness in between. It's true that lead Ti can get stuck in a rut and sometimes they need a very gentle nudge to get out of their comfort zone for some new adventure. They actually appreciate it if you aren't overbearing about it. \n\nYou can't control or micromanage an ISTP, in case you hadn't noticed. They are so independent and need a lot of space and fffrreeeeeddddoooommmm. They hate structure, rules and plans. They are comfortable with uncertainty and they love surprises. (good surprises) I suspect he's deeply frustrated too, and he's expressing his discontent with sarcasm and antagonism. SPs are known to be a little bit trollish. But, when an SP loves you and feels respected, they are very loyal, and won't let you down. They're also known for their generosity without expecting anything in return.   \n\nI would bet that he's fully aware of your disapproval and feeling deeply hurt. \n\nHoney, you've got to save your marriage/relationship. Children do much better in life with both parents in the home. And if you don't resolve the problems you have now with him, the conflict will carry over and poison the co-parenting post separation. This will be highly toxic for your kids. \n\nYou have to put your family first. Nothing, absolutely nothing matters more than saving your family. This is an emergency. Talk to him and be a really good listener. Read all you can about the ISTP type. You share the same two middle functions, which can be mutually energizing, and fun! SPs are playful. One way you can strengthen your bond with him is *doing activities together*. This  works really well with ISTPs.\n\nI typed this out hastily, hope I was clear and not too repetitive. Oh and one word of warning. In Socionics, ISTP is the supervisor of ENTJ. You may be getting some friction in your relationship from that dynamic. Anyway don't fight him, you're likely\n to take some serious damage if you do. He can hurt you a lot more than you can hurt him. I don't mean you shouldn't have boundaries and expectations, but do avoid an all out war. \n
1	Oh the resentment is mounting to the point that I’m ready to leave. As in, looking for homes and seeing if I want to refi the one we own. And I know he resents me, who wouldn’t? No one wants to be told what to do, just as badly as I don’t want to explain basic shit to an adult. We don’t connect anymore. We had a sitter and the chance for a night out together and we both declined. I know that going out on our own would solve everything, and he disagrees. His idea is that we just need to simplify our lives and work more often. 
1	Lol the kid having a banana in bed is that big of a deal? I get it you guys (ENTJ) are structured and methodical, but if my kid wants to eat a damn banana I don’t care where or when he does! Nothing wrong with having a snack in bed. \n\nSounds to me like it may not be so much that he is not driven or structured, but maybe that you are to such a degree that you feel he isn’t. Sounds like you guys need some serious balance. \n\nRecognizing our own problems is hard. \n\nHave you tried counseling? For yourself? Having to control every situation you’re in is exhausting and maddening, I have the same problem.

1	That is a death spiral. If you are digging him like that it will make him more oppositional 
1	> He literally let our daughter take a banana into bed tonight, because “she wanted a banana.” In bed. She’s 3. A banana is not a toy, you do not take it to bed with you.\n\nThis is not the end of the world at all. Pick your battles.\n\n\nIt sounds like he does not live up to your expectations and you did not notice that before but now you have two toddlers.\n\nHaving parents who divorced would not be good for their psyche. Oh and having an ENTJ mother on top of that.\n\nThe outlet - that sucks.\n\nRegarding your career goals - I don't think believe you can have it all. It kind of comes down to taking care of other's kids vs taking care of your own.\n\nNot sure how much he earn but I believe that he would prefer a wife who does less at work and more at home.\n\nThe busier you are at work, the more house work he would have to do, the more he is going to resent it. On top of that you will probably start out-earning him which would increase the resentment.\n\nSo divorce is one option but it sucks balls, not only for you and him but it is going to hit the children VERY hard. On the upside (if you are lucky), you can find the dude who is your match, if such a thing is possible. He'd have to understand that he can't have more kids with you and he'd have to actually love your children and be a good father.\n\nThe other alternative is for you to get through the short-term somehow and from there make house your priority (including fixing the house) and make your career part time. That implies a financial hit but a resourceful ENTJ can find ways to save $, I am sure. Yes, having 2 kids is expensive. So sell your fancy car and get a 10 year old Prius for a few thousand, shop at Costco and almost never go out. There are ways. Plenty of people raise children on small income.  \n\nSince you chose an imperfect mate, sounds like a choice between you having a good life and your children having a good life. Frankly, a huge percentage of marriages are like that.\n\nMaybe it is not a catastrophe because you could be doing what you love, but part time.\n\n*EDIT:* The dumb-ass me have not though of another alternative that others mentioned - hiring help at home.\n\nWell, maybe a combination of two still - throttling your engines down to 80% power at work / education / career and hiring help just might be the compromise that will allow you to keep your sanity. Either way you need to live below your means so that you are not stuck in a position where either you have to go mental or he does.\n
13	what are your views on ugly men?	because equality of the sexes means we gotta have this discussion on both sides ;)
23	Most men could be more attractive with a nice haircut and some good habits, so you have to distinguish people who clearly weren't lucky with genetics and people who just neglect their appearance, voluntarily or not.\n\nEdit: coming from a guy who has openly been described as "ugly" a long long time ago.
11	I am generally not physically attracted to males or female prospects for dating. I am more attracted to the intelligence of someone. I love someone I can really pick their brain and get to understand. Someone with the ability to think for themselves and form independent thoughts and opinions and vocalize them in such a way.\n\nHowever, I tend to like very well dressed men and women. Well dressed, smell good, clean. \n\nSomeone who is willing to make plans for us rather than ride on my coat tails (sorry I'm having serious relationship issues right now ROFL!)
12	Looking at the post history of u/redditorgirl1 she comes from a backgroud of unhealthy environment for a teenagers. She and anyone can convince themselves as "ugly," but I think "ugly" is a bad self-fulling prophecy thing.\n\nFor me, ugly means toxic people such as too self-entitled, two faced, going out of their way to harm anyone in anyway kind of people. Someone can be 10/10 on attractiveness scale, but if they're what I think is toxic people, then they suddently look ugly to me. 
3	I like a combination of good looks, wit, intelligence, and I love to be treated poorly - no ugly men though. 
2	I find smart, hard-working and well dressed men attractive. Even if his physique or facial featured are not striking, a man can carry himself well by having a strong mindset and be determined. \nFor women it‘s a bit more difficult, having good looks is more important for the overall package, imo. 
2	If they are ugly because of their genetics I tend not to think anything until I speak with them.  If they are ugly because they neglect their appearance (whether they be overweight, wearing old and tatty clothing, or whatever else) I tend to see that as a manifestation and reflection of their inner workings, and as such, I don't often give them the time of day.
2	They are a human that deserves the same respect as myself.
1	I really don't mind if a man is ugly. If a man is good looking and a dick it definitely counts against him a lot more though. Always seems to be the tall, good looking guys who act superior to others and are rude to people. I like chubby, nerdy guys with beards and niche interests.
1	Not enough to go on. Women pick from the top of their available options. Men pick from the top of their available options. Then they settle. Or not. Not all women procreate and sure as hell not all men procreate.\n\nAn ugly man with a few million is still going to find a trophy girl if he wants one, although she might screw a male stripper when he is not looking.\n\nFind your niche. Go for what you like. You might succeed. don't overthink it. Don't worry about what others think. It's ok to discriminate. that's what the idea of evolution is based on. women can be picky as hell (if they are able).\n
1	I'm very superficial, only attracted to very few guys. However, if a guy has the personality of a constipated shit then I won't hesitate to drop him and go for an "uglier" guy instead.
1	Speaking in terms of what I look for in a relationship, I'm currently interested in someone who is simultaneously genetically misfortunate and also pretty unsuccessful with their appearance (though based on their outfit choices it's evident that they do somewhat try...?). As an ENTJ, I think it's more about someone's personality and presence (perhaps mannerisms and dominance) that intrigues me, as opposed to physical traits.
1	Personally I don’t focus too much on appearance. I’m not exactly walking down the streets and thinking to myself, “oh wow here comes Mr. Ugly!” \n\nCertainly I sometimes run into people that look really sloppy and unkept and that can and does bother me but that’s not really an issue of them being ugly, that’s an issue of them not taking care of themselves. That’s a separate discussion, frankly. \n\nI’m not attracted to people based on appearance alone. I’m more attracted by what they bring to the table so to speak. What attributes do they have? What are their talents? What are their strengths? How do their minds work? Those are the questions I ask myself when I first meet someone, it’s not about, “well how good looking are they?” Also, typically if someone has a lot to offer in those questions I outlined, they tend to be physically appealing in some way anyways, even if not in a traditional way. It’s hard to explain what I mean by that. 
1	Men who are ugly are not "ugly" \n\nWomen who are ugly are not "ugly"\n\nWeakness is ugly. You're fat and lazy? That's ugly. Fix it. You're scrawny and weak. That's ugly. Fix it. \n\nBeautiful men don't need to have a nice face, they need to have a powerful body and personality that demands respect. \n\nBeautiful women don't need a nice face either. They need to have a powerful body and personality that demands respect. \n\nBeauty defined by a face is so weak. \n\nThe 6/10 guy who will talk to you, make you laugh, and has a powerful body is much sexier/beautiful / whatever  Imo than the 12/10 with no social skills, personality, and is unfit. Same goes for women. 
1	My view on ugly men is that they are humans with feelings and emotions... those who differentiate and emphasize physical appearance aren’t looking at how you can nurture every person into who they could be and treating people with dignity \n\nThat being said, maybe you’re hyper actively thinking about ugly dudes because your dating pool is limited based upon your own looks and vapid personality?... just saying girl a girl 🤷🏼‍♀️💁🏼‍♀️
1	Interesting how the other post got almost 2.5x more comments than this one did
8	Slacker, low energy (job related)	First, I do the bare minimum at work as an experiment to see how far is too far before someone starts to notice. I'm just under a year here. No management has noticed. They actually have praised me on how well I'm doing. The head hr manager has sang praises to the entire company about me. \n\nI really think it's time for me to leave this job. I'm severely unfulfilled. I am everyone's go-to person and often step in when the boss is out (upon request). I've gone an entire week and a half without anything productive coming out of my office besides random schmoozing with coworkers, underlings and higher ups. \n\nMy boss asks me whether or not I want to be his second in command as the position will be coming available. I can do no wrong here at this company. \n\nThat's really it. Just a random rant. I should become a politician. LOL
6	I have a very similar problem, and in fact I just handed in my notice.  I've been working at probably 20% of my capacity and people in the company are still amazed by the work I did.  It's gotten so bad that when someone sees me in the corridor and tells me they saw my latest work and thought it was great (I produce video content btw) I almost feel resentful because I did it with my eyes closed.\n\nThis is always a problem for us ENTJs, particularly those of us who learn extremely fast like I do.  We tend to hit a ceiling quickly or get to the point the diminishing returns on improvement are just far too slow for our liking.  This is something I would describe as a double edged sword for sure.  \n\n\nEDIT: I should also point out that the ceiling isn't necessarily a result of us learning all there is to learn, or learning as much as we can handle, but often that our workplace can't realistically facilitate/support any further opportunities for growth.
2	Get another job, or keep posting this once a quarter when you're feeling you can't take it anymore.
1	Yup. Sounds like you're bored. Is there no opportunity for growth or benefit to the experience of making a serious effort at being 2nd in command? Would that experience not be beneficial to your resume?
1	Holy fuck this is me and I don't know my type LOL. I literally don't give a shit about work while I am finishing my degree. I clock in, do the bare minimum and think about my other shit while socializing with people as cover.
4	Wrongly arrogant people during a fight	When the people you're opposed to start getting arrogant while all their arguments are nonsense.\n\nSomething like "everybody knows 2+2=5 you idiot".\n\nAnd then, when that pisses me off, they're just like "go get angry at someone else". And then I start destroying them (orally of course) one by one and they get upset.\n\nI can't express how much I hate that, can you relate to this or am I just weird ? Sometimes you just try to explain people something and it doesn't work at all.\n\nEdit 2 : looks like this thread didn't go in the direction I expected it to at all.

2	It's not really anything strange.  I just stick to the talking points and calmly dismantle them, but I don't take any prisoners either.  Move on after that if they are going to be a baby about it.  \n\n\nIf this is something that happens on the internet, however, then I would advise not to argue with people on the internet at all.  Full stop.  It really is just a waste of energy, especially when it's radical lefties or other ideologues.
1	This entire question is premised on the assumption that you are right and others are wrong.\n\nMaybe you are. Maybe you are not. No examples were given.\n\nIf you believe that you are surrounded by idiots, then find some place where this is not the case.\n\nYou don't have to argue with strangers on the internet. You have less control of your IRL contacts but there is still plenty of it.\n
0	But what if they're actually stupid?  Specifically users like u/NeoClassicalRealist, u/ImportantCoyote, and u/greeninchwormz.  What do you do when you encounter stupidity like this?
1	Let's be clear, most of you are ESTJs - confirmed.	As my introverted intuition coupled with my extroverted thinking thought, most people on here are ESTJs. We can tell that from the 46% up-voted ratio on my previous post with over 100 participants which seems just about right. Of course this is not news to me, this only confirms what I have already known. There were some interesting posts, but most felt like they were better suited on another, sensor-based sub-reddit.\n\nBut I understand you and it might be difficult for ESTJs to differentiate, so I will make it visual for you since that is where it can be less thought provoking and more sensing and seeing. This will help you define yourselves more.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\nENTJ brain:\n\nCarl Sagan (exactly how I speak, intuitive and curious) https://youtu.be/wupToqz1e2g\n\nBill Gates (the way my logic works) https://youtu.be/qtm9B9Ww9RA\n\nGarry Kasparov (usual ENTJ thought process) https://youtu.be/SMe-hvCwTRo\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nESTJ brain:\n\nBill O'Reily (common ESTJ behavior, many comments from last post resemble this, especially the part about not understanding)\nhttps://youtu.be/Qy-Y3HJNU_s\n\nUK PM (very stubborn even when the truth is in front of their eyes) https://youtu.be/Tjp5OmoDYQM\n\nMegyn Kelly (trying to be chatty, but mostly obvious simple one liners) https://youtu.be/7XYlJqf4dLI\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSadly, there seems to be some misunderstanding between us extroverted thinkers here especially from the last post, so this is a message to ESTJs which I hope will make things more clear.\n\nFrom ENTJ to ESTJs:\nhttps://streamable.com/8sm9r

3	You’re using yourself as a reference to demonstrate prototypical ENTJ behavior? That’s so hilariously flawed. Not sure if you’re trolling or being sarcastic. 
3	I think you're right to an extent. There are mis-typed estj's in this subreddit, and to be honest that's expected, it takes a lot of effort to cut through some of the mbti crap that's all over reddit and find some good information on your type - estj's in particular have plenty of mis-information on them. But interestingly after browsing your other comments I think you had it right before - you're an enfp with strong Te (siding with PlzBuffBeamu). 
3	Finally, fucking someone said it. 
3	You are actually an ESFP. Denying that reality is a classic sign of being an ESFP.
3	It’s inevitable that there’s going to be people that are mistyped on these subreddits and really on any platform where these personality types are being discussed. What can you, or anyone for that matter, realistically do about it? It’s the internet. 
5	Honestly I skimmed this and your last post but you don’t seem like an ENTJ. \n\nMy reasoning is that I’m a real ENTJ and you’re nothing like me. \n\nEdit: Honestly jokes aside not trying to be a dick or anything but this is some shit my ENFP girlfriend would do lol 
2	i already busted out laughing at the first sentence
2	Popping over from the ESTJ sub to say: \n\nYou’re a troll, and not even a good one. Try harder to look genuine next time. ✌️
2	I agree, many people here are estj.  Similar to all the mistyped Intps in the intj channel.

2	Any ENTJs familiar with determinism? I can’t seem to reconcile responsibility within a rational universe.	
3	Your post was removed by our Automoderator, but the content isn't spam so I approved it. Sorry about that.\n\nAlso, recommending lurking /r/philosophy for Determinism discussions if you haven't looked. /r/askphilosophy is best for off-hand/small dialogue.\n\nEdit: typo
1	I didn’t read your entire text on determinism but maybe read upon compatibilism.\n\nAlthough science supports the theory of determinism, the field of quantum mechanics proves that the world is not entirely deterministic but rather it is probabilistic.\n\nMost contemporary philosophers have the view that determinism is true but it’s existence doesn’t disprove free will. Especially when it comes to moral responsibility. All events are caused by something else but our futures aren’t locked. Our actions unlock those futures based on our ability to choose “if we wanted to”. 
0	Let's be clear, most of you are ESTJs.	It's very easy to tell that at least half people on here are either mistyped ESTJs or people that lie to themselves due to insecurities. A lot of messages that I read on this sub-reddit are very "this is what I see, this is what it must be". Hardly ever questioning reasoning, potential outcomes and trying to read between the lines. Whole mark of ESTJ, but why pretend when you have other great assets like... remembering things? \n\nI was really surprised at first with how little many of people on here resemble the way I articulate myself or explain things. At first I thought it was me, but after receiving waves of confirmation results and talking to like minded people it became very clear to me, it is not me, it is you. ENTJs are suppose to be very good with language, like me, yet many of you on here are challenged to give away a thought provoking paragraph, of course being an ESTJ you'll use the "efficiency defense", all it is instead is the inability to question things like an intuitive.\n\nDon't get me wrong, ESTJs are great and I admire your precision, and if you work really hard you can achieve a lot of great things and can become amazing middle-managers that are going to be working for ENTJs like me.
1	Locked because less and less people are playing nice. We're willing to allow these threads to be up if people want to talk about either abstractly or with civility what makes up the ENTJ.
59	I’m an ENTJ. Clear as day. But people like you just give us a bad name. Just because we are ENTJ’s and say it how it is, doesn’t mean we should just embrace being assholes. Learn to talk to others as human beings, and you’ll be amazed at what happens. 
20	The guy who posted this sounds like a brat
37	Interesting how the "*I am ENTJ and you are not*" thing is a recurring pattern in here. Do they have that on other types' subreddits?
11	this is the funniest shit
25	Lol what? A few points:\n\n1) You are a loser, and no one will be working for you.  Anyone reading through your post history can find that you self-proclaim to being lazy and "not caring about money."  That gets you nowhere, and now you've embarrassed yourself and you look like a complete fool for trying to sound tough and claiming that some of the people on here will work for you.  There are actual successful people on here like doctors and lawyers lol you're nothing gtfo.\n\n2) Are you calling out a specific user or a specific situation?  Why are you specifically choosing to single out ESTJs?  If this is aimed at a specific situation then address it directly instead of being a coward and passive-aggressively trying to say it through this post.  If it is not aimed at a specific situation then this post makes no sense.  For example, why provide the quotation "this is what I see, this is what it must be" with zero context.  No one knows what you are referring to.  \n\n3) Also looking through your post history you type essay responses.  Who has time for that.  Go find something more productive to invest your time in.  You don't seem like an ENTJ.
24	I just woke up and for a second I thought I was on /r/iamverysmart
15	Alright Dr. Phil
13	That's bold, how much do you know about function theory to claim you're completely right?\n\nThey might sound similar if you only understand what 16personalities says, but function-wise we're just halfway similar.
11	INFJ here. \n\nPlease say this is satire. 
5	I completely agree. I couldn't care less about control/leadership etc for the sake of power/prestige and never have been. I just have good ideas (as a result of self introspection, reading in between the lines, thinking ahead, seeing and considering every nuance etc) and generally people can see what I'm envisioning and follow along because there's consensus. I am more of a co-operator (helping people help themselves) and don't really believe in formal vertical hierarchies.
19	This sub is retarded because of ppl like you
8	I actually cannot tell if this is satire or someone with some insecurity issues 
4	Entjs trolled e🅱ic style
3	OP is very impressive. OP only got into MBTI a few months ago, yet OP is now an expert. Good job, OP
8	lol
3	Zomg /s
3	This is very interesting considering we live in a “sensory” world and so it’s much more common for intuitives to test as sensors and then figure out later they’re intuitives, not the other way around... it doesn’t make sense for people to be mistyped as ENTJs when they’re really ESTJs. 
3	I find myself writing entire essays as comments on this sub then deleting them a couple days later. Honestly at this point, I'm just subscribed for the persuasive writing practice. But yeah, some of the comments for the open-ended questions are usually disappointing one-liners. 
3	Just because I’m keeping a comment brief doesn’t mean I’m not properly typed.\n\nAlso you’re a dick.
6	It is an accurate assertion and one that will undoubtedly offend many but as usual, why should we care about who gets offended?\n\nYes, many ESTJs do often mistype themselves as us but at the end of the day, you have to ask yourself if it truly matters; the MBTI at best is simply an accurate description of your personality and how you process information.\n\nThe moniker of ENTJ is not an automatic recipe for success, it is merely an indication of your capacity for success. Which is worse? To have the capacity for greatness and never achieve it or to be of a lesser class but achieve the maximum extent of your potential? At the end of the day, we will be known not for our personality, who we know or even our ideas but for the things we have accomplished. That is the true mark of an ENTJ: results.\n\nKnow then that it is the epitome of disgrace not to be an ESTJ but instead to be one of us and fail, it is much better to be a mere ESTJ who is the best of his kind than a failure of an ENTJ. Being the internet however, we can never know who is truly successful and who is not so why fret? Take it as a compliment rather than an insult that they would delude themselves to be among us.
6	Lmao dude get laid 
2	I can't tell if this isn't just a bad troll. \n\n> At first I thought it was me, but after receiving waves of confirmation results and talking to like minded people it became very clear to me, it is not me, it is you. \n\nI don't know if you're serious about this, but if you are.... I don't know what to tell you. Grow up? This is basically the mindset of every angsty and awkward teenager. "It's not me that's different, the others just suck." \n\n&#x200B;
2	Holy fuck, someone has taken MBTI too seriously XD. Man, chill. Not all ENTJs are the same. We can share some traits, but everyone is another human being with different expriences. I will make it clear, if you're like 75% (N) and 25% (S) It means that you have some traits of Sensing person, but that doesnt make you Sensor, you're still ENTJ, for example i'm 80%/80%/80%/60% ENTJ, it means that i'm still a little bit Introvert, Sensing, Feeling and Perceiving. But im not ISFP for fuck sake. Find me 100% ENTJ and I will give you bucket of gold.
1	I’m just hear as an INTJ since they banned memes in the INTJ server and for information about ENTJs
1	Can't deny that. No discussion other than \**your point is dumber because x, y* ***and*** *z\** around here. Could it be a reverse circle jerking?
-4	This is the most ENTJ thing that you can read.
0	what are your views on ugly women?	how do you feel about them?
41	They are a human that deserves the same respect as myself. 
19	Why does this matter?
18	I don't define people by their attractiveness. I work in fashion with a lot of very basic, unintelligent people who have been privileged by their looks. I got away with being a really shitty, undeveloped person because I was attractive and confident. If someone doesn't wear makeup or flattering clothing I just assume that they don't prioritise that as a value, and their appearance isn't important to them. I also live in a country with a lot of women in leadership and good gender equality, so it's not uncommon for women to dress and act in ways that aren't attractive to men. 
8	beauty is in the eye of the beholder 
6	What the fuck even is this thread.
6	Why should we care how people look, unless it's for something like an advertisement or modelling? Often people overlook pure talent because the outside is not pretty. 
4	Pair off with ugly men? 
3	Some of the nicest people I know 
13	no such thing as an ugly woman. only lazy women.\n\nedit: some of yall take things way too literally. use your Ni.  the meaning of this statement is that most women are not inherently ugly. no, not every woman is going to be stunningly gorgeous. but most women are capable of looking decent. and most women do in fact look decent. on the occassion that i see an outstandingly ugly woman, it is usually due to taking poor care of herself, exhaustion, excess weight, drugs, NOT because of inherent, uncurable ugliness. basically, what im saying is that women are pretty beautiful creatures by design, and also glow up is a real thing\n\nsource: am woman
4	They too can find love and romance, but since they are 'ugly' it would be a bit harder to attract guys. \n\nTo balance the playing field, the woman could become successful and have an interesting personality. \n\nKey: make yourself valuable in other dimensions 
2	Everything you cant see on the outside, you'll find underneath 
2	Ugly in terms of physical attribute is not something I would hold against anyone. \n\nI sometimes come off as vain because I value self care and putting in an effort at looking good. Looks should not be an excuse for someone to just ignore basic upkeep. It is a known fact that attractive people get better treatment from others and in a way have it easy in some aspects. But there’s also a personality trait that plays along which is kindness. \n\nI will see someone who is unattractive and label them as so, ugly would be someone who is a shit person in general. No matter how attractive they may be, there’s some nasty personality traits out there that continue to get glorified and mimicked thanks to social media and the cultural immersion on it. 
2	If they are genetically ugly then whatever, I won't have any particular thoughts or reservations about them until I speak to them.  \n\nIf they are superficially ugly (those girls who cake themselves in makeup and wear fake fur coats etc.) then I won't even look in their direction.  \n\nIf they are fat, I will speak to them/be friends with them but I won't pull any punches about telling them it's their fault they are fat when they inevitably complain about it.
2	I love having sex with ugly women but women who do not start their sentences with a capital letter are not going to get this banana. I have standards after all.\n
4	It’s unfortunate.  I mean women receive special treatment in general if they are average to attractive.  Thirsty guys will ask them out and they rarely experience the type of loneliness your typical Incel/neckbeard would.  \n\nHowever below average guys can always focus on their careers and building their wealth.  So even if they spend their early adulthood lonely, they can attract mates in their 30s and beyond often with younger more attractive women.  \n\nWhen it comes to ugly women they can’t really do the equivalent of this.  Building wealth and status will allow them to live independently but it won’t necessarily attract the Chads.  Many guys would still choose a hot poor women over an ugly rich one.  
3	Then that’s double the reason to not be fat.
2	Really gorgeous housewives who drive large range rovers are terrifying. It’s easy to make yourself prettier, it isn’t easy to finish your dissertation and provide for a family without a husband. Value extends past physical appearance. 
1	Life is unfair so deal with it.
-4	I feel bad for them.
-5	As a woman, you will always be judged on the basis of your appearance even if you're at the CEO level so use that to your advantage.\n\nMake up is a short term solution worthy only of the short sighted, it is an ongoing cost both in material and time that you will never get rid of.\n\nGet plastic surgery if you do anything more than light  make up on a daily basis - that's the truly efficient and long term solution.
9	Would you rather be stupid or ugly and why?	I would rather be stupid because it is not as noticeable.
21	Ugly. Because there’s always plastic surgery and makeup.
20	stupid because i wouldnt even know
19	As I girl I'd rather be stupid. If I were a guy I'd rather be ugly
12	Sometimes I wish I could just take the blue pill.  Everything is fine.  You can trust the government.  You can trust Facebook.  The world doesn't suck.\n\nWho wants lottery tickets!?
5	When you are ugly, once you stepped outside of your house, you are subject to cruel judgment from others. I would rather be stupid, at least I would have friends and sex
2	That's a loaded question. I feel like as a woman being ugly is unforgivable. Being stupid is. If I were a man I'd say ugly, but if I as a woman want advantages I better be stupid. \n\nI'd still rather be an ugly female scientist than the world's beautiful woman with low intelligence. \n\nKnowledge is power. 👊
1	id rather not worry and just be happy with what ive been given. if im stupid i can educate myself, if im ugly, well theres a lot of other things you can do to make up for that
1	If average ugly or average stupid, then ugly.\nIf extremely ugly or extremely stupid, then stupid. \n\n
9	Can a Te dom feel what they don't think?	In Jungs original Fe description he remarked how they cannot think what they don't feel. I'm curious if the opposite occurs for Te dominants?
17	I can feel what i dont think, in the sense that I might feel sad or stressed out without knowing why, and I don’t realize what it was until later.
12	We just ignore our feelings and march on! 😉
7	Yup. Like someone already said; we feel some way but don’t understand why. \n\nI often look at my feelings like a puzzle so you’ll often find things in my search history like: symptoms of happiness, how to differentiate sadness from tiredness etc. As long as I can connect to emotions to something tangible, that’s the only way I’ll understand. 
4	Maybe I am a minority in this from the comments, but I actually know exactly what I am feeling and why I am feeling it. \nThe thing is, I don’t feel connected to those feelings because I am able to suppress them into nothingness to get sh!t done, and also, just because I feel that feeling, does not mean that is what I act on (I.e. if something makes me jealous, I would logically think through what my appropriate response should be and that’s what I will act, therefore suppressing the jealousy because it is irrational to the situation). 
4	Oh yes. I can feel one way, but if I think those feelings are irrational or inconvenient to my purpose I'll put them to the side. I can suppress my feelings in order to get things done, e.g. fear, love, grief. 
2	I often know what I feel and I can recognize why I must feel that way in terms of the perspective I have. I think it's more of an Ni function than a Te one.\n\nI usually "feel my feelings" as a sort of internal gravity that pulls me towards understanding or seeing certain patterns as being more important than others. I guess as a Te-dom I'm left feeling like I have a "code" or a bushido that I have to reconcile with my external world.
1	Yes. Normally those feelings come when I consciously repressed and refuse to confront my stronger emotions. I usually feel confused and uncomfortable because I won’t recognise why do I feel that way. \nThis is definitely not healthy, however I still consider many of my intense emotions are obstacles to my goals and logic. 
0	Entj Te rationale is going to be tied to Fi morality and personal internal feeling, but it’s going to be weak.  For example you would be afraid of a decision having dire consequences despite all signs pointing towards it being the very best option.  \n\nTe would never overlap with Fe unless you were angry, at which point Te is out the window by default.  Perhaps why this is a rare occurrence.  Otherwise the social normalcy proposed by Fe is generally always going to be emulated/resultant of Te-Fi decisions.\n\n(My understanding as an INTP)
18	Balance in love	I either give 0% or 100% to everything that I do including love. When I give 0% in love, I don't show any emotions and I completely control the relationship to an unhealthy degree. When I give 100%, I make the person my priority and do way too much for them and when it doesn't work I am really hurt. I do get over it in a few days but that doesn't mean that I didn't experience pain. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow do I get to about 60%? I think this is a good balance 
17	[deleted]
4	Finding a partner compatible with our intensity is difficult. Things are really polarized. Sometimes I will get over it that same day. Other times it took months. One thing is for sure; I walk away knowing I did my best. My ego walks away knowing they wont find what they experienced with me for a long time.\n\nI am working on getting my ego to chill the fuck out and when necessary shut the fuck up.\n\nI can tell you that when you meet someone compatible with you; it feels like you are a different species meeting one of your kind for the first time.\n\n&#x200B;
6	A few days? Chill out there, young'n. I have a feeling that you'll figure this shit out as you get older.
2	When I was having problems with partners, I looked at my past relationships to try to find similarities in my partners and in the way I acted and treated them. I tried to think of our fights and any complaints they voiced - were there any similarities there? What are things most people need out of relationships, and do I fulfill those needs as a partner? Also, I assessed my needs in a relationship and made a mental list of dealbreakers, which I followed pretty ruthlessly.\n\nAs far as the black or white thinking, what I do is envision Schroedinger's cat in a box - simultaneously alive and dead, a 0% and 100% that coexist. But instead, I create more than one option in my head, like a flow chart. In the case of the cat, I'd section it out mentally by time (because after a few days with no water in an enclosed space, we know the cat is dead). I also like to examine variables and involve those on a separate gradient, if they can be similarly sectioned. Hopefully your brain is like mine and this technique makes sense. You probably will always be a black or white thinker, but there's ways around it.\n\nSince we deal with what we perceive to be reality/the truth/what is righteous, it is hard for us to think in grays. It is also nearly impossible, even with a LOT of discipline, to force myself to do something that I think won't work (to invest in a dead relationship, for instance). However, you will always have bad times, so think about ways to mitigate this without alienating your partner or lying to them.
3	I might not be the advice you were hoping, but to answer simply: balancing is a skill that you can learn.\n\n Like you I had a fairly black and white approach to things, even relationships. I had to learn to navigate this fine line. A good way to start is trying to be more "considerate ". I am not implying that you are not, but actively put yourself in the shoes of people I interacted with. This helped me get at realizing how i interacted with people I cated about. Also, above all COMMUNICATE, you cannot read people's mind, so if you wonder things aboit your behavior just ask. \n
1	If you're stuck on either 0% or 100% with how you put yourself out there then you likely need to do some digging into the "why" behind it and practice some self awareness - give that Fi function some attention. \n\nTake it from someone who was similar in my younger years and who is now going through a divorce after 8 years. I was a pretty intense person to deal with initially, my expectations and standards for things was extremely high, and I wanted to do everything I could to help build up my partner and elevate them to the potential that I saw in them, so I pushed him. He joined the military, he got a better job, started going to college - all of this was great and I was supportive, but when he would start to fail in any area, I couldn't understand why he couldn't be efficient like me and see the areas where he was failing. He began to resent me and even though I did back off and tried to give him space and empathy, but still if I saw him failing I'd come in and succeed for him, which ended up squandering his own identity.   \nThat's how we show we love and care about someone - we don't feel love, we think it.  We show care by investing in a person’s talents and potential, honing them to become the best that they can be, but that doesn't work for everyone - especially people who don't want it and when the relationship ends, we will be hurt.   \n\n\nFor my relationship, I went into it knowing that he wasn't an equal to me but I saw the potential there for it. What ended up happening is that when the partnership died and mutated into a parent-child dynamic, it corroded mutual respect, unequally distributed life burdens, fostered resentment, and made for an overall unappealing arrangement.   \nThe reason I mention and say all of this is because it has taken me a little over a month to just sit back, self reflect, see where everything went wrong, what I did wrong, understand some of the not so nice actions I chose to do after the split initially and what I found is that under that type of stress, I was in the grip of my inferior Fi. Realizing all of this and reflecting on it is what will end up allowing me to be more careful in the people I choose and further, it's helped me realize that I don't need to be everyone's savior or take care of them at max levels. Do some research on your cognitive functions, get to know yourself and your personality better, and self reflect - that is what will help find a balance between 0% and 100% - also recognize that not everyone wants or deserves you at 100%; make sure before you invest that, you're choosing someone worthy of it. 
1	i see no issue here
1	Dating is a market. You look at a bunch of prospects, they look at a bunch of prospects. Then you both settle.\n\nHormone-based dating is for teens.\n
11	Do you have any good ENTP friends ?	I love being challenged by my ENTP friends, one of whom gives me a massive hardon. \n\nTheir disregard for order is irritating, but I also find it really arousing...
8	Bouncer buddy of mine back in the day was an ENTP. I was his boss but he didn’t need instruction at all. Very independent.\n\nIt was funny to hear him arguing with drunk people at the front door. Always ran circles around ‘em.\n\nFun to bounce ideas off him as well, since he’d take the opportunity to flesh out the answers even if bringing a plan to fruition was unrealistic.\n\nEDIT: For instance, we once priced out all costs of building and registering a personal fishing boat out of 55 gallon drums, PVC, and pallets.
7	have an entp friend. he's my best friend.
7	My (amazing) girlfriend is an ENTP. So chill, but so awesome.
6	They tend to be both the best and the worst at the same time.
6	Agree with the comments on here. \n\nI’m ENTJ married to ENTP. I was intensely attracted to her but she also completely rocked my regime. Took me some time but once I got my head around what was happening and what she was all about, her allure became immediately relentless. \n\nFast forward a decade and we live in our own state of conversational and world domination-scheming bliss. Also business partners. We compliment and challenge and streamline each other and it’s cool shit. Kids are ENTs, too. No dull moments. Always fireworks and fun. Never a lull in sight. \n\nSpecifically, the ENTP’s conversational style and argument dominance is so fucking cool to observe. Like the “bouncer arguing with drunks” comment on here, I love watching her do her thing. \n\nNow that she’s owned the fuck out of her dumb ass family members (SFs, NFs, STs) and has some years behind her, she doesn’t really go full boar with nincompoops as often - only when needed really, and then I’m basically watching her and eating popcorn like “oh shit this is going to be fun seeing her destroy these unsuspecting fools.” \n\nIn a relationship, she needed someone whom she respected intellectually and conversationally - and we don’t pull out our P/J argument tricks on each other - there’s a mutual respect for one another’s intellect but the rest of the world is fair game, and we back each other up. \n\nENTPs: Love em, hate em, love to hate em, but you will not forget em. As I said she left her idiotic family in her superior dust years ago, but what do we hear the motherfuckers still talk about at EVERY family gathering? Her 😂. 
3	I'm an ENTP and I will say I love you guys. Some of my best friends are ENTJs and I really admire them. I dated an ENTJ girl once and her drive was very arousing to say the least. Have had a hard time meeting one since.
2	my entj's enforced order is irritating but also strangely arousing. sorry not an entp.
3	My boyfriend is an ENTJ and I’m an ENTP. I’m fact, several men in my life who are always around are ENTJs. I suspect your summary above might be accurate. The pair equals a lot of devilish conniving, social engineering and fun/
1	I am not into ENTPs. We annoy each other way too much. They are admittedly sexy tho O.o
1	Every ENTP I know, is great. But the one I like to spend most time with hangs out with an ISFJ and ISFP funny enough. 
1	My longest and possibly best friend is an ENTP\nand i and nobody else really understand why we have stayed good friends for so long. \n\n
1	A good friend and housemate of mine is an ENTP. Great friend but sometimes he can be annoying af. \n\nme: Sometimes dudes are into other dudes. Either way he's good people.\n\nENTP: Yeah I know that but pussy is so amazing. I just can't wrap my head around how you could not like pussy.\n\nme: -\_-
1	Ha - my best friend is an ENTP.   \nI'm a female ENTJ and he's obviously a male ENTP.   \nOur conversations when we were younger were pretty much this: "you're just too stubborn" (to the ENTJ), or "you don't know how the real world works" (to the ENTP).    \nAs we've gotten older we've both calmed down and rarely argue but still challenge each others thoughts and ideas and love a good debate. 
1	Yes.\n\nOne of my good fiends is an ENTP. We met randomly in the city.. I was tipsy  and went to Mc Donalds around 1am in the morning. I saw her sitting in the corner typing on her laptop whilst everyone around her was drunk which was very intriguing to me as I just had to know what she was up to. We got chatting and found out that we live 10 minutes away from each other, have mutual colleagues and we both are in the process of finding our feet in the city in similar ways. We meet up once or twice a quarter to catch up. I think she is a soulmate but not a romantic one. 
4	Breaking out of my "shell"	Hey, so I'm currently in a weird place in my life. I am 20 years old, a full-time student and full-time worker, and I am really working on myself and trying to develop my Fi. I've dealt with and healed a lot of past trauma but I have not unlearned toxic behavior. My biggest problems are my abandonment issues. I've gotten clear about it, but I still repeat the cycle. The other day I wrote down all the times I abandon people and what triggered it and saw a pattern of me not being able to voice my opinion/feelings. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a tendency to bottle everything inside and then it boils up and instead of exploding, it implodes. I lose all interest and care regarding the subject at hand, and just leave it out to dry. For example, I recently just got quit my old job. I was a manager at a restaurant who recently got hired at corporate and would work part-time for corperate doing simulations/Grand Openings. I learned so much while at a corporate and wanted to create systems to help improve the store and take it to new heights. However, all the bottled feelings imploded while I was there and I lost all interest in the job where I had a lot of upward mobility potential. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can't keep letting my feelings get in the way of my potential and also for emotional health and well being. This isn't the first time I've left a team because I imploded, it's a constant thing. I get upset, don't speak on it, implode, start a new somewhere else doing the same thing and repeat. How do you deal with your Fi? Literally, the only thing I know how to deal with this is to abandon and I'm 80% sure is because I feel abandoned. 
7	I was behaving exactly the same way when I was your age, I also had abandonment issues (my parents were terrible) where as now I am outspoken and assertive to the point I am incredibly happy at the man I look at in the mirror.  \n\n\nMy advice; start forcing yourself to speak up.  At first your voice might be a bit shaky or you might not communicate your feelings clearly enough because you aren't used to it, and maybe you're scared it will drive the other person away.  That's fine, let yourself learn from your mistakes.  The more you do it the better at it you will get.    \n\n\nYou also need to come to terms with the fact that people WILL abandon you, that's life.  It's not on you though, it's on them.  Once you start to clearly express your feelings either people will run for the hills or they will stick around.  See it as a filtering exercise.  You only want the people who give a shit about your opinions and feelings surrounding you.  Once I became a full grown ENTJ my "friends" started to drop off like flies, and it's not because I wasn't worthy of being accepted, it's because they were intimidated by me, and being in my presence made them realize they aren't who they could be.
5	I had issues with my emotions because even tiny amounts of stress would throw me into flight or fight mode (PTSD thing). I highly recommend you go see a therapist irl. They are seriously very helpful.
1	When I'm in the grip of my inferior Fi, I do what I call a deep dive. I begin researching, learning, digging for information about what is going on and why - I look at the cognitive functions that I'm ignoring, I look at my actions to course correct and if I'm feeling really antsy about something and just can't sleep, I get up and start digging again and it usually helps the feelings to pass almost immediately when I start reading about why I am the way I am. I then look at reflecting - to do that, I lay all my initial thoughts out there about something on paper or typed - re-read it to see that it's not rational or logical and that I'm not taking responsibility for myself or my actions - and then try to find the base emotion; anger, sadness, fear....When you become more self aware of what it is you're feeling, you can then start to handle how you want to deal with it or find what works best for you. I get to points where I get frustrated and don't feel like I'm heard on things so I allow myself to "quit for the day" and dive into something different until I feel that I've calmed down enough to revisit it. I had to find a healthy outlet to deal with the pent up energy so that it could dissipate (for me, going on a deep dive of information) and then I'd revisit whatever was bothering me before with clarity.  \nBefore, when I was really unhealthy, all that pent up energy in me would come out as an explosion and I've probably broken more glasses than I'd like to admit. 
4	Can't stand school	This has nothing to do with MBTI, I just want to hear from some like-minded individuals.\n\nI have a full ride to a great state university, perfect GPA, excel in all my classes, yet have no motivation for all of it. I keep putting off work and wasting time on the internet, because I know things are gonna turn out fine anyways. I wish I had some sort of big project or goal to pour myself into, because school feels so trivial to me. I know school is necessary, but at least for the way things are taught at my school, it really is not exciting in any way. I love my major, but I wish I could be putting my energy into working on something real, instead of mind-numbing assignments. I'm so impatient to just graduate and start working already.\n\nI play in a band, exercise frequently, enjoy reading and learning on my own prerogative, and occasionally make efforts to socialize, so it's not like I have no life outside of school. In the words of other people, I have my shit together. But that's the problem; I have my shit together and it's stagnant and unexciting. I've probably achieved the Si definition of success and happiness. But I'm so hungry for more. And I don't know what to do. Like, back when I was a younger teenager, I could usually just get my excitement from the social realm, but I don't even care about that anymore. I want to pour my blood, sweat, and tears into something worthwhile. Maybe I need an Ne user to give me some ideas...
10	That means you're not challenging yourself and you're not doing enough.  When I was in college planning for grad school I was extremely involved and still did well in school.  By my fourth year I was doing research, held leadership positions in multiple organizations, worked part-time at a job relevant to my intended career path, and on top of that I was crushing school.  Oh and I also had time for friends, my girlfriend, and exercise.  People in my career path pretty much consider it easy to do well in school when you're not doing much else.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you find you have that much free time why don't you go find in internship or job relevant to your career path.  Or find some organization you feel strongly about and work your way up to leadership positions.  Or maybe find a branch of student government that fits with you and apply for it.  There are endless ways you can do meaningful work in college outside of school.  I'm telling you this because I was like you my first two years of college until I met some truly impressive people that showed me what success actually looked like and inspired me to push my limits.  And I did, which I am so thankful for.
2	Drop out, join a startup, move to Malaysia. I did it, it’s more fun than studying. 😃
2	ARE YOU ASKING FKR A CHALLENGEEEEE!!! Seriously though, you should like a really fast car stuck in a 25mph zone.\n\nGet an internship, begin R&D for a startup, improve your community, find a passion/hobby, teach yourself practical skills related to actual positions you'll get upon graduating (I graduated in marketing, and like 70% of what I learned was fluff)\n\nThink of it this way. Right now, pretty much everybody you know is going the same speed because of an educational hierarchy. You're there just to get your piece of paper, and so is most everybody else (unless in a STEM field). Get yourself in a position to do something really disruptive in your field immediately upon graduation or even before! You may never have this much time/extra energy to explore possibilities again.
2	I associate dice clacking in a cup with this feeling, right before they are about to be thrown. Or that sickening moment of pause at the top of a rollercoaster. Just relax and let your brain take you for a ride. You have tornadic thinking, not linear thinking, so you won't always be able to guess your own next steps. This is your brain agitating things around, making you all restless. You'll come up with a bazillion projects soon (write them all down).\n\nMeanwhile, consider r/magnetfishing
1	Read books. Cook. Grab some friends and go out. Prepare a barbecue. Go to the pool. Anything that can help you work on a leadership role helps. You'll have a life after school, so make it easier on yourself now and learn how newer things work. Don't let your proactive personality be wasted online, unless you're in the stock market. 
1	Coming from someone who did much of the same at school, I wish I had focussed on getting good grades. I never went to university and because I’m self-taught in every aspect of my entire career, I constantly have to over-justify my worth and ability for new jobs.\n\nMany people get sold into hype and need the certainty of a piece of paper, and while in reality a degree or good grades doesn’t guarantee competency, it’s marketability for personal branding is quite useful. 
1	What is your major?
19	Anyone dealing with anger issues?	How do you guys have dealt or are dealing with this types of emotions?\n\nRecently I've been feeling angrier than normal, a growing pain product of being powerless and without options for my personal and financial growth. Its getting so bad I get angry at the slightest, tiniest inconvenience I encounter in my life. \n\nTo give some backstory I had to move out of my country because it was unbearable to live there and now I am in a new place full of opportunities, but opportunities which I can't take right now thanks to the fact that I don't have much money and I'm a new immigrant. Been struggling also to get a fair decent job to start with something but never passed the selection process, so I have to live by with shitty jobs which pays nothing at all and work hours are around 10 to 12 hours the day. I think the anger is the result of the frustration I feel deep inside of me thanks to the fact I can't achieve anything important or relevant. \n\nPardon me any typo or grammar error and thank you for reading.\n\n&#x200B;
12	Once you have more control over your life, you will be less angry. We tend to think of anger as being something that is happening to us rather than using it to guide us. Exercise also helps.
9	Anger is the manifestation of powerlessness and I think this emotion can tacitly dominate many ENTJs. I don’t think anyone wants to be made to feel helpless but the stratification of society and it’s treatment of immigrants can further push that feeling into overdrive. \n\nI’ve dealt with (and still am since it’s so circuitous at times) anger issues that are severe by most people’s definition because even if you have some control over yourself, being made to feel that you’re the Other and possess no options would infuriate anyone. You mentioned you’re new to this country, what has that been like? 
3	I just don't sleep enough and just [perceive people´s faces and social cues as aggressive](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5451790/)
3	Hey friend, this is a big change. It's okay to be frustrated, don't beat yourself up for things outside your control. Give yourself some time to adjust and try to keep a positive outlook while you establish yourself. It's okay to get angry, but maintain your dignity and people are more likely to respect you. \n\nNow it's time to gain control over your life any way you can. Save hard, avoid debt. Figure out the steps to take between where you are and where you want to be, and set goals for them - as an ENTJ I'll assume you're good at this. \n\nMake a good network of friends and connections you can call on for advice or help. I know you're working very hard hours, but see if you can find a weekend hobby to share with others in your community. 
2	I agree with the other comments here, but I want to supplement it with my experience. In anger management classes they teach you that all emotions are a choice, anger especially. So try to keep that in mind. It helps me to think about it that way. 
1	RULE NO. 1 - WE ALL DIE SOMEDAY. SO WHAT IS THE POINT OF BEING ANGRY? ALWAYS BE A LOVING PERSON.\n\nMOST OF THE PEOPLE DON'T KNOW HOW TO CONTROL THEIR ANGER. THIS GUIDED TUTORIAL WILL HELP THOSE WHO SUFFER FROM ANGER ISSUES.    \n\n\n[https://youtu.be/1GCLPTTB8s4](https://youtu.be/1GCLPTTB8s4) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLET'S HAVE AN OPEN DISCUSSION\n\n&#x200B;
1	I’ve been dealing with anger issues for as long as I can remember. Thankfully I use a sarcastic sense of humor and lots of work to lessen it.\n\nMy favorite phrase to use now is “oh, fuck off”, when something shitty or annoying happens. I mumble it, of course,  but cursing does help ease inner and external tension.\n\nAlso, I don’t show my anger publicly or in front of good friends or associates; I do vent to my family, but they’re my family, they’re there for that. Slamming doors (sometimes), lifting weights, and running really lessens range.
1	I am in a similar situation. I moved to another country when I was quite young and dumb, to get to as far from my family as possible. I have had anger issues since I was a kid. But it gets worse and worse as I get older, and I hate it (lol ironic).\n\nI actually threatened my ex with violence. I feel so horrible about myself I am considering suicide. I won't do it though. I am so embarrassed by my anger outbursts. Although a lot of people around me also get really angry, and I don't think too much of it. But I somehow judge myself very harshly when I get angry and hurt others. So tired of it.
1	Divorcing with kids - I believe my partner is an ESFP	I need some advice here on how best to handle this situation - been together almost 8 years, married 4 and had our first children within the first year we met.We've always had an unhealthy way of handling disputes, usually with me getting extremely fed up to where I'd throw the word divorce around as a threat to try and push him through manipulation to grow up. Well, the last fight we had, I also told him he needed to go and so he left and hasn't looked back (Sept 29th). For the first couple of weeks after he left, I tried talking to him but my competitiveness got the best of me in a couple of situations and we tried counseling for one session before he bailed on that because he didn't want to reconcile (I should also note that he was already sleeping with someone else by this point which was 17 days after he left).  I finally found out about the other woman, and many angry words were said, which then led to him actually filing for divorce 4 days later. I was pretty freakin' hurt - so I went to Austin with a girlfriend and spent a week there to do a deep dive into histrionic personality disorder because my husband has a pattern of behavior where when he's done with a relationship, he will quickly hop into another abandoning everything else (including two other children from a previous relationship, but their mother was also physically abusive so bit of a different story) - and he pretty much fits every symptom of histrionic.\n\nEither way, since my husband left, he hadn't really asked about the kids, I had to initially get him to start coming over to see them, and he wouldn't ever take them overnight because he's living with his bachelor friend and his house isn't really kid friendly. Since he's left, he's maybe seen them 6 times for a duration no longer than an hour each time.To further my frustration with everything, initial girl is no longer in the picture as of Nov 26th, and by the 28th, he'd met a new girl that he is now shacked up with. Instead of trying to work with me on seeing our children or being around, he's decided to leave it to the courts to grant him permission to see them (first custody hearing is Thursday) and in the meantime, he's enjoying going out every evening with his new girlfriend (and had been prior to this chick anyways).\n\nNow with both of us being E's, we have a large circle and know a lot of people, so I've run into him with this new girl already and made it clear that I was not happy to see them, which they promptly left the bar. But I recognize that it's my competitive nature of having to one up him that causes me to act out like that because honestly, I feel like he's beating me in the whole "moving on" department and that shouldn't even be an issue to me, but it is.\n\nWhat I am curious to know is - for you ENTJ'ers with kids; how do you keep yourselves in check with an ex? How did you handle your weaknesses and what are some better ways to deal with wanting to be on top in the short term? Even now with everything that's happened, I'm still over here trying to push him to grow by understanding why he does what he does, and I need to quit. This isn't someone I can just drop from my life completely like I wish I could and because of that I'm still finding myself with one foot in the door because I do see the potential for growth there despite the disloyalty....
7	What do u want? Magic words? There is no help. Move on. Bad choices were made for not using your Ni sufficently enough or not building ur knowledge to improve ur Ni. In the first place why would u even marry an esfp lol... u got hella baited.
6	>We've always had an unhealthy way of handling disputes, usually with me getting extremely fed up to where I'd throw the word divorce around as a threat to try and push him through manipulation to grow up. \n\nThis ultimatum thing is a very bad behavior you've developed. You aren't a spoiled kid, you're  an adult interacting with your adult husband. It is good you are divorced because neither of you respect the other, clearly. Please do not use a similar behavior to control your children or you will fuck them up. No offense, not saying you do, just warning you. Accept people as they are, and make sure you respect the next guy you date. Weak ass guys like your ex are comforting, but they are not a real relationship. A real partner is someone who can challenge you, is as smart as you, and who can competently take the reins occasionally. \n\n>Well, the last fight we had, I also told him he needed to go and so he left and hasn't looked back (Sept 29th). \n\nWhy would he? The marriage was dead. You shouldn't give out ultimatums unless you actually mean them. They are not meant to be so candid and they break your partner's trust in you. \n\n>For the first couple of weeks after he left, I tried talking to him but my competitiveness got the best of me in a couple of situations and we tried counseling for one session before he bailed on that because he didn't want to reconcile (I should also note that he was already sleeping with someone else by this point which was 17 days after he left). \n\nYou blame everyone but yourself for so many things, when you orchestrated it in many ways. This is your creation, behold what you made.\n\n> Now with both of us being E's, we have a large circle and know a lot of people, so I've run into him with this new girl already and made it clear that I was not happy to see them, which they promptly left the bar. But I recognize that it's my competitive nature of having to one up him that causes me to act out like that because honestly, I feel like he's beating me in the whole "moving on" department and that shouldn't even be an issue to me, but it is.\n\nI need to "win" break ups too, but usually I do so by acting like I never cared in the first place. Cool as a cucumber in public, pissed off and ranting like a lunatic on the inside at home.\n\n>What I am curious to know is - for you ENTJ'ers with kids; how do you keep yourselves in check with an ex? How did you handle your weaknesses and what are some better ways to deal with wanting to be on top in the short term? Even now with everything that's happened, I'm still over here trying to push him to grow by understanding why he does what he does, and I need to quit. \n\nI don't have kids, but I try very hard to not burn bridges in life, including with exes. And ultimately, I shrug off most things that I cannot change (e.g. your exhusband's personality, the status of your relationship, so on) because it's a waste of time to tilt at windmills. He's going to be a shitbird, the best you can do is plan and adapt. You do not have the right to "push him to grow" any more (which sounds like a PC way of saying you're forcing someone to bend to your will). And let's be honest, he is doing this to piss you off and it's working (or else he wouldn't be so in your face, at the same hangouts, etc). \n\n\n>This isn't someone I can just drop from my life completely like I wish I could and because of that I'm still finding myself with one foot in the door because I do see the potential for growth there despite the disloyalty....\n\nNo, it's because you didn't end it; he did. So you want your sense of control back. He will never give it to you, and he's flaunting his choices specifically to show that he is not controlled by you any more. Just let it go. Focus on what you could have done better, so you don't make similar mistakes in your next relationship. Treat him respectfully and coldly, like a stranger.
3	Holy fuk no wonder ur such a sh***t*r at life, ur some ESxP type LOL, my bad not once have u said ur an entj. Go to the infp forum, this place is not for someone like u. Go do urself a favour, ur not meant for practical self improving advice.
3	SFP here. If it makes you feel any better, your ex isn’t recovering any better than you are.\n\nHe’s manically fucking whatever will have him so he can feel validated and not have to confront his real issues (which you are currently doing, by staying single and reflecting.)\n\nWhen you are eventually able to move on it will be in a healthy and complete way, whereas he is going to have to hustle constantly to feel loved. One day it will catch up to him and he will look back and wish he had handled things differently with you.\n\nTrue story.
1	How would you define an ESFP?
0	I have never met an interesting ENTJ	Everything you talk about is so mundane. How can someone so efficient appear so soulless? Even the topics on this sub are agonizingly dull. Become something.
30	...says someone with the username of depressed_betamanlet...\n\nIt’s okay if you don’t care for me; I’ve looked through your history, and I don’t care for what I’ve read there, either. To each their own.
28	Ever heard that saying "You're bored because you're boring"?
27	The cool thing about being an ENTJ is that I know I'm interesting, and I don't give a flying fuck what you or anyone else thinks.
20	I have never met an interesting depressed betamanlet. Everything you talk about is so pathetic. How can someone so self-aware be so unwilling to change? Even this conversation is agonizingly dull. Become something.
17	*thinks to self: Yeah, I'm not going to bother commenting on thi-* **FIGHT ME BITCHHHH**
12	We have Fi, you, as an INTP have Fe in your main function stack. Fe is just as illogical as Fi, yet for some reason INTPs will hold onto it with their last breath. When we get stuck in indignant, righteous Fi and you're doing Fe things, we clash. Because you're operating within a framework (Fe) and we're actively working as if that framework doesn't exist and THEN filtering our opinions/thoughts/feelings through it after we pick the best solution. If Fe gets in the way of that solution, then we just punch through it. \n\nAnd because of all that, we don't particularly mind the thought of being boring. We know we're authentic to ourselves (Fi). Can't please everyone, unfortunately, so you may as well make yourself happy.\n\nAnd ENTJs aren't the best at writing emotively. We're much better and more charming irl.
6	Lol
2	It depends on your interpretation of interesting. Maybe not EXXP kind of interesting or goofy but these ppl have insight and drive and a wonderful sense of dark humor. Perfection does not exist, perfection can only be strived for and sought after and not everybody liles the same things.
2	I honestly think ENTJs are pretty interesting to understand and spend time with. But each to their own? 
2	Well I adore ENTJ's
2	Who hurt u
1	Do you have some suggestions?
1	We don’t depend on others’ insight  nor do we care to make others feel needed for their own sense of validation. We are too busy becoming for something of a higher purpose that doesn’t serve your entitled sense of entertainment.  Our priorities don’t include being a pawn in anyone’s life. You sound dysfunctional codependent and entitled so you should do some soul searching yourself , (well meaning advice from a “soulless entj “ )
1	Well what would you define as interesting? I'm an ENTJ that ran away to Tokyo for a couple years to become a gaijin hostess.

3	Biological Immortality. My ultimate goal has made itself known. Working towards a world where eventually, the only people who have to die, are the ones that choose to willingly.\n\n\nThis however, requires solving some serious problems, from our own mortality as it is today, all the way to how we as a world sustain population trends that would drastically change from what they are today. \n\n\n1 problem at a time & humanity can get there. People just have to be motivated enough to do what it takes, & know what's actually possible, that's all it takes. That, and time.

I'm currently sessioning for one band and have been asked to join another - the latter I have only accepted on a temporary basis. \n\nNo guarantees of long-term work for the session thing, but I also see this artist doing pretty well and I might be kept on. On the other hand, while the band I was asked to join aren't quite there yet, I know I can help with moving them along. Both acts have label interest so the real question is who I side with in the event of a clash of dates...

10	Check out Steves ENTJ philosophy. Notice the way he wants to Te build things that WORK for the people.	
4	Steve is one of my idols\nI know he's known for burning people out, but I see so many companies not have any vision at all and just rely on numbers and sales  \nI'll always admire how even while being successful Steve still pushed for new designs and products, some of which made no sense at all, but the fact that they made completely new products instead of iterating on the same ones over and over again like Apple does now is incredible. It's ridiculously risky, but very bold and innovative
3	Excellent video. Good to see Ashton Kutcher is aging well.﻿
2	It's a common mistake to type him as ENTJ. He's most definitely an ENTP. The ENT is obvious. He's a P because he rejects tradition.\n\nOne of his most famous quotes clearly demonstrates it:\n\n"Here's to the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers,  the round pegs in the square holes... the ones who see things  differently -- **they're not fond of rules**... You can quote them, disagree  with them, glorify or vilify them, but the only thing you can't do is  ignore them because they change things... they push the human race  forward, and while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius,  because the ones who are crazy enough to think that they can change the  world, are the ones who do."
5	Best distraction proof planning system?	Do you have a favorite planner or methodology for keeping track of your goals and plans? If so how? There are more distractions than ever in today's world and I have a hard time staying focused.\n\nTrying new planning apps on my phone never seems to go well as every timeI go in to check my planner, I get distracted my one of hundreds of notifications, then totally derailed from what I was trying to accomplish.\n\nI've tried some pocket planners, but they always seem to get mashed/broken and are overall just kind of annoying to carry around. Unless I have a button up shirt with a front pocket, but then I just feel silly and it usually ruins my shirts.\n\nAny suggestions?
6	I have a big whiteboard and a monthly calendar with goals in my room. I also journal and have special pages dedicated to future plans and ideas. Another thing I do is set reminders on my phone sometimes even years in advance of whatever I wanna be reminded of.
5	Declutter your phone. Even if only for some days.\nUse a neutral wallpaper. Uninstall every app you haven't used in the last day and keep only the essential ones. Use your favorite schedule app for everything else. After you forget the information barrage in a swipe, things will be more clear. 
2	I use Trello for TODOs I do not want to forget, Google Calendar tied to email / text reminders for appointments and things that I cannot miss, pretty much always half a pencil with some paper when I am on the go to write down important ideas / todos / contact info. I use phone too to take pictures, etc. but I treat the phone as if I am going to accidentally drop it in the ocean in any time. Not a lot of paper - only a few pages - just enough to jot the important things down. After I am back at my computer, I turn those paper notes into electronic notes (by typing). The idea is to write down only the important info, so I keep it short.\n\nOn my computer I have a single file that keeps on changing. Always saved on the desktop. Never more than 1 page long. No formatting. Just a common scratch area. If I have not finished something in the evening, I dump the remaining todos in this scratch area. It is meant for short-term stuff only and I work hard to keep the number of TODOs in this scratch area at 5 or less. Anything more than that would overwhelm me and needs to go into a longer-term storage like Trello.\n\nIf I am flushing out an idea in a longer format but can't work on it yet, I will save all those thoughts in a separate file. The idea here is that I cannot and should not rely on my memory. If I had an epiphany or a good point, I write it down. I know that I will most likely forget it otherwise.\n\nNot that I am not a student. Student life is more hectic and more short-term focused.\n
1	Samsung Note 8 with OneNote as stylus shortcut\n\nGoogle calendar with notifications and reminders.\n\nSomething that has in recent months changed the game for me completely in terms of staying focused is nutrition. Zero carb carnivore / keto / intermittent fasting ... 6000mg salmon oil daily. It has changed my life. Might work for you too.
1	Kanban system paired with a pomodoro timer should do the trick. 
7	Does anyone else often lose the will to work ?	I sometimes go through phases where I just want to have too much fun and I feel unmotivated to do work. This usually happens when my sleep is off.
12	Yeah I do this. Most days I'm very proactive, loving my gig and the freedom it gives me. Staying on top of house chores and dinner making. Than for like 3 or 4 days a month I just feel like a looser with too much to do and end up binge watching something in my pjs all day while the house goes to shit.  It like little spouts of depression. Honestly I figure its a change in my chemical makeup as it gets closer to "that time of the month". IDK for you though... 
3	I think we actively ignore Si, or at least I do. With fibromyalgia, I often consciously try to ignore my pain and aches, or I wouldn't get anything done. I forget to drink water, I put off sleep (and schedule my sleep, getting disappointed that I tend to oversleep because fibromyalgia comes with messed up sleep). This is probably why mindful meditation is so helpful for me, and it may help you all too. I remember other ENTJs agreeing with me in how annoying bathroom breaks and other biological necessities are.
3	I don’t feel useful. I need to feel useful again to have a strong will to work.
2	4 days a month sound about right.
2	Me too, except basically every day. I'd say I'm not an ENTJ, but I've psychoanalyzed myself too many times to do that.
2	Ye, sometimes i watch TV Series, eat chips, and drink beer for few days, then i feel like a lazy cunt without future and i have great motivation to do all unaccomplished work in few hours of hard work. Then i'm back to normal. 
1	Yes. I go through these phases. I end up doing all my work more hours before deadline and being disappointed in the quality produced. \n\nI know better and I blame myself, but it doesn't change anything. This is my first semester back after two years not attending school and I have maybe three days out of the whole week where I'm actually productive. I feel like a Trump running the nation... \n\nMaybe it has to do with diet and bad sleep schedule. I really think it has to do with my depression and the fact that the school doesn't have syllabi so I can't plan my study schedule beyond every two or three weeks. It really screws with me that I don't have a set projected schedule. \n

19	Advice for a young ENTJ on discipline and habits	**Me:** 20 years old ENTJ studying law.  \n\n\nI have a problem with discipline, and by that I mean sitting down to study. I often set a goal like, today i am going to learn chapter 1-2 or something like that, but then I just procrastinate by playing video games, surfing the internet and watching porn. When I look back on my life, I see what I could have accomplished by now if it wasn't for these destructive habits and lack of time management.\n\nI also can't seem to find what I truly want in life. I already dropped out of another university because I didn't see myself doing it in the future. I can see myself being a lawyer and enjoying it, buts somehow that spark isn't there, the big motivation is absent.\n\nI feel like the habits mentioned above are the reasons for my failure, but I can't drop them, they always come back no matter how hard I try (especially the porn).\n\nAnyone had any experience with this? If so how did you overcome it?  \nThanks in advance!
12	Discipline is SO important for an ENTJ. Sort yourself out now. Hit the gym everyday, fix your diet, you will  feel great.
5	I understand the distraction because I’m usually focused on so many things and want to get so much done that my inner world is unorganized. I have so many things I want to control, but can’t. I have to remind myself to prioritize. I thrive on check lists.\nI work best in spurts of energy on each thing. I can sometimes get bored if something I’m doing is taking longer than I expected and the boredom causes distraction. So basically, I procrastinate by doing something else that also needs my focus. \nWhen I was in college, I couldn’t sit down for 2 hours and study one subject. I could easily switch subjects every 30 minutes.
6	I'm gay.
3	You're taking life in too large of chunks. Set smaller goals to get used to working until your goal is completed. And, however small they need to be, don't stop working till you get to the point you decided was ok to stop. \n\nThis builds the discipline of finishing what you start. And 90% of reaching any goal is just finishing what you've started. And 90% of finishing what you start is breaking it into small enough chunks that you maintain motivation with each step. You just need to know how small YOUR chunks need to be. \n\nStop thinking about the larger goal of your career. Clearly that's a bigger decision than you are comfortable making right now. Focus on the smaller goal of finishing the classes that are required for all degrees. Then take things that you like or that seem useful, and see where that leads. Give yourself time and permission not to decide just yet. \n\nLife is a marathon. You don't have to have your shit together right this minute. And frankly, if you have too inflexible of a plan, you're going to miss out on a lot of what makes life worthwhile. 
3	There's really no excuse, shortcuts or cheats when it comes to having healthy habits and good discipline. You just force yourself to do it. Of course, takes thing slowly one step at a time. No one goes from zero to hero in a day. One step at a time and be consistent. \n\nBut then again, no one is perfect and everyone indulges in guilty pleasures from time to time. The key here is moderating those pleasures. People with higher libido feels the need to masturbate more often, fine. But when it starts to get in the way like you say, then it is time to moderate it. Plan a specific time to wank or just get used to wanking less often. 
2	My first bit of advice is drop the porn.  The more you consume it the harder it will be to drop it later on.  It can also adversely affect your sex life and your ability to be intimate with someone (there is scientific data to support how harmful porn is in this respect, this is not just me being ideological).  I can also vouch for this on an anecdotal level.  \n\n\nI was also in law school when I was 20 and doing the exact same things you are now.  The spark wasn't there for me either, and so I dropped out.   Life is too short to do something you don't enjoy, and ENTJs don't have to be Lawyers or CEOs to be happy, they just have to be focused and disciplined, and constantly working to improve themselves at something they are passionate about.  \n\n\nHave you considered that the habits might be a consequence of doing something you don't see as meaningful, as opposed to the opposite? If your situation is anything like mine was, then it's possible that those self destructive habits are the consequence of a nihilistic outlook on your studies.  \n
2	For me, my interest and passions are so intense that discipline and motivation aren't a factor. Any action not propelling me towards experiencing more joy/pleasure from progressing within my interests is felt as an inefficient, senseless time sink. \n
2	I'm going to give you some practical advice that helped me when I was studying law. Go and study in the university library, and only take your readings. If your home environment is not conducive to study, then put yourself somewhere without distractions. Leave devices behind if you can, or join a study group where others will keep you on track. \n\nIf you want to be a lawyer then you're going to need to learn to be disciplined - they charge by the six minute unit, so get used to accounting for your time now. \n\nAlso, kick the porn addiction. All you're doing if flooding your brain with endorphins and becoming chemically dependant on that high. It's the high fructose corn syrup of the mating game, and there's nothing positive about being a porn addict.Try masturbating without porn for a while. Masturbation is a means to an end, not a hobby.
1	You sound like you may have some depression. Have you ever discussed with a Doctor? \n\nFor me. I always start with replacing one bad habit with one good habit. Start with one habit a week and make it stick. \n\nSo for example when you feel the urge to mindlessly surf the internet, do ten pushups or go for a run, or replace it with some form of quick exercise. \n\nThis week I am cutting out alcohol and snacking  to focus on weight loss efforts. I’m replacing the bad habits with things like drinking tea, going for a walk, painting nails, etc. \n\nWhen you replace the bad energy sucking habits with good ones you will feel like you are more focused and in a better state of mind and will be more open to learning new things.
1	I relate to the whole procrastination deal. Playing games, surfing the Internet, watching porn even though it doesn’t even arouse you. If it’s gotten so bad that you can’t control it, maybe it’s time to see a therapist. It may be a sign of depression.\n\nLike someone already said; having so many goals leaves our inner self disorganized. Even through my procrastination having a to do list really helps. I might not be able to fully accomplish everything but at least the chaos in my head can be organized in the real world. That way you get to see what is more important than the others and prioritize better. You may not be great at first but slowly you become more mindful of your tasks.
1	Look into reading The Demise of Guys. 
1	You are me... 6 years younger. I often think what I would have done had I not had my negative habits. But, I still got through grad school unscathed. You are intelligent. You know what to do. Its the execution and the endorphins captured from the instant gratification that get you.\n\nHere is a couple of things that have helped me throughout the years:\n\n"The Power of Habit" by Duhigg. I listened to the audio book in about a week. He gives you the intel on how to think about structuring habits. It turns out that the environment a habit is cultivated in is vitally important among other things.\n\n"Bullet Journalling!" A system of organizing to-do lists helped my productivity immensely.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll that, and I did spend one year on Anderall. That helped me get my shit together and get organized. The skills I acquired that year helped me get off it. My wife will tell you that I was no fun at parties when I was on the stuff, so I prioritized not becoming dependent on it in the long run.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, I am still imperfect. I am wasting time right now and have a deadline at 6pm. I'll get it done. It was just so great to relate to your post... fellow ENTJ.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I also want to agree with another commenter. Exercise and Eating well are super important for some ENTJs. I find that when those two aspects of my life are in focus, everything else just falls into place. I believe the concept is called having "capstone habits." \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for video games and fapping. For me (I love gaming) it need to stays in its proper place (Only at night, only a couple of hours). Fapping is another one. r/nofap is great. I'm not sure how sustainable. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGenerally speaking, I have found focusing on engaging new habits is a more fruitful process than eliminating poor ones. As the new ones become exciting and fruitful the poor/old ones just become less important. 
1	You just gotta do it. It takes a couple weeks to form a positive habit, but you gotta grind through those couple of weeks to get to that point.\n\nFor me it was practicing my drums. I love drums so much, but it was a drag for me to do drills and exercises, which are what makes you better the quickest. I always just wanted to jam, but I forced myself to sit down and do exercises for a few weeks, and now it's just a part of my routine.\n\nI'm in the same boat as you. I'm 22, and I spend the majority of my time playing video games and wasting time on YouTube and Reddit. Start with a small amount of time; I did 30 minutes a day, because I know for a fact I waste way more than 30 minutes a day watching pointless YouTube videos. Do whatever you're comfortable with and then build off of that when you're ready. Soon enough, it will become effortless, and you'll thank yourself for it. 
1	ENTP confirmed. Welcome, you weird stranger.
1	i literally schedule every minute of my day from breakfast at 8.30 until like 8pm. it helps me chunk out time to do hw, read, go to class, etc, and then i have all evening after i’m done w my schedule to dick around. i find spending a dedicated amount of time doing hw rather than setting out to accomplish a specific goal works better for me, cuz i know i can stop in an hour whether i’ve done what i planned to or not (and if i finish early, i reward myself by using the extra time to dick around). you might also wanna experiment w how much time u spend doing hw. like some ppl sit down and do it in 3 or 4 hour chunks while I try to go for 30m to 1h30m at a time. it helps that i love all my classes, but i was still p good abt this in high school when i didn’t. 
1	The Power of Habits is a great book on the subject.\n\nPrinciples by Ray Dalio is a fantastic book overall that everyone should read and also touches on the topic.
1	Every time you don't get your goals done for the day, remember that your time is limited in the end. As long as you enjoy those moments then, enjoy them, but 1 trick that might help even if you have days that you don't feel like doing anything is possibly this.\n\n\nDo something every day in the morning. No matter what it is. If you do something towards your goals for even 30 minutes to an hour, if you don't want to continue, you still did something. If you do want to continue, then you'll get even more done that day. Sometimes, just by making yourself do something for a little bit, when it's done, you feel a bit accomplished, & it motivates you to continue for another hour or 2 or before you know it, you spent all day being productive.\n\n\nAs long as being productive is your goal & what motivates you, then it will literally feed on itself, or build on itself, depending on the wording you chose to describe.\n\n\nAlso, not everyone knows what they truly want in life. I didn't know until my 30's. After high school I just wanted to have fun for a while, so I did!
1	While in law school, I couldn't study at home.  There were too many distractions.  I even had problems studying in the library because I'd see people I know, want to chat and get totally side tracked.  Therefore, I would set aside designated times and *places* for studying.  I tried various locations, like coffee shops, but in the end, rented a very small office space, where there was nothing to distract me.\n\nBefore each final, I would go to my office space, and hyper focus on that one subject for 5-6 hours.  By that point, if I didn't have my outline down to a one-pager, I'd spend that time to create one-pagers, and then memorize them, downsizing my thorough one-pager to a post-it, using acronyms that meant nothing to anyone else but me.  Then, at the exam, as soon as time starts, I'd read the call of the question, and immediately outline my one-pager, leaving out anything not included in the call.    \n\nI'd also spend that time to watch short bar prep summary videos on YouTube for the common subjects, like ConLaw.  As a refresher, I'd play these short bar prep videos and just listen to the audio while I was in the shower the morning of the exam.  \n\nFor the more formulaic topics, I'd draft sample answers in advance.  There are only so many ways a fruit vendor can violate a contract for delivery of fruit, or delivery of thoroughbred horses, or whatever.  \n\nAlso, if they're available, look at your professor's old exams and sample answers to see what they commonly test on.  It won't help you on the bar, but at least it'll help you narrow down what your specific professor is looking for to pass the exam in front of you.  You might also find that some professors are lazy and give the same exam over and over, with a slight change of facts.  Maybe you'll get lucky.\n\nPlus, practice tests, of course.       
1	To be very fair, I got through the entirety of pre-U, the military, undergrad by procrastinating (playing vidya + surfing for porn). Shit still got done very well. It does not matter how you accomplish your goal except that you do. Who cares if you don't study 2 chapters every day? Those are self-imposed objectives that don't mean much. Ace the graded assignments and exams and you'll be fine. Throughout my undergrad, not once did I sit my ass down to study if it wasn't last minute studying for something graded. So quite clearly, excessive wankery and overall laziness aren't exactly a cause for concern. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTrust me, you don't get to your goals by fixing inherent flaws. You learn to either create value from your weaknesses, working around them or simply offsetting them.  I'm not paid to be your life coach so no chance of me just telling you how to fix your current problem but you should be good enough to figure it out. After all, law students generally have a pretty high IQ and if you're posting here in ENTJ, you got the right personality as well. I like to think of one's intellect as a car's engine and one's personality as the transmission. You have 2 of the most essential components for you to go fast. So what if your wheels are a little bit fucked up?   \n\n\nAlso, goals don't necessary have to center around a job. A job is more often than not a means to an end. Having a job as a goal is fine for the short-mid term but what you really need is a long term goal. Figure out what you want from life and other things will fall into place. Good luck
43	Question: Are ENTJ’s shy?	Recently someone told me i am shy and hard to read in terms of being physically intimate with people and initiating physical contact. As we were laying in bed he remarked “ if i didn’t know different i would think that you don’t know how to maintain eye contact.” \n\nFrom my experience, i usually never initiate anything physically intimate  ( reaching for someone’s hand, kissing, touching in general) that could lead to me feeling rejected therefore leading to failure in some sense? maybe i am nervous or feel like i’m not skilled at reading peoples cues on wether they want me to make a move on them or not? i guess what i’m maybe asking is... \n\nare any of my fellow entjs out there also awkward as fük with being physically intimate with others? 
221	Lots of people think I'm an introvert at first. Honestly I just have no interest in them
52	I find it hard to maintain eye contact. I feel like I’m intimidating people, and people have commented that my eyes are very direct which many people are uncomfortable with. I also find some people’s eye contact too direct.\n\nHowever, I wouldn’t say I’m shy. I’m definitely reserved. I like to assess a situation before deciding my next move.
29	I wouldn’t say I’m shy because I’m very outspoken and direct in communication. I am very socially reserved though. I’m not good at reading emotional cues either so I’d prefer someone to just out right tell me if they’re interested in me. I don’t really enjoy physical contact with strangers so I won’t initiate anything physically intimate unless we’re close and I know that person is comfortable with it. So yeah I guess I’m awkward in that arena. \n\nIf you guys were lying in a bed together, that kind of insinuates something romantic? When guys try to hold eye contact with me in that lovey dovey way, I find it emotionally intrusive so I’ll cut it off. Again I don’t think that’s being shy, I think it’s just being socially reserved. Shyness means anxiety in the situation. 
27	shy only when around their crushes, i think
18	I'm only shy if I'm in a room with complete strangers. If I know a few people I'm likely to open up more in social settings
11	I don’t like being touched and I’m very reserved. \n\nMy girlfriend is the opposite and loves PDA . It’s hard to adjust but I’m working on it...
10	I'm not shy, and if I come across as shy or extremely reserved, it just means I don't care.
7	So I'm an ENTJ who is also an abuse survivor who used to fit that description.  The answer is that 'shy' is a descriptor for what is usually fear-based.  What the fear stems from can be pretty much anything.\n\nI say this from a place of utmost compassion for what you may have been through and as someone who used to have PTSD from the aforementioned abuse:  consider psychotherapy.  I had it, and I used to think I was an introvert - turns out, no, I'm an honest-to-god ENTJ, and there are a lot of amazing people who appreciate me for being the bold, nerdy, headstrong, attractive, brilliant, ambitious, stereotypically-pretty-masculine-for-a-straight-woman human being that I am!  I just had to cut my parents and those other assholes out of my life and heal from the trauma to figure it out.
6	relatable
3	Not particularly, but it may have more to do with your age & perception of yourself rather than a personality thing. He also sounds like he’s projecting a bit of his own personality? 
5	ENTJs can be reserved, majorly because they don't want to interact with the majority of people, or just like your case anxious (anxious of being rejected or anxious of failure in a social interaction), but almost never socially shy in the pure sense of the term.
3	I'm not shy, I just am not interested in a lot of people, and therefore can't be bothered to waste my time talking to them. If they say something that piques my interest, I'll inject myself into the conversation.\n\nWith physical intimacy, I'm quite comfortable with it. I don't find it awkward, but I also don't initiate unless I am 100% sure of what to expect from that person, and whether it is the same end goal that I'm also trying to achieve. 
3	Would also like to know this... asking for um... a friend.
2	No
2	No
2	Lol. No. 
2	I'm usually not interested in the person which is why I don't get physically affectionate on dates. My love languages don't involve physical touch, so I feel like things like cuddling are wasted time. I have to make a conscious effort to do things like hold hands and the like because I know my partner likes them. When I was younger, I didn't really do that, so there was a lot of friction, being older and wiser now I've learned it has to be done.\n\nAnother observation is that all the girls I've dated wanted me to initiate things, so it's possible that you are testing him to see how much of a leader he is. That may or may not apply in your situation.
2	Shy as far as initiating physical contact with someone? That depends on how well I know them. I am not going to just go up and touch random people.\n\nShy as in talking to people? Most times, I literally couldn't care less about people. Mean, I know, but I feel like it's my motto in life. I overall don't care about too much that too many people have to offer. Therefore, I won't say much because it's a waste of my time and energy. However, there are times where I just talk and talk. It all depends.
2	Lots I can relate to in here. \n\nWithout doing a whole "I'm this/that" what I will say is that I have actively been practicing being more affectionate because I've not been dating for a few years and I think my personality type has a lot to do with it.\n\nI've been practicing a philosophy of "unconditional unapologetic affection" which helps me deal with the risk of failure or exposing myself, I guess it also makes it slightly systematic.\n\nI've been rejected a date this week from somebody I see on a daily basis. It kind of sucked and even though we had a good air clear chat afterwards and both want to continue growing the relationship platonically and ultimately I'm glad I had the courage to ask, my armour is a bit chinked and it's going to take even more practice on my part not to push her away completely now.\n\nLike many have said, I find it hard to be interested in investing into people unless I feel a strong sense of chemistry - but by this time I'm probably into friend zone territory for others and have missed the romance boat.\n\nIf this is a personality thing, we would do well not to embrace it and to find balance by making a conscious effort to be more affectionate, especially with newer relationships.
1	My ex was pretty shy in one on one settings but funny and outgoing in group settings
1	No lol

1	I'm hardly shy, MBTI actually picked INTJ for me at first but I decided I was far more E than I. You might be INTJ.
1	No, most definitely a T. Might just be I’m reading body language and expressions quickly and bundle it in my mind. Use it a lot at work in negotiations so it might just be well trained, I see every glance and hear every inflection, so that’s what I mean about reading the room
1	Always thought I was an introvert, still feel like one.  However I am great at networking and enjoy leading people.  I've taken the MTBI a few times thinking it's wrong because I expect INTJ.  Nope.
-6	> Recently someone told me ... as we were laying in bed he remarked ...\n\nThat someone is more than just a fuck toy, no? Why call them "someone"?\n\nYou do want kids and therefore a husband, do you not?\n\n> awkward as fük with being physically intimate with others\n\nAre you German? That would explain some of it.\n\n> orphanofthevalley\n\nAre you an orphan? \n
-11	Speak about yourself. Typical ENTJs are the exact opposite of shy. We are dominant and have a very forceful and commanding presence. You sound more like an INTJ yo be honest...
40	An ENTJ perspective on stress and burn-out. Here's the reminder every ENTJ needs to take care of ourselves, because we all know self-care is not our natural strength.	So.. I'm going through the process of recognizing and respecting my emotional boundaries. This shit's hard and I think it's an important discussion to have, *especially* for people like us who naturally struggle with this aspect of our personalities. \n\nMy SO has been (very) ill lately, which has put tremendous pressure on my with regard to taking care of him and our household. I'm finishing up grad school and currently working on my thesis. I was absolutely fine (at least I thought so) despite being tired and stressed. A few weeks ago, I realized the time strain of my care duties at home would result in me not meeting my thesis deadline. I decided to talk to my supervisors and update them on me potentially not being able to meet the deadline and whether there was a potential for an extension. No worries, right? It's just business.\n\nWell.. when I sat down for the meeting, my main supervisor asked me a very innocent question: "how are you doing?" Although I was planning on having a normal, civilized discussion on the topic of my home situation, for some reason this question broke me. \n\nAfter this rather tough, emotional meeting, I realized I needed to inform quite a bunch of other people in my life as well that rely on me or have expectations of me now or in the foreseeable future. Being the straightforward me I am, I send out *a lot* of emails about my personal circumstances straight away that same day. \n\nEver since I *allowed* myself to acknowledge I'm having a tough time, the flood gates opened. I got a major case of the flu a few days later and I have been very emotional and introspective about my mental state since. About 10 years ago, I was diagnosed with a burnout following an ugly family situation. I had a scary moment of clarity some days ago in which I recognized *a lot* of behaviours which I also exhibited leading up to that burnout.\n\nThere is no way in FUCKING HELL I'm allowing myself to go down that path again. \n\nFollowing that realization, I took drastic measures: I cancelled 90% of my obligations outright, I no longer have an alarm on my phone so I can get as much sleep as I need, I no longer do any work on evenings and weekend, and I've asked my mum to come over and help me to deep clean our apartment (clean home helps me feel relaxed). \n\nI also emailed some of the people I emailed 2-3 weeks ago *again* to ask them if we could sit down to have a talk about what's going on in my life. These people have been amazing and have offered to help me in various ways (ranging from offers to meal prep dinner for me so I don't have to cook, getting me fast tracked to see our uni therapist, to arranging a private office for me to study in). I have said yes to any and all offers of help and will continue to actively seek out help, even for silly and benign stuff. \n\nHere's the issue and the reason why I am posting my story: I have been unwell way, *way* before that meeting with my thesis supervisors. Although I am extremely proud of both the swift actions I've taken since and being accepting of help, I did not recognize my worsening emotional and mental states on time. That's *not* ok and *not* healthy. Although my focus right now concerns dealing with my situation at hand, this is definitely something I need to work on in the future.\n\nThis is to all of you: take care of yourself and allow yourself to acknowledge emotional strain and difficulties. It's ok to do so. 
18	Can’t continually cut trees. Gotta stop and sharpen the saw every so often.
7	Great points.  I'll provide my prospective. \n\nLast year, I went through similar circumstances.  We suspected my husband had a brain tumor or M.S. due to sudden memory loss and migraines, we owned a business I had to take over urgently selling while not sharing with the public *why* we were selling, I worked full time during the day, was in law school full time at night, and have two young children -- one of which is very difficult, while also financially supporting my parents -- who provide me with a constant stream of other challenges.\n\nWhile I think it's great to fill folks in on what's going on, I had a different experience as far as my employer goes.  I am the financial breadwinner and supplier of our family's health insurance (with no other options -- in the U.S.), which caused additional unneeded stress.  \n\nWhen I filled my boss in on the situation, and asked for patience because I was trying sell our business alone, due to my husband's medical issues, she had zero empathy, and instead targeted me.  But she was super nice to my face.  Even though I was running my division after two other key employees left (including my boss, whose position was consolidated with my current boss), she tried to say I wasn't doing my job (I was doing my job + the job of my boss who left, without being paid more).  I took no time off to deal with any personal issues, other than having to leave early to bring my husband to the Emergency Room one time, and always got my work done, and then some.  I don't even take time off to take my own children to Dr's appointments, relying on my husband and parents to help take care of them.  I don't call in sick unless I'm seriously ill.  I'm the person in the office who always stays late, and voluntarily works weekends or late if a project needs to be completed.\n\nMy boss literally made up lies in order to write me up in an attempt to get me fired.  For instance, when I got the flu, she wrote me up for abuse of sick leave...even though I had more than two weeks of sick leave available, only took 2-3 days off and came in late a few days because I didn't feel well.  I was befuddled, as I was so sick, I had to puke in the trash can while sitting on the toilet with a 103 degree fever.    \n\nI'm not sure what it is about some people who like to step on others when they're down, but she somehow delighted in it.  The more I shared with her, the more she went after me in conniving ways.  I learned my lesson, and now don't share anything with my employer.  I've been interviewing for other positions, and will take the first that meets my requirements.        \n\nSo, I'm happy that your peeps were supportive in your time of need, but just a word of caution that everyone isn't so supportive.\n\nOn top of the b.s. I had to deal with at work, my husband's friends were total assholes -- four guys he grew up with, who have known each other for 30+ years.  Because he had been forgetting so much (transient global amnesia) and was under huge pressure from trying to get our business sold, he avoided talking to his friends for a period of time.  He was in denial that something could be majorly wrong with him.  \n\nNone of the four friends lived nearby and they all have busy professions and families, i..e. these are not 20 year-olds who need constant attention from their buddies.  When I looped them in on his medical condition via a Facebook message, one basically responded "so what -- he hasn't been there enough for me this year when my parents died," two didn't reply at all, other than a sad face emoji, and only one reached out to me with a half-hearted message of support, but he never actually called my husband. \n\nSo many other negative things happened, that I decided there's a reason I don't share personal information and ask for help.  Because, in my recent experience, there is no benefit.  I figure at least I have the internet to vent to now and then.  \n\n**Edit to add -- I also left work early one time because my blood pressure was so high from the stress that I told the receptionist she might need to call 911 if I pass out.  So we wouldn't have to pay for an ambulance, I had my husband come pick me up and bring me to an Urgent Care, where they gave me emergency meds to bring my BP down and they ran tests for 5+ hours.  My boss' reaction was to tell me I needed a note for leaving early because she didn't believe I had an actual reason because she thought I just wanted to leave early on a Friday.  I'm an exempt employee, working in a professional office.  It blew my mind, and just added to the above.  People can be assholes.    
2	Feel you. Stay strong and be healthy!
1	Glad everything is working out for you! It can be very helpful to journal and recognize when your thoughts start to go in a negative direction.
1	I really appreciate all that you’ve done for your SO in his time of need, all while finishing grad school. Thank you for sharing.\n\nBeing there for someone who is not healthy might be one of the single hardest unrecognized human challenges, and I think very few people can manage it. 
5	Players of games	What kind of games do you guys like to play?\n
3	Games that involve teamwork and/or competition. 4 digits of hours logged playing Dota 2 and I love following the esports scene as well. Lately I've been playing a bunch of World of Warcraft with friends, mostly focusing on running dungeons together on Friday nights. I played a lot of Warhammer 40k and Warmachine prior to having a family when had the time for miniature wargaming.\n\nGenerally the key to my attention is the potential for failure which, as a result, inspires a motivation to get better at the game. This typically means I end up playing games against other players, because competition against other humans creates the environment I crave more often than playing vs a computer. Too many single player games offer me no challenge and end up feeling like I'm on something of a theme park ride.
2	Metal Gear
2	Strategy.
1	Any Europa Universalis 4 players here ?
1	Mainly card games.  I was obsessed with Texas Hold'Em for quite some time.  The strategical and psychological aspects of the game amaze me, but ultimately the variance is quite hard to deal with.  Now I prefer lower variance card games which are more rewarding for optimal decision making.  At the moment I'm playing Artifact, which is Valve's latest creation.  \n\n\nOh, and Stellaris.  Other 4x titles are ok but Stellaris is the perfect blend between 4x and grand strategy.
1	starcraft 2 only about hour a month in average\n\n\- I am mainly strategizing in real life where my chances of winning are way better and prizes are much better too :)
7	Where do you fit in with your friends?	Although I consider myself self-aware, I have yet to understand my role in my friend groups. Most of my friends have been my friends for 10+ years. In some cases, 20+ years. I love my friends, and am grateful for their friendships and the personalities/perspectives they bring to the table. I can't for the life of me understand how I can be overly honest, crack bad jokes and do whatever my initial response is and they still want to be my friends. At least, that's how I perceive it. No, I don't fight with my friends, but they tolerate me so well! My question to other ENTJs is, how do you fit in? Have you ever gotten feedback on why, with some of our faults, people still like you? This might be too personal to be relateable, but I'm asking anyway! 
13	It sounds like you have the friend version of impostor syndrome.
6	I'm an asshole with my friends. I mean, uhhh, I'm my normal self with my friends. They joke that I lured them in by being all nice and friendly and now they know I'm a devil child but can't leave because they're too attached. \n\nWith friends who aren't so close, I'm whatever they like. 
4	We travel a lot for my husband’s job, so sometimes my friends are just people who became that way by default. Like, we are in the same neighborhood at the same time and our kids are the same age. So, now that’s your friend. My genuine friends? I’m not sure that I do fit in. Not because I’m too serious, but ... oh wait, it’s because I’m too serious. 
3	I flirt with my friends everywhere.
3	When it comes to fitting in I'm like one of those musicians that people praise as very technically skilled but lack the spark of joy and genius that makes someone a natural. I've studied strategies and methods for being well-liked and respected and consciously use them. New acquaintances consistently remark that I'm an excellent conversationalist and easy to get along with and generally fun to be around. One of the signs that I was failing in therapy was my psychiatrist remarking that she enjoyed our conversations to the point where she felt like she should be paying me (which I found disappointing and insulting). \n\nIn my heart I almost never feel like I fit in. I've only been part of a couple groups throughout my life where I came to feel like I genuinely belonged and something vaguely resembling my true identity was known and accepted. Unlike you, though, I don't question why people tolerate me - instead I wonder when they're going to abandon me.
3	I'm not sure why my friends like me, either. I can be a little crude and a little insensitive. However, in terms of what role I play when it comes to my friends: Since I seem to have a talent for saying what everybody else is thinking but too afraid to say out loud, I often end up advocating for others. I have been told that while I'm a little awkward (especially in group situations), I'm really fun to talk to one-on-one. Also that I'm good at explaining complicated concepts and a "deep thinker". 
3	As a male most of my friendships with other males pretty much consist entirely of us pretending to be gay with one another, or ridiculing each other.  Other than that I'm usually the one who steers the conversation in the direction of life's bigger topics.  I'm not friends with people who can't discuss politics and existential subjects in a calm and rational manner.
2	I don't 
2	The way I like to think of my friends and I is that I’m the one who’s on his own little island, doing his own things. But when it comes time to hang out and catch up, I’m more than happy to do it.
16	How do you handle reverting to your "shadow personality" ?	So I've been an ENTJ for quite some time, but I've only just learned about this supposed shadow self we revert to when we are crushed by intense stress and/or illness.  Now don't get me wrong, I've been reverting to my shadow self in such circumstances for as long as I can remember, I just never truly understood what was going on.  Sometimes it would get so bad that I would question and re-evaluate everything that I knew I wanted to do with my life, my career, my hobbies, even the sense of my existence.  Everything I was 100% sure about was suddenly nonsensical.  \n\n\nSo a couple of days ago I noticed the early warning signs creeping up on me and I immediately made my partner aware of it (God bless INTJs and their understanding of us wanting to be completely alone when this happens) and I spent the whole day yesterday just watching Netflix, had a long soak in the bath, skipped the gym and ate some bad food.  I was extremely pleased with the fact that I noticed it, reacted early and was able to prevent the onset existential crisis by just taking a day off and chilling the fuck out.  This to me is at least indicative of progress, and today I feel a hell of a lot better.  \n\n\nI'm now trying to narrow down what triggered it.  I'm a highly competitive card game player and I recently started playing a new game that just came out, and within my first week of playing the game I was able to beat a pro player who has been playing the game since closed beta and take a 2nd place finish in a tournament.  Needless to say I was really happy about that, but days later I changed game formats and got stomped by someone really inexperienced (it was my own fault, I played really badly and made a tonne of mistakes) and this seemed to really get to me.  I'm not sure why though, I usually see failure as nothing more than a learning tool, so I'm trying to understand why I felt like such a failure when this happened.  \n\n\nMy question to the rest of you is, how often does it happen to you? How do you deal with it? Have you been able to identify exactly what triggers it for you?
14	INTP shadow for ENTJs. My usual organised and motivated self becomes so passive and engrossed in meaningless thoughts. No actions taken. It's not a nice place to be.
8	I lift weights. The more physical I am, the more I can kind of forget what’s happening, mentally.\n\nEdit: \n\nAlso, I genuinely thought that my dark side was just my personality and that the non-dark times were few and far between. I’m starting to think that it’s the opposite?! YOU HAVE SHOOK MY WORLD AND I HAVE A LOT OF REFLECTING TO DO! 
6	I've never heard of this 'shadow self' personality with ENTJ'S. Do you have any links to this? 
5	As an INTP, I see my shadow when I start demanding things I certainly could accomplish by myself. The way I'm learning to cope is with managing my "autopilot" function stack, which is the superego (mine being ISFP).\nMost of the interactions we humans consider useful for thinking/feeling when evaluating our moral conducts come from the experience we have in the aforementioned state. So getting stuck in your shadow personality often steams from what we've gathered when following our natural social flow, be it unhealthy or not. \nIn conclusion, ENTJ's having the ESFP superego could mean you're in need of having that friendly group talk where they feel safe. Maybe a social gathering where you can expose your opinions with honest people could help. 
4	Okay, I think this post gave me a huge epiphany - I finally understand my behavior pattern! Thank you! \n\n
3	I'll usually become more terse, drink a lot more, and completely withdraw from the world. 
3	Life is a marathon, and sometimes we hit "the wall," which requires us to stop running, walk a bit, get our shit together, then start running again.
3	This sub shocks me because I used to think I was alone with this type of stuff\n\nI refer to my shadow personality almost every day. The real me is harsh, assertive, and can be mean and highly manipulative, so I usually act reserved.
2	I don't treat it as something "bad" to handle. It is what it is. I am productive enough, and life isn't always about what you do, it's important to experience it and enjoy it. Personally I feel like a lack of Se comes with the worst of these moods, so I will often try cleaning, meditating, exercising, etc. I am also pathetically bad at routine, and my routines that I developed tend to fall by the wayside during this. Then the stress of everything I didn't do builds up.\n\nMaybe this mood has to do with having a project or desiring a challenge/pressure?
2	It usually just takes time to come "back", but if things are super bad i need to reach out to my family and friends. That usually works. ENTJ's always need to be surrounded by a sounding board, they're there to bring me back to the center and i am there to do the same for them.
1	How do I (or you, my ENTJ fam) snap out of shadow land. Ugh the stock market! Need I say more?
1	I'm an ENTJ and I came to reddit to find this kind of post. I was worried about it. 
4	How do I master the ability to be alone?	As an ENTJ I am quite lonely most of the time. When I am busy working I don’t think about it but in slow periods such as the holiday season I realise how lonely I am especially when my selected friends are busy. \n\nI do not want to feel like this. How can I master the ability to be alone?
5	Practice
5	I also hate feeling "lonely", and for some reason I've been feeling it a lot lately - maybe because of the holidays as well.\n\nAnyway, whenever I feel like this, I do take the time to reach out to my friends/family, even if just for a quick phone call before bed. I find I instantly feel better when I do.\n\nALL humans need to feel connected to other humans. We're naturally social creatures and not having those connections can really take a toll on one's health.\n\nReach out - call your mom, dad, siblings, friends, whoever - even just to quickly say "Hi, I've been thinking about you". \n\n&#x200B;
3	I background-watch shows all the time if I have nothing to do. It's the boredom that gets me, not so much the loneliness 
2	I felt in peace with being alone the day I did a very deep introspection and found out a few unresolved topics from childhood.\n\nMeditation also helps. Be at peace with yourself and you will appreciate your lone company.
1	Find a hobby that requires introspection. 
1	I make time for "networking." Basically, ensuring I value my time with family and friends and that I make it a priority to see them. I don't want to be old and alone.
0	Have no friends. That's how I do it.
2	Calling out ENTJs with a -Ni substype, share your experiences.	From my encounters there has been a reasonably considerable number of people that sometimes  get mistyped as INTJ, score consistently higher on their Ni than on their Te and generally those that type themselves as xNTJ. For those that have taken socionics (LIE-1Ni, LIE-2Ni or in very rare cases LIE-3Ni).\n\nWhat have your experiences been like? What kind of things stand out to you the most from the personality description that seem and doesn't seem to be like you? Have you ever thought you might have been some other personality type?\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGeneral ENTJ things that I do find in me:\n\nLikes to take charge and doesn't like being told what to do.\n\nEnjoy strategy and competition. (from sports to board games)\n\nVery determined and goal oriented when motivated.\n\nCan be blunt and rude, sometimes inconsiderate to feelings.\n\nGet frustrated when things go out of hand.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGeneral ENTJ things that I don't associate with:\n\nNot money and business oriented.\n\nLove sciences, theoretical and the unknown.\n\nEnjoy acting and melancholic things.\n\nCare a lot about less fortunate and injustices.\n\nSometimes start things and don't finish that deemed unimportant.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAt times I probably wrongly mistake myself for an ENFP (especially when looking back), my enneagram is 8w7. Would be interesting to hear about your own experiences and whether there are any similarities.
6	Sounds INTJ full stop
5	I don't think most ENTJs know what you're talking about, since socionics is still not that widely known. This is the [link to Sociotype test](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/31274-Socionics-Tests-and-Useful-Links?p=819364&viewfull=1#post819364) if anyone wants to take it, and there are the [**descriptions of ENTJ subtypes**](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=LIE_subtypes).   \n     \nThe few Ni-ENTjs that I have met have been good at making conversation and very talkative, but also subtly calculating and not shy on taking some advantageous opportunities. They have also had a lot of trouble in relationships, since they are not very sensitive and will get into relationships that don't work out that well for them. At least one has complained about being taken advantage off by his business partner whose type was ISTJ, the "supervisor" type of ENTJ. They are also great at explaining things and telling anecdodes from real life. Most of these Ni-sub ENTJs have been 7w8s and 7w6s.
4	To distinguish between ENTJ-Ni and regular INTJ, I had to look at the positions/dimensions of all my other functions. 2D Fe vs 1D Fe, etc. No matter how strong my Ni is, it is always used to serve my Te.\n\nI don't think I ever figured out how to determine whether I'm LIE-1Ni, LIE-2Ni, etc. Can you explain how I can figure it out or send me a resource?
10	I made a subreddit for MBTI enthusiasts who make music. Please come and share your OC!	/r/MBTImusicians\n\n\n\n\n7 different people have submitted songs already. You should, too! :)
2	Interesting, thank you!
1	Feel free to check mine out, especially if you live in a different country. It shows different country's flags under my profile's stats and I am measuring my success based on how many flags I can collect :) Sort of like collecting Pokemon :P\n\n* [INTP [Classical](1:00)](https://soundcloud.com/user-216205579/track-1)
3	Recently a question of ENTJ and philosophy got asked here so I think you people might be interested in this	
1	I have a INFJ mate who's quite into philosophy as well. I'll have a chat with him and compare
16	What's wrong with the way we flirt ? do we show it enough ?	Here and on Quora, it seems that a lot of ENTJs encounter this problem, how to get over it ?\n\nEverytime I tried to flirt with a girl, I felt like "I gotta do it but I don't really have the time now" so I guess it was never obvious enough for her. I suppose that was the problem, what else could it be ?\n\n*Edit :* When I say it's never "obvious enough", I mean that it makes me automatically end up in the friend zone.
19	I cannot flirt at all. I’m all awkward and feel so phony.
11	is being sarcastic and roasting someone flirting lol 
8	I found it easy to meet people bc I was always curious about learning more about people...if you just start asking questions and show interest everything goes well from there
7	I'm actually good at it and it's fun. Especially with ENFP girls.\n\nIt's even completely OK to be on the flirting border with people you don't want to create relationships. Like female friends. You just have to be socially aware and smart.\n\nMost girls enjoy this attention if it's done appropriately.\n\nJust be confident and don't take it too seriously.
6	How do you flirt? If you see flirting as inefficient I would not anticipate for the receiver to experience it as flirting that needs to be taken seriously. Also, women notoriously assume that men aren’t interested in them (while men tend to overestimate a woman’s interest). You might have to be more thorough and direct and less efficient.\nMaybe it’s easier for ENTJ women than ENTJ men (I’m assuming you’re a guy) too?Although I think I end up just looking aggressive or competitive, not flirty. I made a policy to stop flirting because it wasn’t working...
21	Stop masturbating for a week - maybe it will become more urgent then.
8	I mean. Isn’t flirting just getting to know someone? Talking to someone you might want to see nekkid ?  I just talk to them. Good at that. 
4	I have the opposite problem (gender’s likely a factor) in that my general gregariousness is often misinterpreted by men as flirting. When I *am* actually flirting, I’ve discovered that even when I think I’m being subtle I am definitely not; like anything else in life, if I want something, I go about making it happen. Some (many) men are intimidated by my ‘forwardness’ but I figure they’re doing me a favor by self selecting out of my dating pool. If me expressing interest/asking them out makes them wilt, they’d never survive.\n\nIf you’re finding yourself ‘friend zoned’ (ew), the problem is likely less that your flirting isn’t obvious and more that you’re not escalating/expressing interest quickly enough. Most dudes friend zone themselves by pretending to be a woman’s friend long enough that she sleeps with him. In spite of what TV and movies would have you believe, this is a bad plan. Flirting with intent, then taking the plunge and actually *asking someone out* is the only surefire way to know if they want to date you. Yeah, you might not get the answer you want, but it’s worlds better than pretending to be a girl’s friend for years with the ulterior motive of getting in her pants. \n\nIf you’re actively flirting, the woman is likely thinking ‘is he into me or just being friendly?’ If you never progress past friendly and into actually expressing interest, we’ll assume you aren’t into us sexually/romantically.  It’s really not that mysterious. This is doubly true for extroverted types, as it’s hard to tell if you’re behavior toward us is different from the general extroversion toward everyone else. \n\nI say, channel the ENTJ effectiveness gene and cut to the chase.
3	Idk, how are u flirting? We might all not do it the same way. Need more details.
1	Last year, I decided I would find a guy who fit all my dealbreakers and must haves. I never thought I was anything special in terms of attractiveness, because guys NEVER asked me out when I was younger. \n\nBut guess what! Everybody is nervous about being rejected, especially when dealing with assertive people who don't make a whole lot of sense (people are often unsettled by what frustrates me, as they often do not see the same patterns I do). I ended up dating more attractive/intelligent dudes and making a longer list of dealbreakers just to thin the herd. I joined OKC to help me narrow things down a little better too.\n\nAs my confidence grew, I became much better at detecting attraction and my flirting really improved... But my dates were still really nervous and intimidated and it would take a while to get them to relax. So please take into account that your personality just flat out makes people nervous (especially when you focus on someone), so they may not respond as readily as they would like.
1	Could just be me but with hookups I've noticed I do a lot better when I know the girl
1	I was in a relationship with an entj and am currently dating another one right now. (I’m an infj) I love the entj men.. they are so brilliant.. grounded.. genuine... honest.. but really neither of them had/have a clue on how to understand women... or maybe they just feel awkward in that vulnerable space? The one I’m dating now feels like my best friend and I know he means well, so\nIt doesn’t bother me...( it would feel nice to have a little more flirting/romance tho) :)
1	What’s flirting? 
1	ENTJ (borderline INTJ) female here. I used to have a lot of trouble flirting due to thinking I was really awkward. It all changed when I started seeing it as a psychological game. It’s fun to use your sex appeal to learn from and about people. Then again, I’m conscious it’s easier for me to flirt since I’m a female and grasping male attention is just a piece of cake. 
12	Do people say you're eccentric? Do you consider yourself eccentric?	
11	People tell me I'm "interesting", "quirky".... when I first started dating my boyfriend he said I was fascinating and weird and that was part of the reason he liked me and wanted to keep dating me. Haha.
8	I am firmly and protectively called "quirky" by others. My friends strongly dislike using "weird" or "eccentric" to describe me.
6	Yes.\nNo, people just really do not have good taste in anything, usually...
3	As an ENFP, I know an ENTJ that I would call ‘interesting’ and one that I would call ‘extreme’
2	I try incredibly hard to fit in and yet I rarely do. I don’t think I’m old enough to be eccentric, but “creative” comes up a lot. People always think I’m gong to be artistic for some reason. 
2	I've definitely been called neurotic before, I'm not sure if that qualifies as eccentric 
2	nah we just strange
2	Eccentric with a capital E. I hold pretty unconventional or even controversial views, thus not fitting well to the crowd. I also have pretty weird hobbies for a typical 20-23 year old lady such as disasters, murder cases, biology and human health...
2	Dont know if you can call it "exentric" but Iam really into fashion
1	Yes and yes. I’m Queen of the Weirdos.
1	I'd say I was quite eccentric. Which I think most would agree with. But I see absolutely nothing wrong with this. 
2	What is your relationship with philosophical discussions?	I am dating a ENTJ male. I've been trying to engage him in discussion like ethics and Socratic topics, but he just listens and gives me very succinct one sentence answers. Nothing more. Why is that? 
7	Only interesting to a point. I like practical knowledge that I can use and philosophy is more of a collection of perspectives. In terms of things I'd like to turn my attention to philosophy is very low priority, so I don't really care to evaluate it at more than a superficial level.
4	ENTJ female here, I absolutely adore philosophy!!\nI have read a good number of classics going from Plato's republic to meditations. You are right, there are very few people I can discuss it with! \nTo solve that problem I tend to mostly have introspective discussions in a good old Socratic manner 😂🤣\n\nEdit: I got so excited i forgot to answer your question. Iy probably has nothing to do with him being ENTJ, it's just some interest he hasn't cultivated
3	Mostly not actionable. Moral philosophy is a dead end ... 
1	Depends on the topic. I'll debate all day on why God's existence or nonexistence is irrelevant, but I won't touch ephemeral Daoism with a ten foot pole.
1	Philosophy is broad. A person may not be interested in all topics. And he may not interested in you or in discussing with you. He may not be an ENTJ as you think he is.
1	Don't know how much it correlates with ENTJ and philosophy in general but maybe [this](https://www.idrlabs.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/plato-aristotle.png) might be useful to you in understanding the different perspectives on this topic.\n\nBTW Socrates is considered by some (including me) to be an ENTP but a lot of his philosophy is retold through the mental lens of an INFJ (Plato).
35	Dating An ENTJ	Female INFJ here! Just wondering if any ENTJs can offer insight to this behavior I’ve noticed in my ENTJ boyfriend. \n\nSo it seems like when he puts his mind to something, whether it be studying for exams (we’re both in college) or training his dog it’s almost like he tunnel visions and forgets about everything else in the world for awhile and even seems to emotionally shut off when he gets in this zone. I admire his work ethic and how driven he is but I often feel put on the back burner when he gets in these zones and he can come off as emotionally unavailable even though I know he still has feelings for me (then once he’s no longer in that ‘zone’ he’s back to expressing those feelings). He also has a nearly impossible time starting something and walking away before it’s completed and perfect, which can be frustrating when I’m sitting there waiting for him to finish what he’s doing so he and I can do something else together.\n\nI guess I’m just trying to better understand this behavior and why ENTJs are like that so I have a better idea of how to approach these situations. Thanks!
29	That's how we roll. When it's time to spend with my partner, she gets my full name is attention. When it's time to spend working on something I have little tolerance for distraction.\n\nI have to make this clear early on. My friends think it's funny when I'm annoyed because my partner keeps trying to text with me or even worse try and get my attention while I'm working. \n\nWe are intense as partners, and we put ours on the back burner when it's time to get shit done. It's how we are wired.
17	ENTJ here. My wife is an INFJ. This all sounds very familiar. As with any reasonable lady, let alone an INFJ, you've got emotional needs that with some effort he can learn to balance. My two cents--the key is to make him aware it's a reasonable need and to work as a couple on some consistent intimacy. I still struggle with this and it still comes in waves as you describe, but I'm better than I was and I hope to keep improving. We do check ins and that really helps me understand what I can miss when I have tunnel vision. Make him aware you love his passion but play to his ego and turn this into a challenge that makes for a healthier long term relationship. 
16	Oh, yes. That definitely sounds familiar. \n\nI'm ENTJ, my SO in INTP. One of the reasons why our relationship is working out so incredibly well is because he recognizes my need for these 'in the zone moments'. Especially when it's a critical 'in the zone moment' regarding major deadlines etc., I can go to him and tell him: I need my time and focus to finish this, I expect it will take about this much time daily over the course of the next days/weeks. And when I get in the zone, he gives me space - more even - he accommodates me as much as I can in terms of taking care of household duties etc. and not bothering me with anything that can wait for some other time. \n\nIf during these times I'm losing touch with our relationship and my SO feels he needs more time/love/energy from me, he will very openly tell me: "you're working a lot right now, I would like you to schedule this amount of time for me on a daily basis and this weekend, I would like you to take the afternoon and evening off so we can spend some time together, can you make that happen?" His trick is to always start this discussion when I'm having some 'down time', for example, during dinner, never when I'm in the heat of my focus. He is also very clear about his needs. It's never: 'I never see you anymore, you need to make time for me.', but rather 'I would like to have daily dinner together and at least 30 mins after dinner to catch up on our days' or 'I would like you to plan time in the next few days so we can go see a movie together'. Considering he does his best to accommodate me and my needs, I always take these requests seriously and make sure I can accommodate his needs as well. 
7	I'm in the same kind of relationship.  I'm the ENTJ and she is the INFJ.  We find a balance.  I made sure to tell her early on I'm a very focused individual and tend to zone in on things pretty hard when my mind is on it and I don't like to start something unless I know I can finish it (my job, side businesses, flying, etc). We also have a Dom/Sub relationship, her being the Sub so naturally my instinct is to make sure she is taken care of at all costs and I make sure to find time to devote my full attention to her.  It's a balance but we've got it figured out pretty good.  Shes also very intelligent and intuitive, lucky me!
5	If you want him at his best then schedule time together. I respond to plans and deadlines, so I need to be home to have dinner with my partner and no making other plans, or working on our Sunday together. This way I'm not distracted or pre-occupied and I can structure every day around this routine. If something comes up in the moment my partner simply asks how long I'll be, states what he'd like (movie at 8pm) or an appropriate time frame (need to leave in 40 mins) and then goes and entertains himself. If it seems like we're not getting enough of each other then we have a date night or go away for the weekend. \n\nCommunicate your needs. The INFJs I know are diplomatic to the point of falsehood "That's ok, I understand, it's fine" and I'm left really confused when they're crying and telling me they're okay. \n\n
6	Honestly what you are describing is completely typical ENTJ behaviour.  Does he tell you beforehand that he needs to focus in order to get something done and can't afford any distractions? This is what I do with my girlfriend so that she knows I'm unavailable, and so she can keep herself occupied doing her own thing without waiting around for me.  \n\n\nMy girlfriend struggled with this in the beginning because she has more emotional needs than I do I would say, but what worked for us was finding a healthy balance.  When I set my mind on a project, we sit down and we decide what a reasonable amount of time for me to spend per day or per week is, and the rest of that time I dedicate to spending time with her.  It's honestly all about finding a compromise so that both of your needs are met as best as they can be.
3	I am entj female but I can echo everything everyone else says. If my partner wants my attention, I will give it to him fully if we have already determined that we are going to be spending some quality time together. As for leisure activities, I schedule out blocks of time in advance and if I want to be spontaneous, I block in times to plan to be spontaneous. \n\n\n

1	I’m a fellow INFJ f (27) dating an entj m, and he is very similar. I have to remind myself he’s in the moment (and much better and focusing than I am haha). He always snaps out of it and it’s like nothing happened. \n\nI will say, however, he uses the same approach on me; for example, I’ll be looking at my list of things to do and get as much as I can to feel great, and he’ll always say, “wait, there’s just a couple more things! We can do it!” I love the go-get-it attitude, but I know my limits! I just politely thank him, and let him know I need a break.\n\n I find him absolutely amazing simply because he gets to the point and in turn, takes constructive criticism better than anyone I’ve ever met; this is great since I hate repeating myself! 
11	INFP here, crushing hard for ENTJ	I’m in need of advice on what to do. Unfortunately she knows I’m crushing on her and I don’t know if she’s interested. How should I act to know if she likes me?
26	Just ask.
4	Ask (politely) until there is a clear answer.\n\nWhen you ask her, her response will be mostly dependent on 1) if she's a kind person that doesn't mind lying and 2) if she recognizes your ask.\n\nIf she likes you and isn't anxious about it, she'll tell you.\n\nIf she recognizes the ask and doesn't like you, she will tell you. But if she doesn't mind lying to keep the rejection less harsh, then she might be intentionally evasive. \n\nIf she doesn't recognize the ask, then she will also appear intentionally evasive.
5	Don’t tell the other ENTJs I told you this, but we are crazy susceptible to flattery (as long as it’s not overwrought and baseless; we can spot disingenuousousness a mile away).\n\nCompliment her, especially if there’s something you like about her that others may not always appreciate or that’s ‘weird’ or ‘quirky’ about her.\n\nThen ask her out directly. 
2	I'm an ENTJ male, and I would love if a girl just straight up asked me. I'm not sure how a female would handle being asked that by a male, but there's a really good chance she'll at least respect it, and there's a 100% chance that you'll get an answer. Just be casual and cool about it, it's a totally normal thing that people make out to be weird for no reason.
5	INFPs and ENTJs are a match made in heaven. Just be upfront with your feelings
1	“Can I take you out for coffee some time?” Assuming she drinks coffee. 
1	We're reserved with emotion and respond positively to people that reach out. Just say something and be forward
4	Am I the only one who attracts/is attracted to xSTPs?	I'm a female as well so maybe that goes into it. I know mbti isn't a good way to gauge relationships but although my ideal partner is an INTP, INFP, or INFJ;  it seems like I draw the xSTPs a lot. I think it maybe because there are more xSTPs than xNTPS. I just wanted to knpw if anyone else felt that way?
4	I'm totally on the same page as you, especially for ESTPs. I see what you mean when you attribute some of it to your being female, if you're straight anyway. (I'm a gay male.) Archetypal ESTPs and ISTPs possess many traits thought to be archetypally masculine, so anyone who has a traditional, primitive taste in guys might easily have a thing for xSTPs. I think the challenge for any ENTJ-xSTP relationship wouldn't be carnal so much as intellectual. Both (potential) partners could be highly intelligent, but we ENTJs are drawn to theory and abstraction, which isn't really the case for most xSTPs. Thinking back to most of the guys I thought were scorching hot in high school, most of them were ESTPs, but I didn't really have a lot in common with any of them. To be fair, I'm talking stereotypes, which one is never supposed to do in our society for fear of crucifixion by our peers. My apologies.
3	ENTJs and ISTPs are in "Mirage" relations to each other, which are often attractive for both of them: [**MBTI type matches for relationships with ENTJs**](https://www.personalitycafe.com/entj-articles/280-love-types-entj-12.html#post20825162).    \n     \nHowever neither the xSTPs nor the INTP are ideal matches for NTJs, because they can't supply ENTJ with much needed Fi in a relationship, and that starts causing some problems later on. Better type matches are ISFPs and ESFPs. They have all of ENTJ/INTJ functions which makes it more of a complimentary match.    \nAs a demo: ENTJ functions from this end -> Te.Ni.Se.Fi <-ISFP functions from this end. You guys are basically like the same type, and ESFP is close by.
5	Debate topic: Books vs. Internet	Do you find yourself remembering/understand and being well-versed in topics through reading a good book, or do you feel you can learn properly through internet sources and watching videos?
9	I prefer reading over watching, whatever the material. In both cases, the key thing is to take notes.
4	Depends what you're learning. I think forums are really good places to start becoming familiar with a topic. Then I tend to branch out into online research and from there actual, physical books on the subject.
4	I am visual. I prefer watching good videos. It is usually faster. I can generally speed them up.
3	I'm not interested in having physical copies of academic/educational texts. In fact, I'm in the process of giving away most of my fiction books too. Ebooks exist. 
3	I took [this test on learning styles](https://www.webtools.ncsu.edu/learningstyles/) and read the accompanying material. I found it incredibly insightful and used the results to try to approach material in multiple ways. There are great tips on how to use your preferred learning styles to greater advantage or to develop new learning styles.\n\nMy results indicated I highly favor Global and Intuitive learning over all others. I am curious if other ENTJs score similarly.
2	Interesting so many people are saying they prefer video, maybe it's generational or depends on your type of work. \n\nI prefer text, online is ideal or an e-book where I can ctrl-f or jump to what I need. Videos have so much waffle and no index to find what you want, I prefer to read transcripts from the video.
1	Both are fine but videos are a lot more efficient because you can just fast forward it to x2 speed
1	Internet ftw. 
0	On "Discipline, Goals and Truth" - Jocko Willink, Gary Vaynerchuk, Jordan Peterson and Joe Rogan	
3	downvote for Peterson
2	Dunno why these "motivational videos" work so well for me. No, not to get pumped up, although a bit. Mostly to push myself forward, even as it's hard and to not give up.
20	Any ENTJ's with ADHD?	Do any of you suffer from this, if so, how does it affect you? Do you take Adderall or anything of the sort to help with it? Do you behave differently because of it compared to other ENTJs? Do you have another way of coping with it?
19	Hi! I have ADHD. Managed it semi okay until grad school when I was 32. Got the "official diagnosis" then and was prescribed amphetamines.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe difference was night and day. I was always willing to put in the work to succeed, that was never the issue. But the amount and clarity of output after I was medicated went up exponentially. It legit changed my life and my quality of life. I could get things done correctly the first go. So instead of 8 hours on a project, I could take 1 and it was correct. Numbers weren't flipped. It was right. All very eye opening. 
6	Diagnosed this year and taking a low dose of instant release methylphenidate. I am far less mistake prone, mundane and repetitive tasks are way easier, my energy levels are more consistent, I interrupt people less, and I'm physically calmer. As a knock-on I'm less anxious that I'll make mistakes, and happier with my work performance. My medication is also really flexible so I can take it as required.\n\nThere really is no other way of "coping" with ADHD. I was undiagnosed for thirty years, and while I did okay I wasn't achieving my full potential. You can diet and exercise, use planners, try supplements, but the structure of the ADHD brain is fundamentally different and these can't make up for a dopamine or neuroephrine defficiency. At this point medication is a quick and effective way to mitigate the symptoms. I would highly recommend this [series of videos with Dr. Russell Barkley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzhbAK1pdPM&list=PLzBixSjmbc8eFl6UX5_wWGP8i0mAs-cvY) (he's a proponent of medicating ADHD with financial ties to pharmaceutical companies, but his talks are very comprehensive).
5	I got diagnosed mid 20’s with ADHD and was put on medicine. The difference was night and day. I went from doing mediocre in college to a deans list student. Now on track to finishing college in under four years. I often wonder where I would have ranked in high school if I caught it earlier. You just have to be careful with stimulants and take only as prescribed at the right times in the day as they can be addicting and can keep you up at night if you take them too late. You just have to make sure you keep your focus on the task at hand because it’s easy to get side tracked by something non-important and go deep down that rabbit hole. Stimulants will probably suppress your appetite and you will probably have to force down some food but it’s not too bad. 
5	Got caught up in the crazy of every boy has ADD (which still considered different back then) later some psychologists came to think I was depression. There is evidence that being on it as a kid as much as gives you ADHD and stunts development. Whether I had it or not the difference between them and now was like thinking through a room full of steam and and a clear summer’s day. The biggest problem was your Ni goes into hyper focus so if you medicate you have to be sure to be on the task you wanted to get done, otherwise you you’ll be cleaning up after breakfast and spend day cleaning the house, or kissing your wife and start a ten hour love-fest (only a mild exaggeration).
4	I have it, and I’ve wondered sometimes if there is a relationship between ENTJ and ADHD.  I’m 36 and just been diagnosed in the last couple of years.  Did well in engineering school and started out on a great track at work.  Kept adding things to my plate (husband, kids, grad school) until I hit a brick wall.  That’s what led me to a diagnosis.  Since starting adderall I’ve felt worlds better.  If you are looking for more perspective on ADHD, the subreddits on here are awesome and have been really helpful and relatable to me.
3	I found out I had ADD after my first semester of college. Was put on medication and did well in school at first, but I disliked the way I felt on the meds. A couple years later I take the lowest doses possible and only take them when I need to work - I chug coffee and tea to make up for it and have found ways to work around my ADD by switching between assignments often.
3	Yep was diagnosed around 4 or 5, I've always been a procrastinator. Which sucks. When I'm on medication it's night and day. 
2	me 
2	I was diagnosed several years ago. I take a low dose of extended-release because I am a child of an addict and want to be as responsible as possible. I tried the non-extended release and felt they caused me to become hyperactive and angry.\n\nMy doctor specified that I have the Inattentive subtype. I feel the medication helps prevent me from hyperfocusing inefficiently. I no longer blurt out the first thing on my mind. I have stopped interrupting people and can listen and focus on what they are saying. I had previously been diagnosed with mild anxiety, but my anxiety symptoms went away after starting treatment for ADD. I think the anxiety was because of the conflict between my ENTJ personality and my ADD.\n\nI still use MANY methods to deal with my ADD. I think of meds as a helper but not a solver. I still have to put in the work myself, but the meds get me to a place where I can do that. I need help with time management, specifically. So I keep calendars, a planner, and even started a bullet journal (non-frills, just the basics) to help keep myself organized. (I also use apps and online tools like calendars.) The pomodoro technique has also been extremely helpful to me.
1	This all sounds familiar...
1	Experiences coming off of ADHD meds? I'm considering vyvance. Adderall and I didn't get along great. At one point while I was on it and unemployed it I pretty bad mental health situation.
1	Diagnosed first year of college,  after I dropped out from the university I had worked so hard to get to. I didn’t understand why I couldn’t just do my work. It was simple.  Is there a link !?! 
5	ENTJs only, what is your fashion style? What do you wear?	my style is rather cute/elegant/girly, i wear golfs and skirts  \nwhen it comes to colors, i avoid yellow, orange and green and choose pastel pink, black, white, green and red instead:)  \nwhat about u?
11	Black jeans or black leggings, black sundress, black or gray long cardigans, black or gray flowy tanks, boots or cardigans. No pastels or white. Occasional dark turquoise or purple.
7	If it’s in my wardrobe, it means it makes me feel sexy, cool, and powerful. Tight pencil skirts, skinny jeans in dark washes, black and camo joggers, a cropped leather jacket, form fitting shirts and tees. I also have a lot of jumpsuits because I think they look super chic and elegant and work on my body type (petite hourglass). \n\nWhat isn’t in my closet: florals, flowy dresses, ruffled anything, or bright colors. I wear black and darker black. 
6	Sometimes I dress like I’m leading the boardroom to victory. Sometimes I dress like a homeless person. 🤷‍♀️\n\nTypically wear black, gray, red, navy, deep purple, and emerald green. \n\nI work in a manufacturing plant so I can’t wear skirts and heels for safety reasons, but if I could, I would wear a pencil skirt with nice black pumps. I usually wear nice trousers and button downs, sweaters and blouses. 
5	I typically dress in sweatshirts and jeans but my ideal fashion style is bold yet minimalist. I like those pieces that say a lot without saying much and are functional at the same time.\n\nNo 10 inch heels for me. 
3	Budget dictates this a lot and comfort is a high priority, but if money weren’t an issue I would. That said if I could, I love a good fitted 3piece in dark rich colors, they just say “I’m not not here to be silly”
3	I tend toward the severe or loud. I have black or bright, nothing in between. My signature fashion move is killer heels; my favorite pair that I wear to high stakes meetings are what my boss calls my ‘power shoes’, deep red, pointy toes, thin heels. I recently went to a gala event in an obnoxiously bright blue pencil dress with mint green heels. I tend to fall on the modest/conservative end for style (long sleeves, higher necklines, mid-length skirts) but with at least one bold item or in a very bright color. Casual wear is mostly black yoga pants and spooky t-shirts if I’m just hanging around.\n\nI definitely don’t do pastels.
2	Nothing black but nothing too bright. Fairly casual, elegant in my sense, but I kept a little bit of UK hooligan fashion from my teenage years.
2	Black fitted trousers and flowing silk tops, or black jeans with a coloured top and a jumper in the weekend. Ankle boots or sneakers. I like really stylish Winter coats, and have the odd statement dress for events. I tend towards autumn colours but have started wearing pastels because it makes me look more friendly and approachable.
2	Why my crown, purple cloak, scarlet tunic and sceptre of course. What else would be fit for a king?\n\nNo but for real\n\nCasual: khakis/jeans paired with t-shirts or henleys. None of those ugly peasant shoes like yeezys; proper sneakers or chukkas (preference for stuff with cool hidden functions like lowas with hidden goretex inserts)\n\nBusiness: tech shirts that look exactly like their legit cotton counterparts but have a ton more functionality. Colour wise, white, light blue, light green, lilac, pink, light grey in a variety of patterns but mostly solids. If I go patterned with my top the bottom is solid and vice versa\n\nFormal: bespoke suits only (charcoal grey, navy, mid grey)\n\nSports coats and blazers to dress up if necessary and clean dark jeans to dress something down. Generally like sticking with just a simple t-shirt and jeans/khakis. \n\nWhen I get stuff made/choose stuff, it's usually with comfort>style>value in mind. I won't ever pay for something that's expensive and not worth it but will gladly fork over for something that intrinsically has value; will not pay for stupid stuff like supreme but will fork out for bespoke shell cordovan shoes \n\nLong and hopefully detailed so hope it helps
1	I have a an undercut all the way around my head, i enjoy wearing suits, and dresses. i like to dress up in more casual situations.
1	Mostly All black, Black and grey, Black and navy blue\n\nSometimes crazy colours like khaki and green or pink 
1	Bold solid colors for professional wear. \n\nNovel styles and patterns for going out with friends.\n\nBlack, low cut, and form fitting for dates.\n\nHilarious "ironic" shirts for generic at home use.
1	My boyfriend is ENTJ. He (ENTJ) likes to wear simple, classic, clean, quality, branded clothes. He likes clothes that fit very well, tailored or expensive quality brands and likes to style his hair back everyday. For casual days, he prefers fitted jeans tapered on the bottom, fitted simple tee-shirt and some kind of exclusive sneaker (he's a bit of a sneakerhead). If he likes this one brand, he likes to stick with that brand. For work he wears tailored suits and the same expensive designer italian leather shoes in two colours, and makes sure every part of his clothes are sprinkly clean and ironed..  He doesn't like to change his style often, and hates people telling him to change it.  The only time he will try something new to wear if he sees me wearing something often and wants to match me.\n\nIt's cute cos he wears so neat clean expensive and classic. And I (ENFP) wear weird bright colours with strange patterns, sometimes a random hawaiian shirt I bought in the middle of the street, and a new style every few days. And I work in the fashion media industry, so I don't have to dress so conservative...so when we're out for drinks after work, and hes wearing his accountant suit and I'm wearing my bright pink mini-dress he jokes that people probably think he hired me for the night. We live in Hong Kong where a lot of people in suits have a young asian girl on their arm so Hahaha. There are many times he gives me the "??????" look when I'm wearing something ridiculous, in which I tell him to loosen up and live a little you sad sock.\n\n&#x200B;
1	I have a small wardrobe and have rules. I don't wear tshirts to work (even though I could). I don't expose my tattoos at work (even though I could). I don't wear pjs or pj-like clothes (like sweats) out of the house. I like neutral-toned clothing with splashes of color. I am fair skinned with dark hair. Jewel tones suit me well. I  wear one accessory (usually earrings) and lipstick every day (a creamy liquid lip, usually), so it looks like I've made some effort.
1	Literally whatever I have. I couldn't care less. I have as little to do with fashion and clothes as possible
1	I wear very simple yet cute clothes. I don’t bother wasting time making a detailed uncomfortable or unpractical outfit.
1	I wear classy but pops of color, Or just 1 thing that pops out of everything else. Camo is my favorite. I prefer comfort. I only leave the comfort of my big jackets when I go make dollas dancing, then I have to be cute and dolled up 
3	What is the best way to rekindle things after a fight with a entj partner?	I'm an isfp btw\n\nWhat's a good way to reapproach an entj?  I've already asked if there is anything I can do to be a supportive gf and I'll be here whenever he needs me. I just am curious what is the most effective way to be there for him. \n\n(We both weren't in the wrong in the fight it was just a misunderstanding)\n\nP.s I'm mostly asking for next time this happens, knowing how to approach things \n
6	Sex.
8	ENTJs like when people see things their way. Not just agreeing but using the same thought process necessary to arrive to these conclusions. If you can make an effort to see things how he does, he'd be very pleased. Fights are not so straining when that happens but if you're SJW who can't reason then it's very much hopeless. 
4	Try your best to stay rational the next time you argue. Take a moment to think about the reason why they’re upset and what they might be feeling. Then clearly and honestly explain what you’re feeling and why. 
1	Is this a recurring issue? 
1	Honestly, it's hard to say when you haven't said what caused the misunderstanding.  If it's something you can work on and do differently in the future (for example a communication issue) we love to maximize efficiency and really appreciate transparency as well, so approaching us with the genuine intention to improve the co-operation within the relationship can go a hell of a long way.
31	Does anyone else have an insane need for privacy and alone time?	
30	Yes.  I'm an "extroverted introvert".  Good with people but it wears me out quickly and then I *have to* retreat to my house for alone time and silence.
15	Yes. I'd like to lock myself up in my room and huddle in the back of my headboard with a blanket over my head in my silk robe. 
10	Just when I'm not in the mood for people who take up all the space.
4	I lock my diary’s into a box, cause I get paranoid sometimes. I need alone time to catch up with myself and my thoughts.
4	Yeah, I love being around people right up until I don't then I need to remove myself from the people around me.
4	Not insane at all, ENTJs are Extraverted Thinkers not Extroverts. \n\nPS you will likely enjoy time with a pet dog/dogs in addition to time by yourself.  ENTJ generally have a secret love of dogs, not all, but oft enough.
3	You know it
3	Yes, at least 70%
3	As supposedly extroverted people, we ENTJs can be pretty introverted.  We are also quite rare.  I'm not sure how it is for you guys, but for me I've come to the conclusion that it's largely to do with the fact that the people who excite us and click with us (and thus feed into our energy) are also rare, and that the majority of people we find mundane and boring.  \n\n\nFor me personally this is especially noticeable when trying to discuss existential philosophy or politics (just to name a couple of subjects).  Discussions pertaining to religion or life's bigger questions are often taboo in a lot of communities, and people are really adverse to them or see them as weird.  Politics on the other hand, everyone is willing to discuss, but when you ask the majority of them to justify their positions you often see cognitive dissonance kicking in and it becomes apparent their opinion was just borrowed from someone else.  \n\n\nTL;DR - I'm only introverted because I find the majority of people to be predictable and mundane.
5	Nope, unless I'm around nitwits.
2	ABSOLUTELY.  Most people are so disappointing.  
2	Am currently huddled in bed with all of the lights off hoping no one knows I’m home. 
2	I need time to blow off steam which includes me alone with my piano for hours. Only the people closest to me impede on that time.
2	Yes 100%. Wouldn’t say it’s an insane need though. I just need it 
7	How to increase emotional intelligence when the majority of people are sensors and feelers?	
8	They actually say ENTJs are the most emotionally intelligent type out there due to TeNi. For me personally, I feel that my gut instinct is pretty spot on although I don't always follow up on it. On the other hand, a lot of SF types tend to be conventional and see things through a linear path of thinking from experience (such he does expression X, he feels Y) which is a sensor thing, rather than noticing and understanding what the other person is truly feeling by reading in between the lines with a view to the bigger picture which is more of a intuitive thing.\n\nSo you may not be on most people's wavelength, but that doesn't make you any less emotionally intelligent.
1	Learn why they do the things the do, put yourself in their shoes, understand them and find their strengths. \n\nAcknowledge your weaknesses and strengths in contrast with theirs and how to use those differences with cooperation. 
17	Married ENTJ's, when and how did you realise that it was time to settle down?	
17	Female ENTJ here, I got married young by today’s standard (mid 20s). I got married because I love and respect the man I am with and wanted to build a future together. We wanted to achieve our goals together. \n\nThere’s no magic formula/timeline folks. It’s about the people involved and what they want out of life. I’ve seen people get married young and have a shitty marriage and I’ve seen people marry when they were in their 40s and still have a shitty marriage. If your attitude isn’t to give 100% and you don’t respect the person you are with, don’t marry them. \n\nI’ve also seen people say they will achieve XYZ first (a couple of ENTJs included in this observation) and THEN they will get married, but when they do they’re still not happy. \n\nMy cousin is also an ENTJ. He delayed marriage to an ESTJ to achieve his goals, dragged his feet until his late 30s and finally gave in and married her because there were no more check boxes left. He’s not happy and really if you’re looking for every excuse to avoid marrying someone, just don’t marry them and continue to work on your goals. 
7	Hi! I’m 23, husband is 23, both ENTJs. I don’t date unless it’s someone I can see marrying. Seems like a waste since marriage is definitely something I’ve always wanted. After 2 dates we knew we wanted to get married. Spent 3 years building trust, making sure the other isn’t crazy, spending time together, decided we were wasting time and money by not being married. So we got married. It’s been nothing short of perfect. We’ve already been through some shit together (a lot of stress outside the marriage), and it has made us so much stronger. Being married is the coolest. \n\nSide note, we’re also pretty religious, so marriage is a core value for us. That probably is why we both knew we wanted to get married. I know by society’s standards, 23 is young, but in our religious community, we’re slightly older than average as we’re already almost done with our graduate degrees. \n\nEveryone is different, but we know we want a lot of kids, we want to be married for a few years before bringing kids into it, and we’re not counting on getting pregnant after 34 (I know it’s possible, but it’s difficult, and the sooner our kids are out, the sooner we can retire). I’m clearly very goal oriented and futuristic lmao. 
3	Married nearly 15 years; together for nearly 20.  \n\nI'm not sure there is an objective way of evaluating this question, as it's going to vary from person to person depending on their life experiences.\n\nFor me, I don't think of being married as "settling."  We have many adventures together, and I think that helps keep us going.\n\nI suppose it happens when you know you've found the right person.  Don't put some arbitrary timeline on your life, because arbitrary deadlines never work out in the end.  Just go with the flow, which I know is the hardest thing ever for an ENTJ.  
4	... do married ENTJ's exist? 😂 
1	32. We are the same age. We both realized by the second date or so - it was just coffee at a marina - that we are both sane, fit, healthy, driven individuals who have a very limited amount of emotional baggage. That contrasted with every single other person that was on the market locally at the time. Pregnant within 2 months, been together 4 years. 
1	After two marriages I think no one should get married until right before they wanna have kids. And that shouldn’t happen before 32 at the earliest. 
7	What is a waste of money?	INTP here and not very good with money, so I thought I'd ask you, the money wise, what you consider a waste of money. \n\nYeah, I know, what is a waste of money depends on the person, but I'd like to see if there is a pattern and also pick your minds a bit about spending/money.\n\nHow do you decide what to spend youe money on, when the groceries are bought?\n\nOn the other side, what is important to buy?\n\nMy problem is that I get the idea that I need stuff which correlate with my change of interests. Currently, I am on a 1 year non-spending program. Going 123 days so far. \n\nThx 😎\n\nEdit: really nice to hear your thoughts on spending. I am closer to become a money wizard. Especially the posts on being intentional and also checking my needs and not just wants.
11	A waste of money is money spent that gives neither survival interest (food, accomodation) or value for you (this is a very wide concept - donating to charities for example has a value for you, psychologically).
7	Personally, I find eating out and fast food a waste of money. Not only is it cheaper to make your own food, it's better for health and weight control.\n\nI also find cigarettes and alcohol a waste of money.\n\nEdit: I'd also like to add big luxury homes to the list. So much is wasted on gardening/cutting the grass. Cleaning the space. Filling it up with stuff so it won't look empty. 
4	A waste of money is a purchase where the price doesn't justify every unit of the item. Ie. MBP 2015 for $2500, pricey but daily use for work for 4-5 years = worthy price /unit. Groceries: eat healthy so body healthy and don't get sick = worthy. Starbucks everyday = no, grind your own coffee. 
3	Obviously people can argue things like ad on services you will never use is a waste, a gym membership you will never use is a waste, clothing you will wear once and throw into the back of your closet is a waste. \n\nIt’s about being intentional with your spending and putting your money to use, whether its investments or buying things you are actually going to get use out of. 
2	Something you don’t need or want really badly.
2	Anything that doesn't better your life or that isn't an absolute necessity is a a waste of money imho  \n\n\n\- Spend on things you need  \n\- Invest in hobbies/pursuits that you are passionate about  \n\n\nWhen it comes to things you need, I also consider unhealthy food and drinks a waste.  Everything that you put in your body should facilitate long term health and maximum efficiency/performance.
1	You should be familiar with the hierarchy of needs - that will be a clue. Also used items are often almost as good as the brand new ones.
7	i noticed....?	i noticed theres a certain look that ntjs develop when they become sick....let me expain\n\n\na normal ntj will just took like your typical human.but once they start becoming sick.like going through mental stress,or a mental illness suddenly develops like bipolar for eg.\n\n\nthey develop this look.this piercing look to them.they will start to have there sharp features.i cant explain it.
11	On a scale of 1-10, please rate how inebriated/high you currently are 
9	Not sure I can relate

10	I feel my face do that.  Like furrowed eyebrows.  More than my normal everyday amount of furrowing.  My son has my same personality and he’s been doing this since he was 3.  Always slightly discredulous or skeptical or something.  And being sick is just a test in endurance, and I never shy away from a challenge.  So I need my battle face.  
3	Bipolar includes extreme emotional highs and extreme emotional lows. How does a piercing look equate to this?
2	sho pics
2	This comment made me laugh, thank you. \nTo be fair, I don’t think bipolar would be a good example to use for your theory but overall, it might be the case.
3	I type as INTP but I know what you mean. I have been told I have a very intense stare. I see it in other people as well, it's like they are working harder than average to keep their eyes open and focused. I always associated it with introverts, who I believe have a harder time making/maintaining eye contact, and have to try harder as a result. 
4	Also my penis gets longer when I am sick, but it is also thinner at the same time. I can still insert a pine needle in it though.
3	INTP here. I've been told my look becomes very intimidating and stern, specially when giving classes or flirting (anxiety, maybe?). May be something about NT's or high Ti/Te in the funcional stack. 
10	What’s your vice?	Fellow ENTJs...what’s your main vice or weakness?
22	Naps\n\nEating really good food\n\nSolo nature walks\n\nSignificant others who anticipate my needs
15	Marijuana. Don't like other drugs nearly as much, apart from Adderall, which I rarely do.\n\n\nHasn't really seemed to impact me too much. I've been doing this since mid-high school, and just locked up a job at Google for when I graduate college next year. It's hard to feel like weed is killing my motivation when I literally couldn't be doing better for myself as a CS major.

13	Sex, Shit gets in the way of so many things
8	Pot and piano. Calming on their own. Even more calming together.
7	Loving women and food too much.
9	Thinking I have more time than I do.  That's the main one.\n\nAnd coffee.  I need to take a break.\n\nUndervaluing sleep.\n\nAnd leg day.  Whenever I find an excuse to skip exercise, it always seems to be leg day.\n\nAnd useless todo lists and planning, though I am better about this these days.  \n\nIgnoring or discounting emotional needs of people around me.  Getting better at this, too.\n\nDairy...cheese and ice cream are probably going to be the habits that end up doing me in.  I'm hoping being healthy in other ways makes up for that but when my father-in-law died, an avid marathoner among other things, they found a lot of stuff clogging his vascular system...nothing beats a good diet.\n\nOh, and anger.  I really don't mind letting it fly, and I'm never really as angry as I seem and I get over it quickly, but other people don't see it that way.\n\nOn that note: cursing.  Again, I love to fucking curse.  Other people are bothered by it, though, so I need to un-fucking-develop that habit.\n\nI really try to keep things moderate...I hate gambling unless I have control over it (poker), I drink but not to excess because I hate how that makes me feel.  I generally eat well and fast intermittently when I feel like I need to.  I exercise.  I'm faithful to my loved ones.  I work hard but I've found balance through good time management (mostly).  \n\nI'm a bit older, and that helps.  I feel like I've done enough of finding my boundaries and I'm very happy that the risks I've taken in my younger years paid off more than they cost...a lot of that was just dumb luck I now know.\n\n
9	Self care things such as pedicures and high end beauty products. Facial oils, lotions, scented candles, really soft pajamas. Traveling, staying in very nice hotels, and taking a prescription pill at the end of the day while detoxifying my skin under a face mask. 
8	No vices
7	Sex. It’s pretty incredible how this one act can have such a hold on me. 
3	Women
3	Positive vices: Intellectual pursuits such as reading, analyzing, introspection, studying people, music, alcohol, fine dining, travel, exercise and being an evil mastermind (insert evil laugh) and dogs. \n\nNegative vices: explosive anger, alcohol, circuitous overthinking and analysis (when I’m in a bad place) and hatred. 
3	League of Legends... the worst drug of them all.
3	Sugar. Good genes mean I don't get fat but definitely going to eventually get diabetes
3	All of them. I’m a hedonist. 
2	THC, video games, drumming, lifting weights.
2	You need to layoff the CS Joseph lol
2	Naps and smoking cigarettes 
2	Ha. I'd tell you but then I'd have to kill you. Actually not just you but also everyone who has read this post or visited Reddit.
2	Sleep 
2	Chocolate. I use the excuse that women actually need it. Not sure how accurate that is, but it sure feels like it sometimes.
2	Is it just a part of our personalities to not get addicted to hard drugs?\n\nMine is weed, too. Weed is the only drug I want every day. I drink recreationally and party on occasion. I like molly, but very rarely do it. I love to trip once in a while.
2	Arguing with people on the internet. What can I say, I like being right
2	The F word
2	Bitching and video games. \n\nBoth so unproductive.  
2	Carbs. Sad.
2	I’m a rigger.\n\nPS it’s a bondage thing
1	Hate is a bad one. That and wasting time playing piano
1	why do entjs loved to be worshiped?	lool.entjs are so narcisistic.just praise them a bit and they will be over the moon
21	It means nothing if we don't respect you. lool 
8	You lost me at “lool”.
7	Don't drink and post on Reddit.
5	Because humans like to be praised, and ENTJ's are typically humans.\n\nEdit: lool 
4	I think it stokes our competitiveness 
3	lool because reasons 
3	Inferior Fi probably. I wouldn’t call it narcissistic, although I think I am a narcissist personality. Not far from it at least.
2	Because being worshipped means i get to do whatever I want to those worshipping me. \n\nThe praise bit is pretty useless for my psyche personally because I don't need your verification that I'm good, I know very well that I'm good. Your praise (or lack thereof) is ultimately irrelevant unless it serves some other higher purpose like increasing my social standing or connecting me to those who matter. Praise is used as a tool, not as a goal. \n\nIn general it's a safe bet to say that others opinion of us is pretty inconsequential especially when they're irrelevant to the achievement of goals. We quite literally couldn't care less
2	It’s our due 😉, LoL but seriously, shadow Fe, we don’t thrust anything but explicit and clear feelings, we don’t sense love easily and worship is love we can trust
2	I don't really asI know I've done a good job. I think people are just trying to manipulate me. 
2	Cause we get shit done, duh
2	It’s how we feel good about ourselves. We do things because we want to be highly regarded. That’s why we go out of our way to be as successful as we can. Unfortunately the way we were raised and our personalities have made us take in all that praise and “worship” from others as positive feedback to make us feel like we are worthy people. 
9	Time management in college	Any one find ways to do some side reading in college. The work load seems to be too much to find private time to act on my interests. Currently on the quarter system. Also anyone looking to law school? What major did you choose and why.
6	Audiobooks mang
4	Your choice of major should be based on what you can do, like to do and can get paid well for doing. Much depends on your brain. I went into programming and studied CS. It just so happens that I liked this stuff. I recommend it if you can do it and enjoy it. But maybe you are much stronger verbally than technically, in which case law school may be for you.\n\nDon't get education like law degree because you are confused and do not know what to do and so you pick a "default" option. If you are confused and not sure why you are in college / grad school, then my advice would be: start working.\n\nTwo factors favoring programming: You can work from almost anywhere these days. Yes, you need to prove your worth, but eventually you could be chilling in Belize, spending $200 / month and earning 5k+ / month after taxes. You also would have a choice of tens of thousands of employers. You can pick large or small. There is also little regulation.\n\nA good formula for doing well is to be in the top 10% (ideally 5%) in 3 valuable skills. If you are going for a long competitive degree with exams like PhD or MD or JD, then concentrate on just that in the short term.\n\nAs for side reading - do it when you can but ONLY when you can. College is way too stressful as is.\n
3	Well if you can finish everything from Monday-Friday you would have time on the weekend for side reading. 
1	I picked up law while doing my Bachelor of Arts majoring in Public Policy. The two were quite complementary and I was interested in the structure of the legal system (but ultimately don't want to be a lawyer so dropped it after a year). In New Zealand you can study law as a conjoint degree. \n\n\nIf you're struggling to manage your course load now then you will struggle with law. It's generally taught by Socratic method, so you do all of your course readings in advance and are tested on them in class which counts towards your grade. So you're usually doing readings between class and every night before classes the next day. \n\n\nLaw is very competitive, and there are usually far more law graduates than there are internships and jobs. You need to maintain a high grade average (A- at least here), and places are limited, here they accept 1500 into first year and only 380 into second year. Realistically you need to be an A+ student, have extracurriculars like model UN and debating or be on the student council, form a study group and network. \n\n\nWhen it comes to working in the industry there can be a lot of bullshit and elitism, I've heard lawyers say that they won't look at resumes for people with foreign names, there's still a lot of sexism, and a Fit In or Fuck Off bro culture depending what kind of firm you want to work for. If you want a shortcut to an internship, get a part-time job that brings you into close contact with lawyers. I sell women's suiting and some of my customers are partners at top firms, I got offered a few really good internships when they found out that I studied law. Beats competing in the next intake.\n\n\nGet super-efficient at time management. Listen to podcasts and audiobooks while you work out or drive, read the news while you eat breakfast or wait for coffee, read for pleasure before bed, watch documentaries while you cook etc. 
1	i want to go into law as well 
1	Seems at though I must devote my life to being a lawyer before i even become one.this is difficult as I’ve met an INTP and we have become interested in the legacy of the two Steve’s (Woz And Jobs). Looking to build the next Apple in the future. But still kinda wanna be a lawyer (have a strong passion for the art of debate). Balancing these two things seems to be trying to talk on two roads at the same time. It seems impossible but I figure everything’s impossible until someone does it. 
1	Any specific interest in a certain law, where are you in life right now?
1	I usually read for myself at night. My brain gets ineffective at a certain point, so I close the books and read a "fun" book to fall asleep. I also read during the 5 minute gaps of my pomodoro timers while studying sometimes. \n\nI am currently an Econometrics major. I am leaving my options open for law school but have decided the ROI wouldn't be worth it for me. I chose Econ because it just fits. Everything boils down to efficiency, and it requires quite a bit of problem solving and logical analysis. I am exploring the idea of becoming an actuary currently, but my fantasy job would be working in economic policy.
7	Entj (M) going after Enfj (F) tips?	Interested in a girl but unsure if she sees me as a solid friend or has been sending hints like crazy and I’m just too skeptical to act. Mostly hesitant as I know she appreciates the stability of a friendship with a guy because she’s the kinda girl who gets a lot of attention regardless. But tbh I’d rather go for it and figure out everything later.
4	I think anything other than what comes naturally to you is the wrong move. If she likes you; switching up is not beneficial. We ask questions where most other people want to ask questions. 
3	Married to an ENFJ. They are highly sought after and selective about who they have a relationship with (not too far off from ENTJs). My suggestion is to be forward with your intentions about wanting to date her and let her take some time to digest it and see where it takes you. Good luck! 
2	I this instance Tact us what you are weighing agianst your Decisiveness. It is not immoral to fall for friend because if the law if proximity. Secondly if your friend thinks highly of you she  may want to stay friends to keep u around. Third is being her friend worth the time and effort put into the friendship instead of seeking out a relationship with a common intrested and investment. Simply if u shoot your shot and all goes well then it worked out as it was supposed to. If not then regardless of timing its not going to be worth the relationship you have now not to become more worthwhile. I learned a long time ago that there is no woman worth torturing yourself over being a really good friend to see where it goes. I watched others crash and burn so i didnt have to. Make your intentions clear and be transparent about your feelings cause if not you wont win any trophies in the emotional availability contest regardless of your openness. 
2	I don't understand things like this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you like her, ask her out.  I dated the exact opposite of the ENTJ and had a great relationship.  I feel like this is hella overthinking.
2	I have an ENFJ girlfriend atm, fairly new relationship but things are going well. She approached me and the hints were there but just like you I was hesitant to begin with. \n\nShe told me to begin with that she felt shy around me and I can only assume that is due to my personality. Not saying that’s the same case for you but it might be. \n\nMy mentor once told me that sometimes I’m like a boy who is learning to ride a bike but is scared to go downhill BUT once you go downhill you realise that it’s the most fun experience. \n\nI apply that logic to different parts of my life, including relationships so I would say take the plunge buddy. Go downhill, it could be a great relationship. \n\nEven if it’s not what you expect I’m sure you’ll learn something. \n\nGood luck. \n
1	If you need more, tell her, and ready yourself to end it; if you are willing to accept less be content, if want more, steel yourself. If you are an ENTJ you will be at peace in making choice and frustrated by indecision. A bad choice is better than none at all, at least for us. If is was wrong learn and be better for it.
1	Where did you find her? How is she, socially? Personality wise? (Looking for an ENFJ myself)
3	Today is one of those days where I wish I am an ENTJ	From an ENFP
4	Nahh i adore u guys. ENTJs dick.
8	Executing and tweaking as you go VS. planning and then executing	Hey ENTJs, I have a question for you. As an INTJ, one of the issues I run into is with potential "what ifs" in my planning phase. At times, this can be fairly crippling mentally and I can get hyper focused on a particular scenario (even if the probability of it happening is low) and this takes time away from actual execution because I then spend so much time planning and making sure that I come up with the optimal system that can lead to a flawless execution. Most of the times, this works but I have a habit of losing out on massive opportunities because I don't act in time.\n\n\nAs ENTJs, you all have a better grasp on SE than we do as INTJs. How do you go about balancing execution and then refining as you go without losing your head if things end up south? How do you "know" what is the right thing to focus on as you're moving through? How can I as an INTJ get better at figuring this out and getting more in touch with my SE?
12	This has never been an issue for me. I plan. Then I plan for things that are *likely* to go wrong or are unconfirmed. I know my end game and I know what's acceptable to me and what's not, so everything goes towards that direction.\n\nI don't micromanage, but I don't trust anyone either. I let them do it then I check up on every detail. If they have a deadline then I check the submission before their deadline. I always plan around other people. \n\nIf you want advice, I'm not sure ENTJs can give any. You fixate on unlikely scenarios? My advice is "just don't".
7	I used to have a room mate who was like this. I am completely the former and he was the latter. We are going out drinking with the boys tonight.\n\nHim:\n\n*what are we drinking?*\n\n*when are we meeting up?*\n\n*who is driving?*\n\n*who goes in what car?*\n\n*which town and which bars?*\n\n*are we doing anything after?*\n\n*is anyone staying the night?*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMe:\n\nOur friends would be late to their own funerals if they were not dead so pregame at our house. I told everyone seven so they should be here around 9.\n\n I'm driving because we might end up in the city and I hate taking the train.\n\n I called these girls up they may or may not meet us out there; doesn't matter. Tonight is about drinking with the boys not hanging with these girls. In the car I am asking where we are going. We both love to drive so we are both driving. If you want to smoke you go in my car if not go in his. Beyond that who gives a shit? We are supposed to be having fun not planning the invasion of Normandy. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are some things worth planning and others you play by ear. You know full well that things are not going to go as expected so why bother planning all these low impact details that may or may not happen?
11	That’s the thing, we tend to stick so firmly to our plan that any disruption can be crippling. So we act on a plan faster than you, but breakdown if something major goes wrong. Until we inevitably pull ourselves back together and go into problem solving mode. Then it’s game on and we finish it out. 
6	I have a clear game plan and then I also form a contingency plan around things which are likely to wrong, just so I'm not caught with my pants down.  I also trust in my ability to think on my feet and adapt in case of emergencies, so that added confidence allows me to execute plans (both high and low risk) much more efficiently.    \n\n\nOne thing I have noticed with some INTJs is that failure very often cripples them.  I also strive to execute things flawlessly from the get go, but I also welcome the possibility that I will overlook something or that I'll make a mistake along the way.  When things go wrong, I embrace it as a lesson learned, fix it, and then I move on and refine my process.
5	You learn to trust your gut with experience to know where to strike the balance. Make sure you cover the big concerns and enough of everything else to cover the flow to the end. Then trust yourself to be able to deal with anything else that comes up along the way.
4	Force yourself to act. I know this is very difficult for INTJs who are a little bit more indesicive. But try to force yourself to do things without thinking through everything and all the what ifs. It takes some courage to do so but the rewards are endless.
3	I am ENTJ and my girlfriend is INTJ, and she is classically as you described.  I might be able to provide perspective here.  What stood out to me here is that you focus on low probability scenarios.  \n\nThe first piece of advice I have is to find a mentor that has accomplished what you wish to.  I cannot emphasize this enough.  This may seem like irrelevant advice considering your question is about how to balance taking action vs. planning, but it actually can help solve this problem.  It seems like your root problem is that you want a perfect plan before moving forward, but that is almost impossible and takes a lot of time and effort, which actually inhibits and slows you down.  Having a mentor who has accomplished what you want already streamlines this process because they can guide you and give you the most efficient way to attain your goals.  It's like they are giving you a map for how to get where you want to go rather than you just trying to wander around discovering it yourself.  This is one of the most important lessons I have learned, mentorship is absolutely essential.\n\nOnce you have a solid map everything else is much easier.  You can then make plans, and focus on scenarios are the most probable.  Also plan for a couple contingencies that have lower probability of occurring, but focus most of your energy on your primary goal as others have already commented.  Seriously though, find that mentor first if you can.
3	Sometimes it is “Ready! Aim! Fire!”. Sometimes it is “Ready! Fire! Aim!” Sometimes it be like that.
3	Tons of planning constantly, but at the same time I trust my physical impulses and instincts if I feel they align with my goals. Sometimes I say or do something stupid, but overall I win by moving forward faster. 
3	Always use the Get Out of Jail Free card: "We've planned for anything we can foresee, but obviously we're human and can't plan for everything.  So this is not a final product, and as we (the group as a whole) see the need for changes, we will make them.  You can help by identifying issues as they occur, and bringing them to the team as a whole, along with how you think it might best be solved."\n\nThis sets two expectations. Firstly, that the plans may change in response to events on the ground. And secondly, that people who have an issue are expected to escalate it *along with* a proposed solution, instead of just being toxic whiners.
2	You already have your super power. Just work to realize perfectionism is rarely your friend. If it's perfect you waited too long to launch. As an ENTJ that's very close to an INTJ, this has been a struggle I endure and my focus on loosening perfectionism and avoidance of grandiosity helps me the most. Just fucking do it. You're plenty smart enough to sort out the changes as they evolve. 
1	I typically do a quick run through of a task in my head to think of future problems.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWork through the problems in my head. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen execute making small adjustments as I go.  
1	Thanks for all the replies guys, this was incredibly helpful. I think I'm stuck in some form of an Ni Fi loop here and I need to snap the fuck out of it. I would reply individually to each person but since there's so much overlap in the answers, I don't see a point.
11	How do I best show an ENTJ that they are loved and appreciated?	I am a female ENFP dating a male ENTJ. I want him to feel as loved and appreciated as possible, but I feel like I don't fully accomplish that. I want to do things other than say "I love you" - I feel like it can go in one ear and out the other sometimes. \n\nENTJs, how do you feel most loved, valued and appreciated?
8	as an ENTJ, , I think we don't like having to unravel the meaning of stuff.  Given all our general high standard of everything you could just say "hey you're not terrible".   I'd laugh.  Or literally get them a card that said "you are loved an appreciated" in block text.   It could work.  At the least it'd be funny.
6	Consistency, loyalty and practicality. Make sure you tell him but not in too gushy of a way. And then make sure your actions match your words. 
6	give him reasons why you love him because if you just say "i love you" we wont trust that
5	Biggest thing for me is that I have my lover's support and loyalty. I appreciate the 'I love you's' as both words of romance and confidence, but I feel most loved when my partner/girlfriend/fiance/spouse either takes interest in how I'm spending my time (i.e. doing a hobby, watching a certain TV show or movie, etc..) or champions my causes (i.e. a project I'm working on or something I'm trying to achieve). Most everything ENTJs do is well-reasoned and executed, so to have someone's attempted understanding and support means a lot. Sometimes this means questioning 'why,' sometimes it means quiet attention, sometimes it means literally telling us 'you did a good job.' That's for you to figure out; use those responses wisely! I generally respond with a simple 'thanks,' or self-criticism, or an explanation.\n\nNot all ENTJs are the same, but this is what I look for.\n\nEDIT: some pronouns
3	I actually appreciate well thought out outings together more than any gift or words. Going to a nice dinner, seeing an event or show we both like, checking out a new brewery. \n\nSuggest you observe what kind of events your ENTJ enjoys and plan an outing. 
3	Acts of service
3	I think my SO is an ENTJ and this is what works for me:\n\n* Demonstrate your interest in their projects. Don't just ask how their day was, but ask follow-up questions and be a sparring partner.\n* Let them rant. They need to vent their frustrations about inefficient processes, incompetent managers, lazy coworkers. This can be hard for introverts who need to be alone after a rough day, but it's worth it.\n* Tell them they're good enough. They secretly fear being inadequate (and therefore unlovable). Provide evidence or they will think you're not being genuine. \n* So-called "acts of service" are something of a double-edged knife. On the one hand ENTJs love being leaders and having people do stuff for them, but on the other hand they despise groveling. Also, you don't want to become their doormat.\n* Stand up to them. If they're being unreasonable or not respecting your boundaries, then say so. This may lead to arguments in the short term, but they will respect you for it in the long term.\n* Tickle their brains. Underneath the armour is a nerd who likes to talk about technical stuff and life's questions.\n\nHope this helps.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBonus question to you ENTJs: does my SO sound like an ENTJ to you? I'm never sure if she's an ENTJ, ESTJ, ENTP, ESTP, or something completely different, so your input is greatly appreciated.
2	Ask them what problems they are trying to solve in life, see if you contribute to the problems or contribute to solving them.  See what problems and goals you can work on together and share. Actions speak louder than words for me and I see life as a series of puzzles to solve, crossing them off make me feel accomplished.  On a more tender note, grab their hand when in the car or reach out for it when taking a walk or out with friends randomly. The action shows you are thinking of them even as life rushes by around you vs a rehearsed "I love you." GL!
2	ENTJ’s are driven to do do do. Don’t just praise him for fluff, but legitimately what you love about him. Things he’s done that you think took work. 
2	Entj male here, for me most important is partnership, i need to know that my significant other is always there on my side. We can trust each other, and I need to know if she is considering my opinion in everything she does. And truly I dont even care about words, it's pointless, because i have to know! Most people lie a lot, so if I want to know the truth I analyze their actions
2	I’m ENTJ but female so I may be different but I feel like if my partner can keep up with my productivity and/or solve problems at my pace so I don’t have to.... THAT is where it’s at 
1	For me, take an interest in my interests, my thoughts and my plans. Come into my headspace and meet me there. Thats all I need.
1	Invest in their hobbies. Don't make them feel like they're taking the lead or forcing you to spend time doing activities they like. 
1	Don't change yourself. Consistency with variation is highly valued, praise that is specific to your guy's emotional skills may catch him positively off guard, do be helpless but do the small things that help him feel...not in control of life, but secure. \n\n\n\nSex. Sex is good but don't overdose.....on sex...
7	Conversations with INTP?	I'm told INTP (me) match with ENTJ in terms of cognitive functions. But looking at the type description, ENTJs seem like energetic workaholics that would just get on my nerves personally. I feel ENTJs would criticize my lack of action and not quite understand I'm constantly in my own head trying to figure out things.  \n\n\nThoughts? 
13	Are INTPs just copying and pasting the comments and posts of other INTPs on the internet now?
6	I have a twin intp brother and we couldn’t get along any better. We share a lot of interests and we can talk deeply about them. I have a lot of intp friends and I learn a lot from them. 
4	Well, if they criticize you for a lack of action, you should listen. We're naturally in our heads, yes, but it's good for us and the people around us to get out there and make things happen.\n\nI have a really good friend who I believe is ENTJ. I love that when I have a crazy idea, he'll actually go with it. It's hard to find people like that, and I'm always looking for more in my life. On top of that, he's one of the most truly compassionate people I've met, with a firm moral compass, which I really respect, because I struggle with pure morality and rather rely on ethics instead. He's loud, always speaks his mind, and he's an independent thinker like me. Plus he loves fashion and styling, blowing tons of money on nice clothes and even cosmetics, whereas I dress like garbage and can't even be bothered to take 2 seconds to look at myself in the mirror. He wants to style me up, lol, and I'm more than happy to completely "outsource" that part of my life.
2	I'm (24f) an ENTJ with an INTP (30m) partner. \n\nIt took a little while to understand that part of things, you're right. I was so incredibly attracted to the creativity and charisma and freedom, the other things seemed understandable if I took the time. There is a lot that I admire about the INTP mentality, and I've been grateful to be able to learn from a partner who is much better at living in the moment than I am. \n\nOur conversational chemistry is unreal. I've never felt more appreciated and understood. We often find that our strengths and weaknesses fill in the other's, and life is easier together. \n\nThe diminished career ambition is actually really great to me specifically. I know we won't have to choose one career over the other. 
2	ENTJ/INTP why it's perfect relation in my opinion?\nINTP's tend to keep thinking and never make a move, well ENTJ is the one who will do it, and help you do it. You INTP have great minds like we do, and we respect this a lot. And we lack of one trait you guys have. You are outside of the box thinkers (J/P). And well, INTP's is type that understand me the most, and vice-versa. You are power supply for our machine that makes product. Without each other we are much less productive. You should meet few ENTJ's and you'll see that those types admire each other. 
1	I'm an intp (24f) and I've been with an entj (22m) for almost five years and I can't imagine being more in love. Maybe I'm a bit biased but I agree entj is the most romantically and socially compatible with intp, being direct mirror types of each other. A mind structured cognitively the same yet oriented in opposite directions brings enough similarities to feel like we really "get" each other with enough differences to keep the passion alive. Also I'm glad to have someone able to call me out on some of my worst traits while modeling better effortlessly, and vice versa. Such as my lack of action and never getting out of my own head. As always if either person hasn't developed their functions well enough, it can definitely become more of an antagonistic relationship with lots of conflict if you aren't ready to be challenged.
1	As an INTP  I  came here because I was curious about the type pairing.   I heard about it before csj but he really made it easy to understand how the type match up is really like puzzle pieces fitting together.   I wasn't expecting to see so many wholesome exchanges between intps and entjs on this sub but there must be something to it if it's always like that haha
4	What life advice would you give to an INFP?	Thinking of an INFP you know in your life, what life advice would you give to them if they came to you and asked for it? What are some practical ways they could learn to improve at the things they aren't so good at? \n\nReally curious to hear the kind of advice you guys would give.  Especially interested in advice you would give to INFP men, as I am a guy.  \n
6	One of the most beautiful things about INFPs is their idealism, which ENTJs often appreciate in part because we have a powerful idealist streak ourselves, which is arguably the quality that differentiates us most from ESTJs. However, our dominant function, Te, renders us the most realistic of the idealists, and for me, this shows most when I am interacting with INFPs. My advice to them would be: never forget that idealism has an ugly side. I'll give you an example to illustrate: Suppose there is a student entering college trying to decide on a major, and he is deciding between studying business or art history because he really wants to be an art history professor but he fears the job prospects in that field. So many INFPs would urge the young student to pursue his dreams and study art history. That's beautiful. I mean that sincerely: that's beautiful. But - what's the kid going to do when he graduates from college, discovers he's not a competitive enough candidate to get into an art history graduate program, and consequently can't get a job. That student could be drowning in student loans and struggling with unemployment for *years*. And when that young guy has been jobless for years, where's the INFP who urged him to study art history? That INFP will be gone - nowhere to be found - and the young student will be miserable and alone. In the same way I would urge ESTJs to have some faith, I would urge INFPs to remember: idealism has an ugly side.
3	Sometimes you gotta do stuff you don't feel like doing. Develop self discipline.
3	Suck it up, buttercup (and I mean that in the nicest way possible). 
4	Music liked by r/ENTJ	I strongly believe that to understand how each type views the world, you look at the art they make and swear by.\n\nYou can think of r/MBTIRadioStation as a place to broadcast, type and discuss music, podcasts, videos or whatever you are watching. The goal is to create a directory but you can discuss anything Art, Science, Psychology there.\n\nI think musicians and artists explore a lot of their psyche and shadow through their art. Art is the greatest healer!\n\nBreak all stereotypes! I think the creativity of ENTJs is woefully underestimated.\n\nTo understand the music r/ENTJ likes and loves, I searched for "music" on the searchbar and pulled out some of the songs you peeps have posted here. I did it for other types as well. I found very few youtube links posted here though. Please post your youtube playlists below if you can :)\n\nI have another dataset with just the band names but that will have to wait a bit. Will try to create an excel and share the data once I have done it for all the types.\n\n[Please subscribe to our sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/MBTIRadioStation/) to discover more stuff and post your favourites :) There is also our [sister sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/EnneagramMusic/) if you are into Enneagram.\n\n* ["Rainy Day In Autumn"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjuX-tTesbg)\n* [A Discussion with Dario Nardi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgFERPXB0SA)\n* [ABIOGENESIS - Visualize (OFFICIAL VIDEO)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rt1QVlOkRfU)\n* [ALPINES - EMPIRE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STh0PaH1LjA)\n* [Achinoam Nini He ( boi kala )](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDxXFtgxZMI)\n* [An Unskirted Garment - Lark Rise To Candleford - Series 3 Episode 8 Preview - BBC One](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbjuEfbzRds)\n* [Anaal Nathrakh - When Humanity is cancer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cfskAGScbA)\n* [Baby Cakes - Role Play Tournament (Be Aggressive)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2XGp5ix8HE)\n* [Boi (Bo'i) - Idan Raichel Project בואי - עידן רייכל](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnvPULGY4S0)\n* [Brad - I Don't Know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYEA3g986CI)\n* [CHVRCHES - Lungs (HQ)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOGMrnfrNM0)\n* [Canadian, Please | gunnarolla & Julia Bentley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWQf13B8epw)\n* [Crazy Voice!

6	Fuck yeah some Lofi better be on here
4	Q: What type music do you like?\nA:  Anything that moves me, regardless of genre\n- ENTJ
1	For me, I like natural authentic sounds that is easy and pleasant to listen to. I dislike the techno sounds, autotune, mixboards or amplified electric instruments.\n\nI like classical music (especially Puccini, Verdi and Schubert) 60s singers like Dean Martin, Perry Como, Bob Dylan and more recently, Ed Sheeran and Adele. 
1	No way I have the time to think up 50 of my favorite tracks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. [Halestorm - Love Bites](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmkHqUwa4zg)\n2.

8	ENTJ/INTJ interractions	What is your initial impression on meeting an INTJ? \n\nI am not fantastic at typing people but I guess I've probably worked with a few ENTJs (law). I do know a confirmed female ENTJ who is a badass. I admire her no bs style. \n\nI've met a man who is possibly an ENTJ (medical science) and that interraction was extremely odd...it was electric and felt like he was looking straight through me with a gigantic smile on his face. Naturally, I ran away and now am over analyzing what that interraction was all about. \n\nI type as INTp on socionics but would say that I am INTJ. Any insights? Normally it is me who intimidates other people with RBF not the other way around. 
18	The friend that I get along with the best is an INTJ friend. Never any conflicts. Disagreements just stay as mild disagreements (we always agree on fundamentals/the big picture). \n\nIMO ENTJs are never invasive (that's how I see other ENTJs, idk about myself). Despite sometimes being too boisterous for INTJs, ENTJs can usually tell if someone is just reserved or genuinely doesn't want to interact, so in my experience INTJs don't feel that their personal space is ever threatened by ENTJs. I tend to feel that xNTJs generally just keep to their own space. 
12	I'm an ENTJ and my girlfriend is an INTJ.  When I first met her I found her extremely intimidating, but to the point it excited me and I saw it as a challenge.  People are usually intimidated by me because of my tendency to take charge and speak very bluntly, and so I started to wear a mask when I was younger to have an easier time making friends.  She saw right through me and was able to get right inside my head, and the fact that no one had been able to do that before really freaked me out at first.  Fast forward 5 years and we are the very best of friends and lovers, we know each other as well as we know ourselves, and now we both intimidate people to the point it's hard to make friends haha.  \n
11	It depends on their health. Both types are very aware of each other so if an intj is in a bad spot we will be able to tell really fast and it may seem downright gross.\n\nIntjs can have pretty self destructive behavior and intellectually can be a waste of they devote themselves to one idea and arnt good at seeing its relationship to other ideas (a flaw we can easily see that others can’t about them sometimes)\n\nHowever.... with a healthy intj we can get along very very very well.\n\nI have dated many types, my current gf is an intj and everything about her is ideal and perfect. She has the greatest intellect of any girl I have ever met. She is humorous and cares deeply about the things that really matter. She is in touch with the darker truths of the world but still undoubtly feminine. Independent as can be yet sees the full value of a partnership with me.\n\nShe will actually have the potential to make the same amount or more than me monetarily speaking and I have never once had to slow myself down for her or find her boring.\n\n\nSo. The two types can get along very well. Just be aware that their shadow is an esfp so don’t catch yourself with an unhealthy one and expect to get along. 
8	My sister is an INTJ. We liked similar video games, played similar board games (Mastermind was a huge favorite of ours), liked similar books, etc. \n\nINTJs are pretty socially insecure imo and tend toward social anxiety. We ENTJs are good at making them feel understood and valued. Their competence and prolonged enjoyment of tedious little details are appreciated by us. 
6	> Naturally, I ran away and now am over analyzing what that interraction was all about.\n\nLOL. INTP.\n
4	I know three confirmed INTJs.  \n\nThe first is the person who got me thinking more about MBTI.  As we were chatting about random life stuff, friends lost, careers, etc., he asked my type.  I had always tested ENTJ, but never really looked into it much.  We've had some rather interesting conversations, usually at events, which both of our very social ENFP spouses were taking part in.  Once we got to know each other, we'll make a point of hanging out and have deep conversations about random musings.  I think part of what bonds us is our heightened sense of ethics.  I've half jokingly asked him to be my life coach.  \n\nThe second is married to one of my professional mentors of sorts, and she's in her 60s.  I've got to know her through discussions about politics, and learned that we were practically neighbors, so now we invite each other over for drinks and such.  She's sort of typically quiet about herself, but an artist, very intelligent, and can be opinionated at times.  I really like her.  It's odd how I've ended up with more friends I hang out with in their 60s than my own age (early 40s).\n\nThe third is a former male coworker in his late 20s.  Because my superiors are not very welcoming people, I sort of make a point of being the welcome wagon, at least for newly hired employees who appear to need "welcoming" until they get settled.  IMO, the way to scare a new employee off right away is to make them think that nobody wants them there.  \n\nMost of the lower level females in the office were confused by this guy because he's very physically good-looking, but so quiet and antisocial that he more or less doesn't speak unless spoken to (except with me).  They blew him off as awkward and unintelligent.  They were very wrong.  \n\nWe got to know one another because we got stuck in a car together driving to/from a conference.  If I'm in a vehicle with someone, I do not handle awkward silence very well, so I start with my list of "get to know you" questions tucked in my back pocket.  I didn't know his type till months later when he asked me to write a reference letter in response to particular questions asked by his potential employer.  I knew exactly why he was leaving after such a short time, and I knew the place he was interviewing would value someone like him, so I'd like to think my reference letter helped get him the job by emphasizing his INTJ strengths, while somewhat eloquently suggesting they not confuse his introversion as aloofness.  We've kept in touch, and when I attended a party at he and his wife's home, observed that many of their friends are also much older.  We're both really into shaping the built environment, so we have interesting brainstorming sessions on how to go about certain projects, real and dreamed up. \n\nTwo of the people above are married to attorneys, and one is an attorney themselves.  None of them intimidate me because frankly nobody really intimidates me.  Also, I smile at people I like and respect.  I go between RBF and being called "smiley," with nothing in between.          
4	INTp is INTJ in socionics\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know this isn't what you asked but I like ENTJs, we get along. I feel like there's a mutual understanding and acceptance. I appreciate their public dynamism and I feel like they're really listening and "getting it" when I'm saying something.
1	My SO is a male INTJ. I don’t think we ever intimidated each other. We were interested in learning more about each other, and our similarities made spending time together easy. 
10	ENTJ [M] going too fast in relationship with ENFP [F]	Hi guys. ENFP here, F, 28, currently dating an ENTJ, M, 27.\n\nWe kicked it off quite rapidly, both being extremely communicative and humorous. We both lived abroad so we know how it is to live in a different culture and, thus, are more open to things in general.\n\nHowever, I feel like he’s going quite fast and I’m curious if it’s a normal thing you guys do.\n\nFor instance, 5 days after meeting each other he invited me to go on a trip with his coworkers. I said yes, cause why not, I like trips. 10 days in, he asked me if I wanna go on a longer trip next summer. That sounded nice but we’ve just met and who knows what happens until the summer. Then he asked me about NYE, if I wanna spend it with his coworkers. I haven’t even met them and the place was definitely not my style. I was honest about it, and he agreed that if I come up with smth more fun we can do that.\n\nMy name day is coming up soon, we’re 2 weeks in, he asked me what I want and I said that I want nothing. That’s what I usually answer cause I don’t need material things tbh. He then told me something along the lines of: ‘hey, we’re gonna give each other a lot of gifts from now on, so I might as well find out what you like now’ at which point I kinda felt the need to tell him I thought it’s going a little fast. He then asked me where I see myself in 5 years. As an ENFP, I obviously have no plans, especially not 5yo ones. He told me his plans are to own a house, own a company, have a wife and kids. To be exact, have a kid by 30, so in 3 years.\n\nI kind of feel like he ‘recruited’ me in order to have his plans on point. It just feels a bit too abrupt. I also feel like we completely skipped the getting to know each other better phase, which is also the fun, exciting dating phase and we’re basically acting like we’re engaged or smth, which totally turns me off. He’s updating me about EVERYTHING he’s doing: going to work, coming back from work, cooking, cleaning, eating, etc, which I find a bit too much. I see he’s expecting the same of me, and I’m not used to that at all.\n\nI’m just wondering if this is normal or not for ENTJs. And if not, what’s the best way to explain stuff to him. I guess he’d understand, but I have no idea how to put things in perspective.\n\nSometimes he calls me childish because I am not as disciplined as he is or because I don’t have plans in general, but I find him childish in another sense. For instance, he also invited me to go to his office party, and I told him that would probably be inappropriate since office parties are for people working in the same company to bond and whatnot, to which he agreed and said ‘actually, my colleagues are not bringing they partners either.’ Duh.\n\nAny opinions on this? I know ENTJs are quite decisive in everything they do, but does this seem too much?\n\nTLDR: ENFP girl feels ENTJ goes way too fast. Is it normal and, if not, how to put it nicely?
14	I dated a guy like this once. He love bombed me and then disappeared on me as quickly as he came on as soon as I let my guard down.\n\n  \nHe calls you childish, has planned out your life for you (?), and is pretty much calling dibs on you with all this advanced planning.  \n\n\nEither he's just really really into you or there's something there beyond MBTI. I'd definitely have a discussion with him about how it's going far too fast and that you'd like to slow down. If he doesn't like that because you're not going along with what he's planned, maybe you're not meant to be a part of his plan. Just a thought.
11	How about you \n\n_wait for it_\n\ncommunicate all that to him
6	social retardation ≠ xNTJ
7	There somethings (mostly the 5 year plan) that, I as a female ENTJ definitely do. But that's the only thing I can relate with 😂🤣😂🤣\n\nYou are right, he seems more to be into accomplishing his goals than interested in you.\nBUT I wouldn't throw the towel yet. Talk to him about your fears, actually tell him what you just wrote on this post. If you guys can't have a honest conversation, then you have another proof that he might not be a match for you
6	This is my boyfriend and my relationship to a T. I’m also ENxP and he’s ENTJ. I just read this post to him because it’s so accurate and we are laughing so hard. Honestly I’ve been wondering if it was normal. Thank you so much for posting this and helping me communicate this to him as well as validating my experience 
5	You described perfectly everything I did wrong with this exact relationship. This is classic ENFP x ENTJ. It is what it is. Yes, tell exactly what you wrote to him.\n\nYou made my day. Best post on reddit in a while. I'm laughing at myself. (still 25, so 5 years until 30 for at least 1 kid 😂) 
5	It’s normal for us to some extent. That doesn’t mean it’s normal for you or that you should go with it just because it’s “normal” for us. It might be mind blowing for him at first but try and explain to him that just because you don’t have a 5 year plan doesn’t make you childish, it just means you value freedom. Your brain works differently than his and that’s okay! Try and explain to him that things are moving a little fast for you and maybe you could slow things down. He’s a thinker so come up with some logical way to explain what you’re feeling and he might be more receptive to it.

2	Oh wow girl, this is exactlyyyy like me (ENFP) and my boyfriend (ENTJ)\n\nHe told me he loved me the first day we started dating. .\_. ......I told him "No you don't, but we will work on it". Also I think its an ENTJ thing to nitpick on something that we have to 'improve' (like when he called you childish). And he's done that to his exes about their careers and making plans etc. But with me, he doesn't have to, since I'm very career driven, and a planner (even though I'm enfp, I just don't stick with the schedule many times HAHA) so he chose to nitpick my looks. =\_= and my body weight.. even though I am a size XS and I've been a hair model before. So basically, there's nothing wrong with you. Tell him to go chew on a sock.

3	Auxiliary Ni vs Auxiliary Si	Lately I've been questioning my type as I decided to adress once and for all my confusion about whether or not I'm ESTJ or ENTJ.\n\nI do have dominant Te and inferior Fi, that's for sure, but what really confuses me is which functions I use as auxiliary and tertiary, because I have no idea if I use Ni-Se or Si-Ne.\n\nSo, what would be the key points to differ one another?\n\nI'm asking here because since it is the ENTJ forum, I'll compare myself to Te-Ni users to see how much I identify with them.\n\nThx in advance xD 
3	This post is pretty good:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/679ky3/differentiating_estj_vs_entj_masterpost/
3	I think the best way to actually see the difference between Si-Ne and Ni-Se is to look at Si drivers (ISxJs) and Ni drivers (INxJs) if you know any - particularly the thinking versions. A good heuristic would be finding the IxTJ interaction that you feel easiest and most natural to you. The way it can manifest in ExTJs is a lot harder to see as external behavior can very similar due to both driving with Te. If the ExTJ is reasonably well developed, they might be able to consciously articulate the deeper reasoning to their behavior rather than "because it works".\n\nFor a more abstract description, the way I like to look at internal perceiving functions is that they compare "things". The things being either sensory experience (Si) or conceptual/abstract ideas (Ni). This comparison means that Si users are sensitive to physical changes and Ni users are sensitive to conceptual changes. \n\nThe way that Ni works for me is that it is a web of ideas, models and concepts. I can immediately see when things represent the same conceptual idea and "pivot" across that. If something is conceptually different I look to compare the aspects of similarity and differences and look to understand why. I then build models of why that is the case through the web of ideas and expand upon that web. I realize this might be super abstract and I'm not giving an example... but hey, that's where I prefer to start with. A very typical trait of Ni - start with the big picture, the ideas, and draw down from that. If you want, feel free to ask me to "look" at something.\n\nMy dad is an ESTJ. He more readily understands the necessity for stability - the reason for tradition and why things are done the way they are. He looks to solve sensory problems... In contrast, I look to solve conceptual problems. He would say I'm quite odd and focus on weird things but I seem to achieve results in ways he never could. And there's a respect there. As I get older I'm beginning to value his way of thinking too. The stability aspect. The need to "not push" on things. A sort of contentedness in the moment. In the now. An ability to be more happy for oneself.\n\nI realise you asked for key points. I thought I'd have a crack since no one has answered your question. I could talk about this for hours. *This* idea is at a complex stage where I can't concisely explicate the ideas.\n\nPS: It might be good for you to look at your tertiary function too. Look at your looping behavior and how you relax.
2	The big difference between me and my ESTJ friend is that I can "replay" conversations and memories in my head... She cannot do that at all. She forgets some plans we make and conversations we have. I sometimes will repeat herself back to her, and then she will remember our discussion. \n\nShe is also into holidays and decorating for their own sake - I find all of that stuff to be "sentimental bullshit" ... It's cute but not something I would spend any time or money on unless I had a specific reason (e.g. having a holiday themed party). Of course my house looks adorable otherwise, just not seasonally decorated usually.\n\nShe is ALWAYS early. I prefer to be exactly on time. If I say 8, I mean 8. If she says 8, she means 7:45.\n\nShe is hilarious and much better with S's than me.\n\nOh and this one is big: she always goes to bed on time, which is 10pm. I... don't. 
2	I'm wondering the same thing! 
1	i went between the two for a while. decided i had Ni when i realized that some of the things i think are absolute nonsense

3	Whatsapp International Group for MBTI	Greetings, fellow ENTJs! \n\nMe, along with an ENFP and an ENTP have created a pretty cool Whatsapp group. It's a very active group and it's super fun! Everyone is hilarious and very friendly. It's equal number Thinkers/Feelers. We lucked out with a very interesting people's community and will be cool to have more similar minded people like ourselves on there :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://chat.whatsapp.com/Ey15CEhWJag1Q1sstl8IrA](https://chat.whatsapp.com/Ey15CEhWJag1Q1sstl8IrA)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS: If you're unable to add yourself (Apple users?), PM me your number and I will add you :)

10	Where does an ENTJ's goals come from, function wise?	From what I can gather, INTJs come up with their goals through a mix of Ni (seeing possibilities) and Fi (the actual "I want it" part), and use Te as a tool to accomplish them.\n\nBut, an ENTJ has Te as the dom function, and Fi as the inferior function. So, how does that work, exactly?
23	In my opinion an ENTJ's goals are the result of the Te-Ni feedback loop. It's very easy for us to identify inefficiencies and areas where things aren't working. When things don't work, it is infuriating to us. We generally want to correct this stuff and improve our lives, as well as the lives of our colleagues and others, where possible.\n\nOur goals aren't driven by what we want (Fi), they're driven by our profound frustration at everything that isn't working (Ni) and our innate desire to make it work (Te).\n\nTL;DR: It's less about what we want, and more about quenching our rage at the stupidity of the world.
2	I think any well-developed ENTJ will recognize that their goals come from Fi very deep within themselves. Fi gives us the “why” behind the things we do: why we work aggressively and efficiently for 10 hours a day, why we pursue upper levels of leadership/management, etc. Ultimately, it comes down to recognizing our internal value system. \n\nHere’s a good example. My school’s superintendent is so stereotypically ENTJ it’s not funny (always talking about self improvement books, how to create efficiency in life, striving to move teams towards goals, etc). Sure, most of his job is spent using his Te-Ni strengths by setting long-term institutional goals and moving teams to meet them within our school district. But, at the end of the day, deep down, his main motivation is his realization of the value that education brings, to kids, our community, our teachers, etc. In that sense, Fi sort of grounds us firmly to our goals. I think ENTJs need to find their why that motivates them deeply to do things. 
20	Females ENTJs and relationships?	So I am a female ENTJ in my 20s and I have read up on ENTJ trends with relationships and they seem to be too selective and detached. Are there any ENTJ females with successful relationships that should shed some light on what I can look for in a partner? Or any guy who was/are with an ENTJ female that could give me insight on what works and what doesn’t? 
11	Well, I really wanted to see someone's response but I guess I'll try.\n\nAs a female ENTJ, yes, I am very selective and  nonsense but I like that about myself because I don't want to settle in my relationships. I am very happy signle and unless I am in a healthy partnership, there is no point for me being with someone.\nI am currently on a very happy relationship where we respect each other mutually and we were clear about our expectations.\nBeing selective does require patience and real belief in yourself but it it pays off!\n\n
8	i find someone who is the opposite (more laid back, passive, sensitive and better at expressing their emotions) and it helps to balance out things 
7	I think too selective should not be confused with high standards. ;)\n
5	My good ENTJ friend casually dated half the population in our city until she was 28, she met an ENTP and they got engaged after about 11 months because he knew she was moving. He is a great match for her. I think she was having fun until she saw someone she could be serious with, and then switched into that mindset. Based on my observation of her, I’d say just don’t compromise your standards. You will meet someone who is a good match for you.
2	My wife and I (30s ⚢) pair up really well. I was an awkward brain in high school when we met, she was one of the top female athletes at her school. (Basketball and wrestling, the stereotypes are true.)\n\nI think what makes us click so well is our ENTJ-ISFP dual structure. I think it's dangerous to let two people handle totally different sides of their common life and try to reconcile it all in the wash between them. That's not what we do.\n\nIt seems like we have very similar concepts of how we want things. We just have totally different ways of going about it. We somehow achieve unity of purpose and diversity of means.\n\nI think some of it can be put down to our common Te-Fi axis values, but a lot of that has likely been shaped by common life experience since childhood (queer alienation).\n\nWeirdly enough this is one place to defer logical analysis of a partner: try and find a partner who inspires you from your Fi, and then use your Te/Ni to make sure you are yourself growing in a way that you want to. Find a long term relationship that seems to be a unity of you and your partner's mission.
2	I'm in my early 40s, and have been with my ENFP husband for nearly 20 years.  Though, we didn't get married for about 5 years, and didn't have children (we have two kids who are close in age) till we were together over 10 years.  We wanted to get the travel bug and all that good stuff out of our systems, but now that the kids are getting old enough, we're back to doing all those things again, just in a different manner.\n\nFor us, we're exact opposites, but very similar.  He's emotional; I'm not.  I'm a planner; he's not.  We balance each other out.  I take care of finances and big picture items, and he keeps me grounded.  There are things about him that drive me bonkers, like his lack of organization and attention to detail, but because he's so great in other areas, I overlook those things.  Nobody is perfect, no matter how much I want them to be.  Every relationship takes work.\n\nWhen we first met, we had each dated many people, and I was very straight forward with what I wanted and didn't want.  Mainly, I refused to date a man who had a problem with me having male friends.  My closest friend at the time was a guy, and I suppose due to my personality, I tend to get along with men better than women.  Not that I don't have female friends, but I tend to gravitate towards men because there's less drama.  This worked out perfectly for my husband because his best friend at the time was a female (though we later learned that she was actually in love with him, so though we stay in touch with her, she's no longer his best friend).\n\nThe thing is, we respect one another, and give each other plenty of space to do our own thing.  Though, we also love hanging out one on one, and attend a lot of events together.  We actually attend so many group events that our "date nights" often involve dressing up, going somewhere, splitting up to work the room (he talks to everyone, and I talk to one person -- or everyone, if I feel like it), then joining back up at some point.\n\nHe does things on his own, and as long as he doesn't abuse certain boundaries (which he has tested before, i.e., going out drinking all night with friends repeatedly, while we had toddlers at home, and not telling me where he is), it's all good.  My one firm rule is that I can't stand liars, and he knows if he lies to me, it's over.  Communication is key.\n\nWe're also both dreamers, though I'm more of an implementer of our dreams than he is.  We can spend hours drinking wine and staring at the stars having long conversations about anything and everything.  We've started two businesses together.  He's a great manager of people and customers, and I'm a great business planner and financial analyst, so it's worked out.  We've had some business disputes in the past, but it was mostly along the lines of him refusing to fire people, and me having to force the issue from an unbiased point of view.\n\nBasically, we are intellectually equals and generally agree on big picture values.
2	I am a female ENTJ and I have been with my husband (also an ENTJ) for roughly 7 years now. We feel so bonded, like what we imagine soulmates should be. We get what we need out the relationship and are always on the same page for the major decisions. For when we disagree on the small stuff, we rationally talk through it and usually come to a mutual agreement in the end.\n\nThere is a lot of love in the relationship and we always support each others goals. If we have the same one, we are quite the force to go up against.\n\nWe honestly can't imagine our lives without each other (even though we know we don't need each other).
3	I'm a male ENTJ, my wife is an ESFJ. She is perfect. We both complement each other because in short, she gives me wake up calls to life, while I give her self-confidence and help her convert sadness into logical solutions. We both like to talk to people, share stories, we have similar hobbies but we are not so similar in, well... you understand. Here's the thing, I wouldn't be able to have much fun in life if she wasn't this way and if she was too much like me it would probably make me feel miserable because I need to be in charge of my strengths to feel good about myself. 
1	Engaged female ENTJ, fiancé is and ISTP. When I first met him I knew I was going to marry him. I agree with the previous comment of being intellectual equals. Smartness is something that’s very important to me. But my istp is smart in a different way (he’s a mechanical genius and I’m book smart). I definitely like that he’s a thinker and not a feeler. Although this does cause some head butting sometimes I find it much easier for both of us to be straightforward and honest with each other because neither of us is scared to hurt the others feelings. He’s a mess around the house but I can live with that. We’ve worked out a system of which areas of the house are his alone (and messy) and communal space which is kept clean. I definitely drive him nuts sometimes with my never ending need for “intuitive” abstract conversation and questions but he’s very good at humouring me. Bottom line though is whatever type you end up with, make sure to try and understand their type as best you can and it will help with communication down the road. Also build an underlying best friendship with that person and when the communication breaks down, work on your friendship. 
1	I am a female ENTJ in my mid 20s with a boyfriend who is an ISTJ. We share a lot of hobbies and he is super smart, so I find him a very engaging person to be around. I think he finds my gregariousness and natural will to lead a good counterpart to his calmer/detail orientated side.\n\nI had about a three year gap between him and my previous relationship though, so I mirror what others have said that it takes us a long time to find someone who we connected with + someone it's worth putting time and effort into.
1	Female ENTJ (in my 30s) married to a male ENFJ for 8 years (total length of relationship is 11 years).\n\nI’ve always had high standards and had trouble taking relationships seriously when I was younger.\n\nAs I’ve gotten older I’ve realized that people are always going to be flawed (including myself). At the end of the day you need to find someone you not only love, but truly respect and like because love and passion isn’t always enough. My husband and I have had hard times (and many many great times too) but I always realize how much I like and respect him and that’s what keeps us going. \n\nAs you navigate the dating world remember it’s ok to have high expectations and be selective. Just remember people are human and no one is ever going to be without fault. Look for people you like and admire. \n\n
1	Female ENTJ in her late twenties here. I’m the definition of man-crazy, but I’m also the image of unsuccessful relationships. I enjoy being alone and not having any attachments that might defocus me from my professional goals. Relationships do not last long for me, but I’m happy the way I am. I just need people who understand that level of freedom. Also, I’m a flirt but totally emotional inexpressive. I see a lot of success stories on the thread so I suppose I’m an outlier.

12	what kind of humour do you have?	hey, i was thinking what kind of humour different types have. i find my humour is usually pretty dry, ironic or extremely sarcastic  how about you? 
10	[deleted]
8	Juicy . Expressive . Laughter that is contagious.  Also my laugh is more funnier than the joke type of humour 
7	Witty quips and various faces. Dry dry humor too
3	all of the above
13	An overwhelming majority of people do not get my jokes. Because they are dumb.
5	None
2	I’m a storyteller, usually with lots of gesturing. I’m a ‘walk around/act things out/hands talker’ type for sure.\n\nI also tend toward pithy observations. 
4	Funny is generally not fun for me. Useful or enlightening is more enjoyable.\n\nPuns, can be enjoyable. The absurd might get a cheap laugh, but really I don’t enjoy laughter half so much as thought provoking stuff that makes you see something in a new way, especially if that new way is revealing something useful, or moral.\n\nI like it when I have to think about it but once I figure it out it makes clear sense. “What is a truly basic poison? Sodium, pure and simple” note: not the best, but gave me a smile the first time I got it.
1	Ditto for having a sarcastic and dry humour!\n\nI love dark, deadpan jokes towards myself and making a monster out of myself.\n\nFor the more lighthearted ones I love puns and mixing jargons inside, like in satire shows about politics and news. Maybe a little bit of NSFW stuff inside
17	Do you think ENTJ would be a type who would ignore somebody they dislike to their face/not get uncomfortable and awkward with silence?	In other words let's say you have to deal with some jerk. Would you ignore them to their face? Maybe you work with them. Would ENTJ be the people who smooth things over/try to be logical or would they just ignore?\n\n\n\nWhat happens when the ENTJ decides the person is a lost cause and useless?
20	I do both, depending on who. I don't feel awkward and uncomfortable with silence. I end things pretty quickly or make my intentions clear from the outset.\n\nUsually, I tend to be just polite in a detached way. I acknowledge them if they see and recongise me. After all, I have control over my behaviour - I don't want it to reflect poorly on me. I usually just say hey and exchange pleasantries but smooth things over and finish the encounter after just a sentence or two.\n\nSometimes if I see the other person in the distance, I walk out of their pathway. They either don't notice or it's a clear message that I would rather be getting on with other things and they aren't a priority to me.\n\nIf I really don't like them (because they've been especially unkind towards me - I have a pretty high tolerance, so this would be rare) even if they enter the room I avert my gaze sideways to avoid eye contact with them. That's pretty clear and intentional. 
9	When I deem someone a lost cause or not worth my time, I stop engaging with them. I am not uncomfortable with silence, so I do tend to just move on with my life like they don’t exist. If I have to work with them, I am polite and interact as needed, but not much more.
4	I remove myself from their presence. They do not deserve my person in their life. 
2	If I have decided you’re a lost cause, I will limit my interactions with you to the bare necessities. I’ll be pleasant/civil, but the smile won’t reach my eyes, if you know what I mean.\n\nI can and have absolutely looked straight through people as if they don’t exist when I have decided they were no longer worth my time, but it takes a lot to get me there.\n\nI don’t dislike very many people, but I know it’s *very* obvious when I do. I find they just tend to do the work for me by avoiding me, which I am absolutely fine with.
1	Yeah if i dont like them a lot. If i have to interact with them then i would be more polite. 
9	What you were like in high school?	Describe yourself.
26	Insufferable
16	Well known, yet not belonging to any group by choice\nHence, a floater. \nKnew both “popular” group and the “smart kids” because I was in all the highest academic classes but was also varsity athlete (“popular group”) \nExtracurriculars, was involved enough to put on my resume, yet in high school didn’t seek leadership positions. I have in college, and have a leadership position in every extracurricular I am involved in to help me stand out for my pre-med application. \n\nI was always very well dressed and put together everyday in high school. I don’t wear jeans or “real clothes” for class in college, but always do have on cute athletic lulu. \n\nEdit: friendly with everyone, but upon analysis, most people were not truly good friends, hence why I did not seek to become confined into a “group”. I usually would have a good friend who I would bring with my floating, but usually would change every year of who that was. I am not very attached to people. They seem to be more attached to me. 
11	Constantly getting detention and suspensions for being an absolute little shit to any teacher who didn't meet my standards of what I thought a good teacher should be. The thing is that I also handed in impeccable work, though sometimes it was just to spite the teachers. I acted similarly in detention, following every rule but making them backfire on the people in charge. I generally did a lot of things that I knew would upset authority figures but that I also knew I couldn't get punished for.\n\nI was also kicked out of two AP courses sophomore year and was still the only one in each class to pass the AP exam.\n\nI had no friends because I was fucking crazy, but I was really lonely so I tried to interact with people by leading classroom uprisings. It didn't really work...
9	Alone.
14	I went to an all boys school. I was popular but I was friendly with everyone who wasn’t as popular. I had friends in every social group. I defended people who were getting bullied and wasn’t a dick generally. 
5	Im still in high school but I would say that I am good friends with a lot of the smart kids since I am in a lot of their classes. My best friends and i are in our own "clique" but we are also in another big group of friends. \n\nMost of my time is spent on my extracurriculars or studying. I would say high school is kinda boring for me and im just looking forward to coege. Its just a lot of grind and some of its fun but some of it is boring. Im also super into music which i dont think is very "entj" like but its one of my focuses in high school. 
5	Stoned, bored, constantly in trouble with zero consequences because I had straight A’s. Rebel. Read a lot. Not many friends. \n\nAlso captain of the debate club. 
4	Really depressed and isolated. \n\nI didn’t feel emotional attachment to most people so constantly fleeted from friend to friend. I was one of those people who was well known but didn’t know anyone ig. I was surprised when some stranger would know my name / stories about me bc I didn’t pay attention to anyone so didn’t understand why they would pay attention to me. \n\nIronically my current group of friends is the one I got close to during the last two trimesters. 
3	EGO
1	I was a loner as it pertains to the other high schoolers. However, I talked with staff members, the lunch workers, teachers, & janitors constantly. All the others my age were boring. But I found all the adults interesting and I felt like the conversations were real, where as with students, it was mostly just, typical late 90's, graduating in 2000 high schooler stuff.
1	Quiet(er), intelligent, rebellious of authority figures, didn’t apply myself to the fullest but still got good grades, loved debate club. 
1	Proudly weird, argumentative, rough around the edges.
31	100% or 0%	As a lot of you probably recognize that we have a hard time doing something 50%. It feels unnessecary, either we do it as good as possible or not at all. \n\nThis doesn't only apply to effort, for me at least. I can't study and take breaks, I cant do my homework if I have in the back of my head that I need to go to bed soon, I don't feel like doing things like exercising/meditating etc if i don't do them every day. This probably has to do with ENTJ's being bad with routine. \n\nI can only reach that ENTJ-drive to work if I stop caring about going to sleep at the right time, if i don't take breaks and let myself study for 4 hours in a row. If I can focus on doing chores one thing at a time it feels more like I'm doing it 100%, and that motivates me to do it. \n\nIf I never needed to sleep/eat things would feel much better and I would get much more work done because then I have less things on my mind. Not because I would save time, because I wouldn't have to use my energy to switch from work-mode to eat-mode to work-mode to sleep-mode.\n\nWhats your take on this?
12	Allow yourself to reason the following:\n\nWhen it is time to work, work.\n\nWhen it is time to rest, rest.\n\nWhen it is time to eat, eat.\n\nWhen it is time to exercise, exercise.\n\nWhen it is time to meditate, meditate.\n\nWhen it is time to love, love.\n\nWhen it is time to play, bring the house down.\n\nDo each of those at 100%, they all contribute to a healthy human, and your 100% will somehow, across the board, go further than it did before.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe simplest way (in concept, its fucking difficult really) to do the things you know you should do is to bind them to your identity.\n\nFor instance, I have words in my identity like - "I am the kind of person that is always learning something." And now, I can't sit and watch TV because that's time I could be learning something, ANYTHING, to make me a better human (i.e. crochet, I do mean learning anything). So if the entertainment isn't teaching me something I find it hard to sit still and do it. For instance I do watch e-sports as entertainment because I learn from their decision making process and that seems to not betray my identity.\n\nAnother of mine - "I am an artist" - originally words based on Seth Godin's concepts in Linchpin - artist more meaning artisan in the IT industry, someone who can create something from nothing. Now after 12 months I'm morphed into a quite competent painter (@themattdavis on IG if you want to see what I mean and the growth, every painting along the way). Lesson - beware your reprogramming haha.\n\nThe next one I'm going to build in was from the lady who started the Whole 30 movement - "I am a healthy person". This is more holistic than food and exercise, it's all facets of my health.
9	I often find myself getting impatient with having to go to the bathroom, sleep, or make food. It's so bothersome and such an interruption. But I think this is a pretty funny thing also, since I'm forgetting a very key limiting factor: I'm human. I'm human! I factually cannot continue a lifestyle where I don't accommodate the needs of my flesh prison. It is a fact and every time I ignore it, I pay for it. Whenever I stay up too late or don't take my medication or don't exercise, then I and my work suffer in the future. \n\nBe a bro to your future self! \n\nAlso, as I've aged, I've realized that details are unfortunately much much more important than I previously thought. I am so much more patient with those little tedious tasks and doing things as perfectly as possible now that I know that they often have major payouts over time. I am at my worst in the middle of a task, however, so I need to build my enthusiasm back up like it was when I started. The way I do that is to break down everything I accomplished before that, to admire how much I've done, to feel good that I've stayed with things so far, and to accept that I will have to be bored and uncomfortable for a little bit (BUT this part will change eventually!)
9	Your inferior Fi is showing. Fi finds all kinds of reasons to justify idleness.
5	For me, it turns into being bad at long-term projects. I can't do a project at 60% for a month, I have to do it in spurts of 100%. 
5	> If I never needed to sleep/eat things would feel much better\n\nI also think that doing the things that keep me alive and healthy is such a pain in the ass. \n\nI'm not saying that sarcastically, I really get annoyed by mealtimes and bedtimes and wake times... and add in a spouse who wants to do certain things at certain times, UGH. UGH!!! \n\nRight around "bedtime" I'd prefer to crank up some music and go tear up my office, that's when i'm motivated to do paperwork stuff like filing and data entry...its like the only time i can focus because i don't have to cook to feed him, or myself.  But my husband gets so mad when it's 4am and I finally want to sleep and me getting to bed wakes him up.\n\nI love him, I adore him, he's everything that's good in the world... but i don't think i'm supposed to be married and living full time with someone else.
3	> study for 4 hours in a row.\n\nYour neurons may vary, but I sometimes find long stretches of studying counter-productive.\n

7	No long term goals	My motivation goes to -1 without a goal. I just scroll through reddit and analyze myself to learn enough to set a goal lmao. It's very hard. I become a different person when I have a defined goal, becoming almost a freight train of effort.\n\nHow did you define a long term goal without second guessing? If I have no long term goal it feels like putting work into anything at all is simply meaningless, as without the long term goal I'm listless like right now. I want money but I also want to make an impact, but if everything is meaningless why achieve anything? I can help people surely, and plan to, but what about just something I want to achieve for my own sake? Why do anything at all? Nothing seems to give me pleasure without a long term goal because without a goal I obsessively analyze to find the goal. This takes me out of the present moment and tints all of my experiences negatively, thinking "im wasting time"

2	What do you want out of life? Why do you want that?
1	Where are you in your life? High school? College? Grad School? Work?\n\nWhat are your talents? What do you suck at? Do you have any negative memories that just won't go away?\n
1	Dude. So much of this for me.
1	Break down into shorter terms achievements, things in your reach or nearby. It's the way to connect with long-term ambitious goals.
1	The older I get the more I realize the randomness of life.  I actually don't have that many long term goals.  Mainly they are all process driven, so I can do something about them today.  Such as the gym, reading, etc.  \n\nI'd focus more on what you want out of life, then figure out what you can do about it today & make sure you do whatever that is everyday. At that point I almost think it's safe to forget about the goal.  If you stay the course, you should in theory surpass the goal.
1	"No long term goals" is all I needed to see.\n\nThink of something you want more than anything else in the whole entire world. Whatever that is, start working towards it. What's your 5 year plan? Screw that, what's your 50 year plan! What do you want to see happen before you go out. I'm absolutely fucking nuts, and what I want to do personally, is change the question from "What do you want to do with the time you have" to "How much time do you want in the first place." If you want to see it all, then humanity should be working towards that!\n\nIt's a nice idea, but it's more than idea. Things are happening right now that are going to change a lot, some in the very near future. Look up biological immortality, stem cell research, telomere extension, dna manipulation, gene therapy, Aubrey De Grey, Dr David Sinclair, Zoltan Istvan, Dmitry Itskov and the 2045 initiative, Bio mechanically engineering new organs based on your own DNA so you don't have to have your immune system suppressed when getting an organ transplant, Reversing the dna damage over time of cells in mice (Dr David Sinclair, March 2017) Reversing the aging of Human cells in a lab (University of Exeter, UK, August 2018) What's coming is absolutely insane, & it's going to be awesome!
15	ENTJ and Athletics	I keep reading about how ENTJs enjoy sports etc but don't really relate to that. I'm more competitive in academic pursuits and usually if I'm indulging in my Se, it's more playful not competitive.\n\nFor example joining a dance club,  play fighting with my cousins,  painting, or indulging in fashion. I generally feel uncomfortable competing in Se things because it's more of a way to express emotion.  Does this indicate inferior Se instead of tertiary?
9	I'm not really that into sports, either. Seems like a distraction from more important matters, to me. I paid more attention to sports when I was younger, but I've been focusing more on self improvement as I've gotten older.
6	Playing a musical instrument will do wonders for your Se and Fi :)\n\nI consider Se to be my stress-reliever function.
4	I’m an ENTJ and student athlete in college and I relate to this. In terms of athletics I never found myself being that competitive, but when it comes to academics I was much more competitive and not just only with myself but with my peers as well. 
4	everything is contextual. no point in this generalization . if you can farsee progression in sports, u do sports. everyt decision is pragmatic for a TJ, 
3	Happy cake day! Eat some sweets.
3	Not everyone is the same. For myself I enjoy athletics, but I'm also always seeking optimization for health and fitness purposes. I do the bare minimum for maximum cardiovascular benefit, and then the rest is for pleasure.
3	I did sports in high school and college and I miss it. I do running, but it's not the same. I am very competitive when it comes to everything though. 
2	I like watching sports and athletic men. That's about it. 
1	I participated in two sports a season growing up, and if they didn’t have a team for girls, I enjoyed playing with/competing against the boys. Then I played pro ball for a while.\n\nI do not have time to be as active now, and I do miss it. However, I do understand that a lot of people don’t place a ton of importance on sports, and that’s fine; everyone is different — even within the same personality type.
0	DO BETTER - Speech by Tyrese Gibson - "Your pride and ego is out of fucking control!"	
0	I try to keep my ego in check hard, but it slips out. There are people who just rub me the wrong way, and I want to give that attitude back. That's not productive, that won't lead to anywhere good. As Jocko says, have to lead both up and down the chain of command.

10	Personality types from ENTJ mother	As per another post by nosayhowsay \nIt seemed as many ENTJ’s has ESFP mothers and some kind of ESTJ relation (father, sibling). What children personality types are most common for ENTJ mothers and the personality type of their partners? 
4	I'm an ENTJ and so is my mother, her mother is a INFJ, but her father is an ESFP 
5	I'm fairly certain my mom is an ENTJ as well.
5	My mom is an ISFP, and I border on xNTJ (I’ve tested both ways multiple times)
2	Any type can come from any parent. Anecdotally:\n\nI’m an ENTJ. I suspect my son is an INTx (probably P) I suspect my daughter is an ENFx (probably J).\n\nTheir father is an ENTP.\n\nMy SO is an INTP.
2	Estj mother
1	This subject matter is very interesting to me. I myself do not have an ENTJ mother, but as a parent I have often wondered what effect parental personality types have on their children's personality development. Also, I have a stupid theory that ENTJ often come from family with multiple highly intellegent or high IQ parents or grandparents.
1	me:ENTJ\n\nDad: ENFJ\n\nMom: ISFP\n\nbrother:ESFP\n\nsister: ESFJ
1	I’m an ENTJ and my mom is an ENFJ while my dad was either an ESTJ or ENFP (he never did the test as far as I know and those are the best guesses my brothers and I have made). Two of my brothers are INFPs and the third one never did the test.
1	My aunt is an ENTJ (a pretty scary one lmao)and she has a ESFP daughter and an ISTP son.
1	Im ENTJ male, my Mother is ENFJ, overall we have good communication with each other but sometimes im exausting for her, and she is boring for me. Fe, Te dominant conflict i guess. My Dad is ISTJ, we almost dont talk. My Brother is ESFJ, he is 4 years older and we was alwyas figting because i tried to dominate him since i learned how to talk. When i grew up everything changed, now we can talk a lot because we are both programmers. Overall i noticed that everyone in my family is xxxJ even Mother of my Mother is ISFJ. 
5	Your Family’s personality types?	I am so tired of the feelers in this house, but obviously still care about them since they are family. My sister is INFP and my mom is ISFP. I do get along nicely with my ESTJ brother and dad tho.\n\nWhat’s your family’s personality types and how do you get along with them?
5	My mom is ESFJ and my dad is INTJ (we don’t always  get along so well). Brothers are ESTJ and INTJ. We don’t always see eye to eye.\n\nFamily gatherings are very very boring because the majority of the greater family is “S”. So they titter on and on and on. 
6	ESFP mother, ESTJ father & ISFJ brother. Not too bad. I can clash with them because I'm the only intuitive, though (I 'don't see the point' in a lot of things they do and I can get detached from the real world which pisses them off).\n\nMy mother and I are quite close. I can crack offensive jokes around her and she won't lose her shit like my father (I gotta respect him yknow). I do clash with her regarding her values and all but honestly it doesn't happen often. She also helps me learn a lot about being less of an ass. \n\nMy father and I are (strangely) more distant. He can never give me a proper explanation for why I have to follow his orders (he only ever says "because I'm your father"). He doesn't listen to me. I admire his ability to work with his hands, though. Dude can fix almost everything. He's a good driver, too. At least he doesn't demand for sympathy from me like my mother and brother (especially him).\n\nMy younger brother is always stuck in his own ways so every time I try to help him, he shuns me. I don't want to admit it but it kind of hurts. Now we barely talk and they're all about superficial things.\n\nGuess my ESFP mum's my favourite, weirdly 
5	This post gets asked all the time but I still reply every time...\nINFP younger brother, ISTJ older sister, ISTP dad, ISFJ mom
3	Mother: ESFP\nFather: ESTJ\n\nMy mother is my best friend. Although she is an “FP”, she is very logical when it comes to emotions, though I believe that is due to her rough childhood family life, she is tough. \n\nMy father is so devoted and loving, and also my best friend, but him and I butt heads at times. I don’t think this is purely an ESTJ thing though, because my two other closest friends that are non-family are ESTJ’s. My father and I are just so alike. 
3	My father is an ISTP and my mother an ESFP. He’s always trying something new whether it be cooking, unnecessary house renovations, skateboarding, etc. And she’s always trying to socialize with everyone and fit in to a point it becomes controlling so that you only paint within her lines. \n\nMe being gay, not religious and in college, my dad always supports my decisions because he’s often busy and doesn’t care as long is I’m moving forward. My mother on the other hand is constantly trying to get me to go to church, lying to everyone and herself about how I fit perfectly into her mold of perfection. 
3	Dad INTJ and is quite a social darwinist, thus having mixed feelings about him. He’s knowledgeable and knows a lot, yet extremely cold and sometimes saying heartless things that even an ENTJ shivers.\n\nMom INFJ or ENFJ and while she’s much as altruist, recently heard that she used being very self-centred and selfish in her youth. Very spiritual and willing to sacrifice herself for others.
2	My family is the super typical, cookie cutter white bread type.\n\nESFJ mom, ISTJ dad, ISFJ sister and ISTJ brother.\n\nI’m the only N in my family. \n\nMy mom means well - she’s loving but because she’s always been such a girly girl, she can get a bit irrationally emotional and unable to reason. My dad is a sports watching, beer drinking and domineering head of household type of guy. But he earns good money and deep down he cares about us. My sister is very sweet, kind, loving and compassionate. My brother is pretty chill - very into video games.\n\n
2	INTJ mum, ENTP dad. Easier to talk to dad, but mum gets more work done on the dot. 
2	Mum: ESTJ, Dad: IxTP. Siblings: ENTJ, ESFJ, (me), ENFJ, ENTP. The thinkers all get along, with the feelers overreacting in spectacular fashion, having meltdowns and causing drama. Dad pretty much locks himself in his man cave to get away from all of the extroversion.
1	ABBA, ACDC, ADHD, XKCD
1	Man those infp are useless. The personality is so repulsive to an ENTJ.
1	Mom: ESTP\nDad: emotionally abusive ISFJ\nSisters: ESFP(older), ESTJ(younger)\nBrother: ENFP\n\nI get along with all my siblings and am very close with my mom. I do get frustrated when I think she doesn’t enforce enough structure in the family so I can seem like “the third parent”. I’m most like my youngest sister and can understand her most in the family. My younger ESFP sister and brother think I can be demanding nonetheless they know if I’m acting acting loosey goosey it’s because I’m concerned. \n\nCan’t stand my ISFJ dad though (given he’s unhealthy). I can’t stand the entitlement and self pitying behavior he often has. 
1	Mom: ISFP\n\nDad: INFJ\n\nOlder Sister: INTJ \n\nOlder sister that I treat like my younger sister: INFP\n\nI am starting to type my grandparents and aunts/uncles. I think my dad's mom is an ESFJ, my mom's mom a possible INTP. \n\nYour mom and sister are going to really help to give you feedback on how to interact with Feelers (a large amount of people are feelers, so this is a skill you really need to cultivate). Instead of being annoyed by their complaints, think of ways to work around them so their feelings are considered but you still get what you need as well. You can really pick up a lot of constructive things from them.\n\nAnd even though it may not be financially the best idea... Move out when you can. Your relationships with your family members will improve immensely.
4	How does an ENTJ feel loved, appreciated and valued?	I am an ENFP female dating a male ENTJ. He is hardworking, dedicated, doesn't express emotion unless brought up, etc. \nI am very different. I am extremely sympathetic, love words, touch, feeling loved and needed, etc.\n\nI want to show and remind my ENTJ boyfriend that I love him in other ways than just saying "i love you!" and "I'm thankful for you".\n\nWhat are your tips/tricks? And if you're an ENTJ, how do you feel loved, appreciated and valued?\n\n[He is also enneagram type 1 if this helps anyone]
16	Find out his preferred love languages. Use them.\n\nWhen it comes to verbal affection don't exaggerate, contradict yourself, or otherwise do something that threatens to set off his bullshit detectors.\n\nWhen planning time together, strike a balance between showing initiative of your own and respecting his wants and scheduling. When in doubt, ask to make sure you're not disrupting plans of his.\n\nEven if he isn't very expressive himself he likely notices and appreciates your affection. Let him know when he does something you like so that he can adapt his behavior to you in return.\n\nGood luck.
10	As one myself, we may be different but even so. I suggest you do the little things for him, cook every once in awhile, clean up some mess he made accidently, tidy his bed (I love walking into to my bedroom finding a clean room and made bed.) But another major point. Touch. Granted we are ENTJs, but he's still a male, and a hot blooded one at that. I suggest touching him whenever he's sitting around or enjoying a cup of coffee or even when he's lying down for a nap. He may not be too vocal about it, (ENTJs may have a hard time conveying emotions) but let me tell you, he loves it. 
7	ENFP female dating an ENTJ male so I’m in the same boat as you and still figuring this out lol but my bfs primary love language is acts of service. So he loves it when I notice when he needs to get things done or little chores like cooking for him or cleaning for him. He’s very practical and efficient so he appreciates it when I can practically do something to make his day easier. It doesn’t come easy to me and sometimes feels a little mundane but he really likes it when I go out of my way for him so I’m still learning too. Like he always brings up this one time when he got sick and I put together a sick kit with all these medications in it and cooked him soup. It didn’t feel like much at the time but he loved it. \n\nHope this helps! 
7	Be loyal to us. We are suspicious of most people because they have proven themselves unreliable. Meet our standards. Most people don’t and that leaves us jaded. Shower us with infinite love and warmth.  We forget how wonderful it can be.
4	I am a female ENTJ and I completely agree with the examples given about showing affection through little gestures. Action speaks much louder than words for me.\nAn example: when I have big proposals due at work it's hard for me to keep up with cleaning. I always cook for us (because I enjoy it) but sometimes I just have to leave dirty pans in the sink and run out (I try to always clean dishes as soon as I use them, i really don't like a sink with dirty dished in it). My heart melts when I come home and see that, first he enjoyed my food and cleaned up after me. He always does little things to make my day more efficient and that shows that he really knows me.\nNot to speak for all ENTJs, but at least for me, I really value when my SO showes me that we are a team in this relationship. Thats again speaks louder than anything. 
3	I'm an ENFP and my  boyfriend  is an ENTJ.  I always give him compliments and affection.  But he is more into the little things I do for him . He's into how mature or responsible I am . Let me tell you immaturity can kill the relationship before it even begins . So it's the biggest turn off for him.  \n\nI did childish things or said childish things .. I've realized he's a kid at heart . But he doesn't like it when the situation  is serious  .  It's all about balance. I plan for him something random .sometimes a surprise . Or a surprise trip .. surprise kinky sex ... like just be random and make his day light up . He loves it ❤
1	I am a male ENTJ and for me, my love language is quality time.\n\nI like doing things together, then having those memories tied in with emotion to look back onto.
24	Do you have a tendency to avoid/dislike "needing" people in your life? Why or why not?	
8	I'm wondering what I "need" people for...? If you don't need anyone then how can you tell if you like or dislike needing them?
9	It recently occurred to me that some people totally flip out if you mention you go on holiday, go to the cinema or eat out alone. I wasn't aware it was such a huge taboo to do things without your friends constantly following along. I think it's fine to be with friends, but it's also nice to just be able to be yourself and enjoy things in life your own way sometimes. Maybe it's because I didn't grow up with siblings, but most of the time I don't really have the need to be social that other people do.
4	Yep. Bigtime
4	It actually kind of like it in a strange way. Like finally I'm a normal fucking person. 
3	It depends, do you mean need someone emotionally as in their presence or for a task? Because if it’s a relationship type deal then no because to get to the point where I need someone, I trust that person and have kept them in my life in close proximity for enough time to know they’re worth whatever negative temporary emotions may pass by. 
3	<div class="md"><p>I can be a bit over-the-top when it comes to my independence and my ability to solve problems without help. It has become more apparent over the years that it is actually more productive and efficient to allow people to help me to solve problems and just generally get things done though. Especially when I know what each person&#39;s special skills and abilities are. Lol. Sometimes I think I sound like a sociopath. As far as relationships go I need my wife badly, she brings everything that I lack to the table. I don't like to admit it but it is kinda nice to need someone so long as they need me as well.
3	yes 
2	Ohhh, yeah. Big time. Needing other people is weakness and I’d rather chew broken glass than ‘need’ someone like that.\n\nIn theory it’s good: I’m self sufficient and don’t expect others to do things for me; I keep people in my life because I *want* them there, not because I need them.\n\nIn practice though it’s...not so great, because (a) I’m a woman and men tend to like feeling needed—and intimidated by not being needed—and (b) it’s hard to have close relationships if you refuse to ever lean on the other person. \n\nI have tried a bunch of things to ‘fix’ it but it really is a deeply wired aversion
1	Why need others when you have yourself?

20	What is Depressed ENTJ like	Someone suggested that I might have been depressed for most of my life, and that had caused some difficulty with being discovering I was ENTJ. What does depression look like with an ENTJ? 
22	I’m bipolar, and when I’m in a depressive episode  I just become type B rather than type A. I have the same desires to complete tasks, but no drive or motivation.  I’ll make a plan and see my goal and just not follow through.\n\nWhen I’m manic I almost become ENTP like. I can’t keep track of all my thoughts and I become increasingly existential and impulsive. \n\nI find it very interesting how mental illness changes the types. I would love for a study to be done so I could see some data. \n
10	[removed]
8	Apparently, functions in a stack invert when under stress/depression so whereas a typical ENTJ would be TeNiSeFi a depressed ENTJ would be FiSeNiTe. Fi dominant and Se secondary would [most closely align to ISFP.](https://entow.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/mbti-functional-stacks.jpg?w=645)\n\nThat way, taking time away from practical, goal oriented action and developing your inferior function (in the way of feelings) allows you make sense of things before moving forwards again.
6	Me
7	I'll preface this by saying I've more-or-less emerged from my depression. I was depressed for about 6 years starting at the beginning of undergrad; it 'ended' 4-5 years ago.\n\nI think the biggest non-personality trait I've retained is an acute sensibility for aimlessness. When things (i.e., my environment and sense of motivational factors) were more ideal, I knew what I was doing at most times; my actions were more calculated, and I felt like I could achieve anything I set my mind to. When I lacked structure as a kid (e.g., on summer break from school), I was as bored as bored could be; I felt aimless then, but I knew it was temporary. However, when I got to undergrad and lost all sense of structure, I felt aimless and had no idea when it would end. This is what I credit with putting me on a path to depression. Now, when I'm not on a task, and because I currently lack a full-time job (have a couple of grad degrees but no 'substantial' experience in a field), I'm plain old dormant, and have no way to pull myself out of it. I'm mentally exhausted from both working at a menial job with bad hours and trying to determine a path to better circumstances.\n\nPersonality-wise, I primarily experienced a turn toward introversion. I was still sure of myself, just a lot less keen on giving input to discussion (as an ENTJ I realized most non-ENTJs don't see things the way we do, so they don't \*really\* want to hear what I've got to say). I've retained some of that hesitation (I think that's made me a better person -- being slower to speak allows me to get a bigger picture of what's happening), but I've returned to being more sociable. I now have much more of a balance between introversion/extroversion.\n\nNot sure if any of that helps. I'm partially trying to help myself by putting this into words.
6	Like someone else says, you star acting like your shadow or at least close to it.\n\nFor me my depression forced me to deal with my Fi and deal with all the fucked up parts of myself I didn’t even know existed. \n\nSo I acted like an Fi dom and thought I was too for the longest time. I didn’t care for deadlines or being organized, I wasn’t as vibrant as I once was( constantly talking people into doing this and being overly witty with authority), I became a part of the cess pool that is Tumblr and was very angry for the stupidest reasons. \n\nI think the difference between an actual Fi dom and a broken ENTJ is that the latter will still have glimmers of goal-orientedness. For example even though I felt like I didn’t care for anything, there was still this image of me in the back of my head being the competitive nerd that I once was. I knew that whoever I was now was temporary and whatever pain I was in now was temporary, and if I could ride it out, I will be where I want to be. That hope is really the only thing that pulled me out.
5	I recently changed my antidepressants and have refound my extrovertedness. I have found that I no longer settle for my "friend's" shortcomings and have decided to prune some out. I am currently going through some restructuring of my social bubble and I am enjoying it much more than I would have 3 years ago at my lowest. \n\nBack then, I was looking for all and any support I could find. I lost all sense of direction and could not plan ahead at all. It's taken me a while to find my center but I finally feel like myself before I was diagnosed with MDD, 10 years ago.
4	I didn’t face depression until I was out of undergrad and moved to a major city. While I know it didn’t spontaneously emerge and that it probably had been a long buildup due to experiences from childhood and trauma from other factors, I still wasn’t prepared for it. It destroyed my ability to think, plan, prioritize, create, feel (and I already suck at this), made me inefficient, extremely sensitive, self conscious, hopeless, aimless, suicidal and hitting rock bottom everyday. My boyfriend said that it was like watching an abyss fester in itself and spew acid internally and externally. I fell more into it as months passed and I couldn’t get myself back to a healthy mentality. I lost my physical strength because my will to exercise dissipated. I felt useless, ugly, empty, alone and cared about what everyone thought. I wasn’t confident in my ideas, I doubted everything including doubt itself. I let morons have a say over me and got effected by the dumbest fucking things that would have signified nothing in the past. Essentially, I was like Descartes in that I was circuitous and may as well have believed that I was being tricked by an evil deceiver. I feel for anyone who has gone through depression. I don’t wish it on anyone. 
4	Me, unfortunately. As a lot of people have already said, you make all these wonderful plans for the future, and strategize how to escape depression, while completely and utterly lacking the motivation to do anything. Although your lack of motivation does depend on the severity to an extent. If its not too severe, you end up trying very hard to push your way out of it with those plans.
3	So the "you have an idea but you sit down to do it, and the go juice is just missing" sounds like what I have been dealing with for... well for more than a decade or two. Grew up in a pretty chaotic home and success and organization was generally undermined by family, add death of close family members I had idolized, and severe nerve damage to my main hand, and sure I can see where it could come from, I think I have built an expectation of inability, so I don't know which is chick and which is egg. I have tried meds and tried CBT for years in the past and have trouble seeing the difference in myself. but sounds like I need to try meds and CBT again.   \n\n\nThank you all for your experiences. And please keep it up, I know I am not the only one with problems so keep talking and helping more people. 
3	This situation has actually been the reason why I've been doubting I'm an ENTJ.\nHow can you keep up with this idea of yourself, where anything you may be able to achieve is only a mere dream you can't seriously imagine yourself achieving ?
1	I've got depression and ADD, for context. I just throw myself in my work and slam doors and cabinets in private more often when I'm really frustrated. I know that rush of dopamine you get from accomplishing is only temporary, but it sure beats a lot of other things.
3	ESFP here, how to work like you guys?	We have the same functions in a different order, so I think that you could give some valid advice on how to be more productive. How to not be a little bitch, work hard and defeat all your countless mammal competitors in the fight for material resources? Maybe you've noticed something in particular our type could improve on in your opinion. Appreciate it dudes
11	ESFPs have a never ending supply of energy IME which is a huge advantage. It’s all about strategy. Y’all can value from more long term goal oriented thinking and more mental organization when it comes to accomplishing a goal. Try to check in with yourself more holistically and orient yourself overall instead of in the moment. \n\nI think enneagram comes into play here, if you’re oversensitive emotionally work on not letting bad vibes or bad emotions in the moment bring you down, stick to the overall goal. If you’re a 7 you need to recognize when you’ve fucked up and learn from it, not just move on and pretend it didn’t happen. More self discipline.
9	ENTJs are naturally effective because of 3 reasons:\n\n1. We constantly look to see where we fit in the big picture.\n\n2. We invest energy into things and people that let us be lazy.\n\n3. We're naturally intimidating, and we have to actively work to appear less so. People respect that we try to offer carrots before we bring the stick, but they know that the stick is but a moment away.
5	For me a lot of my motivation comes from keeping my mentality that the benefits of staying on path and achieving the long term vision will greatly outweigh the work I have to put in right now or the fleeting joy I might get from lacking off. For example, I know I wanted a higher paying and better job so for a year I embraced the suck and each day after work took a few hours an sat down to work toward certifications in my field and pass those exams. It sucked a lot in the short term, but on those nights when I didn’t have the motivation I would think about the outcome and envision my life after I got there. I’m happy to say I landed the job I wanted because of all that work and I’m far better off now because I was able to define a clear long term goal, then break it into the smaller steps needed to get there and use the vision to push me through the day to day. \n\nA lot of it for me is being able to check a box and then look back in a week and say to myself, hey look, you aren’t there yet, but that’s okay because look how far you’ve already come, and if you keep at it tomorrow you will be farther. So I guess for me it’s all mindset. Sort an insatiable desire to always put a meaning behind why I’m doing something helps me stay on course and keep my productivity levels up because I know the payoff will most every time be worth it. \n\nMy favorite advice was from my dad when I started college that I think sums it up.\n\n “You can slack off and party for four years, or you can work hard and party the rest of your life”  
3	I'm amused by the characterization "defeat all your countless mammal competitors in the fight for material resources." I don't see the world as a competition for limited, fixed resources -- so in my view it would be better to take these "mammal competitors," team with them, and create value instead of taking it from someone else. Sometimes battle is necessary though.\n\nThe good news for ESFPs is that executive function is a trait that can be developed throughout life. Since you are seeking to do this, you're 90% of the way to success. First, I recommend working on emotional detachment. That doesn't mean suppressing or resisting emotions, but recognizing them as they arise. Recognizing the emotions and characterizing them will allow you to exert control over their negative effect on your actions. ENTJs do this naturally and I see it as a big weakness when others' actions/inactions are dictated by their emotions. As an example, getting emotional in heavy traffic is pretty universal -- it can make you frustrated and angry, which is totally fine, but executive function means that you don't act on the emotions to drive aggressively or have road rage.\n\nSecond, do little drills in exercising patience or diligence. Do something that irritates you a little bit and overcome it. Then up the challenge if you are successful. If you're not successful, don't beat yourself up (recognize the emotion), but learn and try again. This is a lifelong process and it will identify your strengths and weaknesses, which of course you will objectively embrace ;).\n\nLast, set your goals and then execute day-to-day actions in consideration of these goals. So if you want a raise at work and your boss is early to the office, you strive to get your ass out of bed on the first alarm. At least when you don't, you acknowledge the fact that sleeping in is counter to your long-term goal. You might sleep in 9/10 of the time, and you can objectively evaluate whether that will allow you to meet your goals. Just going through that assessment is useful.\n\nIt's not about being disciplined and hard-working but recognizing personal weaknesses and putting in a fix. Continuing the wake up early example, if you fail more than is acceptable to you, put another system in place. Maybe invest in one of those moving alarms. Or if you're motivated by commitment to others, sign up with a friend or group to workout in the morning (that's what worked for me). If you can't get to sleep at night, run some experiments with exercising, caffeine intake, and food.\n\nThis is my advice for the type of success normally associated with ENTJs like wealth, business, and social power. It does not involve "hard work" or "ruthlessness" but its about the development of an analytical, objective lens to guide your day-to-day actions to achieve long term goals. I often chose to do things that are damaging to my long term goals, but just the fact that I'm mindful of it means that I trend towards achievement rather than away from it.
15	I never experience anger. Wondering if it's related to inferior Fi.	Annoyance, yes. And sometimes I act angry just to make a point. But I really can't remember a time that I've actually felt angry, like the type that turns your face red and makes you seethe uncontrollably and lash out. Except for one time I did yoga.\n\nAlso thinking it might be an ennea 3 thing. I don't really know why this is. Maybe my Fi is actually just a volcano waiting to erupt.\n\nAnyone else relate?
9	I agree 100% I'll be irritated at nearly everything around me but when I'm in an argument with someone and they're getting angry I go stone cold and don't feel anger. 
8	I rarely get angry but when I do I erupt. 
5	I think anger is different for different people. I don’t get hot angry.\n\nThat, and I’ve been diagnosed with some Schizotypal traits like flat emotions and limited emotional responses. Fun stuff.
6	Yoga story pls
5	Anger is an emotion. Emotions make me tired and are a waste of energy imo. \n\nSo unless it’s an emotion that makes me feel positive like peace or happiness, and recently feelings that I know will lead to self growth, like sometimes sadness.

3	Pretty good, but what if I am better at being creative than hard-working?\n
2	Have to destroy that discomfort and weakness.
6	How exactly do you decide whether or not to stay in a relationship?	As a hyper-rational and logical person, how can you make a feeling-judgment like--whether or not to stay in a relationship? I have listed my concerns below and am seeking a bit of help here. Why here? It's cheaper than therapy and took me 5 minutes to write this. As a Te-user, I also value other peoples' logic and input in case they think of something I have not.\n\n1. If the relationship is your first relationship and you are happy but not sure if things would be better with someone else?\n2. Your reasons for leaving are trivial and superficial? I.E. wanting better sex?\n3. Is it true that for relationships sunk-cost fallacy doesn't apply? I.E. if you've been in a relationship for 3 years, how would this change your ability to recover mentally? Can you ever really get over it?\n4. You've met all your goals in life at the age of 26 so you constantly feel restless and are afraid that you're just seeking something new out of boredom.\n5. You're "happy" in the status quo but don't feel fulfilled. But you also realize as a rational person that fulfillment is subjective and may not come. Period.\n6. You're on the fence about kids and they want kids. But at the same time, you won't have to worry about this for 7 more years at least. Is it better to just enjoy the now or end it really early to avoid heartbreak in years to come?
10	Don't let her ovaries go dry. If you are not ready, break it off, let her meet a guy who is ready to settle. Meanwhile bang others like a maniac and then settle down without any regrets.\n\nThat's my opinion anyway.\n
6	Would you be happier without them?
7	When I start imagining that things would be better without them in your life. Whether its abstract like my future plans, or concrete like going to a party or event, the moment I start wishing they weren't in the picture is when I know its over.
4	Correct me if I’m wrong but it really doesn’t sound like you love this girl. \n\nI mean you’re ready to leave her *for better sex*. I think that maybe you should ask for a break from her. Be honest; tell her that you’re just not sure what you want from life at the moment because that’s what it seems. \n\nIf you during your time apart, you can’t possibly think of a way to continue on without her (not just because of the superficialities she offers) then ask her if she’d still want you back. If you can be happy without her, don’t get back with her. If you aren’t but she doesn’t want you back, I guess that’s the con of the decision. \n\nYou’ll just have to move on. And relating back to you question. I think being Fi types, our past relationships really leave an impression on us bc we’d have to love someone really deeply to want to involve them in our lives. That saying, as future oriented types, I think we are able to move on if there has been a moment of closure. We may still hurt afterwards, but we know that chapter of our lives has been shut, the only thing left is to learn from it and move tf on. 
5	If you're in doubt, I'd say that's a huge statement.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt the same time, I would also be cautious.  Sometimes we just need time and we realize it is a good relationship to be in.  \n\nHave you talked to your partner about things you aren't on the same page with, or concerns?  That usually does a tremendous job of helping you figure out what is up.
1	For most ENTJs men I know (granted it is a short list) there are two real questions:\n\nDo you believe this person will be loyal and loving for life?\n\nAre you ready to kill/die for them?\n\nAfter three years if the answer to either is “no” it is time to move on.\n\nPS as for “getting over it” I don’t know that ENTJs do that: my first died around twenty years ago, my chest still hurts thinking of her.
1	1. You will always have this mindset. I used to daydream about every person I met and what it'd be like if I chose to pursue them. Even now that I've dated a bazillion people, I still am very curious about others and thinking of possibilities like that. However, I know my partner is a solid guy and I know I did an amazing job picking him. I use my Fi and stick by his side :)\n\n2. Typical ENTJ :) Human needs aren't as trivial as we always assume. Your Se requires a good sex partner. The sooner you accept that, the sooner you stop breaking people's hearts. My favorite sex partners are I's. INXPs in particular can be very interesting sexually. See r/deadbedrooms .... Sex is a major component of a relationship. It's not trivial at all.\n\n3. You can move past it. It's painful but you can absolutely move on. Your Fi will always make every partner have a place in your stupid soft heart until the rest of time though, so pick cautiously.\n\n4. Your Ni senses a problem and is restless trying to fix it. \n\n5. It's true.\n\n6. If you know it won't work... Always end relationships as soon as possible, as it just gets harder over time to break things off. Also, in my experience I am unable to wait to break up with someone once I've decided that we don't work. \n\nAnd try to figure out if you want kids (or what conditions would have to occur for you to be okay with having kids), as that is a major major dealbreaker in most relationships. \n
1	If you're at this point, I'd say cut bait and fish in another pond.  However, the biggest item would be that if the other person wants children and is coming upon prime childbearing age, thus, they need to be set free to find the right person.  To do otherwise would be selfish, IMO.  The other things are more superficial and will change overtime, but this point will not.
4	INTJ in need of ENTJ extroversion	Without going into too much unnecessary detail: As an INTJ I prefer working alone, but I’ve relented to the fact that I’m unable to bring my vision to life without building a team. \n\nObviously I’m introverted, and while I have no issues socializing, I’d like to hear from ENTJs how you all go about building a team. How do you somehow get everyone on board behind your vision? 
2	When I tested I tested my personality I was barely ENTJ, so hopefully I can give some insight. \n\nIn order to overcome your shyness to be a better team member/leader it is important to remember one thing. Assume the person you are talking to knows more than you.  Obviously they do not always do, but sometimes they are, and sometimes just a part of their logic is. Then as a rational/logical thinker you should be able to combine your knowledge and their knowledge very well. Making them see you as a leader/highly-valued team member that they want to work with again.  Therefore they will be behind your idea because you value their knowledge, and they will value yours. \n\nAlmost being an intj I know how easy it can be to say I am smart and I trust my thought process over everyone else’s. Many times it is hard to transcend that, but as long as you listen to other people’s ideas and do your best to collaborate with them they will want you to lead them. \n\nI hope this helps!
2	Not knowing the specifics (really hoping I’m not helping Project Mayhem over here): \n\n-Network and delegate-\n\nYour strength is Ni focus, get team leaders to filter for you. Give them the perimeters, find people who will translate your intent to others. Easier said than done, but worth it so you are not drained.
1	Make sure to realize that every lifestyle has its benefits and flaws. I'm currently completely mentally and physically exhausted yet my alarm is set for 6 hours from now. I never had that problem when I was more introverted.\n\nI'm drowning in a mountain of irrelevance. I feel like I need a secretary and I'm still a student ffs.
1	When pitching an idea to someone, you gotta understand what it is that matters to them, and that comes from understanding their character and personalities.  Basically, take an interest in people.  You’ll learn what appeals to them and you can emphasize the most appealing aspects of your idea to them.\n\nFor example, if you wanna sell T-shirts and you want a hippie designer on your team, maybe you shouldn’t talk only about all the money you’ll make,  but about the happiness you’ll bring people and how they can express themselves with your shirts.  Hearing words like “big” and “corporate” will make them apathetic.  Likewise, a very business-oriented person wants to hear the bottom line and whether this project is worth their time, so you wouldn’t bore them with the same sunshine-and-rainbow details and would instead explain the potential of such a project to be a big success.  \n\nIt’s basically marketing/selling ideas.  But it’s not disingenuous.  People really enjoy when you understand what it is they’re passionate about.  So if your friend loves swimming and you say something like “hey, we could even make a T-shirt with a giant pool on it!”  Or “Maybe we could make shirts for the swim team!”  It’s not a huge deal but it shows you’re looking out for and acknowledge their interests and they appreciate that.  You can warm people up to any idea when you show them how it can involve or realize their greatest passions, values and goals.  
1	Sorry late response, but the way you rally a team is with your vision and passion. Explain your vision and let the passion out, people will want to follow you if you let it out like that. It's all about the vision. If you go off in huge details about everything you will lose people, that comes with time. Focus on how you deliver your vision in easy terms and get people excited. Make your vision sound as grand as possible!
10	Have a vision for a biotech/social startup. Need advice and potential team members to make it into a reality!	Dear all,\n\nI envision making a startup that can work like Facebook/Instagram but with a biotech/healthcare service (better than 23 and me and involving things much more than just ancestry analysis i.e other kinds of biotech/healthcare services like blood tests, mental health consulting e.t.c). Trying to bridge the gap between biotech/healthcare and the average consumer. Capitalizing on the current state of the US healthcare where many people have problems paying or other healthcare related problems. Also, capitalizing on the high purchasing power of the Chinese consumer market (and the size of that market). Already have Chinese biotech startups supporting me (outsourcing of healthcare and biotech services).\n\nHere are the basics characteristics of my vision:\n\n1. B2C focusing\n2. Social plus aspect\n3. Healthcare support/services\n4. Targeting Chinese and the United States markets\n\nNeed help in the following:\n\n1. Policies and laws with regards to healthcare/biotech/tech/B2C business in the US (and China if anyone knows)\n2. Potential team members who share my vision and can provide value\n3. Any other advice related to business in this realm\n4. Any other obstacles that I may face down the line\n\nThanks in advance!
7	I would crosspost this to r/entrepreneur or r/startups. You’ll get much more specific and concrete feedback there. 
3	What you describe entails some fundamental conflicts. Whether or not people *want* to publicize and make social their healthcare needs, the healthcare sector’s privacy standards are strictly regulated. 
3	I run a small marketing agency. I'd be happy to give free advice if that's of any use.
2	Medical device regulatory officer here with IVD experience. Curious about what testing services you would provide, or more about that link in general.
2	Always looking to connect with intelligent, ambitious people. Having said that, your idea seems very fragmented and unclear. \n\nCan you define the idea and its competitive advantage simply in two sentences?
1	I would love to help and be a part of this but i dont really have anything to provide since I am in highschool still. Some things I would think about are your current/future competitors. What would make you better than 23 and exel in those areas. From your explanation I am also still confused on what you are exactly trying to do. Are you trying to provide an online doctor? Whats the purpose of your service/product for the consumer? 
10	Anyone else play video games?	If so, what are your favorites? I am a big fan of the Fallout series, League, and Overwatch\n\nETA: I also love Terraria and Skyrim

3	I casually play fighters and other fast-paced/rhyth  m games
3	Minecraft, ark and used to play csgo and rust a lot 
3	I have played DOTA 2 for years. Still love it and have made some great friends through it.\n\nI love epic story and strategy games generally. Currently Red Dead Redemption 2 is my game for unwinding. 
3	seriously? No mention of DotA 2?
2	I play way too much csgo. 
2	Sure; I go through stints. FPSs are my jam, and I also enjoy listening to raging twelve-year-old boys tell me what they are going to do to my mom.
2	Just a casual player of a lot of games (all 3 major platforms - hybrid masterrace). Strong preference for single player games but cool with multiplayer as long as its with friends. \n\nRanges from fallout to doom to R6 to EU4 & anno to slime rancher.\n\nCurrently playing God of War and waiting for my friend to finish up RDR2 so I can try that out. 
2	Stop playing video games. You 're an Entj for God's sake! Go work!
2	I play Rise of Nations and Medal of Honor Allied Assault
1	Skyrim, battlefield 2-4, rocket league, killing floor 2, the division, Witcher 3
1	I played Minecraft and a few other games in middle school then stopped playing video games altogether in high school.\n\nI still play once every few months, but other than that, no.
4	Catalyzing Books that ENTJs enjoyed.	Hello ENTJs,\nWhat are some books / authors / articles / or lectures that you found to be eye opening or catalyzing.

Temudjin is a turbo ENTJ, the books reads like a thrilling novel and provide great insights at every page, and there is wisdom in every episode of the Khan's life and even after his life (the chapters of how and why the Mongol empires collapses are a serious lesson to be considered at all times). This book just has everything in it: a catching history, a great writing, emotions, lessons for life, insights of a great man who happens to have been "like us" and even if it's quite long, you dread for the end to happen every page you turn, and that is a feeling I rarely had.\n\n• "[How to Make Millions Without a Degree](https://www.amazon.fr/How-Make-Millions-Without-Degree/dp/1848765908/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1542210507&sr=8-1&keywords=How+to+Make+Millions+Without+a+Degree)" (Simon Dolan) is the best fuel for my confirmation biases. Basically an anthem to self-made people and believing in yourself. Dolan is a funny guy and his motorsport career is more than acknowledgeable.

Wansink was dismissed from his university for falsifying researchs and his "food psychology" thing was recently debunked for having little or no academic basis. This book is full of these made up stuff, most information it contains are probably wrong or manipulated. But... it works. It worked for me. It triggered little changes in my relationship to food (mostly about quantity and not tricking myself into eating stuff I'll regret later) and I can see my fat diminishing from these newly formed habits. So I don't know, this scam book was the one that made me end up bad habits with food when some more academic works didn't help a lot. I'll let that to your own judgement.

8	How to stop from jumping to conclusions?	How do I exercise my Ni more efficiently and gather enough info before making assumptions? \n\nFor any INTJs here, how do you strategize more effectively?
15	Ni is all about perspectives and "why"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\-Philosophy\n\nIt's my meditation. Books and podcasts. Rips apart the assumptions you make about your entire existence and puts things into proper perspective. History's greatest minds going to work on the most important question: "why" (Philosophize This podcast is a great way to get your feet wet)\n\n\-Practice listening and conversation\n\nMake listening a puzzle to be solved. Set your goal in conversation to understand the other's perspective. Helps keep my attention and flex my empathy and it's fun to get good at. Stop looking for your turn to share your opinion and look to participate in verbal tennis.\n\n\-Think on purpose. Slow the fuck down.\n\nDon't solve problems as fast as possible. You may be getting shit done quick but you're probably duct taping when you need to be welding to make progress. True efficiency thinks carefully in big picture and long term.
12	Simple! Have an INTP friend, he'll scold you on every assumption you make untill you'll integrate fact checking and carefullness into your values. \nHe will always make sure you question your assumptions and introduce you to the scientific method. \nYou'll be pissed! But you will always realise that he is right.\nAt least that is what happened to me. Damn bastard... but good friend... 
3	ask "what if" and find the result of your action before actually execute it, make sure you have think about it before. \n\nfind more way to solve the problem, so you won't miss the best one.\n\nbe efficent in the long run, you don't need to do everything yourself to get the shit done. Instead, delegate it and you'll have more time to slow down and actually lead others\n\nfor practice, ask more question, be curious to everything,  even the idea is stupid and unresonable because these ideas actually have a meaning behind it, you just need to find the meaning, not the idea. Use these meaning that you've gathered to build your plan, or your worldview.\n\nfor help, i would recomend ENTP bc they will give you multiple ideas, you can use your Ni to pick up your way. Or an INTJ for a better result, but there will be more conflict and you both have to put work to balance between planning and doing.
2	For INTJ jumping to conclusions is basically an Ni-Fi loop.  These happen when you are using Ni without Te to validate and fact check. \n You break out of it by realizing you're in the loop, and bringing Te back into it.  Talk to someone.  Communicate your assumptions to a trusted party and see what they make of your thought process.  
2	Too vague. Need examples. Run your ideas by the "top". The /r/intj sub did not impress me that much. 10% were smart, some were dull and most were boring.\n\nFor objective Q&A try stack exchanges like StackOverflow.com, and the rest: https://stackexchange.com/sites\n\nFor semi-objective questions you might want to try Quora or even Reddit (some subs like /r/philosophy or something science-related are quite strict in how you can use them).\n\nThe goal is to expose your ideas to the "top", get your as kicked, be humble, learn.\n\nAt the same time you do not want to look like an idiot with your name right next to, it so always post dumb questions anonymously.\n\nFrankly, I think you can benefit from exposure to all 4 NT types. It is going to sound like a cliche but they all have different perspectives and strengths.\n\nENTPs for quick brainstorming. INTJs for workable plans with a backup. INTPs for checking your logic. Something like that. An older ENTJ might try to explain how to tap into Ni more & more often.\n\n
23	Any other ENTJs that never cared so much about making money?	I think there could be some overhyped prescription about some of us (or maybe not) when it comes to ENTJs naturally being found in the business and the finance world. I think it has more to do with suitability of environment rather than our leading/supporting cognitive functions that invite us there directly.\n\nAnyone else felt in a similar way? I have never felt the need or want to be rich, or to be making lots of money. For me its more about enjoying competition, conflict and more so having a meaning to strive toward something rather than the reward itself. Is it intrinsic into all of you to be driven by financial rewards?
30	I just don't want to get held back by money. 
16	Money is a means to an end. imo the end goal has always been fulfillment/happiness. If you can achieve that while being a poor dude then be happy because some of us will strive for it and never achieve it. You work hard not for the sake of working hard but to get $$$, $$$ in itself is useless except to buy you your freedom and freedom in itself is a means to achieve the final end goal of happiness. \n\nMoney frees you and that's why you pursue it because you'll remain shackled until the point where the cost of anything is irrelevant, that's when you'll experience true freedom. When you're free from the trappings of modern society, then and only then can you fully pursue what makes you happy or fulfilled. People who hoard cash for the sake of hoarding cash are just silly - money is meant to be spent
13	Me. I think the ESTJ cares more about money because it is the tangible representation success.   That pairs better with their “S”. But for us, success is more abstract. 
12	Never cared about money. Creating positive change is more rewarding.
6	I think this is why a lot of ENTJ's are great business owners. Because they would rather invest the money into their company and watch it grow than to take a salary. I'm on the border of INTJ/ENTJ and I find satisfaction in being a leader and taking complete ownership of my projects & life.\n\nHowever, I do find that calculating my net worth every month in a spreadsheet provides some peace of mind when it comes to financial stability. 
5	I'm super lazy, which means I don't want to work at all if I don't care about it. But I really do want to work a reasonable amount on stuff I care about. \n\nThe easiest way to do that is to have money, both for flexibility and deployable capital. It's a means to an end, not an end itself.
3	Have you ever been in a situation where you do not know how you are going to make it financially till the end of the month?
3	For me, it means stability that transcends past myself. It want the stability to extend to other members of my family. My family sacrificed their whole life to migrate to America for a better future. Just a few generations ago, my grandparents were without running water and electricity. I plan on continuing this project for improvement of not only my life but my family's lives by creating generational wealth. So yes, I do care about money. 
3	I think that money gives you freedom.
3	I’ve never been interested in money. I’ve always been interested in mastering my profession, the money will come later.
3	I was raised in northern Canada, and I spent a big part of my childhood in [the bush](https://i.imgur.com/epHx1OD.jpg), a couple hundred KM from the nearest town, with no running water, no electricity, and no neighbours. That kind of upbringing (where you carry what you need) kind of re-defined my early ideas of what I *need*. Add to that an abusive childhood, and I think I've just learned to need less than most.\n\nMoney is something I need a little of, and if I spent more time/effort getting more of it, then I'd probably have more of it... along with other stuff I also don't need.. all while ultimately having less *time* to spend on the things I do enjoy.
6	I don't care about money but I definitely need it for my projects and goals.
2	Money is a measure of success.  I got that quote from my friend, Steve Forbes
1	As I have climbed the business ladder, I have been paid more and more. It’s not that I _need_ more money or I’m going to combust, but it’s just hard to swallow making less money than a previous position/company. But it’s nice to have, and it makes life easier and less stressful in many ways.
1	I think that many people love the idea of having money because in theory, it sounds quite ideal. However, many of them don’t realize the pitfalls and the desperation that one can find themselves in after losing that money. It’s interesting, money is both important and yet not integral to me. I want to fulfill my potential, I want to transcend myself and get my projects in motion and many of them would result in me having more money. Money for me is a way to help the marginalized groups of people that I would like to help and to be liberated from society because of the many shackles that come from culture and byproduct of the capitalistic race we all find ourselves in. \n\nHowever, I grew up in an affluent family who obsessed over money to the point that after they emigrated to the United States, they lost it all. The loss of sanity that my parents felt is something that I don’t have proper words for. They lost themselves in the madness of acquiring money to the point that they became hoarders. I sometimes find myself emulating the same habits with money that my parents had and it terrifies me because I don’t want to end up being a slave to it.
1	If we put you on a desert island you wouldn’t wind up with the most coconuts. But it’s likely that you’d lead a team of boat builders and come up with a survival game plan. If coconuts were needed you’d find a way to get them.\n\nISFP might wind up with most coconuts, thinking that the other survivors will be happy. However, they’re all green ones and ISFP winds up dismayed that everyone is irritated at their lack of foresight.
1	I guess for me and my chosen field... I'm very competitive.  I am at work 8-10 hours a day.  If I am going to do this anyway I might as well be the best at it, organize everything and make the most money.  Its all about efficiency.  If I'm working anyway, and climbing the ladder might as well make money.\n\nI don't even spend that much.  But I want to use my time well.   I feel like thats a very ENTJ thing.   Like I've had some "boring" unchallenging jobs and I've quit to do work at startups etc (for more money / chance at more money  / career advancement).  And the thing is I don't need the money.   Its about optimizing your day / life.  If i work at the startup and at least try to hit a home run and work more during my 8-10 hours of working I'm optimizing how I use my life.  So I indirectly care about making money.  Because I guess its how you keep score (and if you hit that startup jackpot, well you made money because you worked harder at a place with higher expected value than say a boring government / giant corp job)
1	I want to make lots of money so that I can spend lots of money
1	Oh you'll get there in a couple of years. You sound pretty young.
1	Money is just a tool and I need a sledgehammer. 
7	FIND YOUR MISSION (by Jocko Willink)	
3	If you don't set goals, you are free of failure. But it also ensures you will fail.
4	What if there is no free will, what if he did not choose military career but his genes chose so?\n\nMy mission is to procreate, eat, sleep and occasionally move (like toward a fridge). That is all I know.\n
8	People always try to bully me.	I am an ENTJ, but I always attract the attention of bullies. In response to getting bullied I get highly aggressive, and manipulative. Then people call me the bad guy when I defend myself. That comes from the people that watched me get bullied, and did nothing about it. I think the bystanders, and the bully deserve to be manipulated into the dirt.\n\nIf you guys have any good advice on how to deal with shitty people without getting aggressive or manipulative I am all ears.
8	How old are you that you are getting bullied? 
5	Perhaps the way you fight them off is as low if not lower the bullies themselves. Like fighting fire with fire ya know. I don't really have much for you since I'm not so confrontational myself. \n\nDraw your own boundaries and enforce it. Be direct and verbally tell them that you don't find it funny. If they refuse to stop, escalate. Shout and use fists if you have to. Why should they have fun at your expense? Manipulating is a low blow but if they seriously don't stop, go all out to make them stop. Don't get yourself in jail while making them stop though, its not worth it. \n\n
4	Idk if the bystanders "deserve" to be manipulated, but they are complicit in a culture that rewards people who isolate and harass people that are vulnerable (or that they perceive as such). Let's address the bullying first.\n\nSo I have a big problem with the word bullying because it makes it sound trivial. It's not because it seriously warps the physical composition of your brain and how you view strangers or people you want to connect with. There's really no word to summarize the vindictive behavior that you're experiencing.\n\nHonestly, I have low tolerance for it so **I pretend they don't exist**. Like I don't even do anything nice for them but I go out of the way to show how I treat other equitably and not acknowledge their own humanity. Your "bullies" (quotations because it trivializes their behavior) may have their own complex issues that they may lash out on you for, but it's not an excuse. You deserve to prioritize your ownself.\n\nIgnoring them does not always work so you can "lash out". Sorry, your elementary teachers were wrong and you should address it head on. "Lash out" is just code to say that you're the same as the people who refuse to acknowledge your autonomy. Be very cautious around the people (bystanders) who use this language *they will never help you*. Personally, I think manipulation is petty and I avoid petty culture. Being "aggressive" whatever that means is to put forth your own needs and assert yourself as a person but there are classy ways to do this. \n\nSorry there aren't a lot of concrete ways in this post to help you navigate a toxic social world because my recommendation is to leave it but I know that's not always *immediately* possible. I would plan for it though. Eject these toxic people and their enablers out of your life at some point in the future because this can be temporary.\n\nSecond, check out the /r/raisedbynarcissists wiki. Not [all of it](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/wiki/index) applies to your situation, but the sub is very good at negotiating and understanding toxic behavior (and helping others escape it). \n\nLong post, let me iterate the important points\n\n * You do not deserve to be treated inhuman. \n * You are allowed to assert your person and put your needs first because no one around you is going to do that for you.\n * Pretend they do not exist\n * Beware linguistic language that trivializes the toxic behavior or accuses you\n * Read the /r/raisedbynarcissists wiki. I'd start with [gas lighting](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Gaslighting) because it's probably what's being used against you when you're "the bad guy"
4	People like to get a reaction out of others, it makes them feel powerful. Don't give them the satisfaction. If I was in your position, there are a few things I would do. I'd file a report with whatever conflict resolution service you can access in your organization, whether that be HR or an attorney. Make sure you document these events. After filing a complaint with HR, you should expect action to take place in a timely manner. With an attorney, you can continuously build a case for yourself in the case of a lawsuit. Do not say anything about reporting, this will likely aggravate the aggressors. Do tell them to stop.\n\nHR managers should be trusted to resolve any conflicts before they get blown out of proportion. A small thing can turn into a big thing really quickly. Plus, if you file a report and they don't do anything about it- you have a pretty good story for the press. Depending on the size of the company you work for, they could be a prime example of what not to do in a harassment issue. Basically, go to HR before you do anything.
2	Pick up martial arts, watch some Jordan Peterson and Jocko.
2	Ha, I used to go through the same shit until I became the bully\n\nNever back down and never be afraid of confrontation. I’m in a fraternity where everybody likes to chirp one another, and I almost never get shit. If somebody comes at me I just hit em where it hurts, they fire at you, fire ten times harder. Shit especially works if you win the crowd over\n\nHowever, you shouldn’t do this. I have a reputation as an egotistical hot head and people are afraid to say shit to me because they think I’ll be mean to em. If somebody chirps you, laugh with them, and keep your head up when you do. If you put your head down it shows weakness and people pick up on it. A guy I know is as sweet as can be and when people make fun of him he looks them in the eyes and laughs with them, like he’s apart of the joke, doesn’t even try to defend himself or nothin
2	Look, it's kind of an ENTJ thing to cultivate socially desirable traits. I would really recommend you cultivate yourself into the kind of person that is difficult to bully.\n\nNever show your temper. Don't even show any emotion that could make you vulnerable. If anyone wants to pick on you specifically for something, you should seek to align yourself with the majority. If someone says "you're a bit of an ass kisser, aren't you" you should reply with "haha, isn't everyone? who doesn't want a promotion right?" You want them to agree with you.\n\nYou're seeking to put yourself in the in-group, because that's where you won't get bullied. But you can't let them see you trying to do that
2	. Look up articles on effectively enforcing and communicating boundaries. Others boundaries are just as important as your own. The danger with manipulation is that someone can convince themselves its effective. (It is in the short term, and backfires badly when eventually people catch on). Don’t give someone too much power. A bully can make a jab once, but if you repeat the message to yourself seven times more in rumination, you’ve done more harm to yourself than they ever could.\n\nBullying is about control and domination. They target vulnerable people, either because they have spongy boundaries, lack supports, are a discredited person, or lend too much credence to other people’s opinions. A bully doesn’t take up a challenge they don’t think they can effectively win. They enjoy holding power over someone to increase their sense of control. I know you’d like to think a bully has a lost little boy inside looking for understanding, but honestly some bullies literally just lack empathy, and enjoy getting what they want through force. Are you skilled enough to “teach” empathy? That’s a perfectly ridiculous waste of your time. Better to reinforce your boundaries, and be responsible for your own actions and beliefs rather than a dick-head’s actions and beliefs. If they want to make you be responsible to them, be more responsible to yourself. Most of us would love to give them a taste of their own medicine by dishing it back. Overpowering the bully, and utilizing control to dominate them into submitting. Thinking “if they knew what it felt like, they’d stop”. Nope! They do know what it feels like, but only for themselves, in their world, they have empathy for themselves and see others in black and white terms of usefulness to them or no use to them. I’d rather be no use to a bully. I won’t be their leverage, I won’t feed their ego, and won’t give them the response they seek. I stay authentic, and back up my boundary if it’s crossed. You’ll have to research psych articles on this because it is not repeating yourself, attacking back, or suddenly overreacting.\n\nBullying a bully doesn’t usually work, because then they can get power through being a victim, elicit support. Of course I’m talking about some big time bullies and not just abrasive types. I mean covert narcs or anti-social types. Just because they’ve usually been crafting domination as a life sport. Soaking in this mindset and perfecting their approach. Giving them negativity or taking up their challenge is what they expect, and are gunning for. You can fight back, but don’t underestimate their stamina for playing games. A bully is effectively shut down when they don’t get what they wanted. A reaction, your submission, your fear, hurt, your anger. Your attention, your engagement. \n\nIn the adult world stone walling them isn’t good enough. Cuz sometimes we have to communicate with the bully. Plenty of people work with a narc boss, or have a bully of an ex that they’ll be dealing with until the kids turn 18. Instead pay attention to what responses or gains are in it for them, when they go after you, then rob them of this consistently. A cool, calm detached indifference. Remaining authentic, and NOT seeking their understanding or acceptance. Don’t control a controlling type at all. Just a defined limit, and a hard “no you will not” and “this will be the consequence”. (ie:a write up, police report, or something appropriate, not a punch to the face). \n\nIf you reward them intermittently by not being consistent, then their bad behavior will increase. (Look up intermittent rewards in behavioral psych topics). 
2	If you were home schooled maybe its because they think youre a cunt who never learnt to play well with others. Who knows.\n\nEither way direct public violence is obviously not an answer as that will land you in trouble / jail. You need to find a form of retribution that cant blow back on you legally and even better socially if possible.\n\n  \n
1	Look up assertive training for a balance reaction. People that try to bully are a) think can take advantage of you and b) looking for a particular reaction from you. \n\n
1	I'm the wrong person to ask. I get people trying to mess with me quite a lot and I'm not sure why. I mean I don't give the impression of being weak or anything like that. But something triggers people to harass me, maybe jealousy or hatred of my personality. Either way I usually get aggressive and fend them off, though they mostly can't dare to say anything to my face, cowards.
-1	1st of all. i cannot trust your perspective, and neither shoudl you  \n2nd you clearly adopt a poor strategy for resolving the conflict - change it  \n3rd its irrelevant what others think, nestpas?
13	Lazy in School	I've heard a lot of of ENTJ's say that they consistently did well in school and finished near the top of their class, but this has always been a struggle for me.  I do well in classes that I'm interested in, or pertain to what I want to do after college, but I've always viewed school as largely inefficient which makes me become really lazy at times.  I ended up rallying at the end of high school to finish with a 3.0, and it's looking like that'll be the case for my collegiate "career" as well.  Even though GPA is really important for job recruiting, I've never been able to compartmentalize that with my attitude towards the education system here in the States.  \n\nIs this sort of all-or-nothing behavior in school common amongst other ENTJ's? 
15	yes. except i am a very good test taker and very good at cramming, so i have perfect grades anyways. gives me a healthy dose of imposter syndrome 
7	I'm in the exact same boat at themoment. Almost verbatim, in fact. I'm curious to what others have to say later. 
6	Hate to admit it but I was extremely lazy in high school. I had been in advanced classes they called "gateway" up until about 8th grade. Moved out to the country where they had no advanced classes. At that point I became so bored with school. I would sleep through class, wake up and make a 100 on most tests, absolutely refused to do homework. By 10th grade decided it was a waste of time. Dropped out, got my GED at the very next testing and went straight to work. Wouldn't recommend it lol. It turned out ok for me, but I sometimes wonder how things would have played out had I actually tried. Oh well, live and learn. Lol
5	I was a finance major and felt the same way! I could get myself to do enough to be able to get a “good” job after I graduated it that was about it. I never felt that doing well in school was a good measure of intelligence so I didn’t let it stress me out in that way
4	I’m definitely an all or nothing student. I did very well in high school because it was easy and college because it was interesting.\n\nGrad school is neither easy or interesting and my grades are remarkably average as a result. Exams are graded on a curve, there’s so much bullshit surrounding grades and employment, and most students are overachievers who devote their entire lives to learning the minutiae of very boring material—it’s all so petty and mechanized and not a rat race I want to enter. I do fine but I’m far from the top of the class. 
4	This was exactly me. I never studied though, survived exams based on what i remembered from class. Did well in the subjects I enjoyed, got through on slightly above average overall. Enough for University entrance, though i didnt go to uni (grew up poor, not enough money and obviously grades not good enough for bursary and didnt have my shit together enough to commit to a study loan), i started working straight after work. Did really well in my field which is typically a degreed field. Still deal with impostor syndrome every now and again. \n\n&#x200B;
2	I work hard because I have career goals that need me to. 
2	Here to echo everything pretty much everyone else has said.\n\nALL... Unlike you, I did really great in high school: the goals were very clear, the structure was consistent, the pedagogy was student-oriented, I was taught good habits, and as a result, I excelled. Homework was first on my priority list, I read everything I needed to, I studied well, did all the extracurriculars I wanted, and finished top-10 in my class. I was a machine, and life was very fulfilling.\n\nOR NOTHING... College was a VERY different story. None of the 'environmental' things were present in undergrad: the goals were not as evident, class schedule was much less frequent, and pedagogy? HA! What I remember from undergrad is burying myself in student government and student theater, doing homework at the last minute, and cramming for tests. I walked away with depression but a decent GPA (3.57; thanks, theater minor). And immediately after that I dragged myself through a Master's program, where I thought it would be better, and it was worse. I had some pretty dark days, but still finished with a 3.37.\n\nI'm still recovering from the undergrad-grad period of my life; I'm still chasing that 'high' of peak performance. Trying to find and build the habits for my success feels kinda like building a ladder upwards by using the rungs and lumber on the ladder beneath me. If I'm not working toward some clear goal, I generally feel pretty lazy; even stuff I want to accomplish is hard to motivate. So, good luck to you. If you figure out the secret, let me know.\n\nTL;DR -- I feel very much the same about school. All-or-nothing seems to be what it is with me unless the structure and goals are very clear. Still trying to figure it out.
1	What prevents you from doing well? Be more specific. You are sitting at home have work to do and what happens...?
1	Thats kinda partially true for me since every year I burn out really fast and it becomes harder and harder to do school stuff but I somehow keep my gpa through just sleeping less
1	I can identify with this statement.  I am in medical school in the US now and while I was in undergrad I had to push myself much harder to study for some classes because most of what you learn in undergrad is useless as a doctor, and I hated the idea of spending valuable time on something I would never use in life.  Medical school is exponentially more work but oddly I don't have to push myself to study because I actually love the stuff I'm learning and its information that will be valuable throughout my career.  I still obviously worked really hard in undergrad though to get good grades and my motivation was constantly reminding myself that studying that material was just a necessary step towards my ultimate goal of being a doctor.  In my experience, if you are obsessed with thinking about your end goal it serves as good motivation and justification for jumping through all the hoops you need to get there, even ones you deem to be useless.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLastly I just wanted to say that your college GPA will not define you for your whole life, especially as a finance and business major like yourself.  Once you enter the working world GPA may get your foot in the door, but experience and networking counts for a lot more than you realize.  It's shocking how many doors open to you if you can network well, and people care more about how competent you are at your job than your GPA.  There is still plenty of opportunity for you to be successful so go network, find a great mentor, and don't lose hope!
1	I care about important subjects (and within those subjects topics) and couldn't care less about the rest. Its about picking your battles and winning the war. If you tell me however that the war is only won with a perfect GPA then suck it up and excel across all subjects. That's what I did in uni. Didn't like most of the subjects but I shut up, sat down, studied and topped the class. tbh its probably much easier if you have some long term goal you're working towards and doing well is integral to said goal - you'll then find it easy to dredge up the motivation to just do what needs to be done even if you don't like it. 
1	I was also lazy in high school and got away with natural intelligence and last minute cramming. I realized towards the end of high school I needed to focus on my future. I set goals and started challenging myself by taking harder classes in high school such as chemistry, physics, calculus, and even a journalism class to improve my literacy. Then in college I got my CS degree :P
1	Yup, totally fucked up my high school career like that. Despite being a very smart girl and always acing tests and taking mostly AP classes, I just hated doing the homework. \n\nI learned so much but having to do boring homework that wouldn’t aid me at all in acquiring knowledge was too soul crushing. I ended up deciding there was no way I’d get into a four year, just took classes that were grad reqs and did community college after HS. \n\nCollege works for me a whole lot better now because the classes I don’t care much for I just take them online and the ones I care about I take them in person. Also maybe you need a change of Major if you aren’t interested in your major’s courses. \n\nWhat is your intended career and what are the courses you like vs ones you don’t? 
1	Auto-piloted through High School and University, but I learn through people lecturing at me, so I never flunked anything. Sat in that solid-B grades throughout everything but my pet subjects (which I aced) and it didn't negatively effect me from a career point of view.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWorked my arse off learning everything from mentors once I hit the real world, basically apprenticed myself to them for the time it took to overtake their knowledge (at that point in time), and moved on to siphoned another.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't fret too much, GPAs etc are really important for like, 12 hours of your life. 
1	Some possibilities to look into before you acquiesce to apathy:\n\nMild ADD/ADHD - esp if long term. Does caffeine energize you or does it calm you down/help you focus?\n\nDepression - esp if recent. As you are in HS still, this is right around when depression starts happening.\n\nPerfectionism Anxiety - don't want to start something you're not good at for fear of failing\n\nGarden-variety anxiety - avoidance can hurt everybody, especially ENTJs\n\nSleep apnea - Super sleepy all the time, wake up multiple times throughout the night (ex: to go to the bathroom), reports of snoring\n\nDiabetes/Thyroid issues/Liver disease\n\n--------\n\nAs you're young, my completely nonprofessional nonmedical guess is that you're a fairly intelligent (but not super intelligent) perfectionist with moderate avoidance issues (anxiety, possibly subconscious), poor sleep (teenager), and mild depressive symptoms.
1	I was also very lazy in high school. I still managed to keep good grades though. 
6	ENTJ work ethic?	Hey everyone, \n\nQuite recently I saw a post online that ranked ENTJ's as some of the highest earners out there. \n\nI'd like to know whether you all agree with this and if you do, do you think it relates to dominant Te? \n\nPS; I'd also like to know what Te means to an ENTJ and how the function stack makes you function. \n
22	I'm gonna be honest man, I do what I have to do to be successful, and what I need to do so I dont have to do more work than necessary. 
8	Yeah I think there's truth in ENTJs being one of the highest earners on average, but it's important not to blow it too far out of proportion though.  The average reported salary of ENTJs in most of these survey would be considered only middle class in most major cities.  There's more that accounts for salaries in the upper echelons than just mbti type.
8	Efficiently be lazy.
7	Work ethic? Lol. I would say most ENTJs (myself included) are lazy af and will do the absolute minimum to achieve their goals and nothing more. \n\nThe only reason why we're considered "hard-working" is because we actually carry on until the job gets completed and that gets confused as us putting in a inordinate amount of work. That's not called being hard working, that's called being effective. \n\nWe get the job done. We don't continue slogging once its done - doing so would be hard working.
6	We tend to be obsessed with efficiency and meeting long term goals, so that probably is the biggest driver for motivation.  However, if I deem something to be unimportant (like taking required courses that have nothing to do with my degree), then I can be very lazy and won't commit much effort.  It's pretty much all or nothing when it comes to giving effort, for better or worse. 
4	I would say it depends on the field you work in. We tend to do well in a business environment, so we tend to earn well. We are usually driven at work and know how to play the office politics game, which contributes to the high earning.
4	Making money has always been pretty easy for me, if I’m good at something I can figure out how to get paid for it. I’m horrible at other things  though like forming intimate relationships and not being a huge bitch, so it all evens out. In terms of my career I have options for more money but at the moment I’d rather do something more enjoyable and exciting than lucrative. My work ethic is just alright, I’m not really a “cross the T’s dot the I’s” person but I’m far from lazy.
3	I've learned that I'm more career oriented than people my age but work ethic wise I'm no where close to xSTJs. They work their asses off even if the job is not interesting to them,  I find it VERY hard to that.\n\nFor me to have my work ethic on point, I have to have an interest in whatever I'm doing; if not, I'll be lazy asf and just do whatever interests me. 
5	If I set my mind to a task I get it done no matter how long or difficult it is. That’s my work ethic
2	Te means extroverted thinking. It’s our first cognitive function as ENTJ’s. A very easy way to think about the cognitive functions is by thinking about them as passengers in a car. It’s the basic way you interact with the world. Your first cognitive function is your driver, the second is your co-pilot, the third in the back has the maturity of a 10 year old, and the last has the maturity of a 3 year old. If you want more info on this listen to the Personality Hacker podcast. It’s how they explain it and the whole podcast is a wealth of information on MBTI’s. 
2	I think it’s more a combination of E, N and J. Extroverts are more likely to make connections in society that open opportunities. N’s can digest a lot of information subconsciously and produce a bigger picture. J’s have the stamina for a long range goal. Those three combined can produce a driven long range person who is engaging opportunities. Or a cult leader, you never know. Lol. Work ethic is subjective. Is it long hours? Your own business? Great pay? Great position of influence? Great outcomes? What kind of outcomes? Is it in the home or in the workplace or out in society?\n\nThe T is useless without maturity and wisdom. I’ve met plenty of T types that lack common sense or overlook other kinds of data. Plenty of T’s who think they corner that market on “Truths”. The F is useless as well if they have tunnel vision, can’t sort their feelings, or think they corner the market on good/bad or “Righteousness”.\n\nReally I think the income difference is more-so tied to ENTJs enjoying leadership positions. So to boot if they are breadwinners, they may see income as the best way to provide opportunities for their family. May be willing to put a lot of hours in or see their jobs as their way to protect/guide/ and influence their loved ones. But not all ENTJs bottom line is $, it may not be the only way for them to effectively reach their goals. Goals, definitely tied to the J. With P types having more tangent, here and now drives or short term goals. Feeling restrained if boxed into accepting an ultimatum. J types can get stressed when their path is too loose. Neglect the here and now rewards, and at times get so focused on a vision that is so far down the road, they can feel bowled over when that vision they busted it out for suddenly goes up in smoke.
2	INFJs	Has anyone figured out how to make these people worth anything, at least to themselves? \nI have an INFJ family member who needs a metaphorical kick in the behind. Thanks.\n\n
8	If you talk like that about them, they’ll stop listening to you permanently.
5	I have an INFJ parent, and I can understand the anger/rage. PM if you want advice.
7	Everyone is definitely worth at the very least something.\n\nLast I checked a kidney sells for up to 260k USD and most people have 2
2	Everyone is worth something\n\nif you cant see that maybe its your nature that we need to research upon
2	INFJ here with ISTJ father. Despite whatever I accomplish, he’ll always think I could have done more. As he measures outcomes based on physical products, (guy is a carpenter and craftsman). Listen you T types really think at times that you corner the market on success or drive. But remember, drive is more tied the the J function. If your INFJ is close on the scale to INFP, then they’ll do things at their own pace. \n\nI’m a vocational coach myself. If I don’t have a long distance runner, and instead have a sprinter, then I’m talking to them about shorter training, like certification pathways or apprenticeships. The hard J’s are more likely to want to pursue longer training. If I have a feeler, I’m talking to him about the jobs that share his values or work culture. Switching that up for my thinkers. If someone is a hard introvert and not very social, hates micromanagement, then I’m talking to them about CDL or IT.\n\nIf this is a younger INFJ, see if they’ll take the RIASEC. Can google their RIASEC three letter code and O*NET to see jobs. O*net will give a full breakdown of growth, median pay, training, and tasks involved, along with similar positions. There is a way to search the riasec code right on the O*NET website, but I get to it faster just googling the code and the word O*net together.\n\nThen go to careeronestop and look under local training or find training tab, to search schools providing the specific certification or degree you’re looking for. Can also search apprenticeships in your area. Call them up and ask questions. The minute as an INFJ I welcomed the idea that I am dumb and must ask many questions, the world was my oyster. Go forth, ask dumb questions, and keep asking until you find somebody with good feedback. \n\nBut if you’re pushing an INFJ who is in reflective retreat mode, back off. I do coach fellow INFJs and sometimes they may just need a good book like Hardcore Zen, Way of The Peaceful Warrior, etc (You know, inspiration fodder). A creative type needs to feed their soul with ideas, so they can organize them into a position or sharper goal. A very stressed INFJ will put too much stock into the advice of “authority figures”, trusting other’s reality more than their own. I had to learn that the hard way when I caved, and “followed” the advice of someone who used fear and “what ifs” to motivate me into picking an option that fit them. I keep my stress to myself now and ask many different types their opinion. Ultimately choosing a path that jives with my reality. Our realities shift a lot with self discovery, as do our needs and priorities. That’s why being too controlling is unethical. I’ve had clients try to make me tell them if they should choose “x” employer or a chance to start their own business. Nobody should hand their lantern off to someone else, or they won’t be following their own path. In those cases I help them self-discover as they are likely spinning with anxiety, making it hard to think clearly. I slow their thoughts down so they can see what they are thinking more clearly, and ask “what’s your priorities in your life right now? Do you need security most? Do you want a period of stability? Are you excited by the chance to start your own business? Are you open to opportunity?”. Then I let them troubleshoot their back up plans should “x” employer not satisfy them, or should their business flop. I ask what they already know, what they don’t know, and how they plan to find out. Usually after asking questions, the client finds their own answer, and has developed some back up ideas or discovered where they need to gather more information before making a decision.\n\nINFJs also detest a know-it-all, so watch your communication style. Nobody knows it all. Even us vocational coaches have some slight differences in our advice and coaching styles. Don’t use controlling language like “You know what you should do” You ought to” “You better”. Controlling language is also threats like “If you don’t...”, “Don’t be surprised if...”. Someone in a defensive mode is going to shut out the rest of what you say because you’re overstepping their boundaries! I see it on my client’s faces when I get carried away. Better language is “I find...”, “I believe”, “Have you seen”, “Can I show you something I think is neat”, “Something I once read”, “So and so says”. This keeps the listener in a more open state, because you’re not telling them what to do with the information your giving them. You’re not telling them to believe it or accept it. You’re giving them the space they need to analyze it, because you’re just sharing information. (You’re not implying that they should “accept the facts”). Then back off, give them time to peruse or look over material. Time to go home and think.\n\nMy INFP brother drives me crazy because he’s full of passionate and creative ideas but has every project half finished. He’s married to an ENFJ and even she is not persuasive enough to mold him into his visions for himself (to be fair he just started coaching for ADHD, so that might help). I wouldn’t care if he was happy, but I hate seeing him frustrated with things. But ultimately it’s his business and his life. Who am I to say how he should be happy? If he asks me for information or advice I share, but if he doesn’t I don’t force my “judgements” on him. He already thinks I’m cocky as hell. (So I share information subliminally... with music and ted talks! Ha!)\n\nEach INFJ is driven by a unique vision, and is happy as long as they are walking in that direction. They really don’t need to be shoved. I’ve yet to meet one that hasn’t accomplished something they wanted. But I’ll tell you every single one I’ve ever met, is still restless and unsatisfied. (We more MOAR, more intangible things that are still percolating).  Be they pastors, chefs, nannies, scientists, or social workers. I’m not driven by money, or success (even though I do crave security), more-so purpose! Making meaning out of life events, and creating a positive impact. I love to use my knowledge combined with my values to create outcomes. I know even that I’ve helped people that didn’t snag their dream job if they improved their interview skills, or overcame a hang up. I like making differences you can see and those you can’t see. Hence my nonprofit work. I get to wear a lot of hats, and right now that appeals to me. However that journey has taken twists and turns. First an aide, then working hospice, LTC, subacute, behavioral health. Was accepted into a nursing program with top marks, but freaked everyone by switching to psychology. Now I’m on the fence... graduate school? PsyD? MSW? Start my own non profit? Marry someone someday and become a kick-ass mom? I raise birds, make stained glass, am a great cook. Would have been a great physical therapist or mortician. There is not enough years in a life for me to pursue all my interests. Which direction do I want to go? Will I enjoy it when I get there? How much debt? Right now I really enjoy working with veteran and homeless populations. My INFJ cousin was in school for marine biology and is smart as whip! But she gave it all up to raise her kids as a stay at home mom. (Organic garden, pickling, homeschooling type stay at home mom). She still has side projects and is content as long as she’s creating her vision, right now her family is that vision.\n\nFor many of us INFJs we stagnate when a goal we might have been working towards suddenly goes awry. That’s the flip side of the J. That’s means it’s time to take stock of what we want to make that “failure” mean. When you get old enough, you’ll realize how much your failures shaped your life as your successes. Being perfectionists, INFJs sometimes need to lighten up and let go of their attachment to what “should be”. In fact, I’m still working on it and know I better get a hold of accepting life as it is, before I become a grumpy old lady one day. One of my favorite quotes that kind of gets under my skin even if I do like it, “Will the impossible, accept the inevitable”. Maybe your INFJ is hung up on something that is stalling them out. In that case they may need to connect with a guide, be it a counselor, coach, new philosophy, or great ENFJ or INTJ listening ear. Someone who asks them things, and doesn’t tell them things. We learn by looking into other peoples lives from their eyes and comparing to our own perspective. That’s how we figure out what we care about. We don’t learn what we care about, from someone telling us what we ought to care about.\n\nWhile INFJs do often experience bouts of pessimism and depression, most will gather great wisdom as they problem solve moving towards balance. So know that even unproductive periods may actually be producing something, even if it isn’t a nice new wooden cabinet. I know now that chaos is impermanent, just as stability is. I used to hate chaos, now I just dislike it. I use periods of transience for growth, reflection and change. I definitely can say my INTJ friends suffered depression a little longer mostly because I notice they have a hard time catching on to their depression as quickly (could be a guy thing). They’ll complain of body aches, and stomach problems, and if I say “have you been stressed”, they act like I smacked their mother 🤣 Only after some time when they come through the other end of it will they say, “I think I was depressed over the winter”. If my INTJ bud is blue, I lend them a book, let them banter and debate like a pessimist, and usually they find their own way out.\n\nMy drift is... I don’t know what my drift is... think it over lol.
2	Maybe dont measure your worth based on how you can make other people more worthy. 
1	Oh psst, I forgot to add. My ENTJ bosses usually get stressed when there is too much uncertainty or filibustering. Stress ticks them off, and they’ve learned that making a decision or action is the best way to move somewhere. Then they adjust even if it wasn’t the best step. But they can get pushy when other’s don’t keep the pace. Especially when their bottom line is challenged. ENTJs really care deeply about their loved ones, so they mean the best when they decide 5am and 20 pushups is a great way for their kids to start the day. Lol\n\nHowever, stress exists for a reason. It means it’s time to analyze further. Unproductivity can actually be productive if you believe in right timing. We’re all on our own time scale for learning key things as well. Some need to think more, and be asked the right questions. They may have a nagging concern that they cannot articulate, and asking the right question can sometimes give them an “aha” moment of insight. Some analyze too long and wind up tripping. Remember, some people need to hit their heads twice, some only once. Good ENTJs become sharp analyzers and know which people are just going to have to trip twice, and allow nature to take its course. I’ve done this rather than alienate a headstrong buddy. Because at least after they trip and fall, they’ll be more open to taking an outstretched hand if I didn’t rub it in to start with.\n\nI think ENTJ’s don’t like stagnation, because uncertainty slows things down, and ENTJs like to keep the pace productive. They like making gains. They like to make the game plan. They like to lead the game plan. But they also are good at analyzing.... When my ENTJ boss isn’t under pressure to produce, he can come up with a unique strategy. But I’ve seen my ENTJ bosses get haphazard when they rush to a conclusion or move for the sake of movement. Their analysis is off if they become rigid and dismissive of unique feedback or smaller details. They also become ineffective leaders when they lead with their stress. Barking things out and getting forceful. Lacking the niceties of communication or forgetting to praise. Forgetting to provide the kinds of rewards people who look up to them need to stay motivated. Learn what people consider a reward. For some it’s raises, other’s stability. Some want change, opportunity or just gratitude. Meaningful praise is specific. Look into what different people prefer and you’ll be able to intuit the best approach. If an ENTJ is in a position of power, then they have a responsibility to lead in a way that’s effective. I remember an INTJ coworker saying one day “I hate being told to be “nice”, but I figured out that if it works then it’s important so I try to be softer”. (Trust me... his version of softer was taking a 10 to a 7, it’s not like he caved and became a care bear).
1	Not sure but these types are very prone to depression and a severe lack of motivation. I have an INFJ uncle who is pretty successful as a physicist. But I never felt like he had strong motivations to advance his career, it was pretty much by chance. Like he just tried different things and went into what interested him at a single moment.

Since you are improving things, why not copy a feature from the INTP sub where there is a warning over the down-vote button for comments essentially stating that down-vote is not for disagreement.\n\nCheck it out in some thread, like this one.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/9vwp0d/4person_tables/\n\nThe /r/entp/ sub has a similar warning for both posts as well as comments.\n
10	Co-Pilot Development	I’m trying to do some personal growth and develop my introverted intuition. Has anyone had any success in growing this function? Also, what did you do to strengthen this function?
8	I have a close friend who is an ENTJ that I met in my undergrad years. He mentioned that I helped him to value "looking under the hood" more while he definitely helped me to be objective and not get lost in planning. When I first met him, he was always very logical and goal driven but he would jump to conclusions prematurely and would think he knew the right approach to everything. He would steamroll people with differing perspectives while forcibly taking control of projects. It took a lot for him to understand that he wasn't always right and there *may* have been a better and more effective long term strategy in accomplishing that particular goal. He was right in his desire to find the most effective way to complete things. However, he grossly oversimplified things a lot more than he should have. In essence, he learned to take a step back and really explore potential scenarios and, most importantly, he learned to educate himself much more on the nuances of the situation/project before he made decisions. A lot of times, he'd say "this doesn't matter as it adds nothing to the result." Unfortunately, a lot of the things he thought didn't matter mattered strongly and affected the outcome significantly in that it made things MUCH more complicated than they had to be. This further stressed him out because he was the arsonist and the fireman and had to fix the same issues he created out of his own haste since he was responsible for them. He has developed his Ni function over time and is a well balanced ENTJ today.

6	What makes life meaningful to you?	Title says it all. What makes life meaningful to you, and how do you define meaning?
18	Well my answer is gonna sound corny but the truth is teaching my daughter things. Watching her learn and grow gives me more purpose and meaning than any job or project (and I LOVE my job and projects lol). I was blessed with a very intelligent little girl and it's like watching someone with a similiar intelligence to me but with a completely different personality. Before her my only meaning in life was to constantly trying to improve myself and learn new things, and while it can be very rewarding, it always left me feeling like something was missing. 
13	Having the ability to chase my goals tbh. My relentless optimism and future orientedness is the only thing that pulled me out of my depression.\n\nLately I’ve begun accessing my Fi/Se in healthy way and I’m starting to appreciate my close relationships and all the beautiful things that life has to offer. \n\nSometimes it’s really nice to stop and smell the roses ig. 
12	Automation, especially at higher levels.\n\nThere's something beautiful and surreal about writing a few statements of nonliving code and seeing that code come to life. By replicating life and human processes, we come closer to understanding and improving humanity.
6	This post was inspired by a conversation with a good friend of mine, so I figure I'll add my own response. I was discussing with him the fact that I was spending too much time on "escapism" activities like video games, and I needed to find a better balance between that and activities with other people, because being with other people felt more meaningful. He asked me why, and I quickly responded that being with other people is necessarily more meaningful than being alone.\n\nHe contested that claim, and he said that his definition of meaning was just the opposite. He suggested that meaning must come from within. In addition, he described a sensory somatic component to meaning -- the *feeling* of experiencing something meaningful. As an example, he described not being able to sleep, and waking up and reading a good book. He said he felt fulfilled in some way by what he read, because it added something to his consciousness. I was somewhat persuaded by his perspective.\n\nAs I thought more about that conversation, I realized that the times I *feel* the greatest level of meaning are when I give people meaningful experiences. If I can really make someone think, or change their perspective, or just make them feel as though they heard or witnessed something powerful or compelling, that gives me a feeling of meaning because it gives me the sense that I've changed the external world in some small amount. To me, the feeling of giving someone else a meaningful experience is one of the most profound exercises of agency, and that makes me happy. It didn't just happen; I made it happen. Maybe that's conceited, but that's how I get off. The world is elastic, and shaping it in a positive way is really rewarding to me.\n\nSO, moving forward, I think my friend was really onto something. His idea of meaning ultimately coming from within and being associated with a feeling, is true, in my opinion. And while I will consider looking for meaning in solitary experiences (like being enriched by a good book), I think the most meaningful experiences for me occur when I am able to contribute meaning and insight to the lives of others.

2	I find meaning in doing nonprofit work and applying my drive and skills to helping make this world a little bit fairer and empathetic.\n\nSure, I like progress and success in any capacity. But when I work for a cause I believe in, I feel so much more fulfilled when I succeed.
2	Taking on a burden that I can bare. Accepting responsibility so that I can move up and forward in life.
1	Broadly speaking: Helping others / making the world a better place / pushing humanity forward
1	Impressing people and having others look up to me. Sounds egocentric but it is what it is.
1	I am very much a nihilist to be honest. I don't believe 'life' has objective meaning. Life simply exists. We are born, we breath, we eat, we sleep, and at one point.. we die. Our act of living is not meaningful, it just *is*. \n\nThis is not a bad thing in my opinion. To me, life not having meaning means you are absolutely free to do *whatever the fuck you want* with your life and have those choices be valid as much as any other choice. The only question that matters is: what do you *want*? If you want to do nothing your whole life and drink beer on your porch, that's just as valid as having the ambition to be a CEO one day of a big multinational. \n\nMy 'want' in life is quite simple: I don't know exactly where I'll go and what I'll do in life, but I just want to see how far I can get. I keep doing more and more, and also more ambitious and daring things as time goes on, simply because I want to see whether I can. In that case, both success and failure are good outcomes: if I'm successful in my endeavor, I know I can try something more, if I'm unable to succeed, I will have learned about what skills I need to develop to try again later. 
1	I’m starting to think it’s- being an impressive partner to someone I’m impressed by

(x-post /r/mbti)	Hello there.\n\nI did a bit of research on that topic, but didn't find anything meaningful (searched through google scholar).\n\nI was wondering if I could find correlation (and perhaps causation) from psychological types to the type of underwear worn.\n\nHere's the [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Q0O9FFHmOZKay1ztg9g39iEsP9gjGIYwejsnFrjGZ9Y/edit).\n\nFeel  free to comment on those questions aswell (with your MBTI type  identified) if you want. I figured this sort of survey would be okay  since there was a fetish survey a week ago on [/r/MBTI](https://www.reddit.com/r/MBTI). Hope it's alright!
5	How can we see the results?
6	How to differentiate high Te Enfp and Messy Entj?	I thought all along that I am Enfp until one of my friend (who is also into jungian) thinks that I might be Entj instead. One point is that I can relate to both Ne and Ni. And strong Te.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe my enneagram has something to do with this? as an 8w9 (8w9 3w4 5w4 tritype)
16	Enfp’s are silly-silly. Entj’s are serious-silly or sometimes serious-serious 
4	I'd say one of the greatest differences would either be the life goals or the motivation, what drives them. Also, ENTJs probably feel a lot worse about being messy than ENFPs. I'd say a messy ENTJ would feel bad just because of the fact of being messy, while an ENFP would feel bad because of the consequences that being messy brings. An ENTJ dislikes disorder, but doesn't mean that there aren't messy, procrastinating or lazy ENTJs. 
5	I've never heard of tritypes within enneagram, are you sure that's a thing? I know that there is a test online that gives you 3 options as a result but you're supposed to pick one of them.\n\nENFP's have problems with things, order and chaos. They collect and value abstract things because they personally like them.\n\nENTJ's have problems with their place within a group of people. They analyse abstract things, what works and what doesn't for the greater good of people, without personal attachment to said things.\n\nIf neither of those descriptions are accurate, \[try doing the method provided in this video yourself\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkF3lKfyHfo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkF3lKfyHfo)).
1	Easy, by checking about Se and Si.\n\nENTJ have lower SeFi while ENFP have lower TeSi, this means that an ENTJ would look like a perfect ESFP and an ENFP would look like a messy ESTJ!\n\nJokes apart.\n\nEntj and Enfp are easily recognized by their relation with the world that surrounds them, the first it's bound to it and is always building the perfect moment while enjoying his life and the second it's a dreamy fairy too weird to live and too rare to die .

4	I really like this video. Had I seen it a few years ago it may even have been eye-opening. I have been in a "why mindset" for awhile though, and it has become obvious that I work hard because I love the process. Money does not mean much to me other than feeding my family and I consider it a tool only, not a goal. I actually had several offers that payed more when I accepted my current job. I value potential leadership roles and a small company more than money, as I have more opportunities to execute my ideas. If you are struggling with a similar issue of weighing pros and cons of more money versus more opportunities for leadership, I will just say that I am well pleased with my decision.
5	I don’t owe you an ounce of explanation. Motivational speakers suck.

4	>claim they are a intellectual like us\n\n> yet their responses in debate \n\n>highly laced with defense mechanisms\n\n>constitute\n\n>irrational responses. \n\nThis is an intervention. Stop needlessly using big smart-sounding words. You should not be trying to impress your reader by the number of letters and sciency phrases you can afford to stuff in a sentence. It makes you look like a twat.\n\n>Do you ever find NFs logic to be weak within reasoning? \n\nWe're clearly putting the cart before the horse here. NFs are NFs (and not NTs) because they indicated that they prioritize their feeling function over their thinking one. They're still often smart people, but in general they care less about the logic than they do about the goal.
3	Don’t get me started!\nI was talking about different concepts with an ENFJ yesterday. It was a real challenge to make any sense of their train of thought. Honestly, it must be exhausting never knowing anything in life and just wandering around without a sense of decisiveness... 
3	My best friend is an ENFP. We get a long in most ways, but when we don’t see eye to eye and get into an argument, she throws all sorts of emotional accusations at me and I have to just walk away because we get nowhere. I have to figure out the way to best explain myself in an almost hand holding way for her to hear me. Otherwise, my matter-of-fact-ness and what I consider logical reasoning comes off to her as aggression when it is never my intent. In fact, I am generally as impersonal as possible and she still becomes emotional. I ultimately end up feeling like I understand myself and her better than she does. It drives me crazy. \nNF’s tend to be hyper aware of their emotions, but not always of others. I have a friend who is an INFJ and she is constantly cognizant of other people’s emotions and can be very understanding and logical. However, the ENFP in my life is not cognizant of others emotions. She has to be told and then can very easily sympathize. Her thinking process is not her preferred cognitive function, so it’s innately under developed and as a result acts like a “10 year old” in debate. \nI highly recommend listening to Personality Hacker podcast if you haven’t already. It’s very interesting in understanding all the different cognitive functions and how they interact as certain types. \nI’ve found it’s helped me a lot in strengthening my inter personal relationships, and understanding my learning and processing behaviors in comparison to others. \nEdit: words\n
1	No I don’t find NFs to have weak reasoning. But I do think they place value on people more than ideas. I don’t know, to me ideas influence people, and that’s our aim right? So can’t be too dismissive of the person. If I want to convince someone of my logic, I can’t surround myself with a circle-jerk, echo chamber. I have to test it and compare it to the input of a variety of people. Then the challenge becomes communicating with people who speak differently, have their own cultural influences, or unique reasoning. I’m sure the Native Americans were seen as backwards or unintelligent, yet the settlers would have had a hard time expanding out without their influence. Try communicating with someone who doesn’t speak your language and you’ll get my drift.\n\nAs an INFJ here with a lot of ENFJs in my life. I only see them get defensive when they think you’ve been rude. One of their highest values is in being a decent person, and they detest a bully. Since they also are driven by supporting or nurturing other’s, they’ll take on other people’s causes even if they haven’t been asked to. (In fact it’s the one thing that does irritate me, is when them meddling kids stick their noses into a cause). But that’s what drives them, and unless you’ve neglected basic politeness, it’s fairly easy to smooth over. An ENFJ would say that a rude or arrogant person is destructive force in society that should be checked (to them a rude person is clumsily wielding power). They also detest arrogance. Put some niceties in there and they may tone it down. Try restating what they mean in your own words first, before you share your point, and try to tie it to their point. (Ineffective if you restate their meaning in a sarcastic way or try to straw man their point).\n\n\nAs an INFJ, I don’t think I lack intelligence. But I do lack the ability to convey my meaning, articulate, or communicate something in a way that is understood. It’s in my mind palace, and getting into your mind palace is the challenge. I don’t usually assume it’s always the listeners responsibility. It’s not even 50/50 if I haven’t had my coffee. Then it’s like 90% my fault until I can wake up. Like I forgot straw man for a minute there, and wished I could have just telepathically conveyed my drift to you, but then the words found me. Hence the shortcut metaphoric speak a lot of NFs use. I can size another person’s goals/aim up pretty quickly, and within just a brief exchange measure how effective this person is in communicating what they are trying to say, or how effective I can be communicating what I am trying to say. There are times when I’m lazy and it’s not worth the effort to convince my INTJ friend, plus it’s cute when they act smug. Maybe they need the confidence boost. I like debate, but I don’t like circular discussions, if nobody is listening to each other. I’ll also let those go. A lot of NFs think that’s a nice thing to do, let you have something they think you really value. Like being right! But, some NFs conquer language/communication like a science, and are incredible teachers and public speakers. Maybe that’s their goal, and NTs enjoy the contribution when it’s spoken in their language. NFs certainly enjoy the input and are open to NT that speak a little of their language. \n\nI’m no great public speaker myself, but I notice NTs often think what they’re saying is smart if it goes unchallenged by a listener, or the listener responds instead to the paraverbal message communicated. They may think to themselves “ha you’re critiquing the wrong content, therefore you must be diverting from the topic because I’m right and you don’t want to lose”, or as a speaker they assume their audience is stupid if the listeners don’t understand their message. It might be that they are hyper-focused on the wrong details, or it could also be that you’re hyper-focused on the wrong details.\n\nTo be fair, if your message is dismissed because your paraverbal skills suck than what’s the purpose of trying to speak? It can’t always be the listeners fault. You can walk through life thinking it’s because you’re more intelligent than others. But those who do this are obviously not intelligent enough to be persuasive.
25	Any chronic rulebreakers here?	Entj here. I've always had a very flexible understanding of rules. Steve Jobs made his most successful marketing campaign about breaking rules, Hans Zimmer says: "If there's a rule, break it. It is the only thing that moves us forward." I am sort of addicted to pushing limits. That is, with a strong moral code and without putting anyone else but myself at risk.\n\n\nHow does this rule breaking look like? When I was in college I skipped all classes where I thought I wasted my time.  I dedicated my time to working on my own projects and find more efficient ways to study the curriculum. Still ended up with two degrees and my country's most prestigious scholarship, despite even skipping exams! If I go to meetings or confernces and I feel that they aren't a good use of my time I leave and go to a cafe to work. If someone tells me "you can't do this" I feel an incredible desire to prove them wrong. \n\nI usually feel obliged to break rules when I see an inefficient system. For example I had to attend a language class which consisted of reciting poetry. I thought that was a crap way of learning a language so I stopped turning up and found better ways to learn the language.\n\nHow about you? Are you "lawful good" and follow every rule or "chaotic good", bending the rules?
38	If I think the rule is dumb I am not going to follow it.
19	Rules apply to me when I want them to/they make sense to me.
15	I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that it is pretty common for ENTJ to break rules they feel are inefficient or pointless. I am guilty of this as well. I am, however, quite rigid on following rules that I believe to be useful. Also anyone who works under me knows which rules are important to me and had Damn well better follow them. \n\nOn a related note, are many of you all quick to take "calculated risks"? 
6	I got expelled from 2 private schools when I was young. I thought school was a waste of time and being outside was more fun. So yes breaking rules was second nature to me. As I've gotten older I know that there are certain rules you don't break. Especially when it comes to relationships, hiding habits is not good.
3	I was the same way in college. I think breaking (some) rules lines up with the idea of getting what you want by any means; you have your own justification of how to get there. \n\nAlso, I personally have issues when somebody breaks the rules I set in the process)) 
5	I'll follow the rules, but usually find the loopholes. 
3	>That is, with a strong moral code and without putting anyone else but myself at risk.\n\nThis statement is one of the keys to breaking rules. Safety of others and yourself is paramount.\n\nAs far as breaking rules goes, I can relate. Especially if the rule does not make much sense. 
2	Not everyone is a genius.
2	I follow rules, it's just that they are my own rules. Like, I choose not to go to class, but the moment I feel the slightest bit lost on the homework, I will start going. I never go more than 1 day without physical activity. I have personal rules for things like drinking, smoking, junk food...\n\nIt's not really chaos. There is a method to the madness and madness to the method.
2	Some break rules just for the sake of breaking rules. I don't think anyone here really does it for that reason. I personally am perfectly fine with following rules that make sense. We break rules when they're stupid. If the rules are efficient and good, why break them? \n\nThink about it this way: If you're going from A to C and at B someone tells you to go back to A, you politely ask them to bugger off and continue onto C. If on the other hand at B someone tells you to move your ass to C, you could tell them to stuff it but that would be pointless because you were in fact heading to C anyway. Same concept. 
2	Most ENTJs I know are likely to break a “rule” or disobey a policy they view as inefficient. Especially if they believe it is a misinformed policy or perspective. They like to have control over outcomes in their life, and will be irritated when their logical bottom line is dismissed. Skipping details that seem unimportant at first glance. But an immature ENTJ is hasty. Unless they’ve amassed enough outcomes to determine with great certainty that a detail can be overlooked they need to temper that approach. Get some balance with an outsider’s analysis in order to be more efficient in the long run. Being too hasty is a fast track to intolerance or rigidity. Narrowing the view. Increasing the odds that you’re not as efficient as you could be, and lessening your potential impact. Leaders become leaders when their good judgement is respected by those who are inspired and wish to follow their vision. \n\nBut I also skipped a class here and there. I’m talking in the big picture.
1	I'm a bit surprised to find that this seems to be a unifying ENTJ trait. I definitely fall into this camp as well ; the way I've explained it to friends is that rules have purpose and if you circumvent the purpose you can ignore the rule. 
1	We ARE the exception.
18	Do you attract crazy people?	This seems to be a trend I can't break. When I'm out with a group of people or by myself, I tend to get the craziest people that wants to talk to me. Last night was a football watch party and me being nice I will say "great game" and then the person will just be loud and go off. Later on this guy was wearing the opposing team's shirt and I said "you guys are showing effort" same thing goes off and keeps talking to me while I'm watching the game. He even fucking stared at me while I was watching. Even his friend was like dude WTF? \n\nAny of you guys and gals are nice, but attracts crazy random people while out?
26	I think I seem to attract people who need stability in their lives, and that includes broken people. I have become more aware of this as I have gotten older, but it still makes me doubt relationships sometimes.
15	Not particularly. I have no patience for such people and as "crazy" as they may be, it's pretty obvious that I can't stand them being around.\n\nI do notice that people seeking stability often gravitate towards balanced ENTJs. 
9	Birds of the same feather flock together. We attract weird people cos we are pretty damn weird ourselves. If you take a step back and compare us with every other type, we're definitely weird af; sure we channel our weirdness into unmatched productivity but to common rabble, we are weird. In a standard distribution, everyone that isn't within X standard deviations of the mean is considered to be an anomaly. We are generally in the "better" tail segment vs the clowns on the other end but we are still an anomaly. A different flavor of weird if you will but still weird all the same. \n\nAlso like the rest of the posters have pointed out, we're stable and directed - of course we're going to attract broken things that can't find direction or require stability. Embrace our innate ability to attract these weirdos, value is the easiest found where all are blind to it. \n\nps: regarding what happened at your party, as Avril Lavigne once said "He was a boy, she was a girl, can I make it any more obvious?"
7	I’m still on the fence on if I’m an INTJ or ENTJ but I posted something similar on /r/intj. It might be an xNxJ thing. We probably give off a vibe of stability or confidence as others have said as well as a high level of understanding so intense/crazy people get drawn to that a lot. \n\nI think the difference between xNTJs and xNFJs is that the latter is more willing to put up with it. \n\nhttps://reddit.com/r/intj/comments/921goy/are_people_emotionally_drawn_to_you/
3	Yes. It’s also partly my fault though, I like crazy people. If you put me in a room with a weirdo and a normal boring well adjusted person I prefer to talk to the weirdo. I’m sure there’s something subconscious to it like growing up with a bunch of pathological people. I’m also really good with crazy people to the point where I basically have a career out of it. I probably make people feel heard, understood and less weird which makes them like me more. 
5	Sometimes I think that this has more to due with the fact that you are, "nice," and weird people usually struggle with social skills, and people who know they are weird, avoid them.  Those of us who are nice and don't know the weird person, kind of walk right into it, bc weird people definitely aren't shy and have no qualms about going up to anyone, it's just that you were the one who engaged with them, so they're sticking around. I've noticed too that people who are weird, find someone who has their act together quite fascinating.  I thought that ENTJ and INTPs were a thing... compared to ENTJs are INTPs kind of on the weird, so I guess I see ENTJs being the type who would entertain this sort of novelty.\n\nI agree with the other poster that this may be more of an NJ thing.  I'm an intj, I have definitely attracted a lot of weirdos, but my radar is better now and instead of feeling like I'm backed into a corner with a weirdo, I am more assertive about getting myself out of that sort of situation, if I've decided it's not someone I want to engage with.
10	I seem to attract not necessarily crazy, but intense/unstable people. It's kinda cool sometimes
3	Oh yeah, it's lead to some wierd experiences that are funny in retrospect. Example: Back in high school, there was a guy who was convinced we were dragons in a past life and that I was his soul mate. For like 2 years, he would show me pictures he drew of dragons. 
3	Yes. I act crazier till they run away. Too little time and empathy to deal with that. Glad that there are others out there who are into helping.\n\nI mean - I tried helping people but after 10 years with little to show for it I call quits.\n
6	What is your school of philosophy?	Curious to see how most ENTJs view life, and if this is a type related thing. Are xSTJs utilitarians? ENFPs humanists? ESxPs hedonists? I personally tend to dig absurdism, but I feel like this isn't the norm.
6	Everything seems to come back to efficiency.  I’ve also noticed that philosophy is one of the last  things AI will be able to do.. and is becoming increasingly relevant in business and public policy.. so Plato’s Republic is on my bedside table at the moment 👍
3	Relaxed absurdist who does not believe in free will. Not even sure about true randomness. I do not try to fight millions of years of evolution. I just observe what happens when the software gets activated.\n
3	Existentialism \nStoicism \nObjectivism \nAnything Plato or Aristotle said 
1	Metaphysical existentialist, absurdist, feminist and a wee bit nihilist depending on how much alcohol is in my system. \n\nI studied philosophy in college and it’s the best thing that could’ve ever happened for my mind. It really taught me how to critically think and to not buy into the every day illusions that we all find ready at hand in the world. 
1	Absurdist, intersectional feminist.\n\nSometimes a bit of nihilist but that's just my depression. 
1	Absurdism and stoicism for me 
9	Dysthymia	For the last few months I have been feeling down but not like really down but slightly. Before i had extreme mental clarity a sense of direction you know all the good entj shit. Now I feel like I have fog in my brain and my IQ has gone down 50 points and my motivation is gone. Everything I did before felt effortless and now I have to really try to do anything. Today I found out about this being something that exists and I guess it is how I would describe what is happening. Anyone has exprience with this and could give me some advice? Could this be an Fi grip?
8	Dysthymia is chronic mild depression, that used to be labeled "depressed personality. My therapist (I recommend getting one) says I have it. \n\nIf this is an entirely recent thing, then I'd reccommend looking for physical sources. Here's a few physical things you should get checked out:\n\nDiabetes  \nSleep apnea  \nThyroid issues  \nUndiagnosed ADD/ADHD  \nHigh functioning autism spectrum\n\nBut it could also be something like cached anxiety or something relatively acute that's been bothering you awhile. \n\nGo see a therapist and make an appoinment with your PCP. \n\nBut in the meantime, try to release any anxiety you're holding on to. Cut back on the sugar. Exercise a little. Do your best to stop thinking negatively about yourself and others.
3	Could be related to nutrition or birth control or tap water.
1	I was diagnosed with it when I was 19. I feel as though it is something I had for years before diagnosis as well. I am 25 now and still have effects from it. I still struggle with battling it to this day, although symptoms have improved to an extent. This is so, only because I have been trying so hard to improve it. If you don't try, and hope it will just go away on it's own, it will not.\n\nAlso, it truly does help to have a therapist or counselor. A lot of the time, you'll find your own answers to problems just by saying them out loud, and some mild guidance in the right direction can help too.\n\nLastly, if you're a guy who's addicted to porn, or think you might be, I recommend NoFap. It has had the largest positive effect on making me happier and more content with myself in day to day life.

12	ISTPs	What are your thoughts/feelings regarding the ISTP? \nHonesty is always appreciated. 
8	I’m an ENTJ and my dad is an ISTP, we both work in leadership roles. He’s a bit more emotional and can be more stubborn than me, but he’s a brilliant leader. Logical, creative (+passionate with ideas) and fantastic when the s!#t hits the fan. In life he’s generally practical, gritty and outdoorsy too! Would love to know more ISTPs, they’re great!
10	Fucking gods I tell you
4	They have psychopathic and antisocial tendencies unless EXTREMELY healthy. Perfect assassin. Horrible partner.
3	Love em, good mental connection and work really well together, solid friends. Probably my favorite type to talk to and do stuff with. They're super smart and independent both in thought and action. Have some cute quirks like getting really caught up on overanalyzing stuff and breaking it down mentally.\n\nMy ex is ISTP, we get along great for the most part, spend hours talking, binge researching and learning about shit, get bored at the same rate and like the same kinds of people. \n\nISTPs are totally ignorant when it comes to their own feelings, the definition of alexithymic. They're awful at advocating for themselves because they don't know their own feelings and get very confused by a slew of emotions more complex than "I am sad." For me it's frustrating as I'm emotionally retarded myself but in a more volatile, secretly-a-huge-baby way. 
3	My SO is an ISTP and maaaaan do we butt heads. We’re both terminally stubborn and will fight to the death for our point of view. We’re both super invested in being right.\n\nBut, it’s also hands down the best relationship I’ve ever had. We have totally opposite ways of arriving at conclusions, but since we’re both Tx Dom it makes for excellent conversation (as long as it doesn’t go south). We talk past each other sometimes, primarily due to the N/S difference I think. \n\nMy favorite thing about ISTPs is that they’re effective and resilient. They also tend to have the exact set of talents and interests that I lack. Like, I can explain abstract concepts and operational failures in systems but they can take a whole car apart and put it back together. They are patient, solid, useful and realistic; I love that. But probably my most favorite thing is their strong will. I don’t have to direct my SO (couldn’t if I tried) and he has a kind of quiet confidence that allows him to take my acid tongue in stride. ISTPs have a strength of personality that is equal to (if wholly different than) mine, and I think that’s why it works.\n\nI really admire ISTPs in a way I don’t admire any other type. Oh, and I like my men dirty and gritty, and you can usually find this type well represented in the ‘up to their elbows in grease’ set ;)
2	I think they're cool, I generally like them a lot and I also find them more emotional than us, for sure. \n\nMy dad's also an ISTP and he is a cool cat, laid back, stubborn and definitely outdoorsy, as someone mentioned. \n\nI work well with them and there's usually a mutual respect, I enjoy them a lot although sometimes their tendency to be tongue-tied puts us both in a weird situation where I don't know if they want to talk or be left alone so I just leave them alone. For months at a time. If they wanna interact, they'd come up and do it, right? \n\nOr I could go to them to casually chat and get an irritated reaction back because they were actually busy, or so they say. Nah no thanks. And this is a very annoying trait, sometimes with them you don't know if they actually want to talk and don't dare to yet sometimes, when you do talk to them even shortly and for a reason, they seem to take offense. Mkay. Too much headache. \n\nWith some I've met this tendency to not answer messages for days or weeks, which is honestly extremely off putting and makes me not want to contact them anytime soon again because, what's the point?\n\nNot as in romantic relationships, but as in casual talk or, more commonly, having to solve something. Extremely irritating and for me it shows either a lack of confidence or interest, either way, a reason to drop the connection.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall, cool people I'd love to have more contact with but god their ways are so off sometimes that I just let it go. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;

2	ISTPs are my debuggers
2	Potentially the coolest, smartest and sexiest among the male sensors, same doubtful Ti look in their eyes as INTPs <3
1	I admire a lot of qualities in them.
15	How to deal with impatience with yourself?	Hello ENTJs \n\nI really struggle with the sense of being impatient with myself. I feel like any goal I have, can be accomplished quickly within a time frame I set it (like 2 years) given it follows (this schedule) perfectly. I don't really give myself any break or leeway about delaying it, and if I do I only get more frustrated with myself because I feel like if I only worked at it earlier I "could have gotten X much done and had Y future". I think you know what I am getting here, I beat myself up for things that could have been the way I planned it to be.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust a quick background on why this troubles me. I'm a college student and I really want my degree quickly so I can start my own independent life. I've been ambitious as a kid, taking college courses during high school, with the expectation I will get my bachelors in 2 years once I graduate. Turns out my life got complicated, I got burnt out, depressed, made lots of stupid mistakes early, changed majors, and ultimately ended up with a lot of "broken pieces" of the original plan I set myself to accomplish. This frustrates me greatly because I blame myself for these problems and I feel like the future of my career/livelihood is at stake because of all this wasted time. I could have been the kid that graduated with a BS at 19, gotten a job within that year, and had all the youth and time for myself but now I just ended up being the same as if all my work dual enrolling during highschool was useless. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know life isn't predictable and I can't keep comparing myself to other people. But it kind of hurts knowing what "I could have been" vs "what I ended up now" and that everything is my fault for not being the way I planned it to be. I don't know how to deal with it honestly. I just get more and more frustrated, especially with the expectations I set to accomplish before I turn 24 (get a house, stable job, travel to XYZ, have X in savings, etc.). I feel like all of these are possible, but the problem is me and I'm the only one that can control my future and blaming others/life is a loser's mentality.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't understand it when people tell me to take life slow and "don't worry". To me, that is laziness and setting yourself up for failures you never planned to prepare for. The more years that pass, the more stressed I get because time goes by FAST. By the time all this "relaxing" during especially the most CRUCIAL parts of your life (college years) go by, you will probably be homeless, no job, no degree, and miserable. I honestly cannot relax. I just feel stress to perform. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI really need advice to stop hitting myself. Can someone show me how I should be viewing my life and what to do when I fail? Thanks.
13	The simple answer is, I do other things while I wait. More time means more time to perfect, time to attend to other things while I wait for it to come to fruition, time to step back and see if I can improve it while I wait. \n\nThe more complex answer is that you get more experience, you get bigger projects and you understand how and why things won't go to plan, and you make contingencies. You learn to enjoy the struggle and the journey, and the adage "Good things take time" starts to ring true when you look at your most important relationships, the quality of your shoes, your cooking skills, and the things you could have done better. \n\nYou'll stop smashing everything with Te, and you'll let Ni take the reins a bit and lead you in the right directon unconsciously, you'll develop your Se and be more responsive to your environment and stop to smell the roses more often, and you'll develop *empathy* and *values*. Then you'll ask why, and keep asking why, and when you realise there's no reason behind all of this work and attainment except more work and more attainment, you'll slow down and start to appreciate what you have right now. But all in good time ;)
12	I'm just going to give you practical perspective.  Your current mindset seems like its due to inexperience and is setting you up for failure. If you continue with the idea that you cannot **EVER** relax you will just continue to burn out and will accomplish nothing.  I don't get why people don't understand this, but one of the most important aspects of productivity and success is to create conditions that allow you to maximize your performance over the **long run**.  Short periods of intense productivity are not enough to be successful.  Given that no human on earth can work 24/7 without feeling burnt out, this means that some time to relax and take breaks are an absolutely crucial part of sustainability.  So just accept it, and allow yourself to take breaks.  If it helps, reframe the idea of taking a break as an **investment** in your long term productivity.  That way at least even when relaxing you can view it as contributing to your goals in some way.  
9	Every ENTJ I know is “in their head” all day damn day. When it took me longer than expected to hit my weight loss goal, I had to reframe and look at things a little differently. Of course by just looking at any plan on paper, you can just follow the steps and finish. But life doesn’t work like that. As cringey as it may sound, giving yourself room to breathe and putting more of your “heart” into your perspective can improve your mindset drastically. The human tendency to get burned out/depressed isn’t a flaw at all, that’s just life. Do what you can but natural timing plays a huge role. \n\nProductivity/Success is not yet proven to be the deciding factor in living a fruitful/correct life. Do what feels right and don’t stress what your social environment might think. \n\n\nI think ENTJs project our super judgmental qualities on other people. At the end of the day we definitely have the highest standards for ourselves. Just live your life without expectations, king. 
7	> I don't understand it when people tell me to take life slow and "don't worry". To me, that is laziness and setting yourself up for failures you never planned to prepare for.\n\nPatience, young grasshopper.  Seriously, though, fail and fail often.  It may not make sense to you now.  But, those are the best experiences as you mature because when it matters, your prior failure will have taught you valuable life lessons to apply to whatever situation is before you, when your success really matters.\n\nPutting arbitrary timelines on your life goals will do nothing more than cause internal torment.  I know, because I used to do it.  Take it from someone twice your age that things will work themselves out, as long as you take steps to make them happen.  I'm not saying "don't set timelines for goals" but rather view them loosely, taking into account contingencies.  You wouldn't take on a house remodeling project without calculating in contingencies, for instance tariffs causing the cost of lumber to skyrocket, so why would you do it with something as chaotic as your life goals?  \n\nAs you mature, you'll learn that if don't enjoy the ride, all these goals for success mostly don't matter all that much.  Have fun.  Take breaks.  Otherwise, on the back end, all you'll have to show for it is regret and a really nice coffin.    
5	I relate to this in the sense that I can sometimes feel impatient to graduate, work, and build my life.\n\nHowever, I've realized that a clear cut path to my goals isn't always possible (as you described). Rather, I've taken the approach of preparing myself physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually, so that I can handle whatever life throws my way.\n\nIn the waiting period between now and your future goals, it helps to remember that there are infinite aspects of life, and thus an infinite number of realms to improve/develop in. Every few weeks, I like to write down my goals in each "category". For example, health/fitness, academic, professional, social, musical, hobbies, projects, family, things I want to learn, etc... I hope that by doing these things, I will be the best version of myself when my future is ready to arrive.
5	1. Back up plans. Always remember the saying "Expect the best, prepare for the worst". I think you may be in a Te-Se loop. You're so focused on now, now, now. You have to realize failure is a real possibility and learn to manipulate opportunities in a way that maximizes the most benefits. Remember failure can also be an opportunity for success.\n2. Something that really helps me is that as long I have the ability to wake up every morning, it's never the end. I was in the same boat as you, almost failing HS (damn that depression), not getting into my dream school etc... It's horrible especially when the core part of your personality is being the smart, hard working one. But you learn to move on. That's what being an adult is; you either fix your problem or you learn to live with it and know tomorrow is another day.\n3. I definitely don't believe in that "take life slowly" bs so sure take life by the horns but it really sounds like you're placing a lot of value on small details. College if anything is a place to make connections and learn skills. These two things can also be done outside of college as well and though it's a riskier path, there are lots of people who don't attend college and still end up successful. It's not the ingredients that matter, it's what you make out of it that does.\n4. When you fail, you cry about it. Give yourself time to mourn, think about why you failed, learn your mistakes, move on. It's never the end until it is. \n\nHonestly failure can be really refreshing. It may not seem like it now, but when you keep going forward, some day you'll look back and think "If I could beat that, I can beat anything." \n\n&#x200B;
4	Looks like you already have two excellent answers here, so I'll be brief with my two cents. I have struggled, and still do to some degree with impatience. For myself and for others. The one thing I will say is that I am finally starting to appreciate some of the delays to my goals. The adversity and different variables I have encountered have actually benefited me in the long run. It forced me to learn new things and how to step back and reassess my processes. Looking back I wouldn't trade the delays for anything. It has made me into a more skilled and patient person, in fact, made me the man I am today. I suspect one day you will look back and feel the same way. So cut yourself a little slack buddy, sounds like you are doing great.
2	You need to reconsult with your Fi when this happens. What do you TRULY want? What was the original purpose of your plans and goals? Sometimes we need to step back and realize that certain goals of ours are actually just overly complicated means to a simple end.
3	Any life advice from an ENTJ to an ISFP?	So, I'm an ISFP and I'm generally pretty impressed by you guys (mostly because of my inf Te and your dom Te). Might be a bit of a broad question, but what are some life advice you can give?
16	1. Learn to love the things you cannot control \n2. Seek to understand, not to be understood \n3. Pay it forward \n4. The best way to grow is by helping the people around you grow \n\nI try to follow these to the best extent possible. I still fall short sometimes. Simply having them as core principles seems to make one a better person and more likely to succeed. 
5	Focus on your goals in life and the thing a you want to achieve. If you really want it, you will find a way to get there. \nLife is amazing, you have endless possibilities, find your passions, just do things that make you happy in general.  And yeah, it might be harder for some people but if there is a way for improvement then use it.\n\nBe kind to others, try to create a positive atmosphere around you so you attract good people in your life who help you grow. But don’t give away your love and supposed to anyone. Chose exactly who you allow in your life.\n\nStand up for yourself when you feel treated unfairly. You’re valid as anyone else and no one can take that away from you. If something’s not right - say it. Say that you don’t feel comfortable, if you feel that something isn’t right. \n\nIf you’re wrong, explain yourself and be generally just honest - makes life easier.\n\nDon’t force yourself to do things or be around people that drain you and make you unhappy.\n\nTake care of yourself, be kind, fair and straightforward. And don’t worry about other peoples opinions.\n\n
2	Get organized and stop believing you’re always right without checking facts confirm your thinking
0	Novel characters: two lesbians ISFP and ENTJ	How would this duo do? I imagine my ENTJ character going on a passionate tangent of her future plans of "domination" as my ISFP sits sipping tea reading one of her books, chirping every now and then "that's nice dear" . P.s. they are in a healthy relationship, just wondering if anyone could visualize a day in their life together ?
6	I dated an ISFP briefly. I'd cook and organise around him and he'd tell me the stories he was writing, standup he was working on, and would draw me pictures. We'd go for long walks, I'd throw him something serious and he'd find something witty to say about it. He was passionate about sci-fi rock opera, and just so ready to wholeheartedly commit to a lifelong relationship within about five days of meeting each other. He was also really committed to trying to have sex for ten hours at a time, and I admire that kind of work ethic.
3	Lol I actually really like this, it has a lot of comedic potential built on the completely different basis of Fi in both types...although I have no idea what the lesbian portions adds to it.
3	Oo I dated an ISFP for a while, he is a gentle, fun-loving human and I am a fiery machine. He definitely laughed a lot at my psycho-ness and how seriously I took myself and always did a good job of reminding me to slow down and be sensitive and humane, to both others and myself. I pretty much ran his actual life and helped him a lot with all of his feelings and emotional codependency, he wanted to fix and help every broken thing. 
1	From Gomez & Morticia Addams to Cal & Rose aboard the Titanic.
5	ENTJ and Fi and Se	I struggled with some rough things in the last year. It was a hard period but also a strangely beautiful period in retrospection.\n\nI guess I’m back in a simular position for simular reasons only difference is I actually tried to get my shit together and work towards my goals. I pretty much aced my professional goals and am pretty close to what I wanted to achieve.\n\nRight now I’m pretty in my feelings but I kind of realise thats not big problem at the moment. Because I learned a more important lesson.\n\nAs long as I can lose my energy in things I set as goals and work towards them I can’t feel shame whatsoever for all my Se and Fi related side ventures.\n\nI suppose the thing I’m trying to say is how much Fi can be a source of grief and anxiety for ENTJ. Se can burn you up and sidetrack you from your goals.\n\nIn the end I guess the things you learn from those episodes is how you look at situations and the future and it calibrates your inner compass to stick by your guns.\n\nI just want to tell ENTJ suffering from those kind of issues or being indecisive that it isn’t bad to feel that way.\n\nI just want to start a discussion about how our achilles heel and bad choices guide us to become the people we want to be and give us an idea about where we wanna strive for. We don’t feel crappy about it for no reason and we can actually improve because of it.\n\nHope you people understand what I’m saying and can contribute to something positive for our unique group.

5	I am already pressured enough to apply for positions that would allow me a leap forward in responsibility and pay.
2	It's an IQ test, folks, like the [Cicada 3301: An Internet Mystery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2O7blSSzpI)\n\nThe final test is to pick up and deliver a sealed package to a specified address.\n
3	What did they see in me??? Am I over-thinking?	I just graduated from college and was given a manager level job at a biotech company in Shanghai, China. Basically, my work revolves around business development in and out of China. All of my staff is Chinese and they have to learn English to work with me. Plus, apart from the co-founders, all the staff is answerable to me. Just letting you guys know that I have < 1 year work experience but I have done many things related to entrepreneurship and biotech research unofficially. I still don't believe that my company provided me with a manager position. It's a three year old company but it's making more than 500k RMB a year with 100% profits in the last three years. The staff is like 10-20 people. I think that it might be a random occurrence. Do you guys think I'm qualified for this job? Or am I just full of shit?
8	Are you a caucasian? It is a trend in China to hire a caucasion. Its like a trophy to say that they are influential enough to get expats to work for them. 
6	I still can’t believe that someone was dumb enough to put me in charge of a multi billion dollar company, either, and I’ve been doing this shit for years.\n\nKidding, kind of. The first initial time there may feel like an adjustment period where you don’t think you know enough, but fake the knowledge and confidence until it becomes real. You may feel like you’re a little lost, but unless that feeling doesn’t go away or you feel like you are quickly drowning, you will be fine.\n\nEdit: And don’t be afraid to make decisions. I would much rather have someone fuck up and make an occasional wrong decision than be too afraid of making any at all.
2	If it doesn’t make sense, it’s usually a bad sign. Worst case, they might be looking for a scape goat for a major fuck up. Best case, they have no clue what they’re doing. \n\nGenerally manager are hired based on trust, so either through referrals or from well know companies that can be contacted or promoted from within the company. This does seem shady. Your spidey sense might be telling you something real. I would listen to it. 
2	If you're good and you can manage what you've been tasked with, congrats you're perfectly fine for the job. Forget about the title, do your work at you're good.\n\nThere's actually a term for what you're experiencing. Its called impostor syndrome. 
3	It's called Imposter Syndrome. I used to struggled with this the last whole decade. Just remember that many families rely on your decision, and try to do your best. Don't give yourself too much time to waste on doubting yourself. Just my two cents. 
1	Is there such thing as an ENTJ without imposter syndrome?
1	> All of my staff is Chinese and they have to learn English to work with me.\n\nIs this company fully owned by someone in China? If not then the people in the West obviously need someone who can speak English.\n\nMaybe they are trying to unlearn their commie ways and want someone who was exposed to Western capitalism.\n\nSeveral start-ups = good experience.\n
1	Only 10-20 people, only 3 years old, you're familiar with the industry, and they want to foster business relations in your home country. You're cheaper than someone with experience and desperate to prove yourself. It makes sense, *if* you can perform. \n\nGiven the company is still expanding, and you only have three years of figures to compare yourself to, you'd have to f*ck up pretty badly to not grow the business. Just maintain the current relationships, and win some new contracts. The question is do you have the right people, resources, and personal skills to drive the company forward? This is a great opportunity to find out. \n\nAlso: read up on the Four stages of Competence, and Imposter Syndrome.
8	Have you guys seen the new movie A Star Is Born starring Lady Gaga?	I loved it. What's your favorite past time activity?
8	Well honestly my favorite pastimes are tinkering around with a car or go kart or reading. I just can't get enough post-apocalyptic fiction. I find it nearly impossible to sit still through a whole movie though.
3	> What's your favorite past time activity?\n\nDivanology\n

23	I am an INTP	What do you guys think of us? A lot of people say ENTJs and INTPs get well together so what do you guys think? I am curious about your thoughts.
24	INTPs are my favorite breed of human. My friendships with INTPs are exceptionally relaxed, long-lasting, and surprisingly stable. Apart from other ENTJs, you guys are probably the only type out there that seems to understand 100% of what I'm saying, and vice versa. Additionally, you're not as draining as other ENTJs, since you've the ability to listen for longer than 2 second spans. All in all, there's some good chemistry in there.
11	Yes definitely! My dad is an INTP and we’ve always been super close. Our personalities complimented each other. Now I’m married and turns out my husband is also an INTP which I found hilarious because my dad loves him. 
9	The best type of person. They’re so chill but somehow similar, it’s really refreshing and I personally think it really compliments the ENTJ personality.\nHope I’ll find a INTP partner again one day... 
11	I am married to an INTP for all of these reasons
8	I love INTPs - they're the chill version (shadow functions) of ENTJs :)
6	My favorite type so far. Love you guys.
8	Absolutely worth my time and energy—perfect intellectual fit.
3	I can imagine that friendship with an INTP is great because it's a great intellectual match, but I had the WORST dating experience with an INTP. Zero emotional intelligence. Zero ability to process his own feelings and problems. Zero ability to communicate warmly. 
2	I tried to do the whole INTP thing, but I think you people are better as friends. There is definitely a mindmate relationship between ENTJ and INTP. INTJ and ENTP fit into this as well for that matter.
1	IDk Id have to meet you
1	We both have the same functions stacks in the same order only that the Introversion/extroversion for each function is swapped\n\nINTP: Ti>Ne>Si>Fe\n\n\nENTJ: Te>Ni>Se>Fi\n\n\nSo i think we would make a damn interesting relationship, i think its the perfect relationship of opposite attract best type.\n\nIve never met an ENTJ myself or if i have i havent noticed of course but i would certainly love to
1	Best friend is an INTP. We just work well together. \n\nYou guys (or gals) are the perfect mix of logical, patient (relative to us ofc) and chill to complement us in friend circles. \n\n\*bro fist from over the internet\*

7	Do you need and hate love at the same time ?	Okay so this is a repost from the INTP sub . I am coming back here because the last time I came for advice you lot were of great help and my ENTJ sister is still in freaking holiday . So I can’t vent to her as I don’t want to bother her with my internal battle . I also admire her secretly with how everything seems so easy with her and how she is able to create hapiness for herself in a practical realistic way while still being a deep person anyway here is my rant . ( English isn’t my first language I am from Europe ) so sorry for all the spelling grammar . \n\n\nIs it just me ? I know I need affection I can litteraly feel a hole inside my heart that I know could only be filled by love ( hug cuddles affection someone being here for me and I can be here for them the feeling of sharing intimacy through deep secret conversations) . At the same time I don’t let people around me giving it to me when the occasion come . Yesterday I complained about it to my ENFP friend she sayed «  you don’t want to receive affection you want to give it without receiving nothing in return and only when you want it on your own term » which I must admit is very true .\n\nBut I don’t do it on purpose I feel like buy letting someone hugging me I am living an agression. It’s ridiculous I know . I don’t know which type I am . I like to think that I am an ENFP but it was 3 years ago and since I graduated from high school and dealed with harsh stuff that changed me . Every time I do the test I have INTP . No offense but I hate the type I feel like By reading it that I am doomed to be a misunderstood over analytical paranoic person who feel constant fear over everything . My ability to overthink literally everything is destroying me from the inside . Anyway that is not the subject. Maybe I am , maybe not .\n\nMy problem is that I realized that my need of affection could not be simply resolved by being in a relationships cause it will bring two things : first I would become dependant of the other person attention thus increasing my sensation of deep emptiness. Second I don’t know if I would be able to make myself this vulnerable to anyone especially guys of my generation ( early twenties) that all seems like crazy sex addict who get their self worth by the amount of girl they were able to fuck making them more prone to cheating , and this would lead to me being heartbroken.\n\nAs you can see I was able to overthink again a situation that don’t even exist .\n\nI know also that loving myself being busy will change nothing. I am going to school , work on a project and have a part time job . I am busy like anyone else with life . I know where my hole come from my parents didn’t give affection as a child . My dad outside of beating me wouldn’t interact with me and my mom stopped touching me around 8 . I’ll admit that I wasn’t pursuing her either. I just want to know if I will feel this pain inside all my life bc I really start to think that I will never get rid of it or there is a solution that I don’t know ?\n\nI can really feel it it’s nearly physical and plain horrible. I don’t even know what to do all I want is intimacy ( I am not talking about sex) I don’t know why I am wirred this way I hate feeling this desperate and pathetic. I know it is suppose to be human nature but it’s fucking ridiculous bc if it was Nature would just have create us already in pair . I crave affection as much was I crave food yet I am fucked when it come to the opposite gender or just anyone who wants to give me affection bc I don’t know how to respond to it bc I feel vulnerable weak and like the person is going to do something to me or use my state of vulnerability against me . So I only want to give it but don’t know how to ? To who ? And wonder if it’s unhealthy to have this need ? cause it could lead to dependancy\n\nHelp me
4	À te lire, c'est une vraie tempête dans ton esprit et tu donnes l'impression de poser les éléments dans le désordre. Tu dis que tu veux recevoir de l'affection, mais qu'en même temps tu as peur de te sentir vulnérable : il faut creuser un peu. Creuser cette peur (liée à ta relation avec tes parents ?) et ce besoin (affection que ne t'ont pas donné tes parents ?) et chercher ce que ces signaux signifient au fond de toi.\n\nTu sembles avoir un énorme besoin de pouvoir ressentir de la confiance en quelqu'un (ça se sent quand tu parles du sexe opposé comme étant des chiens affamés - c'est vrai pour certains, pas pour tous). Ce n'est pas un besoin malsain, mais c'est un signal clair que tu as surtout besoin de mettre pas mal de choses en ordre dans ton esprit (et sans doute dans ta vie) car tu sembles effrayée à de nombreux égards.\n\nMon avis est donc que tu devrais entreprendre un gros chantier sur toi-même, déjà pour apprendre à t'aimer et t'accepter comme tu es, avec tes faiblesses, tes besoins, tes envies et tes peurs. À partir de là tu peux construire de la confiance en toi (ta vie étudiante/professionnelle et les membres de ton entourage sur qui tu peux compter t'aideront) et commencer à y voir plus clair et être plus au fait de tes réels besoins et souhaits. Tu peux envisager de consulter un psy si tout cela te pèse, parfois ça aide.\n\nSans rentrer dans la psy de comptoir, tu as un démon à exorciser (celui de tes parents) et ce sera un chemin de croix long mais ô combien apaisant. Si tu parviens dans le futur à être en paix avec eux, avec ton passé, à accepter et pardonner, tu te sentiras beaucoup plus sereine dans le présent et pour l'avenir. Cela recalibrera au passage ton sentiment d'avoir besoin d'affection. Tu es déjà consciente que ce "dérèglement" est dû à tes parents, il t'incombe à présent de trouver les solutions pour te construire "malgré" cet état de fait. C'est possible.\n\nEn tout cas, ta priorité doit être de te recentrer et de te cultiver en tant qu'individu. Ton inconscient est un cheval sauvage et ta conscience en est la cavalière, tu dois faire ton possible pour le dompter afin d'aller ensemble dans la direction que tu souhaites, tranquillement.\n\nEnfin, ta façon d'énoncer ta pensée me laisse penser que tu es NFP, peut-être effectivement ENFP car un individu introverti aurait plus de facilité à avoir une vision lucide de ses émotions. Les tests internets sont rarement très bons (j'ai été typé ENFJ, INTJ, ENTP...) et il faut compléter par une étude des types (wikipédia fr a de bons articles) et une introspection honnête.\n\n&#x200B;
3	I know it sounds cheesy but that almost sounds like the way I used to think before I accepted myself for who I am. I used to think I was this messed up person, and I kinda hated it. It made me push people away because deep down I didn't feel as though I deserved love. You say loving yourself won't help, but it does seem like you may be a bit unhappy with yourself. You should be proud that you have the courage to analyze yourself. Many people don't. It does seem that you focus on the negative. I have never gotten to know someone well, and couldn't find redeeming qualities about them. Try not to be so tough on yourself. And try to keep in mind that if you are in your 20s, many people don't find that lasting relationship until they are a little older and have gotten to know themselves better. Anyways, I don't know if this helps but hope so. Good luck
2	I have advice on only a small part of your post. It sounds like you're focusing mostly on the question of romantic relationships but that's not all their is. You can have intimacy and affection in friendships too. Maybe start by trying to deepen your existing friendships and learn from that. Then you can expand this to also include romantic relationships if you want. 
2	Lol your description of guys of your generation fits guys in every generation to date. Not all of them are the same, though. \nEasier said than done, but you have to go easy on yourself. These things take time. I've been there and there's a good part of me that still resents this coping mechanism, but it used to be much worse.\nI know that if you mull over things it seems hopeless, but you still have to be optimistic. I don't know exactly what you mean that by letting someone hug you it feels like you're living an aggression, but you may need to build trust to get there and it takes time. There's no fault in that. And yes, these things are not exactly supposed to be easy, but they're worth the trouble. Every rare time I've felt like opening up and being vulnerable with someone it was fucking beautiful, and even if it ended, I'm very grateful for the experience. 
1	I didnt read the whole thing but is this a sex thing?
6	Being drawn to NTJs, ITPs and EFPs - Is it just me?	I'm an ENTJ (8w7 so /sp female) and I've realized that there are certain type groupings I'm drawn to more much more so than others.\n\n---\n\nRomantically: INTP and ENTJ\n\nFriendship-wise: ENTJ, ENFP & ESFP (fun, but chill) -- INTJ, INTP & ISTP (sensitive, but chill)\n\n---\n\nWhat about you guys?
5	How are intjs intps and istps  sensitive? 
3	How do you know people's MBTI type? Do you ask them at the beginning of the small talk or just randomly? 
1	But why? Maybe I'm too close to see anything but my own perceived flaws (INTP), but I struggle to understand what ENTJs would admire or find attractive.  
1	did i ghostwrite this
1	Going off my past history, I like almost all ENFJs, kind ENTJs, outgoing INTJs, put-together ENFPs, grounded INFPs, computer-technical ISFPs, ISFJs with flexible worldviews and mild to moderate anxiety, and the first 30 minutes of every encounter with an INFJ.\n\nI guess that means I have a unicorn fetish.
1	Why do u think intps are sensitive
27	Anxiety PSA	As a rational, outgoing, and judgment-oriented type, ENTJs can be remarkably susceptible to hidden anxiety. We can get pretty good at overcoming overt anxiety, but sometimes anxiety can sneak up on you.\n\nIt can disguise itself as literal analysis paralysis, or as a depression, or as a rational but grim outlook. It can make you wary of trying new things, rob you of your energy, and make you feel powerless in areas that you aren't strong in.\n\nThis is just a friendly reminder that you might need to clear your cache. Breathe in, process your anxiety quickly, let it go, and try to think positive thoughts.
3	It is holiday season after all. My least favorite and most needlessly stressful time of year. Defintely a good time to hit the reset. Thanks for the reminder!
3	This. Thank you for this. 
3	Chronic anxiety sufferer here lol glad to know it’s not just me!
4	Thank you, I needed that. 
4	It's interesting for me, as an ENTJ, to experience profound anxiety only in times of change. I was an anxious mess my first 2 months at my first full time job, I'm anxious now that I'm moving out for the first time, and I was anxious the first week of my 2 month Europe backpacking trip. Sort of sucks since ENTJs are innovators and can really thrive in high change environments. I'm trying! 
2	What's this "anxiety"? 
2	Also try and limit your exposure to anxious people; that sounds mean, but I had to do that recently with a peer in one of my business classes.\n\nGood guy, just too much anxiety on his part for me to feel comfortable in my own skin.
8	How many of you ENTJs with ADD/ADHD tested for Low Latent Inhibition?	I was diagnosed with depression and ADD in my early 20s. Now I'm in my mid 30s and we just found out I might be misdiagoned with ADD and depression for [Low Latent Inhibition.](http://www.lowlatentinhibition.org/what-is-lli/) . The symtoms are overlap each other to be mistaken if you can't communicate well with your doctor, and I think you should ask your doctor to test you for LLI if you're diagnosed with ADD and depression and even BPD. I've heard of depression misdiagnosed with BPD. Take care
2	This is really interesting. Seems to fit with how the ntjs i know navigate the world. the entjs i know seem to enjoy a heightened level of "stimuli" at certain times. Like loud music, socially risky situations, that i (my theory is that lli is related to si) dont enjoy at all. So do you enjoy it at certain times when you can predict it? Or is this theory way off from your experience?
1	I was made aware of the LLI at a fairly young age (mid-teens). Learnt to enjoy it over time... I do like the stimuli :D\n\nThe only downside of it is the occasional insomnia, but no other symptoms of any kind.

2	Stuck in a loop for over a month	Hello. \n\nThree months ago, me and my gf broke-up, a fact that was pretty hard for me because I really loved her. \n\nDuring these months, I used a lot of divination to get a grip on the situation and forge a way forward to plan what to do. It was during this time that I managed to clarify my type, I wasn't sure if I was ISTJ or INTJ, or even ExTJ. In the end, I found out I was ENTJ and been that way since. ~~Even though I still suspect that I'm ESTJ.~~\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDuring this whole time, I fought really hard to keep in touch with my ex. First with the intention of getting back, then with the intention of friendship. After four major tries over these 3 months, she made public her date with another person -whom she started dating with around a month later after breaking up with me but kept secret. I told her I planned to tell her that I wanted to get back to her, but that would be impossible since, then I quit. I pulled away from her real quick. Not even a week later, she reached me out of the blue and we've been talking even since. We actually are as close as we used to be when we dated, and our friendship only grew stronger as her bf is a very \*\*\*\*\* up INFP and hates me out of jealously and paranoia and is tearing their relationship apart because of it, only bringing me and ex closer as friends, and putting himself nearer and nearer to an open conflict with me. Yesterday we were **this** close to having a fight because he got pissed over a simple couple I did with her.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe point is that during this time, I reconnected with an old friend, Debbie, and the crush I've always had on her reignited, and I also started developing a crush for another person, an INTP friend, but since she is dating and is a very tough person to relate to in romance, I simply pushed those feelings aside. And then there's also my ex in this whole chaotic thing, and I've got a proof or two that she may still have feelings for me but push them aside because she is probably afraid of failing with me again -I use a lot of divination and magic as part of my personal life, so most results I've got stem from here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEither way, here I am stuck in a loop unable to get a sense of how I feel about my ex and Debby, two INFPs, and the INTP girl. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy friend, another INTP, advises me to meditate to figure out what is love and what is mere sex drive, but I honestly can't find the will to do so. I consider myself to be stuck in a Te-Se loop with this situation, not reflecting on the internal matters and only focusing on playing games, studying and taking care of other parts of my life, since I really don't want to think about, even though I really want to get a clear picture of everything to decide what I'll do. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyone have even been so divided and unclear of what to do about these feelings? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance for anyone who help, I'll really appreciate any advice on how to find the truth, or even the simple will to meditate and look for it. 
11	Cut off the hoe and mourn the relationship. It's dead. It's over. She left you for a reason. She cut you off. She came back when it was convenient, and she'll leave you again when its convenient. Keep it casual if you want, and tap it if you feel like it, but you got no future with that. Suck it up, swallow it, and move on.
5	Oh man, that was interesting to read.\n\n> Either way, here I am stuck in a loop unable to get a sense of how I feel about my ex and Debby, two INFPs, and the INTP girl.\n\nPerhaps if you are into 5 chicks at the same time, then you are not truly into any of them? Just your hormones being out of whack?\n\nI think a rebound sex is what you need but that can come with its own set of problems.\n\nDon't shit where you eat.\n
4	Hi enfp here. It is good that you're aware you're in a Te se loop. And I'm sorry to hear about your break up. But by keeping your mind occupied you're not giving yourself time to recover. You have just lost someone close, allow yourself to grieve. Also if you began a relationship with another person would they be OK with you still contacting your ex?\nMake time for yourself, like go for a run or walk. Allow your mind to wonder. Or find a friend you can confide to that's not someone you want to date.\nIts OK to not be ok. \nI hope that helps. \n
1	I guess I’ve been in a same situation but slightly different.\n\nThe key is though that you loved your ex and she was a person you saw a future with. But think about this small fact? Why pull on a dead horse.\n\nFind the directions YOU wanna head into and your mind will tell you she is not worth your time. \n\nYou need time to heal and re find your bearings without her BS.\n\nThat other girl might be a good idea if you really wanna risk it. Ask yourself though is it worth the risk in your current mindset and the value of your friendship the gamble.\n\nFocus on yourself and the rest will come. In the end its easier to lose a queen than a kingdom in the long run. Deciding if the fight is worth the kingdom is something you can only decide if you’re calm and collected.
1	Sabotage that relationship she has with that INFP feg and get back with her, it should be hard if what you said is true
5	Advice for Explaining Boundaries	I'm a female ENTP with a male ENTJ boyfriend. We get along very swimmingly, however I have a problem addressing my boundaries when he displays behavior I don't like. \n\nFor example, if he's mad at me for some reason (could be a subtle reason that he mentioned months ago that I had forgotten) or disappointed, he will be aloof for several days. I want to tell him this behavior upsets me and seems random (I enjoy stability and routine), however, when I try to give specific examples of aloof "vibes" such as not answering texts/making plans as much, he says I am being too vague so I can't adequately address the problem. This is just an example. Otherwise he is very loving, caring, attentive and devoting.\n\nAny tips on how to explain subtle issues such as these?
14	Be more direct and clear. I am awful at reading “hints” or any of that shit. If it’s not clear and concise it will not register at all through me, then the problem continues. \n\nThey are your boundaries, stick by them. After all, this affects you to a degree you feel it should be brought up. Put your foot down and show that you mean business. If you’re not entirely sure how to do that, write what you’re trying to achieve down on a paper. It gets all the jumbled thoughts out so you can sort it all out into a more clear message. \n\nI’ve had people do that expecting me to automatically know what they wanted. Hell I cannot read minds, and half the time it ends up in a misunderstanding because it wasn’t completely clear what was the overall end goal. 
11	> he will be aloof for several days\n\nThis is a problem of *him* being shit about communicating his emotions. *He* is having a problem with *you* so it is up to *him* to address his problem, not you.\n\nAnyway, it's easy for an ENTJ to just push annoyances or other 'non-major' feelings to the side and just continue on without giving them proper recognition. We might think we're not impacted by them, but we are and we don't acknowledge it. Meaning if you call us out on it, we wouldn't really see it as an 'us' problem (even though it is) but as a 'you' problem.\n\nFor me, getting over this was simply a process of learning how to talk about my emotions, because it meant I actually had to listen to them and try to understand it. \n\nWhen my SO (INTP) and I got into a more serious phase of our relationship, we would have a night time ritual that really helped me (and him) develop these skills. Every night, we would take a moment to drink a cup of tea outside on the balcony before bed. No electronics, no nothing, just the two of us and a cup of tea. During this time, we would discuss what happened *that day* in terms of minor and major grievances etc either between the two of us or at work or whatever. We approached this moment as 'speak up now, or be at peace with your issue forevermore and don't you dare bother the other about it in the future'. Sometimes we would have nothing to tell, and we would just drink our tea is silence and go to bed. Sometimes, we would stay outside for 2 hours because there were big issues. On a typical day though, this ritual would only take about 20 minutes or so, but over time, these dedicated 20 minutes a day really started to add up. \n\nIt was tough at first, but we really learned how to express ourselves and express what we needed from each other with some amazing precision. We've now been together for 6 years and we don't do this ritual anymore, because it's become such an integral part of our relationship to address anything that might bother us straight away and resolve it straight away. \n\nI have plenty of low key drama and passive-aggressiveness in my life, but my relationship ain't part of it. 
5	A) the reason might be subtle to you but not him, he probably feels like you are taking him for granted or something\n\nB) we do tend to pull towards ourselves (acting aloof as a defense mechanism) if we feel our partner is being emotionally selfish or disregarding. Dont take it personally. Dont try to control him or force him to be someome he is not. If it happens again communicate to him that you value his feelings\n\nC) Vibes... is very vague. Concrete examples is something he can deal with, understand and try to solve\n\n.just a word of caution tho... you talk about "your boundaries" in relation to his behaviour... when what youre describing is him just having an off mood for a bit. Alarm bells are going off.\n\n  \n
3	If there are grievances, succinctly state them.  Think of and present an actionable step.  \n\n"If you bring up issues as they present, they will be taken care of by me."\n\nDemonstrate logic, competence, and integrity within points.  
7	Advice for broken feeling ENTJ TBI	I sustained a tbi for 2 years now and suffer from bi polar disorder as well. I am still compitent at absorbing information relatively. Abstract things are hard now but I can learn things about a car or a computer fast. \n\nI have a lot of fatigue and am struggling with simple college classes because I keep getting headaches from reading or walking. I am on leave at the moment and im indifferent to it however feel that its necessary for my health. Im also balancing a relationship. I cant help but feel defeat. I want to get my doctorate in philosophy or psychology and help the world and be a leader that can help others live better lives. To be honest I feel that i can still heal and get better but I struggle with knowing whats important to me and not letting myself go and doing the right thing.\n\nAny advice would be welcomed. Thank you for taking the time to read.\n\n
6	Hey, I used to be in similar situation when I was younger. I was diagnosed with depression after I sustained a traumatic brain injury by falling off the stair. I wish I took at least one semester off right after all that happened. You know, to let my body heal physically and mentallly. I was just like you, getting headaches from reading, walking, and lifting things. Had a lot of fatigue and struggled with a few classes, so I dropped out of school. But didn't seek help from professionals since I didn't think I needed help. \n\nI got a job as a junior software designer without any degree and while I was still not as competent as I could have, so I wanted to impress by bosses, and worked really hard. I ignored my diagnosis with depression for a few more years, but I had to see a psychologist when I shutdown completely. My psychologist advised me to take a year off from going bulldozer the last few years. I was able to finish my bachelor degree in computer science and got MBA just in 5 years after I get back to learning with a new energy. \n\nI wish I didn't waste my time by not seeking help, and not letting myself heal completely. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTl;dr: seek professional help, take a break to heal.  
2	Hey, I have Bipolar 1 with psychotic features and DID, so sometimes I feel like reality is breaking and shit with the dissociation, depersonalization, and derealization. It’s a struggle. I also have a tendency to get overwhelmed by work and learning if it’s too much at one time. So I feel that pain. \n\nThat being said, take it slow. You’re in no rush, even if your brain is saying you absolutely have to get this done ASAP, I find that ends up delaying me even more. Go at your own pace and if you feel overwhelmed from schoolwork maybe take less classes so you don’t completely stress yourself out.\n\nDon’t hesitate to reward yourself too. Not saying go out and spend money because “goddamnit I deserve this!” Lol that is how you end up like me in piles of debt. But like smaller things like setting aside time for yourself to recover and relax.\n\nThat broken feeling will eventually subside a bit to where it’s at least a bit more tolerable. In my experience anyways, the intensity differs each day. You need to find things you can actually overcome so that you get some sort of sense of accomplishment after all the defeat you’ve been feeling. Even if it’s something small like personal care and hygiene. It’s still counts and you end up taking care of you. 
2	For the sake of others - TBI = Traumatic Brain Injury.\n\n>  Abstract things are hard now but I can learn things about a car or a computer fast.\n\nWhat if you are actually an S and not a T? Nothing wrong with that.\n\nWhy not pursue some of that while you can? Both are useful but computer knowledge is more portable and pays well IMO.\n\nA PhD is a long shot for most people. You might not like it or come to regret doing it. I know I would.\n\n> I want to get my doctorate in philosophy or psychology and help the world and be a leader that can help others live better lives.\n\nYou are trying to do too much. Why don't you safeguard some financial independence first and consult with experts on your condition and in general concentrate on your health? Only then put the oxygen mask on others. You come first.\n\n> Any advice would be welcomed.\n\nYou mean any useful advice, not just ANY advice, eh?\n
2	I don't have any advice, but I hope you get well soon.

21	How the ENTJs reacts to stress	[This](https://i0.wp.com/www.psychologyjunkie.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ENTJ-Stress.png?resize=1200%2C2941&ssl=1) is terrifyingly accurate as I came out of severe "grip" stress a few years ago. I went through the middle phase first when I experienced stress, then fell to severe "grip", then back to moderate stress, now I'm mostly healthy again. Has anyone experience the same?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: To be perfectly honest, after viewing a few comments a moment ago, **I'm dissapointed that some ENTJs don't have a lick of understanding of external stress and internal stress. Also, there's a big difference between good stress and bad stress.** The severe "grip" stress mentioned in the article can be depression for some people, but depression is Not severe "grip" stress. Depression in most common misused word. English is not my preferred language to explain important topics, and I'm not willing to take that risk. Ask your doctor the differences, or even a quick google will help a bit. 
6	Noticed my ENTJ brother when he goes into that mode. Usually he’s cool to chill with but not fun to be around when he behaves this way. As we’ve gotten older I don’t take anything he does personally when he goes through this.\n\nHelps that we don’t live together anymore.\n\nHow do you reckon I can help him out of it whenever we do hang out?
5	EnTJ are the best.\nSource: I am an INTJ 
3	Haha I do this thing when I’m under moderate stress where I figure out exactly what needs to be done in the amount of time I have. Then right before I start I say out loud “Alright lets do this shit.” \n\nI’m pretty psycho when I’m super beyond stressed out. Usually my ENFP girlfriend notices it first and brings it to my attention lol
2	Holy shit this is accurate
2	Fuck, this is so right. I'm stressed as shit this month lol. 
2	Yup. I went through all of these phases this past summer... The ISFP thing is still dragging through.\nI even considered a thought that I mistyped myself originally, but it didn't make sense to me. Then I started looking deeper into function and how we can switch to a shadow type, subconscious and back, and it all clicked together. 
2	My dude, where can I get one of these for ENTPs?
3	Yep. When I'm stressed, I go into ultra work mode. I work on The Thing 24/7 and shut everything else down until it's done. \n\nI don't understand how it's a bad thing, though
1	No real explanation as to why was given. Just more things to memorize about MBTI.
1	The Severe Stress is very damaging, I went through that phase at the age of 16. It is best to keep that at bay. Work out, eat well, mix with people, play and keep living happily. Try your best to avoid being in that mental condition. 
-1	I cant agree with the "Grip" stress part for myself... the more stressed i get the more of a bulldozer i become. My perception of feelings (mine or others') is directly inverse to stress. \n\nGet moving or get the fuck out of my way so that someone competent can fix this fuckup which i told you would happen in the first fucking place ages ago.
3	entjs on dating and romance?	hey entjs.im just doing a survey.to test something out.entjs how successful are you in your dating life?,guys do you often get women,and women do you often get guys?thanks.
4	The problem is not with me. You see, I have to go through a lot of sheep before I find the frog.
3	I'm a woman, fyi. I dated a few partners the "natural" way, and after I fell in love with and broke up with the last one, I realized I was not using my brain to pick out partners and that this should be a thing I apply myself to. Before, I was just dating people in my vicinity who I had feelings for. Now, I want to pick someone who will be a REAL partner and who is as compatible as possible.\n\nSo, I did a ton of dating to find a good partner for myself. Usually I can read people pretty quickly, so as long as our text conversations went okay, I'd ask them on a date for sometime very soon (within the next week, usually). I haven't been turned down yet, but I mean, that's kind of the point of dating websites (to date). Makes it simple and easy.\n\nI ended up being much more attractive to men than I thought would be, so I started dating more "leveled up" men (to put that really insensitively, sorry dudes). As I discarded dude after dude, my mental lists of "deal breakers" and "must haves" grew. The dudes were still endless, even being as picky as I could be. I loved Tinder and looking at all the choices (musing about what my life would be like if I went down different roads), but it was an ineffective tool for finding what I was wanting. I ended up joining OKC (they have a questionnaire) and still had an almost overwhelming amount of choices. My favorite types, looking back, were usually ISTJs, INTPs, and INFPs.\n\nI decided to just be poly for a while, during this whole dating situation. It worked great - I had a schedule of partners I'd see, I'd get my romantic/sexual fulfillment and so would they. I liked learning about sex and what people are like in the bedroom (tbh I was a little insatiable trying to see if there was a correlation between what people present themselves as and their sexual expressions. This was/is a very interesting subject for me).\n\nAnd then I found a sweet little INTP who is super into monogamy. So I dropped all that stuff and started seeing him instead and things are going excellently!
2	You might have luck for your survey on r/mbtirelationships
2	[deleted]
2	I find myself going through phases of great success followed by phases of absolute disaster and I am incapable of figuring out why.
2	Dating can be up and down. One thing I notice is that guys (I'm female) will say that I'm very serious. Which I find is not true. Maybe I have a resting bitch face...
3	I’m a dude dating a dude. Very successful relationship as long as there’s common ground. Illogical emotions are tough to deal with and I end up as the dominant boyfriend. Can be tough sometimes but honestly I would go through much worse to have him in my life. 
9	Making friends with people you find uninteresting.	Do you make friends with people who you find uninteresting?\n\nIf you do, do you do it because there is some kind of convenience or resource that friend can bring?\n\nWhat I noticed for myself is that, I couldn't find anyone interesting in my life to be friends with, because the things we talk about, even the "deep" topics is something I figured out few years ago and put it in my backlog.\n\nWhen I moved to another country just because I needed friend, I suffered through the boring talk, and what I noticed was that if I stick it through the boring people grow on me, and I start to make my own fun with the person, finding intricate details about his personality, studying them, seeing how they react. Nothing malicious though, not me.
6	I have a hard time dealing with this. There is an ocean of men out here who all they talk about is sneakers, mumble rap, and pussy. Occasionally I find someone who has other interests. A lot of times they think about shit and just don't have the initiative.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA good friend says he wanted to start recording. I said get a microphone. It sounds simple but a lot of people have trouble taking that first step. Once they do its easy for them to keep going. Later he says he needs software, a mixer, wants to build a booth and the hobby just grows and grows.
4	Personally have no problem being friendly with boring people, although I tend to surround myself with individuals that posses useful skills or talents. Lol. You are onto something about the uninteresting people growing on you. I find that I tend to view people in terms of usefulness. If on first glance I believe them to not be useful I dismiss them in my mind. But in the last year or so, have noticed that several of the people I dismissed as not useful, turned out to be much more intelligent and interesting than I had assumed. Moral of the story? Give people a chance, you may find that there is more to them than meets the eye.
3	Why? Where do you live that there are no interesting people? Either you like to talk about really messed up stuff or you’re not looking buddy. 
3	My Grandpa always said 'if you're bored, you're boring' 
2	I used to have boring friends. Then I stopped hanging out with people who bored me with their boring topics of discussion and found friends in places of common interests eg art classes, poetry clubs, programming courses, alternative festivals etc. When you find interests and a place to participate in these interests, you will be more likely to find friends.\n\nPeople can have emotional value, financial value, intellectual value, career value, or even value of just chilling and having a good time.\n\nWhen I had boring friends, it's because they had the latest value but neither intellectual nor emotional value (sometimes). I would meet someone and we'd get along so well in this dance of boring and mundane discussion and I would think why don't I bring up this "deep" topic but they would seem to not care. \n\nThese are people you would call acquaintances, not friends. I cut off all my old "friends" who I realized I could never really be friends with because we had nothing in common. Now when i meet people who seems similar to my oldies, I know their only value is acquaintanceship. No matter how much I enjoy spending time with them, they'll never be able to quench my thirst for philosophical/nerdy discussions so therefor I can either accept them for who they are but hold them at a distance or ignore them altogether. I do the first because I really do enjoy being around a variety of people, it's forming a deep bond with them that requires a niche unfortunately. \n\nIt may seem selfish but I mean isn't a relationship really all about give and take? A transaction? If you think you have nothing to give, then it would be selfish to continue to take and if you think there's nothing to take, it's quite foolish to continue to give and expect for there to continue to be a transaction. \n\ntldr; Not everyone has to be your friend. 
2	Sounds like a lack of social skills. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEverybody is interesting.  You just have to figure out what is interesting about them.
1	As far as the interesting people go ... \n\nGo up the hierarchy. Hierarchies exist everywhere.
1	Some might be turned off by my cynicism and slightly “stuck up” personality, which I have never realised before. However I still want befriending people with contrasting personalities (especially ISFP, ISFJ and INFP ) so that I could break away from my bubble and previous prejudices.\n
1	I struggle a lot with feeling trapped and surrounded by the boring or uninspired and end up being more interested and involved with nefarious or very eccentric individuals that can’t even function in greater society to cope. I need high energy to counter balance I don’t like having to always have social interaction and conversation on my shoulders. I hate having to generate all dialogue and ideation solo. 
1	Thank you so much for articulating what I must have been feeling these past couple of years since I moved to a new country. Heck, not even since entering the workforce, after university. I couldn’t for the life of me figure out why I couldn’t make new “true” friends, not even one that I felt was deeper than acquaintance-level, with the people around me. \nThis got me thinking about the type of people I gravitate to or enjoy being with, and it’s definitely those that I can have “intellectual” stimulating conversations with. This is my natural tendency and I want to nurture and respect it, to counteract having focused on my weak points these past few years. A benefit that has come from honing my not-so-natural side is that I’ve met some people that are calmer and seem to be happy even without my definition of success or achievement. Not every conversation has to have an objective or outcome. 
8	Any coder or programmer?	How are you surviving?
6	I recently quit my job. I couldn't be happier also I haven't been this poor in a while.
6	I'm an actuary. Lots of programming and data manipulation. I'm a master at Excel and very adept with VBA and SAS.\n\nAs an actuary, you are trained to have an opinion and to defend it. I think it's a great ENTJ career, but most of the (very few) extroverts seem to evaporate out as insurance CEOs.
4	I love being a developer. I love solving puzzles so programming scratches that itch for me. Can't imagine having a different job. 
4	I do some coding for my job don’t plan to stay as a coder but managing those who code. I have been coding forever 
3	Yes, and I enjoy my current job. I like having new problems to solve on a daily basis, which is what my position requires. Everyone in my  department works independently on projects, but we collaborate to solve complex issues. I've worked in programming jobs previously that I hated, specially the code monkey type positions. I would say enjoying a job is primarily dependent the people you work with and how the company treats you, though. At least, for me that's true. 
3	Killin it B2B type
3	Been in the workforce for about a year. My life is extremely swell compared to many of my friends. My work is pretty interesting. 
2	I love doing actual software development, solving problems and being creative... but i absolutely fucking hate having to fix someone else's shit or having meetings that could have been emails. I was dev manager in previous job about a year ago and that suited me very well but working 12 hours a day for no extra pay can fuck right off. Have started working on my own projects now, I cannot see myself coding for very much longer, no more room to grow in this occupation. Only way up is out.
2	Ex-dev here. Loved 90% of the work, especially analysis and design. Hated the part where you have to just churn lines of repetitive code - and for those who say to never write the same line of code twice sure, but theres only so many ways to write back to a DB before it's just tedious. I went from IT Tech -> Code Monkey -> Developer -> IT Guy (level 2) -> IT Guy (level 3) -> Sysadmin, and the next step is either Project Manager, Analyst or Director of IT, depending on what spaces open up first.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs I said, now a sysadmin, in a medium sized private K-12 school, with basically the ability to do what I want, when I want. I have a manager but he's the hands-off type and as long as I can justify my reasoning I cant pretty much call the shots.\n\nI'm building myself into the goto Analyst here, taking on whatever tasks I can that fits my knowledge range and expertise (and some things outside my expertise) and running or assisting with the project implementations as much as possible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo if you enjoy tech work my advice is to try another company. IT's all about learning what you don't know (I know what I don't know, and that's the gap to fill) and as you grow in each field (Windows, Linux, Mac, Servers, Network, Cloud, Security, Scripting, Email, etc etc etc) then a new door and a new payscale will open up for you. Keep going until you find the thing that lights you on FIRE and be the best in the world at that. If it's coding, go look up Scottgu (of Microsoft) as an example of where you can go.\n\n&#x200B;
3	Yeah ... What's the problem exactly? It varies from person to person.
7	Mod Test 2: Winds of change	What would you seek to change if you were a mod of this sub?
6	Due to recent posts by u/chadthecat, I would consider some possible basic formatting guidelines? Nothing crazy, just maybe remove posts with no capital letters or spaces? Lol \nAlso maybe the group chat that got brought up, but never went any further?
4	Allow the subreddit chat function, change the avatar and header picture to something that makes the aesthetic nicer to look at, add something along the lines of a “Motivation Monday” where people talk about their projects and growth. 
2	Probably add more content about ENTJs, MBTI and self-improvement to the sub on the sidebar. \n\n

9	I think I like spaces between my sentences and that character has too much fanfiction from the origin to accurately say what profile.\n\niMO, ENTJ (not because I am ENTJ) but because of his reaction to God's love of humans and wanting to provide agency to them (I'm going off [Paradise Lost](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Paradise_Lost) Satan btw). He has a lot of the angst against his existence and against God because he has no control (ENTJs generally are concerned with their own autonomy and get pissy when they have no control over themselves). So, he does what he can to gain his own semblance of agency (war against God).\n\nTo be frank, an ENTP angel would only play with the idea of overthrowing God for the sake of playing with the idea. Not actually follow through [idk tho] ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
4	He’s been typed as an ENTJ on all religious Myers Briggs boards. God of the Old Testament was an INTJ. Jesus Christ was likely INFJ. 
4	I find this subject matter very interesting. The problem is, I don't believe I can contribute to this discussion due to formatting. I'm not a grammer nazi, but that is nearly unreadable. I feel like maybe you could put in a little more effort please? In a sub full of ENTJ it comes off lazy and half-assed.
3	This is actually pretty good.\n\nAl Pacino in the Devil's advocate comes off as more of an ENTP.\n
3	Sounds more like Entp lol
2	I think people miss the point with ENTJ's....You assume we are "evil" or "dictators" but in reality we just have real emotional goals that we use highly focused thinking to accomplish. It isn't that we don't care about you or your emotions, in fact we might care more than you. We just refuse to sit in relish in them. If satan is an ENTJ than so is God because an ENTJ's worst enemy is another ENTJ... I think we should thinking that ENTJ's are all "evil"... Not all ENTJ's are evil but they all have a plan.
2	Satan = ENTP\n\nGod = ESTJ\n\nCase closed.
11	Living out of a storage locker for 2 months, in style!	
6	What do you do for shower/toilet? How does no one smell you cooking? Aren’t there security cameras? So many questions.  
5	So if you're going to do this you have to be totally invisible, like a ghost, leaving literally no signs that you might be living there. So here's a super obvious extension cord that I'm going to pretend is hidden because I zip tied to some conduit for a bit, before it dives down at an odd angle and enters awkwardly through my door. Right beside the antennae I put up - because that's something you see outside a storage unit all the time. \n\nIt would be completely obvious to anyone doing even a cursory inspection of the place. \n\nI stopped watching at that point. I mean kudos for surviving two months living in a storage locker, that must have been tough. But that is a 1/10 for stealth. 
2	Is it even climate control?
2	So, he's just one step up from squatting.  I'd be pissed if I was renting a storage unit and some guy is using a toaster over, hot plate, etc. and can cause a fire.  He's not as stealthy as he thinks he is, I'm sure that if the establishment didn't figure this out another unit would figure it out.
2	I saw it like a year ago, fucking awesome lol
1	Stealthy!\n\n*Has surround sound speakers*\n\nlol
1	You gotta do what you gotta do, but you are making a huge risk here for not very much investment. Is the difference saved financially really worth possible being arrested for trespassing and not having water and a toilet? What's your plan if you're caught? What if you applied for low income housing in the mean time? What is your long term housing plan? Also I did not watch the video because I did not care (I will never need to know how to arrange a storage unit, because if I become homeless I'd rather live in my car). No offense. But if you answered these questions in the video, then I apologize for asking again.
4	Mod Test 1: Popularity	In order to moderate well, you must be able to understand your base. You should seek to represent your active users without constantly pandering to them.\n\nScoring is related to number of upvotes received. You get 2 sentences per question.\n\nQuestion 1: Tell us about yourself.\n\nQuestion 2: How would you go about improving the ENTJ representation in r/ENTJ?\n\nQuestion 3: What is your ideal dog like?
1	Probably too late for anyone to notice, but here goes nothin.\n\n\n\n1. I am a 31 year old typical ENTJ (if such a thing exists among a group of high functioning, take charge, go-getters such as this) who works as a lead man/heavy equipment operator at a quarry. I love analyzing problems, learning new skills and conversating with other ENTJs, especially those from other countries or with drastically different skills or interests.\n\n\n\n2. I believe this to be an excellent place for ENTJ to encourage each other, suggest new ideas and chat with people of a similiar mindset and work ethic. The only ways I see to improve representation would be to keep an eye out for low effort, troll posts, open the chat and a possible regular weekly post for sharing new projects such as u/nobleghost suggested.\n\n\n\n3. Golden retriever. Loyal, intelligent, obedient, beautiful animals.
1	1. Avoiding conspiracies is for sheeple. People skills are for no-talent ass clowns.\n2. Survival of the funniest.\n3. [Hellenic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVRDiq2-uUM)
1	Question 1: Tell us about yourself.\n\n> I do nonprofit work for a living, and I program for "fun"\n\nQuestion 2: How would you go about improving the ENTJ representation in r/ENTJ?\n\n> Reminding us feelings are normal and sometimes matter. Write a journal or something\n\nQuestion 3: What is your ideal dog like?\n\n> A black, retired search and rescue Newfoundland or St. Bernard. Great with children
1	1. I enjoy long walks on the beach at sunset and kittens. Joking, I’m allergic to cats and programming all night long while debating whatever topic comes to mind sounds like heaven. If I had to describe myself in one word I’d say I’m intense. \n\n2. ENTJs are goal oriented leaders but I don’t see that here. I’d make it so we can share our progress on whatever we’re working on in massive weekly threads giving incentive to achieve more and share our passions.\n\n3. My ideal dog would be obedient, calm at home but energetic outdoors, smart enough so I can teach him tricks and protective over our home and loved ones. \n
1	1. Just a regular INFJ who has creative hobbies like music and drawing(not THAAAT good in both though :P). \n\n2. Hmm... Maybe show that ENTJs are still human beings and not heartless CEOs and managers. \n\n3. I like fluffy and cute dogs\n\nWrote this on a whim because I am in a hurry now. Might edit later.
1	Interesting we have more non-ENTJs applying for the job. I wonder if this has to do with ENTJs not wanting to micromanage people? 
1	1. I'm fascinated with human behavior and i love that a sub like this has a bunch of people that are self aware enough to realistically evaluate themselves. Sean Pertwee is my favorite representation of Alfred.\n2. I think a lot of people on here simply want to be an ENTJ personality type. Reality is that it's a pretty rare typing which already makes it a thing to be desired so helping people understand their personality could be a main focus.\n3. Loves to swim and doesn't mind grabbing a beer with me at a bar. Also she can fetch a fresh bottle of water for me if I ask nicely. (good girl)
1	1: Sup bros and dudettes.  I’m Honky Tonk Donkey Kong, and I’m exactly what you imagine me to be.  A 45 year old man with lots of body hair, a love for video games, and a lust for back-alley country bar dancing. You may not like it, but this is what peak male performance looks like.\n\n2. I doubt any of y’all city slickers can hit a lick worth a dick, so I’m gonna show y’all the way we do it back home.\n\n\n3. My ideal dog is a coonhound bitch, no doubt about it.  They can smell the fear, beer, and piss on a white-collar, yellow-belly for miles, and just like ma, won’t ever let you hear the end of it if you let one of these sap-suckers into your home for more than a handshake and a lemonade.\n\nGod bless the U. S. of A. y’all.
7	The more I read things on this sub, the more I feel like an ENTJ	When I took an MBTI test for the first time (on 16Personalities), it first said "INTP", and I didn't question it as I thought it was accurate.\n\nThen I found out I was actually way closer to INTJs in my way of functioning. And now, after having read a lot of things here, it turns out that I could be an ENTJ.\n\nI hate useless conflicts and conversations, I was very shy when I was younger, but I also love talking to people when it's interesting, I sometimes feel small talk with friends can be relaxing, I love nights out in bars and sometimes spend a lot of time thinking about my appearance. Could it be the case of an INTJ? I'm not sure.\n\nAnd after all, I can really relate to that sentence: \n\n>[But, like many ENTJs, if the quality of social interaction available  does not meet a certain standard (depth/ challenge) I withdraw more into  myself to feed my needs and goals.](https://www.reddit.com/r/entj/comments/9nqygt/xntj_feeling_like_an_entj/e7owzbm)\n\nI've already spent a lot of time wondering what my type was, and now I've got no answer again.
8	I knew I had the right one as soon as I read the results, but I have seen many retest and get diff results. Seems like the only one who really knows is you. My wife who is clearly an INFP can take the test four times and get four diff results over thinking the questions lol. I look at it more as a guide to use as long as you are honest with yourself and realize that lumping people together by personality seems to be far from an exact science. To me it's just a group of individuals who think similarly to me but will vary from person to person.
4	Hey, that was my sentence! I read it, and was like, I have seen that before.... wait a minute! \n\nI too misclassified as I for awhile before it all came together for me as well. I am extroverted, because I get the most energy from that right kind of social interaction that has me firing on all cylinders. \n\nJust the other day I took a friend of mine out to lunch. Normally, we have the best conversations that go from psychology, theology to sociology and philosophy. He is real smart cookie that gets people. \n\nSo, I started wondering if he was ENTJ, so I pulled up a quiz and walked him through it, and behold he was. \n\nThat was cool, but it also showed me that there is no situation where a conversation like that would exhaust me. I really am an E, it’s just hard for me to care about a lot of the surface level stuff people tend to talk about.
3	I tested intp at first as well. I’m xNTJ, very borderline on the E/I. I think the test is a good indicator to point you in the right direction but you will only truly find your type after researching what each letter means, and then applying that knowledge to your memories of the life you’ve lived so far.
3	My INTJ bf and I are very similar in a lot of ways. However, I am quicker to act, and I’m usually the one that says what we are both thinking.
2	I can relate, the first time I took the test and got INFP. That was the time of my depressive episode so I guess it makes sense; Fi Grips and all.\n\nThen I decided I was too desperate for organization to be a perceiver and decided on INFJ. And then I realized I was too argumentative and disregarding of the emotions of others to be an Fe user and looked into INTJ. Talked to and watched other INTJs online and turns out I'm a lot more talkative than they are, actually enjoy small talk and harmless gossip/pop culture in small doses, and care about aesthetics, and parties more than they do. \n\nI think it's quite common for ENxx to mistype as the descriptions are overly extroverted. The ENxxs I've met in my life are often quiet and reserved at first even the ENFJs. The difference between them and introverts is how they'll seemingly blossom out of nowhere when discussing ideas they find interesting. With introverts there almost this feeling that you have to draw it out of them.\n\n&#x200B;
1	From what I read about you, I think you are an INTJ. Introverted Intuition is, might say, your first nature. But for ENTJs, it's their second nature.\n\nIf you have an Android device, you may use this app: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aadi.personalitytraittest\n\nOr this website: Truity.com (recommended option).\n\nLet me know the result. 
1	I really relate to that sentence as well; for years, I referred to that attribute as being "antisocial". In a sense, it is; but, it's far more appropriate to refer to that behavior as being selectively social.\n\nIt's not so much that I can't speak to others, or that I don't want to; I only do it if I feel that there's a sense of meaning or value to the potential conversation.
1	Meh.. This isnt very precise for everyone
3	the law of attraction?	do you entjs believe in the law of attraction?by focusing on postive thoughts.you get positive situations?,and vice versa?,there was also an occult audiobook i listened to some time back that speaks about willing things into existence.action at a distance.that if you caltivate your willpower.and visualze and focus on a specific thing you want it can and will manifest thats if your willpower is strong enough..?what do you entjs think about that concept?that implies consiousness over matter.....anyways what do you entjs think about this.and if you dont believe in it.you never know untill you try it.lol.thoughts opinions?
14	No. Law of attraction/ positive thinking is so overrated. It's the source for expectation, and expectation breeds inaction and disappointment. Positive psychology, however, is different from positve thinking/law of attraction, and I like positve psychology. 
5	I personally believe in the Law of Attraction as it has worked for me. Not on an astronomical level such as gaining 20,000 by way of manifestation, BUT I have definitely manifested some opportunities that led to gain, be it materialistic or something else. It’s not just thinking positive and expecting, that’s where the secret fucked up at. It’s about positive thinking, ALIGNED WITH ACTIONS. I can’t manifest a job of my dreams with just positive thinking. I have to go out and APPLY, with the thought of me already having the job. That’s a dumbed down, off the top of my head version of what the LOA is. There are other universal laws one must understand in order for things in your life to be balanced and aligned. The Secret is only about 40% right. 
5	I can't speak for everyone but personally I believe wholeheartedly in the law of attraction. And even if it is just your own positive speaking that puts your mind in a positive place to be more aware of the things that were already there.... As long as it works, it doesn't really matter to me. 
5	How long should you be in a relationship before proposing?	Asking for a friend...
11	If you're wanting an ENTJ approach, not til you've lived together for at least 2-3 years. In that time you'll have seen them in enough situations, and through enough adversity to know what a marriage will be like. Particularly when it comes to lifestyle preferences and finances. If you're happy after that amount of time and can't see any obstacles then you're onto a good thing. Which is different to seeing obstacles and pretending they're fine, or that one of you will change - those are red flags. If you're relatively young and not religious, wait til you're 30 or older. You're more stable, have a better sense of yourself, better finances, and you're less impulsive. Remember that marriage is only a commitment, it won't change the state of your relationship.
5	It depends on many factors actually, the first being the culture your partner and you grew in. You can be in a relationship and know (s)he is not "the one" (that's not really smart but it happens - a lot of people end up marrying "not the one").\n\nAlso, they say there is a 3 years threshold. You may want to go past this one, and be sure you are comfortable living with the person on a day to day basis, which means, having lived at least a year together - can't tell much more, I am on this step of the process currently.
6	Just before you want to have kids, or never.\n\nMarriage isn’t important, love is.
6	Years. Why rush something as important as this? 
2	I think it depends on the people involved. Are they emotionally healthy and ready for this big of a commitment? Some could be in a relationship for 8 years but don't know a thing about each other's values and things that are matters to each other. Some could be in a relationship for a week and know every important thing and help each other overcome personal obstacles. Some could be in a placeholder relationship with or without knowing they're in it. FWB relationship is a form of placeholder relationship. 
4	... it kinda depends on the relationship I would think. I mean personally, I have like weird internal prerequisites that need to be satisfied for me to be confident in the relationship for that. For me those are things like, have we been living together, what do we fight about, do I see a future with this personally, do we have the ability to talk about finances calmly without it affecting our relationship. If those things are positively satisfied I have no reason not to. But at this point some of those things were unsatisfiable in previous relationships or, the relationship ended before we were able to get to that point. May take years, could take months depending on where you and your significant other is in your lives. 
1	For me, I would know if I would want to marry someone very, very quickly, but I would probably not actually propose until I had been dating the person for at least a month.
0	This would be better suited for /r/relationships\n\nRegardless, I believe age and locations really dictates what a good answer would be.\n\nFor my neck of the woods, these ranges appear to be the norm. \n\nSub 30s? Likely a few years. \n\n30-40? At least a year. \n\n40+? Less than a year.
0	I would never propose, I don't believe in marriage 
3	What does a wild ENTJ look like in the wild?	As an INTP, I've wanted to see the social dynamic between myself and someone like an ENTP or an ENTJ. Problem is 1. I don't get out often and 2. I don't know where to find people like the ones I'm looking for. \n\nSo, where can an ENTJ be found normally that isn't their house?
25	You don't find us, we find you
12	Look in these fields: science, medical, a lot of people on here are lawyers, anything that involves or could involve seeking out progress, a fluid environment and a leadership role. \n\nI can’t speak for everyone but if you saw me and a couple of my ENTJ friends you would catch us in one of two modes. Either we seem extremely productive and focused or we seem like total dicks that nobody could love but either way we’re the first ones everyone goes to when they’re in trouble. 
10	I think there are several of us that find careers as teachers- especially the less common female ENTJ. \n\nAs to where we go and how we socialize I personally love a good bar, a fun trivia night, wine tastings or anywhere we can go and direct our friends in an activity. My favorite things to do with my friends are things like escape rooms, trivia nights, competitive activities etc.  But that’s me personally and the one other true ENTJ that I know. 
5	Where you can find me (excluding  my house): Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Class. Work. Work. Work. Tennis Court. Work. Work. Class. Class. Work. Class. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Bar/Club/Lounge. Work. Work. Work. ~~My house~~. Work. Work. (I exaggerate. I have a life, but I definitely do work a lot.) \n\nMy dad and one of my best college friends are INTPs. I get along great with them - I've always been a daddy's boy - but they don't always approve of my inclination toward anger and confrontation, which complicates things.
4	My business partner is an INTP, and he is fucking fantastic.
1	They often look like feelers superficially if they have something to gain from you or testing the waters. Obviously extroverted, chatty (although with focus on themselves or things happening, few personal questions directed at you, contrary to INTJs). They have a strong dramatic Fi side that becomes quickly apparent as they talk about things important to them. When they first meet you they'll ask you your opinion on some arbitrarily important matter(s) (Ni) to test you. You generally find them in their work place as entjs live to work and usually have to have a reason for an outing (I.e. To celebrate something) and rarely spend money on restaurants or go for a coffee just to blow steam off. 
3	Identifying opportunities for growth	Hello all, \n\nI am in my last year of university this year and I am in a new living situation. I lived alone the past few years and really enjoyed it, but this year decided to move in with a roommate for financial reasons, and because I felt last year I isolated myself a bit too much and I hoped this would encourage me to have a bit more of a social life. \n\nMy roommate is an acquaintance I met last year that is entirely pleasant- let's call her Alice. \n\nAlice is totally non-offensive. She is not malicious, she is not needy, and she is not especially annoying. She is a pretty average person and we've always had pleasant, surface level interactions. \n\nBut Alice and I are very different. She tends to sleep in very late, she watches youtube videos and reality TV for hours on end. She doesn't exercise or have any interest in health. She isn't particularly ambitious, and pokes at students who "take university too seriously" (I always point out to her that I am absolutely one of those, but don't both mentioning that I think her view is fundamentally wrong). She also seems to get sick often, and I think this is because she doesn't take care of herself. \n\nI have never had a conversation with her that is intellectually stimulating, in fact, I find my energy and patience depletes very quickly when I'm speaking with her, since I find her lack of understanding, inability to be reflective and general lack of conscientiousness frustrating. To be blunt, I find her lazy, irrational, and uninspiring. \n\nMy immediate inclination is to live independently from her, avoid anything but quick small talk, and just be okay with having her in my space. However, we are living together for the next nine months, and I would like to find in this experience an opportunity for growth, and maybe even turn it into something fulfilling.\n\nDo you guys think it's possibly to have a fulfilling relationship with someone like this? I don't feel a significant amount of respect for her, but I know she is not undeserving of respect. She is not a bad person. \n\nI am hoping for some help identifying some areas or skills that I can build through this experience of living with Alice and interacting with her regularly. I know I will probably encounter many more Alices in my life and I would like to be be able to navigate them will skill without sacrificing my own productivity and goals.   \n\n\nThanks :) 
8	You're an ENTJ, you suck at being patient. Use it as an opportunity to grow your patience with people. If you are able to conquer being around her, think of all the other people you can deal with.
5	I would say that most people are like your roommate. In my opinion, I would recommend sharing a common hobby with her but not really to invest much into her as a business or career partner.\n\nOne thing I'd like to mention is that you are the average of the 5 people you spend most of your time with. Therefore, I recommend taking most of your time networking and making deep connections with high achievers. Then, what you can do is relax with your roommate and others outside this group to take a break from the intense lifestyle 
3	She might be depressed. Now would be the time for depression to manifest itself.\n\nI wouldn't go about asking her that though. 
2	I used to have a roomate like that. This is not much to do with being an ENTJ but learning how to live with others. Respect others even if you don’t agree with them. From your description, I don’t see her annoy you but your perspectives of her annoys yourself. Stop trying to change other people. They won’t change because of you. Focus on yourself and learn to not give a fuck about everything. Spend more time with people who give you energy and avoid those that suck yours.\nNot everyone wants to achieve, learn and grow like we do. You have to learn to respect others’ ways of life.
2	I think everyone deserves a basic level of respect. As long as you have no issues with her as a roommate (she keeps the area clean, etc), then you don't need to pursue a deeper friendship with her if you don't want to.  Chances are you're not her cup of tea, either. Use MBTI as a tool for understanding the people around you and not a way to isolate yourself from others. 
2	I have been in similar situations, and from my experience it is probably not likely to be a very fulfilling relationship.  This is completely fine.  You won't get along with 100% of the people you meet in your life and you shouldn't waste your precious time trying to for the sake of the opportunity cost.   Your time will be better invested looking for people you have more in common with and you will feel much more gratified if you do so.  I actually would probably do what you have already suggested and just kind of make small talk and live independent lives for the most part.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat being said, if you really want to try to become better friends, then I would start by being genuinely interested in listening to her and learning about her interests.  You'd be surprised at how much more depth there is to someone than what they initially show you.  Then try to find a common denominator and make those your points of discussion/hangouts.  
1	> My immediate inclination is to live independently from her, avoid anything but quick small talk, and just be okay with having her in my space.\n\nGood, simple plan.\n\n> However, we are living together for the next nine months, and I would like to find in this experience an opportunity for growth, and maybe even turn it into something fulfilling.\n\nA lot more can go wrong than go right. Don't underestimate the irrational.\n\n> I know I will probably encounter many more Alices in my life and I would like to be be able to navigate them will skill without sacrificing my own productivity and goals.\n\nAvoid them. Work your fucking ass off to find half-decent roommates if you can't live alone. It will be worth it.\n\nI have a lot of experience dealing with people at the bottom. The only real lesson I learned is that I do not want to be at the bottom. You can't help the lazy and the unmotivated.\n
4	The Walking Dead MBTI - mentalfloss.com	I'm so pissed that cheater was labeled an [ENTJ](https://images.mentalfloss.com/sites/default/files/1389760004.png)

3	ENFP striding for ENTJ values	I'm an ENFP and currently working on my bachelor's degree in IR. I have a lot of trouble when it comes for having a fix look in my perspectives, specially as an student, even though I know I'm capable. I have a great time making professional acquaintances and creating schedules when needed, but it all goes down right as I overthink about what I'm trying to accomplish for myself, I don't know if I want money, the title or something else, and this usually happens weekly, derailing any type of consistency in my academic mindset. I'd like to know more about you ENTJ, how the heck do you stay on such tip top motivation to finish things up or just not worrying too much about self imposed expectations? 
9	Understand your values and what these values want in life. The ENFP in my life (Most of my friends are ENFP) have this never ending battle of making decisions on what they want to do vs what is smart to do. \n\nUs ENTJ are different, we mostly go by what we deem as smart to do. This inherent nature drives us to orient out lives around this simple way of looking at life. \n\nLet me ask you something. Why do you want a bachelor's degree in IR, what can you do with it, and how likely can you pursue a career in that area with that degree (have you looked at the metrics?), and will this degree aid you and your values?.
4	Look at the data in front of you.  Integrate your personal desires into the equation.  Come up with an option or two, then go with whichever sounds best for you and your long term goals.  You need to evaluate what you need, not just what you want.  What you want is secondary.  The fun stuff comes after being attentive to your needs.\n\nMy husband is an ENFP.  If it were up to him, the fun stuff would always come first, and he's more concerned about today than ten years down the road.  \n 
3	I don't know what I want either. But I know that being without money, education, or a prestigious job, I'll be nowhere in life. So I deliberately target those things. Why do you care that you don't know what you want? Would you act any differently if you suddenly realised you're not in it for the money?

6	It’ll be a night in watching horror films with babe. I’m still gonna dress in my gorilla onesie and he’ll be wearing a yeti onesie. Scarfing down pizza and loads of sweets. Im on a diet so I’ll be looking forward to Halloween, it’s my cheat day. What will you be wearing?

This year, I am a murder unicorn..... black lipstick and eye makeup, a black horn, red long wig and a black onsie that gives "I'll knife you" vibes with a red sash for a tail.  My friend is going to be my victim, with a unicorn sticking through her and blood makeup, etc.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI like being a unicorn every year because I don't have to come up with a totally new concept every year, but still get to be creative and have some fun dressing up!  
2	I don't dress up for Halloween. I work. Mostly to avoid trick-or-treaters.
2	I’ll go nerdy this year dressing as a chemical element: Hassium (named after Hesse in Germany). My costume is more like a gag one making fun of myself.\n\nWill either go casually wearing a shirt with the state flag plus a can of apple cider, or the Hessian historic dress from German eBay. 
1	I'm going to be myself. \n\nYou could say that it does match my personality quite well.

13	I love silly people, they're so much fun. Of course, if that in no way interfere with work. 
10	That sounds like someone with an unhealthy and immature relationship with Fi, honestly. Keep in mind that anyone can be a bully, it's all about how they relate to themselves and of they can't or don't, then it's likely that they'll end up being a shitty person. 
6	I don’t really like silly behavior but I wouldn’t crush someone for it. I don’t just harass someone simply because I don’t like them, I don’t have time for petty things. I will always call someone out on their bullshit and idgaf about any crying or pity pleas. If it’s the same person with the same nonsense I’ll keep calling them out. If that makes me a bully, then sure. 
5	Yes. I know because sometimes I'm a mean mofo like that. But even if ENTJs don't try to be mean, we just naturally sway others a little, I don't think we're always aware of it
3	My ENTJ friend can be mean and a bully but only when someone challenges the idea that he isn't in control, he likes being the alpha male. And when he does it he doesn't make it explicit or obvious it's more manipulative or under the guise of a joke, bearing in mind he's extremely witty (probably the funniest person I have met) but usually has others at the butt of the joke. I've never had this problem with him because he genuinely likes to have meaningful conversations with me and I have no reason to challenge him/I don't dominate social situations. However when we were on holiday he silently bullied my ESFP friend who is quite alpha male in himself and usually at the centre of conversation/jokes. 
4	Fun fact. Meyer’s Briggs has literally zero scientific backing. Opinion? Don’t blame shitty behaviour on an imaginary “personality type”. 
2	won't go out of my way to be a prick but sometimes what I do gets construed as insensitive and to a good proportion of people, that's more than enough to label you a bully. \n\neg: if someone was incompetent, telling them to their face that they are and making them fix it may just be second nature to us but to people around, they may mistake it for us being sadistic when it is merely a matter of getting the job done. \n\nRegarding cronies, all kinds will follow if you lead them right. Why do you have a particular fixation with the ESTP? 
1	ExxJ are the bullies. Te and fe are the most naturally aligned with what everyone thinks or i guess feels.
1	I think what you said makes sense.  I have to try hard not to constantly take nips at people.  I look at it as being witty, but in reality it’s me being a douche and trying to get laughs at someone else’s expense.  It’s something I’m working on.  \n\nAnother factor that could compound this is that I am the oldest of three kids and we all playfully pick on each other.  We are super close and don’t get mad.  So I had to learn that picking on others like I did my siblings doesn’t go over well with all people.  
1	Yes entj are bullies. Sometimes they aren't even being bullies consciously. They just like what they're doing.
7	Do you think you have unorthodox viewpoints?	It can be in politics or religion, perhaps your beliefs are radical or perhaps they're simply weird. Do you generally go with the mainstream or are you unorthodox?
7	i am predictably non-conformist.
5	I'm conservative, but also atheist. I never like to look at anything at face value. The question I always ask myself, is who wins and who loses from x.
5	Compared to the majority of others within groups that I willingly consider myself associated with, yes. I'd say that most of my views are generally held by others in the group, though never at a majority level. 
4	I’m very unorthodox, the funny thing is I say the things some people are too insecure to say. 
2	I wouldn't say the viewpoints are unorthodox so much as my path to get to my ultimate viewpoint is. I make decisions logically with little emotional input unless the decision will effect the well being of people I care for. If it does I err on the side of benefiting those around me and the logical reasoning takes a back seat.   
2	I’m fucking unorthodox, bonus for living in a very conservative place.\n\nPeople will freak out knowing I’m actually Christian. I chose so for filling the spiritual gap, which exceed the scope of rationality. Rationality is important but unable to answer all the answers, yet I’m often confused why I became religious and whether god exists or not . IMHO it should be between 99.99999999% and 0.00000001%, and never 100% or 0%. (infinitely close to both ends for better understandings)\n\nI criticise a lot on religion, support same-sex marriage (unfortunately in my place LGBT people are treated as subhumans), listen to extreme metal(death, black and co., except NSBM for the  i ideology), read anti-religion memes (plus laughing at them, admit many of them do hit the point ), talk in innuendos and toilet humour especially among friends. Religious and non-religious, theists and atheists alike come in all forms and there’s no absolute answer whether a person is a true *insert label here* or not.
1	I've met a couple ENTJs with whacko viewpoints, and what really irks be about them is that they're "black and white" - absolutist - as in, it's their way or the highway. I sometimes find myself in a similar mindset but have taken it upon myself to understand all sides, which is controversial from time to time. I make a concerted effort to veer away from radicalism but I think that's an odd trait for ENTJs to be conscious of.
1	Largely unorthodox,  but not everyone I know needs to hear it or is prepared to hear my real viewpoint so I often don’t mention it.
2	I have pretty far left political views, and believe (a little) in astrology, so there's that. 
0	Perhaps this is a separate question worth asking, but does above average IQ relate to being an ENTJ, and therefore having unorthodox viewpoints?  I can't recall my exact score, but my IQ is in the low 140s.  I'm curious if there is a correlation there with other ENTJs...
2	Calling fellow ENTJs! Now Family Vs. Important Life Goals. 18M Seeking advice.	My fellow brothers, I'm sure you've had a problem like this before, I seek your valuable advice and council. \n\nMy family is coming to visit me at college this upcoming weekend and they continuously state they want to spend the entire weekend with me doing activities and the like. Thing is, I have a Calculus 3 Mid Term Exam on Monday and a Physics Mid-Term Exam tomorrow. Since I'm part of two research groups (ProtoDUNE and another) I do not have the time to spend more than a few hours with them. We've Skyped for an hour once a week to keep in touch. My family and I have always fought in the past on my choosing to attend business or academic conferences over birthday parties, research and study over family movies...\n\nNow that I'm 18, and a full time student in college I know I have a right to pursue my endeavors. Since this is my first semester in college, GPA is vital; this results in mid-term exams being very important. I withstood their constant teasing, harassment, and belittling in high-school for fear of them not paying for college (they threatened it). I won't stand it. They won't listen to what I tell them nor listen to logic. I don't want them isolating me in college as well. I'm really looking for advice here, because at this point, besides cutting all ties, I don't know what to do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nExtended Info. : Family attending the weekend event at my university centered around activities for visiting families. Both parents and all three siblings will be in attendance. They will arrive 10pm Friday and leave 6pm Sunday. \n\nTLDR: Parents coming to visit, stating they won't give me time to study for important Mid-Terms. I'm looking for advice on what to do and how to handle them when they come this weekend and in the long run.
3	25, full time student and work full time. College is nothing like high school and you need to make that clear to your family. High school is free. You pay to be in college and it has a bigger effect on your future. I have to tell my family no to thing very often but they need to understand that good grades don’t just happen in college like they do in HS. It took a real sit down heart to heart conversation with my mother letting her know that this shit is hard and I can’t afford to be lazy with it.
1	Tell them you need to take time to study for your test and that you will need half a day or so. Any family should be able to recognize this need. So just be an adult and leave them to study at the appointed time. It’s really not confusing. Your life and success is your own jurisdiction.
1	>My fellow brothers, I'm sure you've had a problem like this before, I seek your valuable advice and council. \n\nNerd\n\n>Thing is, I have a Calculus 3 Mid Term Exam on Monday and a Physics Mid-Term Exam tomorrow. \n\nI was kidding, but now I'm serious.\n\n>We've Skyped for an hour once a week to keep in touch. \n\nGood boy.\n\n>Now that I'm 18, and a full time student in college I know I have a right to pursue my endeavors. \n\nYou do. But...\n\n>for fear of them not paying for college (they threatened it). \n\n...so do they. Monkey dances for the hand that feeds it. And right now you're the monkey, Monkey. So unless you want that cheddar to stop rolling, you better dance.\n\nMy advice:\n\nLet them hang out with you, but be clear that you'll be studying the whole time. If they complain, enthusiastically offer to let them help you.\n\nGive them 2 hours of your undivided attention, and let them pick when that is. If you can give more, then do. They're your family and it sounds like they're paying for college for you.
1	Tell them everything you said here. Present it to them in a way, (however you want to manipulate the words is up to you) Present what you say in a way, that when you tell it to them, they will feel compelled that you are struggling, & they will want to help you by giving you the time you need. The more you stress it's "an emotional burden having to bla bla bla all this studying" The MORE empathetic they will be to helping you. Also, talk about a later meet up, so they also have something to look forward to. Give them as much as you can, without actually giving it to them.\n\nIf you have to be more direct, then fuck it! When you're hanging out with them, spend 99% of your time studying, & if they ask why, tell them you don't have a choice because of what's in front of you. After all, that is pretty much true anyway!
1	Worst case scenario you can just take loans out. Don't be afraid to say no. Sounds like you're well on your way to getting an engineering degree. 
-1	This is in no way easy. I have this problem myself. The way I resolved it was to simply go along with their bullshit needs. No amount of explaining or discussing would get them to put my future ahead of their desire to “be a family.” They miss you and it’s irrational to risk your grades at this point in life but unless you wanna completely cut ties and be financially independent then just pretend to care and study whenever you can (lunch,  late at night, whatever). \n\nI also have a family that would risk my grades and ruin my study time because their need to “be a family” is so strong they can’t look past that. My uncle was half way to see me during final exams (I go to college on the other side of the country) before me finding out and telling him to go back. My mum called me during my final exam (knowing it was my final exam) because she wanted to talk to me about going back home to see her. \n\nDo whatever you need to succeed. 
3	Is Sheogorath ENTJ?	
1	[yes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COh-DVxqI9g)
1	Holy shit I was thinking about this earlier 
10	Who's into metal?	I'm into the 80s thrash and some newer bands like Lamb of God and Gojira. Plus a little bit of grunge. 
6	Meshuggah. 
5	Parkaway Drive, As i lay Dying, Arch Enemy, Amon Amarth.. many many more.\n\nI found a lot of NT types beign metalheads 
3	Metallica
2	Personally into Powerwolf, Blut aus Nord (Black industrial), Rammstein, Amon Amarth and Immortal... also love folk bands such as Finntroll, Arkona and Skyforger. This might be quite surprising since I look like a fairy tale girl IRL and have a soft spot on cute things, along with edgier things such as mysteries, extreme weather and serial murders.\n\nRecently also discovered hard rock and metal using Japanese instruments, since I’m a huge fan of Touken Ranbu (app/ Browser game base on Katanas, with lots of beautiful BGM and history facts mixed inside) and I love anything traditional with modern elements.
1	I am too!
1	I'm in to all kinds of music, but I definitely have a soft spot for metal. The really, really heavy stuff like Converge and Dillinger Escape Plan. And the doomy stuff like Pallbearer and Boris.
1	Gojira is great! I just went to see Acacia Strain, Erra, and Make Them Suffer last week. 
1	I dabble a bit at the borderline. Disturbed is one of my favorite bands but many metalheads would classify them as hard rock. I also like symphonic metal.
1	80s rock music is the best ever!\nI love metal - just discovered Sylosis - standard tuning, good trash.
1	Old school metal, yes.  Modern, no. 
1	I have more 80's metal, and I cannot deny alot of it is "hair metal" than anything else. I just loved that era of music, it's far above any other category!\n\nLess known bands that I found were awesome:\nIcon - Especially their second album, Eddie Kramer was involved in this, but then the lead singer left before they went on tour to really promote this album. If that didn't happen, Icon would likely be more well known!\n\nBonfire - Dont touch the Light & Fireworks albums !!!\n\nBlack 'n Blue - From Portland Ore.\n\nFirehouse (They were later but had to get their first 2 albums)\n\nKing Kobra - Ready to Strike is AWESOME!!!\n\nLizzy Borden does some good stuff too, especially like Visual Lies!\n\nLoudness - This band from Japan was awesome! Especially the Thunder - Lightning - Hurricane albums!\n\nKingdom Come - They were called Kingdom Clone but I still liked them, didn't care!\n\nWarlock - Doro rocks here!
14	What careers have you chosen?	What led you to make that decision? Do you regret it? On a scale of 1 to 10 how would you rate it? 
7	I'm a Pediatric Nephrologist. I'd give it a 8-9/10. I really enjoy patient care. My quality improvent work and research allow me to better my field, patient outcomes, and to continue to learn new things/have creative control of my time. I would absolutely choose it again, even though it took 14 years post high school to complete training. 
6	Lawyer, criminal law.  Led by culmination of different opportunities and experiences combined with natural aptitude. 8/10, I love it. Haven’t been at it long enough to decide if I regret it or not. When and if I get bored of it and can’t make an easy move to something else, I might regret it. For now it’s great. 
6	GC/CCO hedge fund/private equity 
6	Software developer. I've been coding since I was 11 and loved doing it for fun. I sort of regret doing it for a living because I haven't coded for fun in a loooong time, but I honestly don't know what I'd be doing otherwise so I suppose this is my path.\n\nThe job has good days and bad days and a whole lot of "meh" days. I'd give it a low 6/10.
3	I'm a YouTuber who just learned about my ENTJ personality type through 16personalities.com and was introduced to it all through a friend of mine with INTP. I was also diagnosed with Asperger when I was young, if that has any significance.\n\nI love Counter-Strike. That game got me hooked since I turned 10. I also like movies, music, anything creative, artistic and inspirational. The decision to be a full-time content creator was simply followed by what I'm most passionate about. \n\nDo I regret it? Let's just say I should have started way earlier but I was too scared of leaving my previous job. I used to work as an IT-supporter/consultant but I always felt like I could do something better which would fit my personality more. Being in charge of your own shit is the shit.\n\n10.
3	I'm a technical writer and love it. I had planned on being a HS lit teacher, but God had other plans. I'm not teaching the students that I expected, but am teaching and reaching a different audience, who needs good docs. 
3	(preface: apologies for formatting) I'm in school for costume studies, which I really enjoy. On the books side, it satisfies my desire for research, particularly learning about history and human culture, artefact analysis, etc. I'm always learning new things, and learning that I'm interested in things I wouldn't have thought of before. E.g. I didn't know I actually cared about history until I had something tangible to put into the context of a culture/civilization. I also never realized how important clothing was to human culture, both as something practical and as a form of expression.\n\n On the technical side of things, I've learned how to sew and tailor, draft patterns (which I love because it's very technical), and drape garments. I find sewing rewarding because it's so precise. I can see the result right away if I put time and focus into it, and it anyways looks SO much better than if it's rushed/done without care. It really checks all my boxes so far: interesting, creative, changing, requires really good time management... So on. Currently I'm recreating a gown from ~1759/60 and 3.5 years ago I didn't know how to sew at all. For me personally, it's 10/10 
3	Credit analyst in corporate banking. Been doing it for a few years. \n\nPay is 8/10.\n\nWork hours are 2/10.\n\nWork interestingness is 5/10.\n\nOverall 5/10.\n\nI don’t recommend banking. Finance is ok, just don’t do it at a bank.
2	Professional painter/contractor
2	I work as an IT consultant at a big corp
2	Lawyer. My intuition led me here 
2	Loan underwriting. I love my job. 
2	Lawyer. Hate it. 
2	Piping designer, almost 7 years now. I was in art school and switched to engineering after 1 year.  \n\nI don’t regret switching. I did foresee struggling to find a career had I stayed in art school. My strengths were not in math and surprisingly, I thrived and enjoyed learning fluid mechanics and thermodynamics. Those were fun subjects in school. \n\nI rate it about an 8/10. I worked my ass of in school to be where I am and with all the downturns and recession, I survived not being laid off.\n\nMy work is mostly independent meaning I produce drawings, usually site visits I look forward to as well, and when something I think is not feasible, I let the engineer know and enjoy it when my way is followed and enjoy it more when I learn something new and my initial thought process is not feasible. I just got my first capital project and I’m excited to work with multiple disciplines for it because it’s been a while since I worked in teams and it’s a bigger project than what I’ve been usually working on. I look forward to leading a project one day. But personally, one has to learn to follow before becoming a leader (a great one, anyway). 
2	Video producer. 
3	Sculptor. 10/10. Loved my job and would never change it
2	Law school student I plan on getting into corporate law 
1	Engineer turned optometrist. Has given me a lot of laterally. Wouldn’t be happy unless I owned my own practice like I do...
1	I'm a cook. I don't love it or hate it, but I've been doing it for a while now, so I'm pretty good at it. I do enjoy cooking a good meal and definitely like when others appreciate what I cook for them. It's a useful skill, and I'm glad to have it, but the money isn't great, so the plan is to go to a trade school and learn something that will make me more money.
1	CEO/COO of a dive service
1	Changes to software development this year from previous backoffice work. We do different kinds of projects with my team, our main goal is to automate backoffice work as much as we can so people can work more efficiently. 10/10 thanks to the fact that my team is full of chill dudes & gals. 
1	Running a business. Super fun!
1	Computer Programmer / Books Writer 
1	I am the General Manager of Food and Beverage of an Amphitheater. Was an event planner throughout college. Music is one of my passions. It’s a great career and love my company. It’s just very long hours during our concert season and a lot of physical and mental work. Also I’ve become jaded to large concerts now. I use to love to go as a patron. Now, not so much. Rather unfortunate actually. I miss enjoying an event as a standard concert goer. I would rate my job 7/10. 
1	I wear many hats relating to funding development, both real estate related and economic development (small business/non-profit funding), which includes everything from urban planning to underwriting to project management.  I'm potentially changing careers for the second time, as I recently graduated from law school.  The JD will likely get me an increased income, and I'm debating whether to practice if I pass the CA bar, as I currently make more than entry level attorneys... unless I open my own practice.  Opening my own practice, in a hybrid fashion, like an attorney/consulting firm, might be an option.  We'll see.   
1	Engineer/Project Manager: 8/10.Led me to it: strength in math and scienceDo I regret it: no.\n\nI like working with innovative technology, and in a professional field where my experiences push me along a career path where the future is brighter. I worked in a blue-chip, non-innovative company - this didn't work well (defensive vs future-oriented).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI like creativity/entrepreneurial spirit: I like thinking about the future and making something new happen. Making big-picture observations and organizing people toward that vision is satisfying - however, I am also risk-adverse: as a result I am a project-level employee, which leaves me with an objective and plan that is handed to me. I am achieving someone else's goal and doing the foot-work to make it happen. I don't like this part of it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am optimistic I'll make it work eventually: I sent a proposal to a senior at my company about offering a new service to our clients yesterday... here's hoping senior management shares my vision and give me a green-light to make it happen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI only just came across this personality test/classification today and find it's mostly accurate. I think it really helped me find clarify on what about my job isn't satisfactory and what I need to do to feel fulfilled.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSomething very interesting thing I read about entj that applies to careers is this: "if he doesn't find emotional support, his fighting spirits quickly dwindle." This is true. I'm a single dude, and have found more success professionally when I was in a healthy, supportive relationship. These pursuits are much more meaningful when there's something at stake aside from my personal ambition.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
1	IT Manager, I kind of regret my decision. I was always good at tech stuff but i have a undergrad in business and a MBA; I wish i would have either gotten into Law or Finance. I am finally moving into a position where I deal more in strategy which I am liking a lot more. I'd give it a 7/10
1	Technical content writer \n\nFell into my lap after I wrote regular content for years. Despite being extroverted I can’t play nice in work environments if I’m not in charge and just accept this about myself, I hate the inefficiency of others and won’t be subjected to it. Writing from home seemed to be the solution, I could be my own boss and I have a big enough social life that I don’t feel isolated or lonely. I’ve had a lot of jobs from being a prep cooker to writing erotic novels to managing marijuana grows (being a maniac who doesn’t get stepped on is a general job requirement / being a workaholic). People into weed love cryptocurrency, learned about it from a traveler I met working out west and went home and did the damn thing; quit my lower paying mechanical-fluffy writing jobs. \n\n7/10 - bad marketing right now, lack of stability, people in tech right now are delusional and want everything for nothing harvesting cheap labor from gig economy victims. And writing all day can be intellectually draining. Love the pay I’ve fought for tooth and nail and alllllll the flexibility. So much flexibility. But it took me 5 years of writing to get here. \n
1	Product manager in the software industry. 9/10. Moving in the direction of eventual CEO. 
4	How To Social Engineer ENTJs (Particularly ENTJ Women) By Youtuber C.S. Joseph	
8	I watched about half.  My thought is that ENTJs have superior bullshit detectors, thus are going to be much more difficult to "socially engineer."  An ENTJ woman isn't *made to believe* she is in control, because she actually is in control.  She may allow a man to believe that he's pulled some cheesy manipulation act on her, but she is well aware -- merely letting him believe what he wants because she doesn't feel like wasting her energy on pointing it out.  At least that's my experience.    
7	Oh dear. This is an elaborate wet dream of CS Joseph's, where he meets our emotional needs so well that we take him home. \n\nHe thinks that we're all damaged and insecure because our dads and all of the men we've met find us emasculating and unfeminine. Apparently we're insecure about loyalty and starved for affection, and all the guy needs to do is acknowledge us. Oh god, then he compares us to Donald Trump.\n\nIt's a mishmash of MBTI and pickup artist bs, through the lens of Fe Tertiary which thinks feelings are the best way to manoeuvre people.   \n\n\nNEXT!  \n
2	Interesting video, but it's too long. I watched it with fast speed, and actually finished the whole thing. Thanks for sharing

3	He’s really bad at typing people. 
16	Help! Unable to get interested in girls.	I'm an ENTJ and I am sexually attracted to females only. However, for some reason, I don't feel interested in any. It's been 2+ years. I do have a casual crush once in a while, but then I get bored. What is wrong with me? I fear I'll never be able to connect with someone romantically because of my habit of feeling uninterested in them from the get go.
14	I'm an ENTJ girl, but I feel the same way about guys. At least for me it's because:\n\n1. I feel like the best version of myself when single\n\n2. I have very very strong mental connections with my very close friends, which fills the longing and loneliness void that drives most people towards attachment\n\n3. I seek the surreal, and after a few years of experience, everything and everyone just seems normal\n\n4. I'm uncomfortable making emotionally-driven decisions, which prevents me from getting close to a crush/potential partner\n\nI think I'm probably going to end up in one of those relationships where you're more like companions, or mutually beneficial partners. Every other type of relationship is just a vacation.
9	Maybe you’re a raging narcissist who can only find interest in himself, not to offend, I’ve met people who feel the same and the truth is they get bored because people start talking about themselves and you just wanna hear yourself or hear someone talk about you which happens mostly in the very beginning of a relationship. \n\nWhatever the case, look within yourself and review your memories to analyze a pattern of how/when/why you lose interest. 
6	That's so strange I actually went about 2 years once without any type of relationship.... And it wasn't from lack of game or being ugly lol, I just couldn't seem to give a Damn. Then I met my wife, who is an INFP. I found (and still do to this day) her unbelievably intriguing. At that time I still felt that I didn't want a serious relationship and told her so.  That didn't work lol... I found her so fascinating... The way she looked at the world, her spirit, the way she always seemed so alive. Anyways enough rambling lol, but i wouldnt worry about it too much. Life has a funny way of bringing people together when they least expect it.
10	I've been like this for a while myself, a few years or so perhaps. I wouldn't worry about it too much - just keep living your life and perhaps you'll feel differently about one specific person in the future. Personally I don't think it's down to people being boring, more that we're not a very emotionally expressive type.
5	Some possibilities:  \nHeterosexual but aromantic  \nDepressed (get that checked out)  \nLow-testosterone (that too)  \nSomething else entirely
2	[deleted]
2	Maybe you're aromantic 
2	I'm pretty much 100% the same.
2	Yeah, it’s the same for me. I think I really only get those casual crushes when I’m bored and want something (someone) to keep my mind busy. But nobody has been able to keep my interest. I don’t really want a relationship at this point in my life anyway so I’m unbothered by it. 
2	ENTJ's are pretty good at reading people so it can be hard for someone to keep your interest. You figure them out before you ever really need to get information out of them. If someone isn't interesting then you obviously get bored. There are girl out there that are legit interesting and not simple to figure out. That may be the challenge you need to hold your interest. Keep putting yourself out there and eventually a girl will come around that really peaks your interest.
1	Maybe you're looking at the wrong place. Go somewhere that you think interesting people in your opinion might be. Of course, the amount of effort you put in to get to know someone matters too. Maybe you're into introverts who really take time to open up. Who knows?
1	How old are you? There are plenty of interesting people in the world, you'll meet some of them eventually.
18	Looking for junior mod talent	In true ENTJ fashion, I want ~~somebody to do all the work for me while I take all the credit~~ to promote succession planning in motivated individuals.\n\nI'm looking for 2 candidates so that they ~~snitch on each other~~ work as a team for the betterment of the sub. Given how infrequently this sub gets posts, I'll give it 3 weeks before I decide on my candidates. \n\n*Qualifications:*  \nMentally unstable enough to seriously consider moderating this subreddit, but not unstable enough that I'll regret promoting you.  \nPreference for ENTJs and ISFJs, but will consider Sagittariuses and Reds (of the 4 color system) that also happen to be Type B.  \nMust appreciate the little things in life.  \nMust have been a redditor for at least one year, but no more than 3.  \nMust be able to commit to at least 3 (metaphorical) fucks given per month.  \nMust be active on reddit at least twice a week, and must cooperate with the other candidate.  \nKnowledge of subreddit design is a plus.  \nKnowledge of Korean is not required.
1	To clear some things up, this comment will be serious.\n\nFor a rare personality type, the ENTJ personality type label attracts a lot of kinds of people. Many of these kinds of people are insufferably stiff and literal, take pleasure in petty power trips, and are surprisingly arrogant. \n\nI'm not looking for a Julius Caesar. This isn't an "I'd rather be 1st in a small village than 2nd in Rome thing."\n\nThe ENTJ label also attracts people that are friendly, flexible, ingenious, and driven. Sympathetic people with an amazing sense of humor and a desire to make positive change in the world.\n\nSo if you took the post above and thought "wtf is the mod high on now", then I'm not looking for you. The whole "Korean is not required" part was obviously a joke. You do need to know it, or I won't consider you.
5	Awesome! I would like to moderate. My qualifications: I've been banned by /r/intj and /r/entp and I've got the right attitude. I also got auto-banned from a few subs for posting a comment at /r/the_donald.\n
2	Entj, Sagittarius, Red, Type B, oh I don't have the fucks to give, and I was going so well 
2	I think you’re better off looking for potential in posts/comments in the sub. Then you can see if anyone covers your wildly specific requirements.

12	can someone explain Ni to me?	whats the difference between Ne and Ni, and how does it apply to ENTJ vs ENTP?\n\n
9	E = external, objective. I = internal, subjective.\n\nNe is active; Ni tends to be passive. Ne is brainstorming - connecting concepts regarding things that exist. Ni is partly about epiphanies, finding hidden meaning, sometimes connecting concepts rather than physical things. Ne is fast; Ni is slow, works as a background task until either it is needed or it needs to tell you something. Ni is very hard to control. it is kind of independent of "you". You can present it with tasks and problems and it will go off and disappear and ponder on those, unless the question is familiar. Once it is done (and that can take awhile), it will come back and announce itself. Or it could provide you with a spider sense about something when you are not actively asking it to do anything. Just a very strong gut feeling that you can't immediately explain but better pay attention to for it is right frequently enough to matter.\n\nENTJ vs ENTP is not the best comparison because Ne is the first function of the ENTP whereas Ni is the second function of an ENTJ.\n\nENTJs are often too busy doing shit, so their Ni is not always utilized. You might want to ask the INTJs.\n\nBeware - INTJs don't always get along with ENTPs well because INTJs are weird condescending dorks.\n
5	Ne gathers new concepts, Ni organizes concepts.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/m8UlqJxSqLU
2	Physiologically, Ni is a whole-brain function. Meaning, Ni isn't correlated with brain activity in a specific region, but rather low activity throughout the entire brain. It's described as being a "zen like" function. (See Dario Nardi)\nWhat does this mean? In practice, Ni is the synthesis of information. What's special about Ni is that this synthesis happens in the background, almost subconsciously, and presents itself as little epiphanies. Whereas Ne is quick and responsive to stimuli, Ni may have an epiphany about something that happened days or weeks ago while doing something as mundane as brushing their teeth. For me as an ENTJ, it's easiest to tap into my Ni revelations through long conversations or stream of consciousness writing.\nUnlike Si (which is also about synthesizing information and coming to conclusions), Ni is future oriented. This is also why Ni users tend to get gut feelings. Also, whereas people with Si are more likely to get nostalgic and attached to the past, Ni can get overly-attached to their vision of the future.
2	I wrote up a post about Ni from an INTJ perspective here: https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/8shn3y/my_perspective_on_ni_vs_ne/\n\n\nI hope it helps, let me know if you'd like me to clarify anything.
1	Its right before san and right after ichi :)

8	long periods of turning emotions off	i know we are knowing for being able to turn out emotions on and off like switched, but do yall also have general periods of time when you are on a big "emotion turned off" period or another more lax, "emotion on" (even though its always still filtered and managed, its not completely eradicated). During the "emotion turned off" period, I find myself, for maybe months at a time, being extra efficient and hard working and extremely logical in my thinking, especially with the way I think my emotions. Its a time period of very cold persona. Within this period, I can still have emotions, its just extra, extra suppressed. 
5	Lol I feel like mine are always off.. but when they turn on, its like a fucking volcano
5	I think I did that when I was a child. My parents were discussing divorce (they didn't though) and at that point in time I was just thinking about which parent I'd go with, if I had the choice (I decided on my father because he had a higher-paying job) I wasn't even upset. \n\nI was like 9,, it's a lot better now for me. I still do have these switches but it's a lot less frequent and only happens when I'm stressed. My emotion 'on' isn't that dramatic though, like I'm still a little cold but not as bad as if my emotions were 'off' \n\n[ sorry if i missed the point of your question ] 
4	Really familiar. I am entering the “off” period now after a prolonged and unusual “on” period that wrecked me a little bit. \n\nFeels good man 
2	I see it as when we get knocked out.. it can be emotional. But we are going to get back up again because what doesn't kill us makes our Te stronger. 
1	I get this phenomenon \n\nI’m in one of the “emotions turned off” phases right now. I could not be more happy.
2	ENTJ's favorite sport	Personal mine is baseball because of the high competition in the games and the different strategy involved. 
17	Fuck baseball. What a boring sport.\n\nMMA would be my favorite. I like it for the same reasons you like baseball.
6	Im sorry, but in my humble opinion baseball is trash, football is #1 for sure. It’s the closest sport we have to war today. Biggest, strongest, fastest athletes fighting for every inch of the field. So much strategy. So much team work on the field and leadership from coaches and management is necessary to win the Super Bowl. Because of this most athletes are super team driven, no room for egos on the field. It’s all about what you can do for the team, not what the team can do for you. 
2	[deleted]
2	I really love football, MMA, boxing, F1, tennis. \n\nThey all require a mastery of physicality, mentality, strategy and performance under duress. I’m constantly fascinated by what these athletes can do with their bodies. They push themselves so far beyond limits and I admire that immensely. I only wish I could have gone into sports from an early age. I think I would have excelled. 
1	Chess biking and debating things?
1	Motorsports (what's left of it, sadly) and French kickboxing. I enjoy football\* a lot.\n\n\*football, not handegg, fellow americans.
1	Sport shooting, as it is about focus and control. A single mistake in the proper steps will fail you in competitive shooting but and the success is evident when you succeed.    
1	i played a lot of basketball when I was younger, and generally enjoyed playing point guard the most, which seems to be a very ENTJ thing to do
1	I'm too competitive, so I've never really been into team sports.  I lean towards things I can do on my own, like running, where I'm accountable to only myself.
1	Golf. Personal Responsibility.
1	MMA or Muay Thai. Go hard or go home.\n\nNot boxing though, not going to have some dumb ref or judge decide what I can or cannot do and who wins.
-1	Sports are dumb. 
0	I’ve never cared for any sports, tbh
8	im trying to understand extroverted thinking?	as an infp i have inferor te.so i want to better myself by tapping into it so i can be more focused on my goals.....anyways what is extroverted thinking from a te dom like yourselfs.is te dropping away personal feelings and emotions to get the jov done?,is it getting to the outcome as fast as possible,is it,accomplishing goals,is it logical or more seeing the best steps to accomplish a goa......how would you describe te as a te dom?
7	Te and Fe are herd functions, i.e., they appeal to consensus, whether it's scientific or social. Ti and Fi are more 'individualistic'. Ti needs to figure shit out for itself but is restricted by the laws of logic. Fi is a more open version of Ti. It also allows connections that aren't logically valid.\n\nTe basically seeks to understand how things hang together, based on *what is observable*. It is also fine with making assumptions that Ti users love to destabilize. Ti focuses on accuracy and deductive arguments. Te is more inductive and probabilistic. Instead of trying to create an airtight argument it's fine with "close enough". Ti users might criticize this as sloppy, but it's what makes Te users more decisive.\n\nTe users will prefer and use empirical evidence and then tie it together logically. Ti users will be more focused on the logical structure of an argument. Both are fine with using facts and logic, but they have different priorities. Likewise, Fe will appeal to consensus of the group while Fi will compare against it inner ideals.\n\nThe problem with Fi is that it thinks it's never wrong. It's very hard to change a Fi user's mind because you have to argue against their internal "flawgic". What I have noticed when arguing with INFPs is that they're way too comfortable with their own interpretation of reality. They use Te as a way to selectively gather arguments for their Fi perspective, which they accept as true a priori. \n\nIf you want to get better at Te, I suggest you make a conscious effort to prioritize facts and empirical evidence. Instead of thinking about things in terms of your own interpretations, you should stick to the evidence in front of you. \n\n 
8	it's like imagine you have an egg so instead of measuring its radius and deriving its formula analytically you cook it and eat it and therefore win
3	How I'd describe Te Doms is that their quick to analyze situations in a succinct, clinical manner. When I worked for the 9-1-1 center I excelled at writing reports because I was absurdly objective and used the exact language to both describe and separate myself (and the reader) from the complaint or situation an officer responded to.\n\nI did not initially excel in my SOC (sociology) 400+ classes with observing volunteers for research. I would constantly get feedback from my professors that instead of *participants* I looked at them as just *subjects*. That I was too impersonal and this empathetic gap wasn't making me as good of an interviewer or researcher as I could be.\n\nSo I illustrate these two points to show that there are appropriate times for Te to be 100% and times for it to not be. Being that you have inferior Te, I bet it's either 100% or not with you (with whatever it may be a person, skill, thing, etc) and you need to learn to allocate energy appropriately (sometimes be 80% or 20%).\n\nI don't really think understanding how a Te Dom thinks is going to help you personally become a more rounded individual. You should focus on how you can adapt your inferior Te (rather than mimic a dominate Te). Doing it wrong can make you become dictatorial and prone to outbursts when one thing deviates off the plan. My first recommendation is to focus on something you have serious interest in becoming more *discipline* in.
3	Te = Prioritizes tribe\nTi = Prioritizes self\n\nA big downfall of ENTJs is that they run around trying to do everything, and spending a lot of time to help others that they don’t take any time for self care.
-1	Basically, an extrovert is someone who thinks their thought is so exciting or relevant that they must share it that instant or they may forget or feel as if they are holding themselves back. 
12	How to you behave when you’re “in the grip” of feelings?	Title says it all.
18	[deleted]
2	I definitely have people I care about. So, yes, I get upset when people are dying or if I suffer a breakup. I'm human. Not a robot. The difference is, I notice that in the past, I have thrown myself into work but now, I don't really have a job to throw myself into and instead I retreat into quiet depression. It's driving me crazy and I'm trying really hard to get back into a job that allows me to work 60 hours a week like a crazy person so I don't have to think about things that get me upset.
1	I just carry on my normal routine. I mention stuff to friends if I am really affected- but for the most part I don’t let my feelings control how I act.\n\nI’ll still smile at work, I’ll still hit the gym and I’ll get my homework done.\n\nI guess the only thing I really let slip is how clean my room is. If I’m in a funk I won’t clean my room for a week. As stupid as this sounds, if my room isn’t tidy it drags me deeper into whatever I am feeling. I fucking hate having a messy room.
6	xNTJ feeling like an ENTJ?	Hi friends,\n\nEver since I was little I was typed as ENTJ, but as I entered out of high school I found myself being typed as very low %extroverted. I have had ADD since I was little but found out about it in the first year of college, and have always felt like I've done the minimal amount of work possible and had tons of free time. \n\nIn the last couple months, I've been taking 15 hours of classes, 10 hours a week at an internship, and another 10+ hours of extracurricular, and have been pulling 10-14 hour days consistently with minimal breaks. But as I've gotten busy I've only been feeling better and better. Take today-I ran a huge tournament and pulled a 14 hour day, and when I got home after my shower I did another two hours of cleaning my apartment.\n\nAm I just coming back to my ENTJ-ness as I fill my time and am forced to work through my ADD? Do any of you have similar experiences and have any advice? Thanks.
5	Imo, when you have xNTJ, the E and I are pretty interchangeable. My INTJ friend can come across pretty extroverted when she wants, and I'm frequently mistaken for an introvert when I'm actually an ENTJ. I've already thought that the E/I functions are the least you have to worry about
2	This was me in many ways. I had ADD too, but it only became a problem in college because I was smart enough to skate through Highschool with minimal effort. It actually was a game for me to get As and Bs with the least amount of time investment. \n\nFor me, when social interactions engage me in interesting ways I feel total E. But, like many ENTJs, if the quality of social interaction available does not meet a certain standard (depth/ challenge) I withdraw more into myself to feed my needs and goals. \n\nI had a job in college too that I really enjoyed. I was doing audio/visual setups for events/ concerts. The complexity of the task and execution were satisfying. Using my analytic skills to help others and contribute to something bigger was really satisfying.  
2	Anyone ever take the Myers Briggs test in different languages?	I did and I’m curious if anyone else had the same results

3	She is very interesting for sure.\n\nI would say she is an ENTJ as well. Her enneagram would be 6w7 with a heave dose of 3.

1	Hi Everyone! Just recently found this on Reddit, as I don’t have an account (until now).  Thank you for sharing my videos ❤️\n\nThe “Dating Tips for ENTJ women” was a project I worked on for an MBTI community. I collected data from other ENTJ women and acted as a spokes-model. \n\nI am actually an ENFJ, 4 w 3. Sorry to trick ya’ll! \n\nAlso, Shrek is my cousin.  
2	ENFP; best way to manic pixie into an ENTJ’s life?	How do I capture the heart of an ENTJ? You fuckers are wily, so I gotta outsmart ya.
15	No one captures the heart of an ENTJ. \n\n\nThey already decide if they want you 5 mins before you even think of checking them out.\n\nAnd please let's drop the manic pixie shit. It's awfully cringey. 
13	Yeah, you're probably better off as friends.  \n\n\n(For the ENTJs, see: [Manic Pixie Dream Girls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hyIlrfGR5g))\n\n&#x200B;
6	ENTJs are more straight shooters when it comes to things like this.  Using myself as an example, some of the things I like I lump together as a "cool, collected, and intense" person.  Meaning I generally prefer someone with a moderate level of extroversion, someone who is a hard worker and is responsible, and someone who can stimulate my mind.\n\nI would recommend showcasing your best attributes while maintaining an open dialogue between the two of you.  Show that you can keep pace both physically and mentally.
5	Letting him to play with you, my friend is an entj, and when he is in love he talks a lot with the girl he likes, he play with her, he tries to invade her mind and her heart, but if you want to invade an entj just speak with them and send them signals, they are very intuitive. 
2	You could also try /r/mbtirelationships! 
1	Swallow
1	> I gotta outsmart ya.\n\nBeing a loyal friend and honest person and playing from your own strengths will serve you 1000 x better with ENTJs (and generally) than any faux competitive approach. 
4	What things do you hate most?	Hello fellow humans,\n\nSo I want to brainwash myself for self-improvement. Here are the steps that I want to use:\n\n1. Break down current identity.\n\n2. Connect pain to old habits.\n\n3. Learn new things, preferable several times.\n\n4. Connect positive things to new habits.\n\nHowever I'm stuck at step 2. I need some things that I can do when I fail to meet my demands but I have no idea what those things are. Most of the things that people dislike are in some way productive and therefore I don't dislike them completely as long as I'm focused on the goal ahead.\n\nIf any of you have ideas please list them down below.\n\nThanks.
3	I think a little more details as to the kind of "habits" you are referring to would be helpful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAre we talking personal self improvement in attitude and thinking?\n\nHow you express yourself?\n\nHow you are viewed by people? (insensitive/too direct?)\n\nHealth and fitness?\n\nCareer related?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
2	So I interpreted this as carrot/stick method, is that right? If so, maybe doing pushups could work - possibly escalating based on how many 'offenses' of bad habits there are. \n\nAlso, shame has been a big motivator for me, so I always like to do work in a more public space. Maybe record how much time you spend procrastinating and commit to sharing that with someone or on social media if that's your thing. Or here on r/dataisbeautiful! Then you can also track progress
2	Could you be more specific?
30	Introversion in ENTJ’s	When I first dived into the world of MBTI, I had mistyped as an INTJ before it occurred to me that the cognitive functions were a thing. However, I’ve come to realize that I can be very withdrawn at times—displaying undeniable characteristics of an introvert to the point where someone will even call it out. The introversion doesn’t come from a state of “me time” or “recharging”, it’s because there is simply nothing to do that would be deemed extroverted. I don’t care to talk to uninteresting people, I don’t care to vocalize my opinions if they have nothing to provide, and I don’t care to gloat about my accomplishments if it will not further my success in a certain area. But, due to my lack of social display, I guess every unsuspecting person believes I’m an introvert.\n\nCan anyone else relate to this?\n\nDoes anyone else feel the same?
19	MBTI E and I don't really correspond with the popular definitions of "introvert" and "extrovert." Jung originally called them "introvision" and "extrovision." That is to say, MBTI E and I have more to do with where an individual focuses energy and attention (towards the internal world or towards the external world), and less to do with how they recharge, or whether or not they like being the center of attention at parties.\n\nSo yes, ENTJs are sometimes introverted by the popular definition, but that doesn't have a whole lot of bearing on their type or function stack.
9	I tell people I'm an introverted extrovert.  I really enjoy talking to people I find interesting, otherwise, I'm fairly quiet.  I also don't really open up to people until I've felt them out.  Otherwise, at work, my job is really boring at times, and some days I chat with coworkers to fill the time.  Or I intentionally chat because I know they view me differently, so I make a concerted effort to chat so they don't think I'm a total bitch.  Sometimes it's a means to an end.\n\nIn my 20s, a coworker pointed out that I never asked people how their weekends were, never complimented people, or seem to take an interest in others.  I didn't want to tell her it was because I don't care what they did over the weekend.  But that conversation was a wake up call to me that I didn't want to be viewed as different.  So, kinda like Dexter -- fake it till you make it.  Over the years, it's become more natural, but I have to consciously pretend to care about what people did over the weekend, or where they went on their trip, even though I typically don't really care.  I do care if something serious happened, or they had an exceptional experience they want to share.  \n\nSeriously, I get it... Hawaii is a chain of islands, with an ocean and beaches and volcanoes.  There are typical island things to do there, and typical island type hotels.  Yes, it sounds fantastic.  No, I don't want to hear the same story from the 10th person in my office who went there.  I can play their whole trip out in my head in 30 seconds, so I'm pretty sure they're not going to tell me anything interesting.           
7	[deleted]
8	Same here. If someone is dull or dumb or the conversation is unintelligent or a waste of time, I won’t engage. The worst is going out to lunch with xSFx where they will talk on and on about that cute dress or that tasty wine and I’m just pulling my hair out! Haha\n\nBut further, I’ll withdraw when deeply upset to think things over and over again, but the best processing for us is when we can think out loud and talk it through with a friend.
3	INTP here. My best friend is an ENTJ , and when I'm with with him we never stop talking, he always has something to say. The same goes with people that he cares about or gets along with. However, friends have told me that when there's no one he wants to talk with, he just puts his earphones on and goes home as fast as he can. \nHe doesn't have a good relationship with his family too, so he barely talks or interacts with them. So I guess my ENTJ friend can relate to this.
3	I totally relate with this! I don’t always voice my opinions or correct people if I feel it is unimportant. I preform well in social functions, but in all honesty I really do like ‘me time’.\n\nYou don’t have to swing too hard one way or the other. You can be an introvert and express extroverted behaviors when needed.\nI feel like entjs are one of the mb types that don’t rely on others for a lot of satisfaction or comfort. \n\nI view how I interact with people as a practical function. Having a good network is important and opens up a lot of doors.
2	I actually do need a few evenings alone a week to recharge. 
2	(Dumb) people are draining and I need to recharge. In this case it can be introversion, but I'd just think we're all allergic to stupidity...\n\nEdit: Also kinda new to Reddit formatting, does anyone know how to get the little "ENTJ" icon beside your name?
1	[deleted]
1	Interesting. I wouldn't call the things you don't care for or care to do examples of being introverted. I'd call them examples of applying wisdom. 
1	A lot of people think I'm an introvert at first. Truth is, I'm really just not interested in talking to most people. I don't have anything to say, so I stay quiet
5	ENTJ: Secrets to Making Friends	
3	ENTJ and ESTJ	why does it seem like people portray that these two types are not a good fit? \nIn romance and friendship, I have found my closest people to be ESTJ’s. I find that they also think through choices of relationships, and are very honest and direct and committed. I find no power struggle if both are healthy and mature. They also like order .
3	I had a bad experience with an ESTJ because she would try to control everything I did. I think she was just a tad bit immature though. 
2	I dated an ESTJ one time and 😍\nHe was so attentive to me and filled my every need dutifully and faithfully. A very smart guy. And LOYAL. He just wasn’t able to discuss the abstract like theology or politics. But he was definitely the best partner I had.
1	What is meant by “think through choices of relationships”?
1	I get on really well with ESTJs as friends and coworkers. Even if they're my supervisor/boss we have a good mutual understanding. They seem to respect my competency and don't feel the need to micromanage me which is baller, I don't work well being micromanaged. \n\nProbably wouldn't date one though. Had a short relationship with an ESTJ once, got annoying really quick. He wanted a more domestic, quiet, secure life than I'm interested in, felt like he was always trying to nail me down. Even though ESTJ and ENTJ both lead with Te, we have completely different styles. I'm more of a goal-oriented generalist, if it works it works, while he was more small-scale organized and interested in the process. So he'd criticize my methodology for being haphazard and disorganized while completely missing the larger point of my actions. Didn't last very long. Could also be the gender differences though, I don't do well with judging men in general. 
15	Preemptively Ending a Relationship	Gosh it hurts so bad! I really liked this guy.\n\nWe had a fwb situation and I wanted to take it further. However, he was dropping acid and this is not something I can tolerate. Differences in values will destroy a relationship in the long run. I feel like ENTJs know this and understand this, and we have a visionary super power to see the future. So I ended it in less than 24 hours. My brain is right on track, but my heart lags behind.\n\nI know he was bewildered and surprised. And I feel so cold doing it. But I know it was the right thing to do. This is the way it is, but I wish it didn’t have to be this way.\n\nAny other of you rationalists have felt these terrible struggles of head v. heart when it comes to a crossroads?
9	The girl that I most recently dated was a pathological liar. I loved literally everything about her, except for the fact that I couldn’t trust her.  When I caught her in the latest batch of lies, I knew it was time to move on. My heart, however, did not want to let go of everything else that I loved about her. It was tough, but I got over it pretty quick with a little bit of distance and time. 
5	Hi! If it makes you feel any better, I’ve been in the same situation but on the receiving end. It was hard at the time, but looking back I think the ENTJ made the right decision for both of us. (I’m an ENFP)\n\nLong story short, I had a great early dating experience with an ENTJ. I wasn’t ready for the commitment so I ended things. Months go by and we get back together. It was awesome, but I was still being flakey. He recognized this and called it quits early. \n\nIt hurt on my end. I thought he wasn’t giving us a real chance. But now we’re both in healthy, committed relationships with other people who are a much better fit for each other. I’m very thankful that we didn’t draw something out that wasn’t meant to be. \n\nHope this is helpful! 
3	Been there got the same scars. Emotions are hard for us but in my experience it's better to do these things earlier because later it's just going to be worse. It also sucks for me as an ENTJs putting things off that I  know have to happen because the waste of time starts to bother me.
3	You could also try /r/mbtirelationships for further advice! 
2	I’m “involved” with someone and I think I’m going to end things prematurely because it’s not sustainable. I really want to get to know this person more deeply but I’m afraid that based on the information on the table we don’t want the same things out of the relationship and it’s best to end it clean. \n\nLogic>emotion/desire 
6	Except LSD isn’t even bad. 
3	Just curious, but what makes you not tolerate a SO dropping acid?
1	An ENTJ who has had his or her mind opened by psychedelics is ten times more powerful.  \n\nAfter that, they can put their energy and charisma into what really matters.
1	My reason is always that it's easier to hurt then deal with the problem
1	Literally wrapping things up this week. I just cannot walk into the fire. 
3	What’s something small that pisses you off?	For me it’s when I can’t find a clean eating utensil 
10	I hate passive aggression 
8	People who are indecisive about the smallest things\n\nLoud chewing, excessive coughing, obnoxious or squeaky laughing, biting of utensils\n\nAdvice without facts to back it up\n\nLateness\n\nPeople who say they'll do something and then flake out
6	Stupidity, valley girls, passive aggressive behavior, entitlement, assumptions, unsolicited advice, unchecked privilege and throat clearing. 
3	My penis!
3	Telling a story and including every small minor detail and not getting to the actual point of the story.\n\nHonestly...listening to anyone telling a story longer than 30 seconds just annoys me now that I think about it lol.
2	> For me it’s when I can’t find a clean eating utensil\n\nDufaq? You caused it and it is so tiny and easy to fix. And there is a workaround.\n\nLots of small things piss me off.\n\nPeople not recycling or being too dumb to figure out how to do so.\n\nSame for compost.\n
1	Lack of self-awareness is kinda annoying, although funny at times as well
1	Technology. For some reason when I lose even a few seconds to something stupid, a mis click, pop up, or whatever else, it irritates the @$)% out of me. But I don't think I've ever gotten mad at another person, because I know people are always motivated by something. But technology is just technology, it's not motivated by anything, it just does. Yet for some reason, these little moments wasted via technology, just irk the hell out of me. I curse at my computer a lot! lol
1	acting childlike (e.g. jenna marbles)
1	People who walk slow in the city 
1	People who use the last of something and don't replace or reorder that item... Holy heck. So so frustrating. 
4	How to care about people?	Hello ENTJ! I’m actually an ESTP but I think we share similar concerns.\n\nI feel guilty about not really “caring” about people. I was accused of being selfish and that I only use people to promote my own goals, which, I honestly can’t deny. I’m really focused on trying to make my own living and working on my own projects that I abandon or leave behind the people who really care about me. I feel really sorry about it, but don’t know what to do, because I just want to get it over with first before I spend time with them.\n\nIt just makes me feel bad because I didn’t talk to my high school friend for like 5 years and I only talked to him recently about networking for this job I want. Then the other time I only talk to my internet friend when I need to vent, because he has a good perception on life. Another time, I only talk to another internet friend for memes and funny jokes but not for general conversation. They all accuse me of using them and I just feel bad and I don’t know how to express my feelings other than that I’m sorry and I’m really focused on trying to get a job so I can stop stressing. The excuse sounds like BS I know but you get what I’m trying to solve here... I just can’t keep caring / keeping tabs about everyone in my life when I’m literally working steps towards my future. I would best say the “steamroller” analogy is me whenever I want to get a big goal done.\n\n***TLDR***\nHow do I care about people and how do I prioritize about others in my life while I’m focused trying to accomplish my goals?\n\nThanks bros\n
17	Maybe while you’re picking up empathy tips from ENTJs you can drop by r/ISFP and ask how to manage your finances. Or get the INFPs to advise you on making and implementing long range goals.\n\nNobody can make you care about people, you just have to pretend to. Especially if you want to keep those people as friends.\n\nNext time you think about one of your friends, send a text asking “what’s up” even if you don’t give a shit for real. If you are out and about and see a cheap trinket that reminds you of someone you know, get it and give it to them next time you see them. If you see an ad for a movie or hear a song that reminds you of a friend, call and open up with “Hey I heard/saw this and was thinking about you...”  and try to do these while you’re driving or grocery shopping or actually doing something that matters. Or you could just post to their FB wall every now and then.\n\nWhat seems like an effort to you might mean a lot to someone who is having a bad day and just needs to talk. And they will remember it the next time they see you, just as they remember if you only call them when you want something from them.\n\n
3	I feel you. I am very much the same. It’s hard. But there are moments when I actually feel some empathy. Caring for people and being here for them if they need you genuinely is one very important thing. And also showing them that they can count on you. Mailing time to spend (pass) time with them is another thing (less important imho).
2	I don't think you necessarily have to care about people.  But it's nice to show interest, & I think that goes a long way.  All you have to do there is ask questions and follow up periodically.  It's also good to understand that the more you care about people, the more people you get to know, which if you asks me leads to accomplishing your goals.
2	I like to think (and tend to overthink) about how I would feel in the positions of others and it gives me a better appreciation of the problems in other people's lives. I don't know if that helps.
1	The exact thing you talk to them for, express some appreciation for it. Turn it into an inside joke. Offer something in return— a gift, a favor. If you’re doing something that’s not important or a high priority, invite them to tag along. \n\nYou don’t have to give back something if you don’t want to, or if it’s unnatural. Just give something back in your own style. \n\nI personally am really stingy with my time, so I just find other things to offer. Like I’ll never be upset if someone doesn’t spend time with me, but I will if they waste my time. Everyone has different tradeoffs.

1	Have you ever considered that you're a classic Narcissist?\n
0	mbti type and evolution?	i was bored lastnight and started reading up on what women want in men according to evolution then combined that and thought which mbti types would most exibit what a women would want in a guy so here goes.......1)women wants men who can provide,for there kids and them, 2)women want a leader of man 3)women wants a protector 4)good genetics or any other quality advantages to survivle........so one women would probably like j types more than ps because j's are more focused on completing tasks,oragnazied and stable, two women would probably want an extroverted type,because she needs a man who can actualy get shit done in the world and provide,..........lets say estjs and entjs because one,entjs and estjs are hard workers and get shit done,and according to statistics entjs and estjs earn the most money,and can provide,also entjs and estjs can protect there families very well,as they are te dom.that being said,you can add esfjs and enfjs second,you can also add intjs in there because they make quiet abit of money....so there is my conclution what do you think?
7	Not even a little bit.
8	No to all of this.
6	chad... we meet again.
3	I adore my ENTJ husband. Provider, leader, strong personality and very sweet with me. I am an ENFP female. I think there could be some truth to this from my perspective. 
3	How do you come up with your questions?\n\nAnyway ... not necessarily.\n\nWomen on welfare just want a hot guy with muscles who can punch like a gorilla and last all night.\n\nThe k-selected females may be looking for other things.\n
2	[deleted]
2	Pretty sure we've gone from a rudimentary understanding of either gender espousing specific traits and wants into actually distilling the personalities behind their biological organs. Yes, in general, a sufficiently significant proportion of guys according to MBTI statistics are more "alpha" (for the lack of a better term) so there definitely is a visible pattern to guys doing things a certain way but it alone is insufficient to buoy up the entirety of the gender. Similarly, a good proportion of the female populace will in fact be the softer feeler variants but that as well is not enough to set a scientific law that all girls desire X qualities in men on the basis of these "feelers" enjoying certain aspects. Yes, certain personality types do like to be led and these same personality types are more common in females but this is not a causative relationship. You thus cannot reasonably conclude that ALL females like such guys because there are also "alpha" girls around and likewise we have a whole bunch of soft crybabies that just so happen to have a penis. Lol you're in a personality type subreddit, if you use something as superficial as gender to judge people on what they may or may not fancy (instead of you know, the test which serves as a namesake for the sub), you're probably going to get sneered at - consider this a friendly explanation.\n\nHowever (regarding the accuracy of your theory), yes a good enough portion of girls do enjoy these aspects (and in my personal experience relative to that of my mates, I have had a lot more success being the "alpha" vs hiding around like an introvert) to demonstrate an inclination but this is by no means all encompassing. For example, as you can tell from the ENTJ girls above me, they most definitely do not like being led because they are in fact already "one of us" and undoubtedly will seek out ISFP/INFPs to lead along - much like we would. Also, in countries where feminism has taken hold, girls generally do not like being told that they "need a man" (even if some deep down they do want it) and thus may reactively adopt the more extreme stance of those who truly do not. It all boils down to your personality type not gender when it comes to generalized needs and wants so use it.   \n\n\ntl;dr don't confuse an increased occurrence of specific personality types within the female gender to assume a causal relationship between being female and wanting   specific things in their partners
2	what about ENTJ women then? most are attracted to IxxPs.
12	How long does it take you to get over someone?	I was talking to a good friend, an ENTJ, and we were discussing his relationship with his gf. Basically, he wanted to end the relationship because he wanted to pursue his goals and he mentioned how he would be sad for a day or two and be completely fine afterwards. They've been together for about a year and have traveled together. The length of time to get over her blew my mind. I'm an INFP, it takes me weeks, MONTHS to get over someone. If I connect with someone I easily get emotionally attached and I cant easily shake that feeling off. \n\nSo, how long does it typically take you to get over someone? Do you have any advice for the people, like me, that can't seem to get over break ups very easily? 
37	He’s not serious. It hurts bad. It lasts. We invest deeply in those we carefully chose as a partner. And the mourning takes a while. But we make a cut pretty cleanly and quickly.\nIt hurts a long time unless we’ve already decided that the relationship is oppressive or annoying, or if we’ve already mourned the relationship, then we’re happy to get that person out of the way so we can spring forward. 
18	> Basically he wanted to end the relationship because he wanted to pursue his goals\n\nI’m no ENTJ, but it doesn’t sound like she meant that much to him in the first place, so short recovery period.\n\nFi is concerned with “true love”, authenticity, being able to bare one’s soul, trusting and being trusted completely.\n\nTe is seemingly preoccupied with image, power, and financial success, or at least that’s how it comes across to Fi doms, which is why his actions seem cruel to you.\n\nTo me it just sounds like the girlfriend in your story was getting in the ENTJ’s way, or holding him back from what he really wanted...which obviously wasn’t her.\n
16	If someone didn’t mean much then there’s nothing to get over. On the rare occasions I do get emotionally attached it takes a long, longggg time for me to get over them. Probably more than the average person. I just don’t ever externalize my emotional pain and when something is over it’s over. Just distract myself with different life things and then eventually I’m over it. 
5	I’ve found that I struggle for weeks leading up to when I end a relationship but by the time I end it I’ve been internally dealing with the emotions so when it’s finally over it’s easy for me to move on quickly. Trying to improve things or come to terms with what I’m not willing to continue putting up with is extremely emotionally draining so when I finally end a relationship it’s a relief on my emotional side and that’s why I have an easier time moving on. Your friend may have been dealing with his emotions behind the scene for a while and has already mourned the loss of his relationship. 
3	It tooks months for me, but probably because it kinda took me by surprise and it was my first time, probably won't take as much time next time.
3	ENTJ's need to learn to keep their distance and not invest heavily in relationships in the beginning.  \n\nI feel like I tend to over invest & I just get disappointed in myself when I knew I shouldn't have.  I think it takes everyone just as long as anybody else, ENTJ's included.  I think we can deal with it better than most, but still cuts deep.
3	3 minutes to cut you off emotionally, but inner turmoil lasts about 3 months. 
2	female ENTJ here, a week for me basically. took 1-4 months before im busy with my work, and thats when i was in high school and stuff. still so naive about relationship and friendship. but right now im so focused with my work, wont let anything distract me. 
1	Well my GF broke up with me months ago and I feel as if I’m only slightly better than I was the moment she broke up with me. I’m very torn up 
1	As ENTJ, when someone is breaking relationship with me, it takes a lot time to recover, months I would say, because i choose people wisely, and only few people can get into my inside. So after i gave them my whole heart, it hurts a lot. But if im the one who is breaking up, it's because I dont care about someone already, somehow he or she made something that meant i have to cut them out of my life. In this sittuation it's day or two and im good. Why? Because I dont care about people who hurts me, they are worthless for me. For example if someone lies to me a lot i can tell him or her to fuck off, even if i know them for years. 
1	I am an ENTJ, and I agree more with what kookiepop has said. I am very good at cutting clean and quick. Except, the only thing is that when I choose to love someone (yes, it is a choice for me), and this person is very deserving and I am very committed to that choice, that would take a longer time. If I can see how this person is not someone I want to choose to love, then again clean and quick. But if this person still holds all that checks all the boxes toward something I would like to be committed  to, it hurts, but I wont express it. My actions will not express it (would never in a life time be the one to reach out to them, even if I were drunk I would still control myself not to) and it will not affect my daily life, but it definitely hurts when youre in more vulnerable times like before bed or when youre drunk and come home alone and are about to sleep. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut, when i decide to cut something off, it is done. There is no reverse action, and I do not go back to it for the world. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI do have the problem of once I assess that this person is a go, I do tend to come off strongly, which may be too much for some people. My choice is just very well thought out and strong that I am all aboard for it.
1	I don’t really invest myself too hard in people because my life is so busy.\n\nBut to be honest it takes me a week at most
1	Having three to five girlfriends at the same time has definitely helped :D
2	Career field/Background	Previous post about the chat room got me curious. So how about a brief description of career field or background. Might be interesting to see what entj do in other fields. I work at a quarry. Leading a crew and maintaining several processes a handful of co-workers and a whole lot of equipment. Suits me perfectly, so how about everyone else.
4	Software Engineering. I'd say I'm pretty much inserted into the field because it pays well (big time) and I come from a non-traditional background (no college) so I managed to get comfortable in life by 21. \nAnd as for the job, I don't really lead anyone or anything of that (I do get to point out technical standpoints during meetings and such anf Te helps a lot) but the complexity and technical challenges are really nice. One might say you can never get bored at work because its actually pretty fun.
2	Strength and conditioning coach in the college system. Coaching athletes in the weight room to improve performance on the field. Perfect application of my leadership ability plus my interest in physiology, biomechanics, etc. Plus I’m on my feet, don’t sit at a desk all day. Pretty sweet gig.
2	Entrepreneur. Previously in leadership positions in politics and consulting. I do a lot of different shit though. Keeps me sane.
2	I work in fire protection at a hospital. I manage a team of 6 repair techs and advise hospital leadership on various aspects of fire and life safety. 
2	im a female ENTJ and an entrepreneur. i love self development and work so much. i dont like taking orders, cant imagine myself work 9-5 job in a company unless its MY company. basically i work from "when i open my eyes" to "when i close my eyes". i dont like life balance, because i think i need to focus on my goals first before i can relax when i get older. i am crazy about reading business books and feeding my mind with motivational things and stuff.
3	How to go from Sonny Corleone to Vito Corleone?	What I’m trying to say is that... \nI’m the ENTJ who is “Turbulent”, my test also said that multiple times. \n\nNow turbulence isn’t nice always, in some situations it’s okay, but generally when you’re dealing with office politics you don’t wanna jump the table and punch the guy in the face. \n\nI wanna calm down, take care of things like Vito does. I don’t want to be a pushover, but, want to settle it without violence. Not that I’ve been violent but I’ve been seeing myself get into the urge of smacking the hell out of the guy who keeps on bugging me these days. On the other hand, I’m just ignoring most of whatever someone is telling, just so that I don’t give them a reaction at all. But I feel like I’m being a pushover by not reacting always. So yeah. \n\nBiggest mistake of Sonny...he always got turbulent, Vito, was smarter.
3	Lol i'll remind myself to explain this in a few hours 
1	Therapy? \n\nIt's not about having incentives I guess, more about acting on them. If you feel the anger building, ask yourself how this action might benefit you or not in the future. Think about the sacrifice, if you can afford then do it. If you can't then don't do it.
7	Is there something wrong with me?	Hello, \nI am a young female ENTJ and I think there’s something wrong with me. I have never had a BFF , I have no close friends, At school I’m alone. \nI’ve stopped talking a lot and have developed I speak when I deem its necessary or I need to save my classmates from somebody’s else stupidity.My parents have noticed that I don’t go out, I’m not invited to things. My mom says its because I push people away and I’m closed off and reserved.                                                          \n \n\nI’m still very extroverted I love talking to people , having debates and such. I have started obsessing over my future as I’m still very young  and there’s quite a bit of time before I go off to university ( hopefully Oxford) \nI’ve been planning for what I have to do to get into Oxford , then Harvard law school or Yale I’m still undecided. I’m not depressed . I’m not suicidal. I just don’t feel the need to engage with other people my age ( I hate my age group).\n\nAlso I’m gifted! So maybe not intellectually challenged enough. I’m at the age where everybody only cares about what’s the latest fad and the Kardashian’s ( who I hate) I admire how the used Kim to become millionaires but I hate them and think their trashy but I digress \n\nAnyway if you know how to help me or know what’s wrong please comment I’d love to read all your thoughts. \n\nOh ya I think I’m asexual , I feel literally no attraction to any guy my age or above. I think dating at my age is stupid because it can distract you from what’s important like becoming managing partner in under 15 years ( unrealistic I know but I can try)  well that’s it \n\nPs. I don’t normally do this but I thought hey maybe I need some help from some like minded people.\n\nPPS. I need some good books on human behaviour and sociology if you would be so kind as to drop them below that would be greatly appreciated \n\n
8	I didn't develop any close friendships until I was in college. Although I think that was more a product of very strict parents who are very anti-friends. I will say this though, I am fairly reserved and closed off. It takes a long time for me to get to know someone to the point where I consider them a friend. When I got to college, I felt so out of place not having close friendships so I made an active effort to get to know people other than a surface level acquaintance. Once I started putting more effort into getting to know people, it became more natural and now I have lots of deep meaningful friendships. I also think in college I met people I had things in common with and didn't feel quite as out of place as I did in High School. Keep your head up and don't stress it too much. You are young and have all the time in the world to make friends. I felt the same way when I was in high school and now I'm in a much happier place. It will happen. Just give it time. 
5	It somewhat sounds like you don’t want a Bf or a Bff. Well, at least not with “regular” individuals or people your age. \n\nSounds as if you are saving that spot for someone like you, but because you’re someone more uncommon...you’re having a hard time finding someone. \n\nIn this case, it makes sense you probably won’t meet someone up to par with your flares until your life becomes more niche and solidified into your liking. Until then, you will meet passerby’s most of the time. \n\nPs, it doesn’t hurt to be warm. Good luck finding your crew !
3	Is it possible you are demisexual? I thought I was ace for a long time because I felt uncomfortable with romantic relationships. I would get the occasional crush but they were always based on admiration for personality traits they possessed rather than physical attraction. Once I was able to make closer friendships with others, I started feeling physical attraction towards certain individuals. In college, it is much easier to find other intuitives.
3	What about asking people questions about topics you are interested in, to help the conversations be both interesting and not one-sided? How about doing activities with people? I volunteered to help build and rehab houses, with other teenagers I knew also on the crew, when I was about your age.
2	I think im around ur age but im not sure but I would recommend actual interaction instead of books. I like to think school more as a place to learn how to interact with people. My classes are boring so i use that aspect to spice school up a bit. If you are not already join some extra curriculars and meet some people with similar interests. Then reach out and try to talk to them. 
2	You have other interest, most of the interest you do disclose sound oriented around long term goals and personal development. \n\nNothing is wrong with you, welcome to being an ENTJ. You’re not interested in petty things nor things that waste your time. \n\nYou will feel different most of your life because of this, embrace it, accept it, and move forward. You’re here to build yourself not waste your time. 
2	It depends on what you want. If you don’t like going out, be it.  If you don’t like having friends, be it. If you don’t like having romantic partners, be it. Reading your post, I can’t decide what you want so not sure how to advise.
2	Nah I think you're fine. I've never been much of a friend person. Any friendship I have has been 99% the effort of the other person. I like talking to and engaging with people but I don't like relationship building. \n\nI do recommend being mindful. There might come a point when you're lonely or start feeling isolated, that's when you should start thinking about what if anything you need to change. 
2	My dad was always really worried about me, because I never invited friends over. Even now in my mid 20s, I still don't really enjoy having people over. I always did have friends though. I'm still - in my experience - very close to my high school friends even though we don't see each other a lot. I am very introverted and don't crave close connections as much as other people, but I feel happy and content about the number and depth of friendships in my life, and that's all that counts.\n\nIn my country, you do an IQ test at 12, and only the top 15% get to go to the type of high school that grants entry to university. Some schools have mixed level education, but I consciously decided to go to a high school that only offered this highest level education. This was an absolutely blessing, as I got the intellectual challenge I needed and I was able to make a bunch of friends who I shared my intellectual passions with. I can imagine you will start making more friends when you get to uni, provided you're open to it and actively opt in for activities etc. (Life is about actively opting in, not opting out.)\n\nAnyway, life at your age is confusion. Just.. hold on and hang tight. Try to get yourself in a mindset of being open for new experiences and just try a whole bunch of activities. Not liking it is just a valid a conclusion as liking the experience. Thinking you *might* not like it should not be a reason to not at least try.\n\nContinue having big dreams. You might be the only one who actually believes in them, but that's ok. Dream big, because your instinct is telling you you can make it, don't overshadow that instinct by believing the people with no dreams at all when they tell you what you want is impossible. Your dreams WILL change over the next years (and even many, many years after) and that is OKAY! Don't be afraid to bin a dream and start a new one.\n\nAlso, cry, be angry, be annoyed, all of that emotion is normal and healthy. Don't bottle it up and banish it to a dark corner, try to actually *feel* and understand your emotion. It's scary, but it will pay off big time later in your life if you start learning how to work *with* your emotions now, instead of fighting against it.\n
2	Look for NT friends, seriously. INTJ and INTP especially. I'm ENTJ male, first relationship i was 18 yo, it was with INTP/ISTP girl, but as she was getting older she was becoming more ISTP, at the end we broke up because of differences. I have only few friends, and i'm not close to them. One is INFP, and I dont understand him, we are Just friends for 14 years, second one is ENTP, but our contact is way worse since i moved away from city. I love talking with my ESTP friend from college. ENTJ's dont have friends but minions exception are people that can debate with us on the same intellectual level. So simply, find someone who is as much intelligent as you are. Both for friendship and relationship. 
2	You sound like a perfectly normal ENTJ to me. I'm in my 30s and always liked talking to people but didn't become really social until I was in my late 20s. \n\nJust remember that being social is a skill and a useful one. It helps in business and leadership to be able to handle oneself in office interactions and in relating to people. Not everything is all about the work. \n\nAlso it is stupid to get into a relationship as a teenager. You have better things to do. 
2	I want to take you to lunch. I went through some growing pains myself. You may need to make a variety of friends before you  start experiencing crushes. It’s fine, hun. Also, I recommend seeking to become an outstanding listener and practice empathizing with others as far as understanding their goals and needs and wants.
2	I really enjoyed volunteering at your age. I got to rehab a small inner city apartment building on weekends and learn about tools.
2	You would do ok in a libertarian club of sorts. They are desperate for female members but not in an SJW sort of way. It's just that 3/4 of libertarians are men.\n\nhttps://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0042366\n\n"""Compared to self-identified liberals and conservatives, libertarians showed 1) stronger endorsement of individual liberty as their foremost guiding principle, and weaker endorsement of all other moral principles; 2) a relatively cerebral as opposed to emotional cognitive style; and 3) lower interdependence and social relatedness."""\n\nIf you do not care about politics, you could just hang out with male nerds - computer, engineering, etc. You yourself don't have to be one in order to hang out with them.\n\nLook, I don't have a great advice for you. I just think that it's not that you do not want to talk to people but you have a requirement that those people be rational-ish. Well, they congregate in certain places.\n\n> PPS. I need some good books on human behaviour and sociology if you would be so kind as to drop them below that would be greatly appreciated\n\nhttps://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\n\n> I feel literally no attraction to any guy my age or above. I think dating at my age is stupid because it can distract you from what’s important like becoming managing partner in under 15 years ( unrealistic I know but I can try) well that’s it\n\nWell, I hope you did think this through. Maybe you are a late bloomer. Even asexual people tend to seek companionship. Being a 50 year old childless CEO is not satisfying to most women, even many competitive women, but maybe you are an exception.\n

4	entjs what if.....?	entjs are if someone really pisses you off?,i mean really?,what would you do in retaliation?
13	I don't really ever retaliate. I just move on to the next thing I'd rather do with my time. 
9	Another excellent post by chadthecat
9	I really thought I blocked you.  I guess not.  On reddit?  Block them.
6	Move on. Time is short. 
7	I don’t waste time to retaliate. \nRant in absence if confrontation is not possible or a waste of time.\n\nJust today I told someone that he annoys me. He said sorry and now it’s done. What’s next?
5	Two chicks at the same time.

0	If he really deserves it i play the bad  guy card and use my social network to partly destroy the  other person atleast mentally 
10	Do you ever think up theories?	Do you ever imagine up crazy theories that could change the way the world functions even if only purely theoretical? 
11	No, my theories are usually pretty sound.
7	Kind of? I don’t know why but I always theorise of other ways to organise society/government but then I get annoyed because I’m not that good at it. 
4	Yep, ENTJs do this for society at-large as well as interpersonal relationships. Sometimes I can overthink things. This is our Ni at work.
2	Not "crazy theories that are purely theoretical". I really dislike people working in dead-end jobs because there are no other options for a salary. When I'm around that I always start to plan different ways of automation so that these useless jobs that kill people could be eliminated. Hopefully replaced with better ones.
2	YES. I love to think paradigmatically about how certain institutions/structures/society can be altered to change the world.\n\nBut then my ISTP friend, a.k.a. my personal debugger, reminds me to chill.
2	Yeah, big into theoretical physics
1	Often
1	Is there any other way to think? :-)
0	Omg all the time!!! Entj check!
3	Being too direct?	Good day fellow ENTJs,  \nI feel like I might be in a sort of a dilemma now, where I feel me being too direct and honest about things might turn people off. To give you an example, if someone goes to lunch and picks a place that is expensive I'm just saying that "that place is too expensive and I don't want to go there because of it, sorry", where I guess an alternative to that would be "Oh, sorry, maybe we could pick another place" or whatever. That is just a very rought example to explain what I mean \n\nTo me it seems that people might not prefer the directedness sometimes, even though I would really appreciate if people would be very direct with me and don't hide behind lies. So for example if someone would come up to me and said "hey, I think you were too harsh yesterday about so and so". Obviously everyone has a different opinion but to me having that feedback would be very important, because if you hear a certain opinion from multiple people you might still consider that yes, maybe it was a bit harsh what I said, or at least it came across as harsh etc\n\nThe point I'm trying to make is, I think being honest and straightforward is at my core, and I don't want to change anything about that, but on the other hand, I guess telling people what they want to hear might be a better idea for getting along with people better. Have you ever came across something like that and what do you do?
12	Tact was a difficult thing for me to learn. It came with practice and with paying close attention to people’s reactions to what I said. Retail/sales helped me hone this skill due to the necessity of reading your client carefully so you can adjust your behaviour to make the sale.\n\nWith regards to friends, I tend to surround myself with people who understand my straightforwardness. I would absolutely say something along the lines of “Nah, I don’t have that kind of money right now,” to my friends if they chose an expensive restaurant, and I’d have no second thoughts about it. With somebody I was less friendly with, I would just tell them “no thanks.” \n\nYou can still be direct in your intent and not have to give the reason (although, as an ENTJ, I know your first instinct is to give all the information over at once so you and your intent are fully understood). You giving the reason point-blank without being asked is what’s putting people off in this situation. Know your audience and practice different approaches to these sorts of situations. Some may go against the grain of your natural responses, but if you learn to incorporate and use these alternate responses, you will go far. 
5	I also highly value honesty and directness in both giving and receiving. But when it comes to others, I feel that it's always best to read the context: the type of person you're talking to, what the conversation is, etc. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nA recent scenario happened with a friend who texted me asking if I was free. I was about to head into work and said no. He said he was getting his car fixed and had the car company drop him off at a mall at 9am and it was already 4pm. As most of us know, cars take a while to be fixed. I asked him why didn't he asked to be dropped off at his house, to which he replied "he would get bored." This baffled me because at home you have your computer, food, and bed (at least). No common sense at all lol Then I asked him "hey you know I live 40 miles away right?" and he was like "yeah lol." Like bro, you expect me to drive over there to entertain you? Idk the whole situation I was just being honest with how I felt, but I realized in most situations he talks about with me, he just wanted sympathy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt the end of the day some people don't want honesty all the time. Being honest consistently is rare and a good trait to have. But there's always a time for everything, and sometimes brutal honesty isn't the best course of action.
3	Surround yourself with people who are real and honest, people that like you for who you are. That would be my advice.
3	Pick and choose your battles wisely. Also, some people just can't stand the heat of the kitchen.
3	I laughed out loud at this post and your examples. I don't think you were harsh *at all*, but then again, this is much more a cultural issue than a type issue. \n\nI'm Dutch, your directness would not only be accepted, but quite frankly, even expected. Saying 'no, I don't want to go there, it's too expensive' is the most normal thing to openly express from my cultural perspective. People would be quite annoyed if you wouldn't speak up only to drop some subtle clues about you not wanting to go there because of finances later on.\n\nWhere are you from?
2	We’re described as military commanders, and rightfully so; very blunt, not exactly “in our feelings”, you know what I mean.\n\nIf I could make a reading recommendation, I recommend ‘Leadership’ by Arthur Harrison Miller. I’m in the process of reading it, and in it, he talks of 16 key characteristics of good military leaders.\n\nNow, why do I recommend this book of military science? Because it’s really not that far off from how organizations, corporations, and leadership-based situations play out. It’s definitely helping me have a different perspective on how to lead and lead well.
2	How about a middle-ground: Telling people not what they want to hear but (only) what they need to hear. Do they really need to hear your reasoning for why you don't want to go to the expensive place right away? Or would it be enough to show some sign of resistance but keep the door at least slightly open? It's more diplomatic to give people the feeling that they had a chance to persuade you. Consider asking them about their reason for going first, instead of naming your reasons for rejection unprompted. Taking this route they might bring up a good reason you hadn't thought of, which trumps "expensive". Or they might not and then you can still say what you were going to say, but now it's warranted, they will understand that you *had* to say it at this point.   \nIt's easy to forget when you're a strong-willed ENTJ but many people fear confrontation so if you lead with "here is why your idea is bullshit" they immediately surrender (and secretly resent you). They might have a good reason but they won't say it because the situation (for them) has turned emotional. They don't trust their reasoning and instead just submit to your dominant tone. It sounds a bit silly in these technical terms but this really happens all the time. It took me forever to figure it out because it's something invisible that happens in other people's heads and rarely in mine.
2	Really depends on the culture. Anglosaxons love their criticism super flowery while I am from Germany where being direct gets you very far. The fake politeness in the UK really pissed me off after a year of living there. In Asia for example Chinese are somewhat more direct than Japanese. 
4	How exactly are ENTJ's on top at EQ?	Well, I don't buy into all the negative stereotypes surrounding ENTJ's BUT according to Thompson study, ENTJ's are the highest at EQ.\n\nHowever, they are are somewhere in the middle when it comes to self-awareness which means they must be highest at self-management, social awareness ant relationship management.\n\nWhile I can totally see why they are highest at self-management (great control of emotions), I just can't see how they are highest at social awareness with types like ENFJ, ENFP, ESFJ or ENTP(they have Extraverted Feeling). Introverts live more inside their heads, although i think INFX's can give anybody a run for their money when it comes to picking up on emotions. The entj's I know don't even seem to listen to people, and good listening skills are an essential part of the social awareness aspect.\n\nWhen it comes to Relationship Management, to influence they usually use directness from what I've gathered, so they don't resort to emotions to get people to do what they want.\n\nIt seems that they all it takes for them to be such good leaders is a good self-management in order not to get impatient, intimidated or angry until people do as they say.\n\nSo I'd be interested to know what makes you guys the highest at these other two categories(social awareness and relationship management) especially in comparison to other types.\n\n&#x200B;
18	ENTJs are natural born leaders, OF COURSE they have a high EQ. I'm always stunned as to why people would be surprised about this. Leaders are basically everybody's mommy.
8	I can see where the dissonance comes from in light of the stereotype of NT types tending to fall along the Autism Spectrum.\n\nHowever, one thing that is less commonly mentioned is that ENTJs and INTJs possess the ability to use their Ni to easily suss out what a person "fundamentally is". That is to say, at least from my own experience, it is extremely easy to tell what a person's set of values, beliefs, and statistically likely actions are, on the basis of their past behaviour. \n\nNow combine that with Te as a dominant function, and that means that it is equally easy for us to strategise around how to achieve our goals in light of the "core identities" of our counter-parties. In business, for example, if you know what your client likes, you strategise around those preferences, to achieve a higher probability of scoring a deal with him/her.\n\nFinally, if EQ is somehow defined as "the ability to navigate a social situation successfully, owing to one's ability to understand the motivations and concerns of other parties", I can certainly see how ENTJs score at the top.\n\nThe other types you mentioned: the ENFPs and ENFJs of the world - they might certainly be as good if not better at reading people - but they certainly also give less of a fuck about using that to their advantage.
3	Te-Ni is a strong ally in this regard.  Te alone is insufficient to solve the task (which is why ESTJ doesn't hit the top rank) and Ni is all about seeing context.
3	Depends on how you define EQ. [Here's](https://www.ihhp.com/free-eq-quiz/) a sample EQ test, a lot of the questions are about one's ability to handle criticism, control over your emotions, that kind of stuff. Doesn't seem like it's about genuine empathy and building relationships and more about being separate from the emotional environment, rationally conceiving what other people are thinking, stuff like that. I'm saying yes to pretty much all of these questions. So, it makes sense ENTJs would score high on an EQ test. 
2	High EQ in the sense that it helps manage other people. Honestly, it's the only use I can see for it
2	Problems with "motivation"	I am super frustrated.\n\nI moved out to another country, started studying, got a job everything is going well, except that:\n\nMy room is a mess, I fell behind my school work and I've been "trying" to get into speed for two weeks and I just can't for some reason. I see myself falling behind my peers and the work I have to do, I want to catch up, but I don't do anything by the end of the day and feel like massive failure.\n\nIn addition, I think my father is ENTJ as well, and all life he has been kicking my ass whenever I got lazy. However, now I can't fall on my father for that. I think most people here will think I'm just lazy piece of shit with an excuse, and I am, but I don't want to be one and was hoping if anybody can offer me any tips.
5	This happens to me from time to time.  Usually short “moments” that over my life have lasted minutes, days and even months. For me it seems to happen when I lose sight of my purpose. I forget what I’m working towards and how a clean room or school is part of my overall purpose.  Do some soul searching to find your purpose, create a plan and get with it. I personally find EMyth Revisited by Gerber helpful reading in finding my “Primary Aim” aka purpose.  It’s mainly a biz/systems book but I like it also as it emphasizes our personal aim is essential in building a life we were created to live out. \n\nIf you do indeed need a “positive” kick in the ass then I would read “The War on Art” by Pressfield.  You can find the audio book for free on YouTube. \n\nLastly, calling yourself a lazy piece of shit is destructive, unproductive and nonsense. Stop that. 
3	Divide your goals (household, studying etc.) into smaller segments. Make a to do list and go point by point. That way the idea of starting seems less overwhelming and you are "finished" (and produce dopamine) more often along the way. Doing something (no matter how small the task) will get you into a positive mind space and that will motivate you to do more.
2	Just do it. I know it sounds very unhelpful, but what's preventing you from tidying your room right now? Starting on your school work? Personally, I never think about motivation. I just do it, or I don't do it. WHY I do something matters less than the fact that I do it, in this case at least. 
1	 I've been here lately, and have found getting organized helps a ton.\n\n Force yourself to make a to-do list, set phone reminders linking you back to it every morning when you wake up. Your list maybe long, but it gives you a place to start working when you get a bit of motivation. When you start working, don't stop.
2	Game apps	Hi fellow ENTJs!  What are you favorite game apps for your phone?  I like having one or two games that I get really into, to pass time while waiting in line or on a flight, etc.  Otherwise idle useless downtime that can be used for my own personal amusement.  It is even better if they need brainpower or are funny/interesting.  
1	Empires and Puzzles, Androdominion, Splendor, Solitaire Suite, The Trail, Neko Atsume (because kitteh)...
1	[Play Store] I have a couple, but the ones I play the most are:\n\n* Solitaire: Decked Out - it's my fave solitaire game because of the graphics and lack of ads.\n* Card Brawl - it is described as solitaire with a twist, but idk if that is accurate; it's fun as hell though!\n* Push Sushi - one of those puzzle games where you move pieces around to get something to a finishing point in X number of moves.\n* Choices: Stories You Play - it's that visual novel game everyone used to see ads for all the time; I only pay attention to two series. \n

6	Analyze My Situation	Hey all, I found this subreddit yesterday, and then proceeded to finally feel among my own people.  I have a question which at the end of the day I understand I'm responsible for, but would like your input as I found many of the discussions here to be of value.  \n\nSituation:  I am 24 years old, and like many of you have been a "go getter" all of my life.  Skipped a grade in high school, finished undergrad in three years (Finance), married at 19, full time job in college to pay my way, straight into working full time after degree, earned Certified Financial Planner designation, etc etc.  I don't say any of this to be braggadocious, but rather to give you some context into how I have tended to operate.  \n\nSo, fast forward today and I am in what many would call a dream position.  I work at a small Wealth Management firm under an amazing boss who is also an ENTJ.  I could count on one hand how many times we have had legitimate disagreements.  He pays me more than I am worth in regards to experience and age ($120kish depending on bonus), has given me a path to ownership in the future, and gives me leeway to do my job as effectively as I can.  He is the definition of a macromanager.  \n\nBut, I have noticed this discontentment start to creep in from time to time.  For one, his son is also in our business which can be hard to navigate.  They try very hard to be fair, but at the end of the day I am in a family business and not in the family.  In addition I almost feel as if I was given too easy a path forward, and that I need to quit to show I can put myself in as fortunate a position.  If I quit I would most likely start down the path of doing Rental Real Estate.  Further, my schedule tends to rely on when my boss has clients in.  This means I really don't control my schedule as hard as I may try.\n\nAll this being said, do you believe that I am simply finding something wrong with where I work without proper cause, or is there an actual argument that with my personality type I need to be "in charge of my own destiny"?\n\nThanks in advance for the input.  If you want more info I'm happy to provide.
6	I think you’re scared that you’ve peaked. You’re comfortable and you may think that the struggle, the climb, the brutal adventure of getting there is over. \n\nAn ENTJ at his best is voracious in his/her hunt for more. I’d say go for more but don’t forget that if you go for more you’ll potentially lose what you have. 
3	>at the end of the day I am in a family business and not in the family\n\nI feel like this is your main concern, but you have to understand that this is a sign of your boss' trust in you. This is a good thing, and he's clearly paying you well. Family businesses are typically superior work environments to the corporate world. If you are truly on the path to ownership or co-ownership and you like your boss, you have to understand that you are in a good position.\n\nRight now you do not have total control of your life because you are an employee and you are 24. In the grand scheme of things, you have not been with the company very long. However, you need to understand that there is only a very small percentage of control you are ceding to your boss -- maybe 10% based on your post. Everyone has to deal with shit schedules every now and then, and it sounds like you are given far more autonomy than most workers -- certainly more than anyone in a corporate job.\n\nHere is my advice: stay in this job for five years minimum, and then decide if you want to continue to stay. If you still feel like you want more control / autonomy, have that conversation with your boss, and be honest with him about your concerns and intentions. Maybe he will grant you that autonomy or control in your current business if he really trusts you and likes your work. And if he doesn't, you will have the work experience by then to create something worthwhile on your own.
3	Did you make this post to tell everyone how much money you make?
1	Stagnation.\n\nWhat is it you're working towards? This "path to ownership"? Does that satisfy you?\n\nI don't think this is about control unless you are exceptionally needy in that department. I think this is about you 'idling' and not being able to measure quantifiable progress towards a big objective. Can you refute that?
1	Tactical analysis. You may struggle to develop social skills. You married too early. You needed that grade in high school to work on interpersonal skills. You really need to focus on becoming part of the family and understanding relationships.
1	We're pretty similar OP, finished HS a year early and accelerated my undergrad by a year as well but I had compulsory military service which essentially eliminated the time saved. In my reply I'm going to assume you're worried because of what you perceive to potentially be inevitable stagnation and not because your ego needs to be stoked; if it is the latter, there's only 1 solution: growing up. \n\nOverall it is a valid concern but I'm pretty sure this is a good pathway that you should in fact stick to. In time you may consider moving on but right now the fact that you have been given preference over  a family member shows how much the boss values/likes you. However, you're right that there definitely might be a glass ceiling going on which you may not be able to break (being on a partner/ownership track is worthless if you can't actually get there). You may also want to consider what may potentially happen if your boss suddenly has to step down (health etc) and the son takes over; are you certain your position will still be secure? You shouldn't jump out of the ship so soon though. I suggest sticking around for a while longer and focus on doing your job well before parting amiably; if you in fact do gain partial ownership and your position is sufficiently secure, no harm sticking around right?  I'm sure I don't have to tell you its a rough world out there. Rn you're a big fish in a small pond which is a pretty good position to be in so as long as no one blows the pond up or looks like they're going to, you need not do anything but prepping to should be a chief concern. \n\nI would suggest continuing to accrue experience in this firm but also covertly preparing for the worst. Considering that the market has been going strong for quite some time, a recession is bound to happen sooner or later so you should factor this into the equation and more importantly how you would not want to be in finance when it does implode (far too much risk that you may potentially fuck it up - much safer to just not be there when it happens). A good way to leave this firm, avoid the worst of the recession and springboard yourself into a better position is to start saving up for business school (and prepping for the GMAT) at a proper ivy league school. You can start applying once you've gotten >7 years of experience. Remember that you'll be there as much for the learning as the **network**. \n\nRegarding rental real estate, hope you have experience with REITs before you actually take the plunge; where would you be getting the capital from? \n\nps: married at 19? You're either really lucky or you fucked up. 
0	entjs look like this when angry lol?	i noticed that entjs when they get angry they tend to 'look like' they going crazy lol.theres this one bussiness man who is an entj that i work for,he hates inefficiency. and will really scold.but if someone tries to challenge him lol. all hell breaks loose,eg if someone is sarcastic with him,he will use this type of manipulation as to make him look stupid.but anyways,as hes scolding he looks like hes in great pain and hes about to explode into a mad house lol? any thoughts from other entjs?
9	Depends.  \n\nMy beast is on a short leash, so my anger is controlled.  When frustration builds, it looks like I am controlling myself, very mindfully being as logical and specific in word choice as possible. \n\nIf there is an outburst, you've either pushed me to the point of breaking the leash, or caught me off guard. Neither of which happens often, and normally scares people when it does.
3	Hmmm, depends. Often times I will raise my voice slightly to be more forceful, but it takes a good amount to make me really angry. Annoyance or frustration is much more common for me, and my preferred method of "scolding" is expressing disappointment and pointing people in the right direction.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have found, after a number of mistakes early on, that it's easier to trap flies with honey, and so the first mistake i would provide guidance, the 2nd or 3rd would probably receive disappointment - after that I'm pissed because if you're still making the same mistake at that point either you're a moron or you are fucking with me. 
2	When I get angry I kinda warn you to stay away because I know I can get pretty physical when people try to test my temper. I would have a fast mood change from non angry automatically to a hothead which is what people call me. Pretty much I would clench my fist if I were angry when I try to calm down and have a intense expression  trying to relax to prevent hell break loose and school suspension. 🤦‍♀️
3	Takes quite a bit to piss us off but I don't think ENTJs in general are prone to emotional outbursts (gloating after a victory is a different story). \n\nDoubt getting angry while scolding you is indicative of anything lol. The fact that he bothers demonstrates either weakness or his care for you. Personally, if someone I didn't like made a mistake (from back when I was in the military or during work/school projects), I would just not bother and cut them or get someone else to fuck them up on my behalf. Why bother scolding someone stupid when you can get someone else to do it for you? As those above have mentioned, if its someone under me and they're inefficient, the first few times I'll guide them in the right direction but if its a frequent occurrence I won't bother reasoning with them and just sack them. \n\nI don't get angry at work. The lowest range of my emotions usually ends at disappointment of frustration but never anger. I only get angry if a friend stabs me in the back or someone does something savage like kicking a dog or a kid for fun - that would set me off for certain. People being stupid and/or attempting to challenge my authority is just part and parcel of everyday life; why get pissed off? Smack them back to where they belong and carry on \n\nAlso, are you certain he's an ENTJ? He could also be an ESTJ. Unless someone actually tells you their type or you're an expert, its pretty hard to conclude what someone is on the basis of your observation of their behavior alone.

6	Do ENTJs ghost people they don’t like?	I mean, try and avoid a person at all costs because they feel wildly uncomfortable in their presence.
15	Yeah, but I tend to avoid people I find annoying. Not very many people make me feel uncomfortable. 
19	I think everyone does this to a degree and ENTJs are no exception.  I can't speak to how much exactly but I know I occasionally do this.  Mainly because I don't let people waste my time.  I generally don't do this to people I feel uncomfortable with because those are usually crushes or people more powerful than me (of which are people I can actually learn things from).
9	It's less to do with being uncomfortable and more to do with not wanting to waste my time (unless it poses a greater problem down the road). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also take the time to reflect why I feel a certain way towards someone and whether or not it's beneficial down the road which can also be seen as avoidance too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI like people who make me uncomfortable because it makes me ask why. Those that are downright creep - need not apply.\n\n&#x200B;
8	My SO is the ENTJ in my life and in the 13 years or so that we’ve been together, he’s cut an average of one person a year completely from his life. However, he has at least one or two clear conversations with them first to try to hash it out.\n\nTo a certain degree, I envy his ability to do this. I’m an INFJ, so I just keep people around forever and try to accommodate for whatever the issue is or avoid them without any confrontation. 
6	I typically make them gradually more uncomfortable around me on purpose so they feel it was their idea, then I don't have to feel like an asshole and I get a good reference if anyone asks of, "we just drifted apart."
10	Nope, never.\n\nI never ghost people.  Sure I stop talking to them, but I just tell people how it is.\n\nI would think this is typical of ENTJ's but I guess not.
4	I can't speak for all of us, but I do. 
4	I am over 40’so “ghosting” is not normal for us, but I’ve handled this what I consider the ENTJ way, flat out telling someone why I am breaking off a friendship and it was pretty awful.  \n\nGhosting might have been easier for me but I think it drives people crazy not knowing why they’ve been abandoned. I think it’s kinder to tell them, although very uncomfortable.  You feel like an asshole either way...
3	I know do. But I usually also think about why they make me feel uncomfortable and if there’s a rational reason I make it known so the other person doesn’t even try anymore to be around me \n
3	I haven't done that, but I do grow cold to them to the point where they leave.
2	Hell yes I do,  you can see my disdain a mile away so why put us both through it
2	I never ghost people I know, even acquaintances. Mostly because everyone knows not to bother me unless they have a point. I only ever ghost people with whom I speak to online for like 5 minutes, and then I get really bored of them and ghost them. 
2	Maybe not at \*all\* costs. Loud people and generally shitty people or people i just don't like to be around for whatever reason... i will go to all reasonable lengths to avoid them. If that person is going to be at an event i have been invited to then i am very likely to give that event a complete skip. And i'll probably point out to the event organiser that this is why i will not be attending. They can do with that information whatever they please.
2	Yes. Because I usually outright end things but people in 2018 usually don’t get the blunt hint, so I ghost them and move on with my life. Usually no ill will and I wish them all the best. 
2	I won't just disappear and have to think about the next time I see them. I tell it like it is. There are people who will talk on and on about nothing or gossip and shit. I tell them I do not like talking to them or being around them because:
2	I ghost people when they are not worth my time anymore, not because I am uncomfortable.\n\nIf I care enough about a person before I drop them altogether, I will let them know why and then exit. 
1	M yeah I ghost people but not in an awkward way. Sometimes I just get bored with people or distracted by life and don't have the energy to upkeep interpersonal relationships. \n\nDepending on the situation I'll also sometimes just say "I don't want to talk to you anymore or see you again" 
1	I agree with RFF671 about everything doing it to a degree; I think people do it even when they don't mean to.\n\nMe, personally, I try not to. If I don't want to talk to or be around someone, I usually tell them. It's not my fault if they take it personally (i.e. if I just don't have time to give to that person or if they just aren't my cup of tea- you cannot please everyone). *However*, it depends on the severity of the situation. A great example of this for me was cutting my childhood best friends out of my life. They were both toxic people that loved to cause a scene, and also seemed to only get cozy with me when something was going wrong for them. So, I completely cut both of them out; one took a little longer than the other.
1	I pretty much ghost everyone via text.\nMy inbox fills rapidly and I would be spending all of my time answering people if I texted everyone back\n(I’m not saying this to brag, I just know a lot of people- and all of them are big on texting)\n\nI only really text to set up plans.\nI prefer talking to people irl 99.99% of the time\n\nEdit: spelling corrections 
1	Yes, I burn bridges with no mercy\nSome people are waist of time and can make us fail 
1	Do ENTJs often go for INTPs?	Just gonna keep this short.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo ENTJs often go for INTPs?  Is our ability to perceive logical outcomes that powerful?\n\nThere's been some talk saying XSFJs tend to steal you away (to your own detriment).  I'm just wondering if I would realistically have a chance at this point in time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\[Also, side note... any female entjs (25-30) looking for a date in san diego?  I'm statistically unlikely to find you lol... (I'm probably an INTP; 31m)\]
5	I don't like P types in general and I find INTPs too slow. My favorites are INFJ and ENFJ :)
12	[deleted]
4	Im ENTJ male in border with ENTP, for me INTP's are 2nd pick, i met few of them and i love this match but never been in romantic relationship with any of them, but i would like to. First pick is INFP, and why? I feel like INTP can handle my intelligence and talk with me about things interesting for me. It's all about Ti and Te match, INFP is opposite. ENTJ/INTP relationships on paper are easy, because both can understand each other easily but i would more like someone who is my opposite, who can help me with my Fi. I can work on my intellect on my own, i don't need help. But yea, INTP will accept jerk part of me, while for INFP it would be hurtful. 
4	I like ISTPs better. Like NPs as friends and for conversation but they're generally too in their head and soft for me. I don't care about MBTI enough to date someone because of their type but that's the trend I've noticed in myself. 
3	Well, Im a female ENTJ who ended up with an INTP.. Im curious though, why are you only interested in women younger than you?
4	I love INTP’s
2	Tbh I’ve ruled a lot of things out lol.  I don’t really care anymore, nothing good came of this.\n\nPosting in r/entj is akin to jumping into a den of lions lol.\n\nEdit: To answer the question, I only just turned 31 a few days ago.
2	My husband is an INTP. We were engaged already when he did his Myers Briggs. It works because we are both rational and on the same wave-length ‘intuitive’ if you will so normally whoever’s argument is better will win the argument in our relationship. He’s also quite confident, his introversion does not make him passive. He isn’t afraid to stand up to me whereas I’ve had relationships where the other person always gave into what I wanted and it ended up very unhealthy. \n\nEDIT: I will say he did feel like a naturally better match and partner for me when we met. The match up between our personality types just feels like a bonus.
1	1 its contextual. we have not reached a point where we either understand or are sensitive to human virtue  \n2 we dont have the tools to make it happen \n3 by becomin flexible we can make almost everything work  > look at isfjs and intps
1	I'm an ENTJ an I always fall for INTP's. 
1	Supposedly an ISTP is your perfect perfect match in that while the thinking first function matches up, you both do Ni and Se, you both envision a future for yourself and takes the steps to make it happen. Whereas in an INTP you would share no functions, and no, opposites do not attract unless there’s some level of glaring commonalities(sometimes Ti+Te can be enough, but why risk it? Find yourself an ISTP today)
1	Yes but not because of the reasons you think of. I think it's safe to say that ENTJs as a whole are already pretty effective at being able to "perceive logical outcomes" (albeit only ones relevant to our goals) and don't need someone else to confirm the fact that we are in fact capable at doing this. If anything it would just be a baser instinct in that we would feel more chill discussing topics with you guys cos you wont tend towards sudden "muh feels" thought processes. Personal opinion here but I would also be looking for a friend in a romantic partner as well which includes tons of logical discussion so that's definitely attractive to me. \n\ntl;dr - Yes I would\n\nPs: if there are any <23 y/o XX INTPs in the Sydney area HMU. Preferably someone in science or vet cos I'm in med and would be cool if our fields matched \n

4	How you were at high school?	Just curious, how did you behave, who you were etc. 
18	Lost, on the verge of depression. Worst years of my life.
9	Always busy, studying to get good grades, exploring new things, planning my life out, hanging w friends 
7	High school and teenage years were not kind to me as I had not developed my N and was what most would call a "live wire". This is gonna sound like a humble brag at first but stick with me, it's not. So schoolwork was always ridiculously easy for me and I refused to study. I was always reading 2 or 3 novels at once. I played baseball and it came easy as well. However, somewhere around eight grade I grew very bored with school and decided it was a waste of time. Dropped out, got my ged, and started working in the same month. I kick myself sometimes thinking of how many opportunities I wasted before I got a grip on the overbearing part of my personality.
6	(F ENTJ here) Was the classic overachiever who freaked out when I got less than an A on a test. Was the captain of the debate team, leader of an extra-curricular biology team, a physics and chemistry olympiad. Was always called bitchy but I didn't care because at that point I always thought (or knew) that I was right. Didn't make that many close friends but for the ones I did we're extremely tight.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCurrently studying in an arts college and I'm jokingly described as "Drunk Hermione Granger". 
5	I went to high school in two countries.\n\n9th to mid 10th grade I went to high school in the USA, my parents constantly breathed down my neck to represent the perfect child so they would look good. I had major depression and anxiety but I was still functional and received decent grades (mid 80s), played sports, did martial arts and snuck around to hook up with other guys and go to parties. Thought about dying a lot.\n\nThen I moved to Brazil.\n\n10th to 12th I was away from my parents. I received top grades in my class (I was valedictorian), I went out with friends, to parties, no longer had to hide, played lots of soccer, dated a lot, was no longer forced to participate in religion (although my mother tried from a continent away). It was awesome.
5	Depression manifested in human form. Mostly had to do with a completely new environment and me not knowing myself. 
3	Busy, officer in a bunch of clubs, top of the class, did everything to earn a full merit scholarship to college which I eventually succeeded at. Socially I did alright, I had good friends and people respected me. I branched out more after high school. So I would summarize myself back then as a driven, functional nerd.
2	Busy!!!
2	Half of it was full of friendships and breezing through my classes.  Second half when I moved to a new school was hell, sprouting mental illness, abuse and bullying. Despite the good half in the beginning I wouldn’t redo any of it lmao 
2	Awkward, quiet, socially inept, schoolwork was always easy, but had largely no interest in being the best.\n\nNever had any confidence, was always self-conscious. Also tubby all through school (still am, but care less now).\n\nWhen given an outlet I would let myself go, but was never high enough in the social structure to be anything but a follower. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLooking back now it feels like I was in a box all through school
1	Kind of nerdy but got along with a bunch of different social groups, got good grades and on the debate team. Had a bit of a snooty "I hate everyone and am too good for this" thing going on. Some partying, no dating. 
1	I hated high school. I didn't hate my classes or anything; I hated that I had the potential to do and be so much, and I couldn't bring myself to do more than what I was doing. It was definitely the part of my life where depression+anxiety ruled over everything. I also had not yet started therapy, so I was a very different, weaker person than who I am now.\n\nI was pretty well-rounded despite that though. I was not popular, but people knew who I was because I was involved in so many things. I was in all honors/AP classes, I played soccer and field hockey, I was in culinary club, orchestra, the academic team, and my favorite: I did JROTC. It was only for senior year, but damn I wish I took it all four years. I think that I involved myself in so many things because I was trying to outrun the way that I felt about myself on the inside.
1	**Results**: Classes were easy (straight A for everything) but I found HS to be very stifling and so endeavored to get out ASAP. Graduated a year ahead. \n\n**Social**: Was quite social and was part of multiple cliques but secretly never felt like I fit into any of them (with the exception of a few solid bros who I still am close to).\n\n**Relationships**: Guys in my cohort were hilariously unattractive which made me quite popular among the girls cos I would be a 7-8 at best but got attention worthy of a 9-10. After dating a few I realized many were shallow and it was really exasperating to discuss any meaningful topic with them; barely any knew where they were heading in life and most just wanted to use me to incite jealousy in their girlfriends - it was retarded and I stopped dating altogether after a while. \n\n**Extracurriculars**: Didn't bother too much with school run extracurricular activities, I would just hang out with my close friends or go home to do my own stuff. Continued to do kyokushin karate and muay thai through HS (started in middle school) but nothing too hardcore. I did however run a trading card "business" on the side trading with people and hosting tournaments for $$$ - made a good profit off it which was enough to buy me a GTX670, a 360, a ton of games among other crazier expenditures. However, quite a few dumb cunts were skipping meals/stealing money from their parents and using the money to gamble at my tournaments and parents found out. Principal and the discipline master (yeah I'm not american and we have those here) did a bit of hunting and I got an in-school suspension for 3 days + some law enforcement dude came down to talk to me but nothing on record cos they didn't want to fuck with the top scorer nor did they even disclose to the parents who was responsible. Principal told the parents that it was a valuable lessons for their kids about the dangers of gambling and said he wouldn't look into the matter further or ask anyone to return any of their earnings because everyone lost and gained $$$ without any proper record. In retrospect I should've started investing using the money I earned instead of balling so hard but oh well can't cry over spilled milk. This was without a doubt the highlight of my high school.\n\nThat's honestly about it. It was really boring overall and I was much happier in uni (heck even my time in the military was more enjoyable), if I had a choice and some way to still meet my good friends, I wouldn't even bother attending HS and would've just taken the uni entrance exams 
1	Nerdy cheerleading captain, on the student council, who was friends with everyone, especially if my so-called popular peers thought those people were bellow them, I'd make a point to befriend them and make them feel accepted.  I have a weird ability to read people, and stick up for the "little guy."  I thoroughly disliked fake people or those who would put down others to make themselves look better.  \n\nSchool work came naturally to me, and was fairly boring, so I didn't put much effort into it, but still did well.  I thrived in classes where I was allowed to do things outside the box.  For example, in my history class, we did a group presentation on JFK's presidency and assassination.  Without asking my history teacher, I brought in my physics teacher as an expert witness to discuss to trajectory of the bullet.  My political science teacher was young, and I was often able to nudge my way into taking over the class discussion and ask probative questions that I thought the other students would benefit from.         \n\nEdit - I also had a job, a small side business, and was a member of many clubs and received several scholarships.
1	I thought I was ESTP, and I bragged about it
1	Was mistyped as INTJ back then since I didn’t want to come close to my classmates.\n\nAt that time I suffered from inferiority complex and depression, almost killed myself until visiting the psychiatrist. 
3	What are some good ways to screw with an ENTJ?	My brother and I are kinda playing a game of sorts, and it's a long story. But he's an ENTJ, and I'd appreciate some ways to really tick him off. Nothing illegal, and nothing sexual because he's my brother. But anything else would be helpful. No matter how subtle or obvious it is.
29	Pretty easy just pretend to ignore any important info about something and decide based ENTIRELY of emotion or tradition. Re-organize his stuff then gas light when he asks. Interrupt him in the middle of a complex issue or conversation. Idk if you need more I can direct you to my brother who has it down to a science and thinks its hilarious.
18	Start conversations with really, really dumb shit, like "you know, when you think about it, evolution doesn't really make sense" and then end the conversation and refuse to talk about it.
13	Pseudoscience, conspiracy theories, and new-age spirituality mixed with Eastern philosophy. E.g. Vaccinations are a collaboration between big pharma to sell snake oil, and government are getting kick backs for promoting them. You're healing your body with tumeric capsules and vitamin C. For general wellbeing you put it out into the universe, because like attracts like, but you're not too concerned because your guru tells you not to cling to worldly things. \n\nFML 
25	Start making irrational decisions and insist that they’re deeply rooted in your unwavering morality.\n\nI.e. “I got really sad after watching a climate change documentary and decided to switch to a clean energy supplier for our electric bill and it’s gonna cost us an extra $80 a month total. It’s only fair we keep splitting the bill in half, you can Venmo me because the utility bill is in my name anyway” 
9	Waste their time by making them listen to your monologue about making irrational  decisions. Then waver back and forth about the decision for a while. Then do nothing about the conclusion you came to. Then talk about your feelings about the decision that you did nothing about.
7	Make them love you then expect them to know what you’re thinking and get mad when they don’t do/say/think what you want them to. Drives me fucking insane.
7	Any time you're driving together, take the longer, less efficient way to your destination.
5	I agree with the emotionally based viewpoint discussion. You'll earn bonus points if they're chocked full of allness statements ('..nobody would..,' '..everyone knows..', '..it's common knowledge..').\n\nAlso, try and argue the opposite viewpoint, and continue to argue \*just\* for the sake of   \narguing.  \n \n\nHim: TFA was exactly like ANH, and here's proof (example 1, example 2,...example 8..)  \nYou: TFA was nothing like ANH, and that's why I like it more! In fact, it was \*way\* better than ROTJ!   \n \n\nYou: Everyone knows that Revolutions was the best out of the Matrix Trilogy.  \nHim: (Fuming.) 
3	Show up late, make a horrible excuse about why. Whatever you’re showing up for, only half engage in the activity. Find a way to mess with the efficiency or effectiveness of his plans while you’re at it.  Get really emotional when he confronts you pointedly, for the cherry on top.
4	tbh if my sibling did this to me i'd move out and delete their contact. i don't accommodate people who intentionally try to inconvenience me, even a little. but i hope yall have fun though! 
4	How do ENTJs react to when being provoked?	What do you do in the situations when someone “fucks with you” as they say? 
21	[deleted]
10	I resolve it, usually by taking them aside and addressing whatever concern or reason they have for acting out. \n\nIf they are close minded and unwilling to engage with me in productive conversation using the CPR method (constructively, privately, respectfully), then I escalate it to a superior and tell them that I would like their input on how to resolve it. \n\nIf someone is being petty and my boss refuses to intervene then you have to get creative, usually by buddying up with others and inciting them to defend you and stand up for you against them when said person decides to act out. \n\nMaking friends with others and having them defend you is always way more efficacious IMO because it becomes organic and nips potential provocations in the bud.\n\nIt's rare for an asshat to fuck with a person who has a lot of clout in the form of friendships.\n\nWe know how to make friends and influence people...so use it.
6	They calmly cut you down with an insult so hurtful and personal you have nothing to do but take your truth bomb and go home.  Then they forget you.
3	Cactus Therapy
2	Worked as a bouncer for two years.\n\nI tended to not tolerate that stuff, but not escalate either.\n\nWe cut people out by pretty much deciding that they’re inadequate judges; nothing they say has any affect from here on out.\n\nIf someone is making a personal attack in a personal setting, I leave.
2	I use evolutionary psychology to subconsciously manipulate them. That generally makes them stop fucking with you, but you have to do it right.
2	As an E... I am aware of the power of my "disappointment" face. I try to reserve it for the truly deserving. When someone (usually my boss) provokes me by making ill-informed decisions, I say (using my J voice), "My (professional) advice was documented in the last two emails I sent you, meeting minutes from our last three 1:1s, and during the recent stand-up meeting with YOUR boss. "I can only make recommendations to you because MY job is making YOU look good to your boss."\n\nUsually this tactic is successful because he can privately re-read my recommendations. I understand he processes complex information slower than me.\n\n     Patience is the key.\n\nI am successful about 60-70% of the time.\n\nI should note that I have been written up three times for insubordination in the last two years... Probably because I am impatient. \n\nThat said, I probably won't get fired for the reasons below:\n\nUse your J strengths to build a case. \n\nLeverage your E to build a network of loyal support.\n\nAnd don't forget the reason N is important... Thinking outside the box is your best asset.\nFind a way around the issue. Discover another department--for you or the annoying employee. Or find a task the employee can do without interaction or supervision from you. Stuff the provocateur in a corner...creatively.\n\nYou have the natural skill set to "briar patch" the bitch. He/she thinks they are winning. Go ahead. Win, dude. In a briar patch.
2	I try to resolve it verbally\n\nIf they fuck with me or try to manipulate me after that, then I just wipe my hands and cut them from my life.
13	When upset or frustrated with life, do you tend to withdraw or that’s when you want the company of others more?	Say you’ve been disappointed and rejected lately, would you tend to withdraw or you’d prefer that someone close to you (e.g. your SO) would comfort you? If you’d like to be comforted, how?
23	Depends, i mostly comfort my own self
16	Withdraw like a dying animal
15	Depends, with noobs around me i withdraw. A great NT-conversation however builds me up!
11	Withdraw af
6	Withdrawal unless I find another NT to kick my ass and get back to senses. 
6	Depends on how important that thing was to me. Something small - company. Something major - withdrawal. 
5	I withdraw. Then when I’m ready, I seek some NF company first, then NT company when I’m feeling more myself.
3	Super circumstantial. If the pain involves someone else I'll go solo and be the strong one (things like death). If it's only me going through it then I know opening up to someone will help no matter how hard it is.
5	It depends on the level of upset or frustrated. A tough day at work? I will want to grab a friend or two and grab a drink. If I get past a certain point, I do completely shut down and withdraw so I can process and work through shit on my own.
2	On the whole withdraw to process all relevant data points. But I'd seek out company to suspend thinking if I feel the person can understand me.
1	Don’t know about withdrawal since that’s kind of my default state anyway. Perhaps I would be withdrawing from my withdrawal? No, that doesn’t sound right.
6	ENFJ with ENTJ Tendencies	I am an ENFJ in my personal life, however, the older I get, the more it feels like I am becoming an ENTJ, at least in a professional environment.\n\nCan anyone speak to this change I am experiencing? And to be honest, ENTJs sound like they get more accomplished in an efficient manner than ENFJs, and that sounds great to me!
16	I don't think people just change types like that. It is more likely you've learned how to not let emotions get in your way at work. \n\nAs an ENTJ myself, I find myself pretending to emotionally support someone who is venting at work, when really I'm thinking hurry up I have stuff to do and this has no impact on advancing our goals. \n\nDifferent hats for different roles. I'm patient when I need to be and I listen when I need to listen. It doesn't mean I've found an emotional bone in my body nor does it mean I've developed into an ENFJ, it just means at that particular moment in time I've learned that this is the easiest way to handle things.\n\nIn short, I find it highly unlikely you've turned from a feeler into a thinker. I still don't believe that people ever really change.
2	~~This is probably not a very satisfying answer, but your type probably did not change. Instead, you are likely strengthening your extroverted thinking (Te) function. This is the third cognitive function of ENFJs, while it is the first function of ENTJs. So while it might seem like you are more ENTJ-like in the professional world, what's likely happening is you are using our primary function more prominently in your professional life, which gives the appearance or seeming as though you're becoming more like an ENTJ.~~\n\n~~ENTJs and ENFJs are both "leader" types, imo, but they come at the task of leadership from oblique perspectives -- like two lines in a 3D grid that go towards roughly the same endpoint, but never intersect. This is reflected in the function stacks of both types.~~\n\nIgnore this post everything I wrote was completely wrong. But I think what's likely happening is not a type change, but instead an emphasis of other cognitive functions through the lens of an ENFJ.
8	How to find your passion/industry	ENTJ here. I am nearing the end of my graduate studies and I am struggling to know which job or industry I should apply for. I have previously been in politics at a very young age and I have volunteered in a third world country and have a couple of more politics related intermship under my belt. I have helped friends with their startups (unpaid) throughout the last years and I have worked on my own (small) idea for some passive income. My major is a foreign language and business. I do not want to work in politics again but rather in business. I have great grades, have perfected the language I have been studying and got one of the most competitive scholarships in the world at a very good uni.\n\nAs all ENTJ's I love being competitive amd solving problems. I have identified thr flaws of my friend's startups and helped them with great success. I am usually at the top of my game at what I do, no matter what it is.\n\nNow the but. My problem is that since I quit politics I don't know what I want next. My plan is to work corporate for a few years im a big city and save a lot of money, live in a tiny apt ., provide for my future and network. The long term goal is a startup and freedom. But I don't know which industry. I dont even know how to try an industry as their first question is: what is your previous experience in our industry? \n\nHave I really fucked up by travelling and doing exciting stuff in my teens and early twenties? I feel like the coffee making internships are now missing.\n\nAny advice on how you have found your industry/passion and how to enter the corporate world without prior experience?
3	I actually graduated with a political science degree and was going to get into law after school. Didn’t end up working out for various reasons but I did find myself in corporate finance, project management and data analytics (SQL, Python, R, Tableau and the like). It’s hard at first, to report to someone who you think is an idiot — at least that’s what I’ve encountered sometimes — and “pay your dues” but don’t be afraid to take risks. ENTJs are great at vision and details, so marry that to something you think is missing in the world and run with it. Heck, you can even partner with those who have execution strengths if you have an appetite for risk and get a startup running! Don’t be ashamed of going for internships as well. To explain the gap you had with traveling, push that into your resume and provide soft skills you learned from travel. It’s still experience. Good luck!
3	> Have I really fucked up by travelling and doing exciting stuff in my teens and early twenties? I feel like the coffee making internships are now missing.\n\nJesus, you have to be an ENTJ to ask this question.\n\nWhich languages do you speak? It can matter.\n\nYou should combine your existing skills with something you are at least somewhat passionate about and something that pays.\n\nIt could be import / export.\n\nYou could move to Pittsburg and work for https://www.duolingo.com/jobs if they hire you.\n\nThere is a lot of money to be made in many industries but if you are indifferent, I recommend IT / software. For example, you can try your hand at building web sites for people. Could be useful when you need to have a web site for your own business.\n\nYou can increasingly work remotely thus potentially saving a ton of money on rent. You could even travel while working.\n\nYou could also earn some side income here:\n\nhttps://www.upwork.com/o/jobs/browse/c/translation/\n\nIt may not be as good as working for a corporation, but it can make you more https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragile\n\nImagine living in say Thailand on $200 per month where you spend 20 hours per week just doing gigs and the other 20+ building a company.\n\nYou could start doing that as early as a few months from now provided that you establish a stream of clientele.\n\nDon't be a yet another boring ENTJ.\n\nSomething tells me that you are a female, so having kids can be a concern, but other than that - the world is your oyster. Knowledge of foreign languages looks good on your "dating resume" if you are looking for a smart partner.\n\n
3	Hello! I’m a project manager and I think it fits my ENTJ personality really well. I started in digital marketing & communications, managing campaigns and website builds, because my degree is in communications. The experience allowed me to move into PM work for software development, which I LOVE. If you’re ever bored and interested in reading up on process, agile project management has a lot to dig into and the principles can be applied to many different kinds of work.\n\nYour language skills would definitely give you a leg up for tech companies reaching users who speak those languages! \n\nBest of luck!
3	Have you considered a career in technical writing? Or you are familiar (or can become familiar with ASD-STE100?) Many jobs are available for you in aviation. Especially in avionics software.\n\nEspecially for contractors. Work from home, yo. 
1	What city?
1	Apply for as many as possible and look at any and all available options. I good ENTJ can thrive in any situation. Every job or experience you have makes you stronger.
6	Help navigating the corporate world as an ENTJ intern	I am currently in a competitive intern to hire program in a corporate business that runs on billable hours. We have weekly meetings where we discuss our level of busy-ness on a defined scale. Today at our meeting I expressed that I was on the lowest end of the scale. The intern manager asked whether I understood how the scale worked (implying that I should reevaluate my level and provide a higher response) and I replied with my same answer wanting to be honest. \n\nI am given assignments and I work on them straight away wanting to prove that I am capable and qualified to be there. I frequently ask guidance and assistance on aspects of which I am uncertain, but still complete my tasks with ample time for revisions and edits. Thus far I've completed every assignment before deadlines with plenty of time to spare. \n\nI have attempted asking my direct trainer and the intern manager for more work/responsibilities to no avail. I expressed my low response to show that I want more work/responsibilities during the office meeting to which the office supervisor asked my direct trainer if there was opportunity for me to be utilized. \n\nUpon speaking with my mom she expressed that I threw my trainer and intern manager under the bus for giving an honest response to the state of my busy-ness level. \n\nI have never worked in the corporate world prior to this internship and I am in need of help navigating the proper way to handle office politics. \n\nWas I wrong? What should I have done? What would be advice on how to do damage control and remain in the good graces of my coworkers? \n\nI love what I do and do not want to lose out on future opportunities. Lastly this office highly believes in mbti and know that I am entj. 
5	Until you're actually both an employee and aware of the political landscape, I strongly suggest you bide your time and act like everyone else does. Remember that you may be a gifted baby that will grow up into a superpower but the generic adults in the room can still strangle you in your sleep. Same concept, don't rock the boat till you're the strongest dude on it\n\nAlso, I wouldn't want to join such a company if the metric they use to measure performance is how "busy" you are. Trust me, some slow and stupid guy is going to truly busy himself and be seen as superior to you despite you completing the exact same task in a shorter time frame. It is quite literally the anti-thesis to our measure of efficiency. If your goal is to have a solid career progression, sometimes it is easier to get out of the kitchen if you can't stand the heat than attempt to change the entire system you're placed in.\n\nYou want a proper action plan? Acknowledge that you probably already fucked up your chance at being hired because you just screwed 2 superiors at one go + threw the office culture into question. To salvage the situation, try your best to kiss ass/curry favor to get good references. Don't bother with this company any longer, take the references and use it to springboard to someplace better. 
3	> Was I wrong? What should I have done? What would be advice on how to do damage control and remain in the good graces of my coworkers?\n\nDo you really want to play office politics to that extent?\n\n> I love what I do and do not want to lose out on future opportunities. Lastly this office highly believes in mbti and know that I am entj.\n\nI assume that you are quite young.\n\nOne thing you want to do is figure out who you are and where you belong. If you can handle office politics - ok, good. Just polish your soft skills. Pay attention to what is going on. I do not mean gossip but how people work in general.\n\nThis internship is an important step so you do not want to sabotage anything, but you also want to not bend over too much.\n\nThe worst case scenario is that you do not get good references at the end of the internship. They are unlikely to fire you.\n\nYou can try to figure out how the office politics works, but maybe you will find out that you would rather be a freelancer or start your own company. You do not want to bend over too much. Maybe it is hard to tell when you are young when you are busting your ass serving the clients (an honorable thing to do) and when you are just bending over because of politics (a lame thing to do). If you can't find your proper path within the system, try finding it outside the system. That does mean potentially wasting the internship, but it is the price you would pay for figuring out who you are.\n\nOn the positive note, you will be dead in like 70 years if not sooner, so try to have fun TODAY.\n
2	> do you really wanna play office politics to that extent?\n\nI pride myself on navigating different ecosystems with relative ease. At the end of the day I am looking for positive references. I do notice virtually all of my coworkers with multiple browsers open flipping between work and cyber loafing. I feel (and I hate using that term) that my social rapport with them is positive. \n\nIs it an unspoken rule that while working in billables to push deadlines to the limit? \n\nI view most, if not all, of the corporate world as a high stakes game. I would just want to know the rules and the meta game to give myself the best chance at winning. \n\nEdit: I meant to reply to u/nut_conspiracy_nut
1	I currently am at intern at a much smaller operation. My goal is to complete my task at the given time, and am currently trying to learn from experience how to go one step further and show that I am straining myself and pushing my boundaries. I get the sense that in my situation, enthusiasm and effort are more valued than results, because my supervisor knows I can't provide AMAZING results because I don't have the training. Does the last sentence I said feel applicable to you?
9	Better to stay silent and lose the spotlight or retain it by saying something?	What's your opinion on this bit?  \nWhen to speak and when not to?\n\nWhen I’m sitting with my work peers and they talk stuff about work, even though if I know a little more than them I stay quiet because I just started out. I don’t want to show that I’m over confident and etc and trust me, people say such shit. I’m thinking I’ll just try and prove myself first and then speak if at all. 
5	Both schools of thoughts have their pros and cons. If you reserve yourself, you can think things through a little better and get a better understanding of what you're going to say exactly. The con is someone might overshadow you by saying it first... assuming that what you're going to say is revolutionary. If it is really a load of horsecrap, well you just saved your own face from embarrassment. \n\nThe other way which is to say it anyway, you can get more discussion and debate to further fine tune your idea with other people but you might get grilled while the tuning is in progress. 
3	There's a difference between confidence and arrogance. If it's about the success of the team, and you know the better way/solution, then speak up. If not, let them talk just to talk. 
3	People are fucking crazy. Most of the time, unless this is related to work, you want to keep your thoughts to yourself and find a personal outlet after work.
2	We'd need more context to give an accurate answer. There are numerous reasons to justify either case. 
2	You have to strike a balance between Law #4 and Law #6.\nhttp://www.deconstructingexcellence.com/the-48-laws-of-power-summary/
2	It is the art of being a gentleman.  Putting people at ease an sidestepping the spotlight when necessary.  Build an outstanding reputation and soon it will be clear who knows what is what.  If you are seeking to correct bad information, simply pose a question in regard to the topic and drop your knowledge in the course of the conversation. This will help you avoid sounding like a know it all.
2	Let them puzzle it out for themselves. If they are well and truly stuck, they’ll go silent, and you can speak your piece and look like a genius. Otherwise, you just sound overly opinionated. \n\nPeople need time to think through a problem. Sometimes some people do that verbally. If you don’t let them do that - by giving them the answer too early - they get frustrated. \n\nSure, it’s annoying to wait. But getting to the right answer is rarely as important as getting everyone on board with the right answer. So you have to let everyone come to the right understanding in their own way, even if that means leaving them alone for a few moments. 
2	Do you gain something from speaking out? If its about something stupid like sports or grapevine bs, its better to just let them have the "win" no matter how misguided they are so that when it comes down to things that matter like work, you can take the win and they won't make too much noise.\n\nIn any given group, people do want to feel like their opinions matter and they know stuff others don't. If you attempt to rob them of this pride in areas where you literally will not gain any benefit from winning an argument, you may strain the relationship. It's better to be known as the guy who is crazy "work-focused" and an expert in it than a jackass know it all (even if you do) across multiple fields.\n\nJust don't be an ass not just because its morally right but simply because you may need your colleagues in future endeavors (if you're overly concerned about effectiveness) and their aid maybe solely reliant on their opinion of you. 
4	Thoughts on calling in sick?	Asking since my mother is an ENTJ and I’m currently sick (ISTP). The other day, I called in sick since I’d gotten a bug and flu from going out to a party on the weekend and had been chucking up Monday lol, and today it’s still here (though only a little bit more tolerable) and she asked why I wasn’t getting ready and I said I was calling in sick again since I’d only gotten half an hour of sleep. She then proceeded to blow up about how she never has days off and I’m lazy and I’ll probably get fired, even though I work fucking hard and more hours than I’m supposed to.\n\nSo I was just wondering what your opinions are on calling in sick for work if you feel like utter dog shit? Because it came out of nowhere and I was a bit taken aback lmao and I’m interested to see if anyone is just as adverse to it. 
14	I can be really short about this: if I'm ill, fuck the company, my health has priority. \n\nAny employment is build on the premise that they pay you less than the worth you're adding to the company. I've been adding value to the company throughout the year, so if I have to take a few days (or even a week or 2) off to recover and ensure my personal health is taken care of, I will do so. They pay me for my added value, not for my life. I don't even have to feel 'like utter dog shit' to stay home. I know my body. If I feel a serious flu coming up, I will stay home *before* it's caught up with me 100%, because I know, if I take a rest now, I'll get a lot less ill later on. Again, my health has priority.\n\nI also live in a country with good worker protection rights, so they literally can't fire me for being ill (even long term illness) and I don't have to justify my illness to my employee, only to an independent GP. So, the employee can fuck right off, I'll be staying home.
8	Better to stay home and feel better sooner, than come into work and share it. \n\nThe only person I know who was militant about sick days is an ISTJ. Last time she got sick she gave it to five of the management team, who passed it to all of the staff, and cost the company a bomb in sick leave and productivity. Lesson learnt. \n\nYour mum is probably annoyed at something else and thinks staying home is a manifestation of it (like laziness, or not taking your obligations seriously). I lose my mind when my ISTP partner is late to work and doesn't hurry. It genuinely stresses me out. Maybe she's worried you'll miss vital education. 
6	In my years of working I was lucky so far and had to go on sick leave only once. Usually when I have like a cold or a headache, I just work from hope, since that's more comfortable. That one time, I had to flu, so I was either in the bathroom throwing up or in my bed with a fever, no condition to work in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy opinion in short is: health comes before work. If you are not healthy, you can't give it your all at work, plus if you are contagious you will just make others sick. So yeah, stay home and recover until you feel 100% well, and get back to work with new enthusiasm.
4	I tend not to call in sick, though I don’t get ill too often. Sometimes I think I probably should do though (once I am already at work, but usually just suck it up). I have gone home early from being unwell though.
3	Take your sick day bro, we all need them, we’re not machines we’re biological beings. We need sleep, food, sex is fun, we have emotions, and we get sick. It’s normal. 
3	Staying home when you're sick is the resposible thing to do. For you and for your coworkers who you protect from infection. One of my friend said she didn't want to be home sick because she felt bad for the chaos of left her colleagues in. But if your work place goes into chaos when someone's sick that is the fault of the management, not the sick employee. 
3	No matter what your MBTI, when you’re sick, stay home and rest up. Better a day than a week, or worse.
3	When it comes to colds and flus I take the time off. I find I recover in a day or two away from work and can come back at 100% but if I'm working then it can be upwards of a week or two to shift it.\n\nIn the UK we have a set number of sick days, make use of them and recover.\n\nThe aspect that some people forget is coming in with a cold/flu means you can spread it and I've seen firsthand someone come in like a plague victim and suddenly 15-20 caught their cold because on person didn't want to call in sick.  \n\nSome people have respiratory issues which makes having a cold much worse and some people at work may have dependants with respiratory issues and run the risk of spreading it to them.\n\nThe moral of all this, if it's contagious then keep it at home.
1	My mom is similar. She doesn’t see you working so it’s not obvious to her. I just acted more disciplined when she was around so she had a certain impression of me
1	It depends on context. If I'm somewhat new on the job, I try to avoid taking sick days as much as possible. I might even hesitate to use up all my vacation days.\n\nI also consider what's going on at work. For my job, I get an extreme influx of work at the beginning of the year, all of which must be completed against a tight deadline, so I end up staying at work for over 12 hours per day, as do many of my colleagues. So, to call out sick from work during this period would be professionally reckless. I would only do so if I were puking, and even in that case, I would try to work something out with my boss, such as an agreement to assume more work later on, but this isn't always possible.\n\nOn the flip side of the coin, you don't want to be that person at work who's coughing incessantly or running off to the bathroom to barf when it's less than all-but-necessary, as this can make a bad impression too.\n\nI guess you could say I decide whether to go to work by weighing my "need" to stay home against the impression I'll make on my boss and, to some extent, my colleagues.
1	I am a manager. I run a team of 6 in a mission critical operation at a hospital. If you are sick stay the hell home. I don't want you making the rest of my team sick if I can avoid it. \n\nHowever different supervisors have different opinions. 
1	A lot of times if I feel sick, I'll call in but work from home. That way I'm still productive but not spreading my germs. If I'm *extremely* sick, I'll usually just work a half day.
0	People get sick all the time. Somehow humanity managed to work with that reality. Employers know that sick time is a thing.
6	How do fix a broken heart as an ENTJ?	I know this is stupid for me to ask, we all have our ways and it’s pretty much around about the same sort of ways we do it, but how do ENTJ’s take a really badly broken heart? 
21	Wallow for a bit, we’re all allowed to be heartbroken. Then think about the lessons you’ve learned from it about yourself and the kind of relationship you deserve in the future. I believe people come into our lives for a reason so I try to find the reason or the lesson so that I’m ready for the next one. Not just mentally ready but now as someone who has taken the lessons and made myself a better person and a better partner.  Growth can hurt. I’m sorry to hear about your relationship but something even greater is in your future. Good luck 
8	Time.  Stay busy and keep developing yourself but ultimately time heals all.  
7	Of course, I’m sad in the beginning, but I focus on becoming a better version of myself. I started with pole dance after the first break-up and I bought an apartment in a cool city after the second break-up. Break-ups make me super productive and I’m happy with what I have achieved. 
4	I wish I had good advice but it just sucks until it’s over. \nOddly enough I’m grateful for all the losses. Not to be poetic but after the dust has settled I’m more sentimental and just accept what happened. It’s scary how smooth and quick I can move on. 
2	Aspirin.
4	I take it as a learning opportunity and move on 🤷🏼‍♀️ sometimes I book a trip somewhere different if it was really bad. Distract myself with other personal goals and hobbies. Surround myself with friends. It’s okay to take time and be sad also—mourn the relationship. \n\nI’m surprisingly friends or acquaintances with a lot of my ex’s, but when someone betrays my trust or does me dirty I also personally like to “napalm the bridge”... when someone breaks my heart but that’s just me.
2	Rebound sex?
2	Since you’re an extrovert, you need to talk through your pain and experience with a trusted friend. I also did a lot of journaling to work though all aspects of what had happened. I know this last part is a little ridiculous, but go fuck a lot of people to take your mind off of it and have some fun in the process. Meeting other people will help you get over it too, people who will affirm you. I’m sorry to hear about it, I feel you.
1	It gets easier, but it never gets easy.  I've been through it a few times.\n\nI'm INTJ, but this probably still applies.  When someone hurts you, you tell yourself a story, and often assume the worst of intentions.  Ni+Fi will give you a loop of all the bad things that could possibly explain what's going on, but it's 95% bullshit.  So you gotta counter it with Te and Se.  Go outside, read a book, lift some weights, and get out of your head.
1	Balance sheets and line graphs.
1	Solutions:\n\n1. Don’t invest your time and heart in someone in the first place\n\nPro: short term you’ll feel untouchable \n\nCon: in the long run you’ll be miserable\n\n2. Let time pass\n\nPro: it works\n\nCon: you only have so much time\n\n
1	I never got over it. My Ni just put in into paradigmatic perspective.\n\nI see my most painful breakup as one of the most intense experiences of my life, and for that I am appreciative. My life aches to be extreme, intense, interesting - whether good or bad, experience is experience, and the metric I use to rate these experiences is how much I felt moved (because it's pretty hard to move me). Looking back, my experience with heartbreak is surreal, and I'm fine with it being that way.
2	entjs help me with organization.?	as an infp i have inferior te,so im not that good with organization,tho i read that infps can be pretty strong when wanting to accomplish goals,but i can see the path to my goal.i often get distracted by my emotions as entjs with dom te,how do you put away your personal emotions to accomplish yoru goals?or how does te really work for you in your consiousness?
7	Take a pen/pencil, a paper, do you have things that have to get done with? (Along with your thinking of the future if any) \n\nJot that down. \n\n\nNext, control yourself from distractions (<- this none can teach you, you’ll have to learn)  and knock each one of those off your list. \n\nDevelop the habits, everyone’s got the brain power, but develop the habits. Like if you’re a writer then make sure you write x amount of pages or words per day. Even if they suck it doesn’t matter. If you’re a programmer then make sure you finish x number of problems online or finish x amount of the work of your personal project. Doesn’t matter if it’s shit, just get it done or try to, that’ll give you strength for the next day.\n\nWell, obviously it goes without saying that you’ll need to review your work or get it reviewed by someone...learn what they’re teaching you. Then chill...go out for a walk or play with your dog or go out for a few drinks or whatever makes you feel lighter. Go live life, just working doesn’t get to be someone great. \n\nCommitment  is the first way to organising yourself because even to “organise” your life you need to be committed to finishing it up on paper or in your head or wherever whatever you set yourself to do. \n\nEven us ENTJs have emotions, we all have go through a form of distraction even now and then, no one is immune to it. You’ll have to learn to be firm about it. It’s all practice, as simple as that. ENTJ’s don’t have a super power that makes us commit. 
2	This is really inspiring and true! Thanks ^-^ 
6	I lose sleep/ productivity over irrational fears.	Maybe yoga would help. I want the marble thing that Vulcans use for meditation for these sort of issues.
6	Do you have an anxiety disorder? or are you just anxious about something in particular?
3	Yoga will definitely help you. During my last semester of college a professor made us write our final research paper on mindfulness meditation and it's affects on negative affect and depression. I was always skeptical of it 'cause of it's usual audience, but after writing the paper I was convinced.\n\nI started doing it at least once a day and both my anger and worry are either manageable or non-existent. I'm currently getting evaluated for PTSD and honestly I treat yoga as seriously as medication. Meditation will help too, but if you're like me yoga will be easier to get into; it's easy to concentrate on the movements and the breathe than just the breathe itself.\n\nGodspeed my friend, I wish you luck with your anxiety and progress.
3	Specific things from time to time. Last time I talked to a medical professional, she thought experiencing anxiety over certain situations was normal.
1	There’s a wild animal in my yard that has gotten too close to me.
1	Yes. Haven’t seen the animal. I’m also terrified of hurricanes. One was enough. Although as a trade off, I’m not terrified of losing my material possessions, because I’ve been there and know that didn’t actually kill me.
7	ENTJ and chronic illness	I was wondering if anyone else has had problems with having to slow down/ ways to combat this. I have been diagnosed with a chronic illness that is exacerbated  by "over-doing it". When I slow down, I mentally go insane from feeling unproductive, but when I keep my normal schedule, I end up not being to do all of it anyway from more physical problems arising. \n\nBackground: I am an undergrad student who is trying to prepare for law school\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation before or does anyone have any recommendations?? \n\n&#x200B;
5	Lawyer's training does not stop after schooling. You could passively absorb some relevant videos on Youtube or listen to audio books while you have bits of time. Just so that you could move forward.\n\nAs for your condition - could it be related to your diet? Mikhaila Peterson has had a chronic auto-immune disorder which she cured through diet.\n
3	I'm an ENTJ with Crohn's Disease. Initially...I thought I could maintain my normal lifestyle and put my disease on the back burner. I was so wrong. I had to have an extended hospital stay to learn that my health needed to be my primary commitment. Everything else in my life, even things that I enjoyed came second. You learn to find other ways to occupy your mind when you have to be sedentary. Try reading about the spoon theory. It's a great representation of what life with crohnic illness is like. It's important to place the proper value on your time and put less importance on things that really shouldn't rank so highly in the first place. Don't give up. Don't forget what drove you to want to study law in the first place. If you find yourself struggling emotionally with anything don't be afraid to seek professional help. Learning everything I could about my disease was probably the single most valuable thing I have done for myself since being diagnosed. I like control. It's an ENTJ thing lol. I can't control my illness, but I can control my understanding of it. Feel free to PM if you ever need someone to talk to.
3	\nTreat staying healthy<--both mentally and physically--as your main job, and your educational goals as your side gig. \n\nBoth are important, and you can judiciously sacrifice the first for the second on occasion. But you cannot do the second if you are not successful at your main job. The side gig cannot yet support you by itself. \n\nMaintaining your health ensures that you can keep working longer and set more goals once you've accomplished your current ones. But you have to accept that this is a fact of your life, and figure out how to achieve your goals and live a good life anyway. 
2	Not ENTJ but I have this issue as well. Saw a psychotherapist and she said I have tendencies with Bipolar II. Namely, i'm almost by default in a manic state and when things don't go my way, I end up in the depressive state - might be something you could look into.
2	Yeah, it’s common with our personality type. At one point I decided to finally dial work back a bit and focus on my health... but then I did the exact same things just all focused in on my workouts and ended up going so hardcore I had like a total body transformation in three months, lol. I had to dial that back a bit then as well. \n\nIt’s hard to do but try to find balance. We are planners... so try planning for personal time. Don’t overdue it either, stick to plan. \n\n
2	Meditation is my relief. I have chronic digestive issues due to stressing things out (trying to keep up with schedules, work, everyday life, etc. etc) + genetics, so almost got myself an ulcer (not really a biggie compared to others here). People would say, I need to stop and take a break, but I am like you,  I cannot just sit and do nothing. The worst part is that I did not really felt like something was going on, until I started to loose weight and noticing more prominent issues in my general health. So now I am practicing taoist breathing techniques/meditation, slowly learning tai chi --> makes my mind calmer, helps relax and improve general health though the energy. Plus extra bonus - I still learn something, so the time spend not useless.\n\nYou have to realize that your health is priority number one. Not being healthy = not performing to your potential = not being productive = not reaching your goals. The sad truth is that if something goes bad with your health, most of the time it's hard to get back if at all. Other stuff (money, education, material things) is always achievable at other times. Health is not, when it's gone, it's gone.
1	Definitely; try buti yoga. Because it’s not like traditional yoga and has a lot of movement involved, it helps me get out the energy without running miles.
1	Using the Eisenhower Matrix could be effective for you. Might force you to really categorize and prioritize things, making you more efficient while not overstressing yourself. 
1	I struggle with mania and anger management, and my doctors have told me one of the best things I can do to work on my problems is to just chill out, to relax and remember that most things are not a big deal. \n\nI was put on chill pills for a while. I mean that in the literal sense.
1	What can you do to clear your head and feel healthier?
0	erick cartman from south park is entj not estp!	trust me when i say this!,i had a friend(not so much a friend) who was an entj narrcasist/sociopath in high school who was exactly like eric cartman,his manipulition style to anger everything,he was a definite entj,he worked hard at school work,was very organized ect.....but how he got angry and his manipulation style was really the same.! thoughts opinions?
12	You have never made a productive post.
10	[deleted]
5	> trust me when i say this!\n\nWhat are you, a gay fish?\n\n> thoughts opinions?\n\nPop tarts are just ravioli.\n
2	Enneagram Music Subreddit	Here’s a subreddit to associate music with Enneagram:\n\n[/r/EnneagramMusic](https://www.reddit.com/r/EnneagramMusic/)
1	What am I?	I have a strong conviction that my cognitive functions indicate ENTJ, but I don't know why I have hard time relating to the typical ENTJ traits: leadership/bossiness, dissatisfaction with the status quo in particular.\n\n\nI'm not bossy. AT ALL. Only when I know I'm the best in the group do I feel comfortable telling people what to do and how things should be. This does not happen at work, so it feels a little shitty.\n\n\nI also don't feel particularly dissatisfied with how things run at work, as long as it doesn't impact me directly. In that sense I don't give a shit about what happens to the direction of the company, and can't wait until I have an idea to start my own business.\n\n\nI am strangely relaxed in airports and I also listen to the same music on repeat lol.
3	You absolutely sound like an ENTJ. IMO all ENTJs are quite similar, but there are distinct differences. Some of us are the perfect archetype of an ENTJ. Some of us are more laid back, but when something requires us to step up, we have no issue doing so. You just don't sound too motivated to change the world, but I suspect that if the world tried to change you, you wouldn't be too happy about and bite back.
2	Do you relate to all of the functions or some more than others? Because you sound an awful lot like an ESTJ, I know because they are not easy to forget. I can sense a lot of Te-Si. But I could be completely wrong because I don't really know you well enough. So think about this, do you do things you want to do or do you do the things that are most honorable? Would you consider yourself skeptical? Do you value novelty? 
2	You don't have to be Te-Ni dominant. These functions will likely lead to controlling behavoir. \n\nYou can also be Te-Se dominant (and yes I know that that's technically not the dominant function but about 40% of people with a certain type prefer their 3rd function over their 2nd). This most likely means that you want to apply your knowledge a lot.
2	I'd like to know about the bit about being relaxed at airports and listening to the same song, is that not normal? \n\nCould be situational for you, if things are smooth at work and management are on point there isn't a reason to get into "commander" mode and take over.\n\nOn the flip side, if your workplace suddenly decided to swap a process into a very inefficient and time consuming one and your team becomes self-organised with no management I would hazard a guess that your leadership and hate for inefficiency and "status quo" will come out. 
1	When I took this test a few years ago, I had the same doubts. I was reading the description and was like: whaaat? I am a leader?! Too bossy!?Naaah... So then I have forgotten about it. Recently I got back into physiology/sociology, took the test again, re-read everything and got entj again, only this time I was more like: Holly S*, that's totally me. What's different? My surrounding has changed. Especially at work, where I am in a team, and I clearly see how the process should be set and I am ~involuntary~ boss every one around. I even got repremented for being too efficient and that people can't keep up with me, and that I have to sugar coat every mistake I point out,because people are too sensitive. Like seriously! Do they want the place run smoothly or do they want a bunch of lazy busters and be involved in each step of the process?!\n\nI don't think entj's really crave for power perse, but rather when situation arises they easily take  charge and do what needs to be done. The more I think about it, the more I see how I was like that through my school and college years. And I didn't do it because I really wanted to be in charge, but simply because I could see the most effective way of doing something, how to organize it and so on while everyone else was just contemplating ideas.
10	The Political Affiliation Thread :)	Since all other threads seem to be really serious (being about emotions, relationship problems etc) and we're all presumably not the best people to talk about feels, let's discuss something much more lighthearted: politics!\n\nI'm sure everyone here has an opinion on how they would like things to be run and I'm interested in hearing it. Would also be interesting to see where ENTJs lie on the political spectrum.\n\nTo ensure some semblance of uniformity however, let's stick with a format derived from the well-understood 2-axis political compass alongside a traditionalist-progressive dichotomy to represent modern social issues. As many on this board come from different countries, I believe it would be best to avoid broad umbrella/handle terms like "socialism", "liberal" etc which may have different meanings depending on a poster's country of origin (eg: liberal in the US refers to left-leaning progressives whereas in Australia, liberal generally refers to free-market loving libertarians).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Economic**: Free Market (Right) vs State-Controlled (Left) vs Centrist  \n**Governance Style**: Authoritarian vs Libertarian vs Centrist  \n**Social Issues**: Traditionalist vs Progressive vs Mixture\n\n**Space for justification/other issues**: do elaborate upon your viewpoint here or add in the handle-term you identify with (anarcho-capitalist, neoliberal, conservative etc)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't believe this will devolve into a shit-throwing, name calling fight but just in case, please be civil and as always, use logic and facts to prove your point (ps: @admins, please remove if inappropriate).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo tell me, what are your opinions? :)
16	I think that putting everything in a left vs right, authoritarian vs libertarian, traditionalist vs progressive framework only creates unnecessary friction. Politics should be about finding the best solution to a problem, not about having a civil war on Twitter between people that identify as "left" and as "right".\n\nMy top 5 issues:\n\n1. Legalise soft-drugs. Tax them, forbid adverts and discourage their use as we do with cigarettes. Decriminalize hard-drugs and treat them as a public health issue instead.\n\n2. Replace the first-past-the-post system with a proportional system. This will change politics from a war between Democrats and Republicans to a plurality where parties are forced to compromise with each other instead of slandering each other. \n\n3. Fight regulatory capture, and fight back against rent-seeking companies: forbid local governments from giving telecom providers a monopoly, re-enact net neutrality, reduce the length of patents, forbid private donations of any kind to politicians and instead give politicians a limited budget from the government, fight excessive lobbying, etc. \n\n4. Zoning reform. Restrict the power of NIMBY's. We. Need. More. Houses.\n\n5. Forbid adverts about alcohol, (online) gambling, "medicine".\n\nControversial bonus issue:\n\n6. Stop guaranteeing student loans. It's a ridiculous system and it needs to end.\n\nIssue that I forgot about but is really fucking important:\n\n7. A carbon tax. With the appropriate import taxes that will simulate a carbon tax in other countries. (in other to equalize the field between local and foreign producers. Free market and stuff )
5	1. Although I'm in a country where the Government is partially controlling the economy, soon it will turn into a Free Market. I believe that we should've been Free Market from the start, but I do understand why we didn't let that happen.\n2. Liberty is crucial. People misuse this and hence governments step in (apart from various reasons) and do their trick. So if people developed the habits to not screw things, Libertarian governance would've been ideal. Also, not everyone should be so intolerant already.\n3. Social Issues: Progressive.\n4. I am a punk, but being a punk and throwing shade will not help to solve an issue. You have to understand that there's a system in place and it's here to stay, you will have to work within in and be a in punk in certain places. Punks always complaint about the system and don't do shit about it. They blame the system and say that they want to bring the system down. That's bullshit. They don't understand that people on the other side of the table also have issues and have reasons why they do certain things. If they're doing wrong, the voice should be raised, but when they want to speak, don't interrupt, let them speak, understand their side and then decide where you want to stand, next see how to come to a common ground, because trust me...you don't want to win small to lose big. I'd rather lose small battles to win the real one. Lastly...I'm gonna quote Rage Against the Machine. - "FUCK YOU I WON'T DO WHAT YOU TELL ME." (They were "punks" who wrote punk songs to sell a few albums and look edgy, Tom Morello ended up going to Harvard and working with some Politician after all.) 
4	I don't have much to say, but I firmly believe that most people are idiots and that having a free market means that it functions very well in the way that the people at the top of any hierarchy keep exploiting all the less fortunate. Competency is underrated and incompetency is underestimated.
6	If it were up to me we’d live in a technocracy.\n\nI believe the government should be responsible for only the essential things like public safety (both interior and exterior), public transportation, universal health care, public schools and protecting nature reserves.\n\nWith new generations come new realities, more possibilities, a chance to make the world a better place where each person can be who they are and choose to do what they want as long as they don’t hurt anyone else. \n\nAs for economy, capitalism creates competition which creates progress which is essential. 
2	Mixed market, Social Democracy, Progressive.\n\nI live in a social democracy, so I see the benefits of universal healthcare, welfare, free education and employee protections. I think that people are born in unequal positions, but all deserve equal opportunity and equitable outcomes. In order to achieve that there needs to be government intervention to reallocate resources for the public good and limit negative externalities. 
3	I definetly prefer libertarian, capitalist and progessive policies. Therefore I would be a libertarian capitalist. \n\nHowever you forgot 1 variable: nationalist vs globalist. \n\nHowever I personally don't care that much about this factor. Both have benefits so it depends on the situation.\n\nWhy: \n\nCapitalism is the most efficient system. Many people benefit from it and it regulates itself. It seems to me that it is almost like second nature to humans. Even in socialism it would be necessary to invent it, which is why many hippies (we all know which idiot said this) come up with the idea that everyone should grow 1 crop and share it with others in exchange for their crops. Too bad hippies aren't insightful enough to see that they just invented free market xD.\n\nLibery is necessary for people to reach their full potential. Making rules and laws don't work in general if the population don't support them. Raising taxes to pay for things that "can only be done by a government" is also stupid. You can give money to unicef if you want to help people in afrika or give money to homeless people on the street if you want to help the poor, just to name a few examples. Why dies everyone need to support the same cause if the supporters can support it themselves without dragging other people down with them?\n\nAlso, liberalism supports capitalism very well because regulations drown competition from smaller companies, thereby creating artificial monopolies.\n\nThe only problem of a society like this is that it could be very easily taken by a society that is authoritarian and nationalistic.\n\n[For those who don't know many things about politics, here is a test](https://8values.github.io/).
3	Reasonable moderate christian conservative. 
2	I identify as a contrarian. In high school, I was a raging liberal (U.S. sense), but now I can't stand some of them.\n\n**Economic**: Free Market/Mixed-Market Capitalism.\n\n**Governance**: Libertarian\n\n**Social issues**: Generally progressive, but sometimes bullshit shouldn't be tolerated. For example: Only in our absurd world could a certain demographic group carry out 200+ shootings **in a single city** *per weekend* **each summer** and then vilify the police and convince everyone else that they are victims.
1	Free Market  \n\nLibertarian  \n\nProgressive  \n\n\n\- less bureaucracy, more productivity  \n\n\- lean governance  \n\n\- more individual responsibility for all citizen  \n\n\- less law regulation, only where it is absolutely necessary, laws are very inflexible in our fast moving world  \n\n\- collective employment agreement negotiated by labor union & employers association instead of inflexible law defined minimum wages  \n\n\- solid basic health care system obligatory for everyone (eg. Switzerland)  \n\n\- solid social security obligatory for everyone (eg. Switzerland)  \n\n\- less regulations for Founders & small & middle companies  \n
1	Free market libertarian, borderline minarchist.

6	Donald Trump and ENTJ?	Saw i watched this guys video, and he seems to come to the conclusion that Donald Trump was a ENTJ. I always thought he was an ESTP. Is he right? i always got strong Se vibes from Trump but could that possibly be Se child?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DA9JelaDVaI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DA9JelaDVaI)
24	[deleted]
26	I dont know where people get ENTJ from. Hes definitely ESTP.
11	Nah, I cannot for a second imagine that someone who speaks in such a scattered-yet-facile way ("the best words") and who never reads books and gets all his information from cable news is an ENTJ.   Like, where is the Te there?  He's a businessman, but he wasn't a particularly good one.  He doesn't seem to have much of a knack for institutions or systems or laws and has propelled his career on a lot of charisma and cult of personality rather than like... Te-Ni planning and thoughtfulness.  And all politicians contradict themselves, but xNTJ politicians tend to be careful at distinguishing the cases to show why the contradiction isn't \*actually\* a contradiction, or they'll admit that they didn't have all the evidence at first.  Whereas Trump tends to contradict without any excuse or shame about it.\n\nHe gives me Se-dom vibes, for sure, not Se tert.  And Ni inferior function makes a lot of sense for him, so I'm inclined to agree with the people who type him as ESxP.
5	ESFJ \n\nHe’s a feeler. Not a thinker. Just because he is male people overlook this. He is values based. Not logic based. 
4	ESTP for sure. 
8	I thought ENTJ's tend to be knowledge sponges. Isn't it an accepted fact that DJT barely reads at all?
12	A telltale trait of an ENTJ is loyalty. Trump has 0% loyalty to anyone but himself.\n\nAlso, ENTJs are very close to being introverted. Trump is an epic attention and fame whore, not socially tactful. ENTJs have robust vocabulary as well, while Trump has the literacy of a 4th grader. ENTJs value facts, logic, and are rational.\n\nTrump’s definitely not an ENTJ.
2	ESFP for sure 
2	Cs Joseph sucks 
5	I find it crazy that no one thinks he's an F.
1	Trump is most probably an INTJ. \n\nENTJs are knowledgeable, open-minded, passionate, charismatic, pragmatic, professional, problem-solvers! \n\nTrump is none of that.\n\nTo know the distinction: Obama is an ENTJ.\n\nEveryone compares Trump to a used-car salesman for a reason. ;) 
1	Duh of course he is. He is just also into trolling and psychology.\n\nHere is his book. You can download it in a PDF format free of charge. It is dripping with TeNi.\n\nhttps://archive.org/details/TrumpDonaldTheArtOfTheDeal\n
1	MBTI has its limitations but in Trump's case, ESTP fits like a (small) glove.
0	Man, that was like the best typing video I've ever seen.

2	I generally agree. The points about the credentials may lack some nuance. For me it's not just letters at the end of the name that add up to expertise, but I'll also listen to how a person describes something to assess credibility. If a person has no degrees but their language clearly shows mastery of something, I don't care much about the degrees.

6	Any Self Help Books That's Helped You?	For me it's The 48 Laws of Power and The Republic... Don't ask me how I got "self help" from the Republic but I did.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI loved reading Art Of The Deal as well, whether you like or hate Trump.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyone else want to add?

4	Goals! By Brian Tracy\n\nI'm about to save you hundreds of hours in self help reading. 99% of these books boils down to a simple piece of advice: Write out your goals, make plans to achieve them, work those plans every day. This nugget of wisdom comes from the book above.\n\nI quit reading self help a long time ago. Now that I have professional and personal projects to pursue, I'm far more interested in content that pushes me closer to my goals. There's lots of good reading material out there, but when you get further into your career pragmatism becomes far more important.\n\nI'm not saying there's no value in being well read. In fact, I think you're much better off reading some Machiavelli than playing your Xbox all night. However, if you're looking to build a business, launch an app or get a girlfriend, you're better off finding material that's geared towards your objective than reading content just to expand your mind.

15	Honestly being in a relationship I learned the best thing I can do is to shut up and listen no matter how illogical the other person sounds. \n\nRemember the things they say are important to them so don’t judge them for what they say but make sure to question them politely because it shows you listen and care enough to allow them to continue but still intervene. \n\nAnd always remember you’re on the journey of life together, she’s your player 2 and it’s you two against the world.

19	everyone in r/entj needs a vacation	yes, working is considered fun and my idea of a good time is scheduling my life [maybe I’m speaking for myself here], but I’m super concerned about y’all. anyone have any exciting things to report in their life? met any goals lately, however minor? had ice cream today? let’s congrats like we’re five pls
11	I visited 8 new countries so far this year and countless cities/regions.  People always say, "you never stop!"  Guilty as charged.  I have a lot of energy and want to maximize my life.
6	Lmao, I was just literally (20sec max) on another thread telling another dude on this sub how I found planning for stuff relaxing. Never met anyone quite like me which is why I find this sub so awesome.\n\nI just got into med sch which is the culmination of nearly 10 years of scheming and work considering I intended from the very start to not do it the traditional way. I still have the chart I drew up as a 13 year old on how I intended to get there. I guess completing the first phase of my plan warrants an evil cackle or 2. \n\nNo icecream tho and getting some is too much of a chore :(
6	I need to lose 6 more pounds until my goal weight. The process seemed to take forever (9 months) but losing roughly 20 pounds so far, I’d take it over being the weight I once was any day. Feels better to move 
6	I never have time for a vacation and when I go I want to do it large and not have to check my bank account. Working till I can do that..
5	I just finished scheduling my third of four vacations I'm taking this year. 
4	My wife and I found out we're having a baby girl.\n\n1st child so we're excited. Still plugging away at life, planning to fatfire in the next 15 years and then spend the rest of our lives sailing and pursuing falconry when parenting isn't consuming us.\n\nI'm learning mongoDB atm and dabbling in elixir hoping that it will pay dividents when I start looking for another job here in 18 months.
3	Got a holiday to Japan in 10 days time, then a big trip to Spain/UK lined up for next year. A lot to do in the meantime.
3	If you're offering, I'll take one. ;) 
3	I’m going to Spain this weekend...
2	INTP, but\n\nI've made all A's in 3 of my classes so far, one high B in another (test tomorrow), and then 2 D's on quizzes in another class (Money & Banking is hella rough), but it's okay because I always have a throwaway class so I can make sure to get my highest grades in other classes to even out a C. Still on set to graduate at 20.\n\nI started antidepressants back up again this week (an addition to my adderall) and it is great at helping me feel like doing anything is worth doing, and usually with ease. Almost 5 years of combining medicines to finally get to a point where I'm more satisfied than not.
2	I have a life goal of visiting all 50 states and I knocked 4 off this year alone! Made for some great memories.
2	Yes, please.  \n\nOther than 3 day weekends, I haven't taken a whole week off for quite some time, as for the past three years I've used all of my vacation to get through law school while also working full time.  But I'm done now, and considering whether I should take the February or July bar exam.  \n\nOther than that, I went on a weekend trip to see a concert recently, so that was a nice break away from the kids with the husband.  This weekend, we plan to meet a friend we haven't seen for a long time who's visiting from another state to go wine tasting (my husband is a wine super nerd, so this is usually how visiting friends ask to be entertained). \n\nI'm also applying for jobs in hopes that my newly minted JD will help mama make some cash...or, just get out of my current position...which I'm really unhappy in, but stayed in temporarily because it was stable pay and easy enough to deal with while also in school.
2	I find that I need a mini vacation at least once per quarter or I burn out. Took me years to realize this. This post reminded me to start planning something for the final 3 months of the year. The best way to keep my life balanced js to realize when it’s not.  A lot to be proud of in 2018, especially on the self-development front.  Year 3 of own business is profitable, book in progress, did first podcast and live webinar, gearing up for something bigger. Would like to end 2018 with a clearer path forward. Thought leader, author, speaker, and doing so more profitably. Dropped TV, Film, Sports and Most Friendships this year to put all energy into something more important. ENTJ All the WAY.
2	I learned yesterday that I had two weeks to finish my thesis. I have administrative issues with my current contract that could mean a brutal end of contract (I'd better go to the end of it). Some Indian guy guessed my credit card number and got himself a nice pocket money, had to oppose the card. Water is broken and I can't take a shower for two days (and God do I stink).\n\nEverything is planned and schedule for proper management, will get my thesis well done in time, manage my contract issue so my management will enjoy me some more time (I believe they do, judging on their face when I told them about it), bank will reimburse me if I go to the police and provide me a new card, I'll wash myself with cold water somewhere and add some more perfume.\n\nBut, yeah, I'll need a vacation soon. Sorry about that post, needed to get that out of my head, the sum of it generates more stress than it should.
10	My test says I'm ENTJ, but here I am wasting time on Reddit	
11	You can be an ENTJ and get distracted. \n\nYou can be an ENTJ and have ADHD. *raises hand*.\n\n
10	Then don’t do it.
9	What do you mean by that? Personal Development is crucial.
9	as long as your playtime doesn't interfere with your achievement of your goals, I don't see why it matters what you do in your free time. \n\nI personally find planning for my future holidays and learning new skills to be very relaxing so that's what I do even if its not what others may consider as such. I know I find talking to random anons on reddit pretty fun too so that's why I'm here. You can browse reddit all you want unless it starts to interfere with your plans
6	I think you are trolling, but if not why do you think it is a waste to be on reddit? I don't give a fuck about what our culture says. I am asking you pragmatically why you think it is a waste.
1	I find myself asking the same question, and then I also have some sorta self guilt and hate for such an unproductive activity... But... A little distraction for our minds serves like a relax, so it's all justified... Besides, as it was already pointed out, as long as doesn't hurt your big plans, it shouldn't be a problem. 
10	What gets your confidence up and when it’s down, what do you do?	Do you have a daily ritual? \nA routine? \nOr something else altogether than answers this question.
13	Blast music, try on different outfits, then go out for a coffee and bring a good book. It’s like a nice date but alone. 
6	Go for a drive and listen to my favorite bands.  That usually clears my head and re-energizes me. 
10	Being successful at my job is a confidence boost. It gives me purpose. When my confidence is low, I remember my purpose.\n\nOther than that, I do things to occupy my mind: arts, crafts, working on my classic car, getting into nature... 
4	Lately, I've been playing with the stock market. It's been a huge stress relief to research something new and be genuinely interested. I love risk, fear, and uncertainty; so naturally I turn towards something that I'm completely unaware of. I do feel ignorant towards the depth of the stock market developments but it really pulls me away from stress triggers.
5	Jordan Peterson has an axiom in his book "12 Rules For Life": it says "Being Is Limitation". If we don't somehow fail or seriously fuck up in life, we will never have the opportunity to experience the story of redemption or the story of triumph over adversity.\n\nThat thought gives me the confidence to pursue the most extreme of goals. Because if I succeed, great. If I fail - well, then that's another opportunity to live through a narrative of heroic strength and recovery. Full upside, zero downside.
2	I like to cook. It can be a good escape and there’s something about following a recipe and having it come out perfectly that is cathartic. \n\nI also like to dive into work. I realize that the more insecure I am the harder I work and the more I take on. \n\nIn terms of routine, I feel more at ease when I have one. Climbing Tuesday’s and Thursday’s, pilates on Sunday. Book club every month. Meetings on Tuesdays etc. 
2	Lose small, win big.\n\nMeaning - minimize the damage when that is all you can do, but \nmilk your fortune dry when your energy is high.\n\nAccept variability as part of life. Only mediocre people *always* do their best.\n\nPick your battles very carefully, but once they are picked, do not let go.\n\nPick your friends very carefully, but once they are picked, do not let go.\n
2	I can get a serious confidence boost out of how I dress. If I look perfect, someone that gives me an extra energy boost that can suddenly make everything else seem less daunting or stressful. I do like experimenting with fashion and style in general, so it's also something that's simply fun for me to do. \n\nWith regard to daily ritual: if you feel down and stressed, it can be daunting to put together an amazing outfit on a moments notice. To tackle this, I have two wardrobes. One is for storing my clothes, and in the other, I have at any given time 15-25 ready to wear outfits (clean, ironed and accessorized) on clothes hangers which I can just pick and put on. I make sure to have a diversity of outfits ready: super formal to super casual, some with pants, some with skirts, some black and white, some super colorful etc. This way I can still choose to pick and outfit that matches my mood or intent that day, without having to stress about what I'm actually going to wear. \n\nOh also: I have some high quality headphones that go with me everywhere. On my way to work, I can them to have some time alone (despite being surrounded by people) and either use music to relax or get myself pumped up. 
1	uhhh drugs? If I'm realllly down I can always have a crywank.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUsually just homework though. 
9	Any business owners?	I'm curious to pick the brains of any ENTJ business owners in the sub. Any of you own a small business and are willing to answer a few questions? For anyone who's curious about the answers all of this will happen in the comments.
3	Former Small Business owner and B.S. in Entrepreneurial Studies here!  Whatcha wanna know?
2	I know a small marketing agency. Never got a degree. Ask away.
5	Socialising at work	Hello everyone!\n\nWant to know how I can be improve on this aspect. Noticed throughout many jobs people have been able to easily talk with colleagues and manager's (small talk and the like) when it comes to me it's very minimal and to the point.\n\nRecent example, group of us had to go to a meeting for a task and the indecisiveness was painful, took the lead and said we are going to this meeting room and lead the way meanwhile everyone else was socialising and laughing away and no one said a word to me. Tend to be very reserved keeping personal information to myself whereas other openly talk about a variety of sensitive issues at ease. \n\nI want to know the best way of improving these situations as I believe this is going to hold me back from promotions, appreciate any advise given. 
11	I'm the same. You go to work to work, not socialize. I don't care about your personal life to accomplish the work we both came here to do.\n\nOn the other side, it's still very important to be pleasant. Be polite, for both interpersonal reasons and to make working together easy. \n\nBut beyond that, I think the socializing at work is unnecessary and I think inappropriate. You will slowly become friends with the people you like, in which xase you guys could socialize after work.\n\nI also hate team-bonding lunches and shit - again, we're there to work. Knowing about your college basketball days accomplishes nothing. Those situations are borderline - it's bullshit yes, but sometimes you have to put up with the bullshit. 
5	In my experience socializing at work isn’t necessary for the average job. I think you should just focus on being easy to work with and attend the occasional happy hour or party.\n\n\nI think it’s better to socialize outside of work because things are more genuine without corporate politics clouding everything. Also, you’ll have more control over your life and be able to seek out social activities that are more intellectually stimulating.
5	Work is for making money and sustaining your lifestyle, not friends and family hour. Be kind and cordial but I see no reason to go beyond that. 
3	Think strategically. Having good relationships with people pays off.
3	I’m the same. However, after I got “reprimanded” for not being more “friendly” with people at work I just sucked it up and read articles about how to build relationships in the office. I’m super good with people outside of work and school—just don’t tend to care about people at work or school. I would learn the names of my coworkers kids, their hobbies, their families, ask about that kind of stuff. I’ve had to learn to do the same with friendships since I move A LOT, and often don’t care enough to ask people about that stuff. The hardest part for me was having to share about myself also to build those trust and relationships because I don’t feel like that’s necessarily anyone at work’s business—my personal life.
2	I'm a little surprised by this but also not surprised. We're all business-minded people here so I get what you're saying, but we're also simultaneously social and magnetic. In my eyes if my employer is happy to pay me for both doing the work and for having some fun social time with the bois then I'm all for it.
1	Just consider socializing is part of work. You may be right, but it doesn’t matter if the others don’t follow you. 
0	Nope! Socialism does not work.
7	Princess Carolyn from Bojack Horseman, an ENTJ?	It’s a show on Netflix.
3	I can't tell if she's ENFJ or ENTJ but definitely one of those two, depending on the episode.
2	Ha ha, I watched the new season as soon as it came out. It was nice seeing this here.
1	Yep
9	DAE struggle with keeping friends or lovers?	Edit: Boyfriend cheated with best friend and I'm not sure if I can keep them as friends anymore. I tend to test people a lot to see if I can trust them; I let these two in my life after testing them a lot. Now I want nothing to do them.  Is it just me or can anyone relate? 
13	Your cognitive functions aren’t an excuse to be an ass
3	[deleted]
3	I can perfectly relate to you. I tend to do the same, but probably even worse, and it keeps me up at night whether I should stop or no (and whether I **can** stop or not). Thing is, I do the same as you, but I'm also quite ideological in my opinions (probably Ni-Fi), and I end up judging people before even talking to them (mostly by what they post online), so I've reduced my "sample" of potential friends or meet-ups a lot, those whom I meet I still make them my friends very fast too though.\n\n\>And I can't keep a relationship for more than 4 months.\n\nHappens to me too, but I'd say that in this occasion is possibly not because of the same reason as you. My relationships end up fast because of my desire to control, not because of me testing them (unless the testing is, how much can I control them? LMAO). 
1	Why are you 'testing' people? If *you* are looking for a friend, why should *they* proof themselves to *you*?\n\nMaybe you should try turning your attitude around for a while, and start out with trying to show how amazing you are as a friend first, and once that attracts people, you can pick which ones you really want to invest in due time. It's not just about you.. as much as you are testing them, those people are also simultaneously evaluating your compatibility as a friend..  and this behaviour fails that evaluations dramatically. Both parties need to see value in a friendship, not just you.
8	What gets an ENTJ into a rage of anger and how do you deal about it?	Anger as in yelling and cursing at strangers in public areas, including children who are acting rowdy towards you.  \n\nIt doesn’t sound healthy to me.  And it’s scary to witness when he bursts like that.  He thinks therapy is “for cowards” and refuses help. \n\nIs this typical?  What are other ENTJs like when angry?  Any thoughts or insights would be extremely helpful!  Thanks in advance!\n\nUPDATE:  thank you for all the responses!  I’m incredibly grateful to read them all. I’ve learned that no, this is not typical nor healthy. Therapy was suggested by multiple people. I have asked him about seeing a therapist 2-3x already and he refuses. I’m going to try 1 more time and do my homework on it before I approach him with this topic. As always, any further thoughts/advice on how to approach that conversation with him will be greatly appreciated! Thank you again, everyone!
26	It's not typical.\n\nWe do tend to be short tempered but no one's personality type justifies out of control behaviour.\n\nThe most atypical and alarming part is the one where this person refuses therapy. ENTJs are almost the ambassadors of constant self-improvement.\n
12	Not typical at all.
14	That’s unacceptable that abuse and uncontrolled behavior
8	Whoever you’re talking about needs therapy, anger issues are an unacceptable thing for anyone to have especially a grown adult. It could do serious harm to the person and others around them. Emotions must be managed and not acted on with every chance. 
7	I don't ever get angry, period. I get frustrated, but I do not raise my voice, I strive not to put others down, and I'd never approach anything resembling violence.\n\nOne of the most crucial lessons I've learned is that anger solves nothing but can destroy everything. \n\nWe can choose not to be offended by others and we can choose not to be angry.

5	Not typical. I usually say that shit in my head or under my breath by not at strangers in pubic.
5	>  Any thoughts or insights would be extremely helpful!\n\nTo me he sounds like a unhealthy ENTJ, but not crazy. I think the roots of his behaviors are caused by his ego, and a since of traditional values of being powerful/masculine. I say this as someone that was an egomaniac. seriously. I know what it is like, and unless he changes his value system on what being poweful is he will be unhealthy. Is he an intellectual at all? That could be the key to making him happy.
3	Doesn’t sound like an ENTJ to me either, but the real point is how you can address his anger issues.  I would search the r/relationships-type subs for advice, or the depression and/or bipolar subs.   They have been helpful to me in dealing with people like you are talking about.  PM me if you want to talk further about it and need a sounding board.
3	Every single person is telling you that that person has issues. And I'm only here to add to that number. Regardless of which MBTI type someone is, this kind of behaviour is absolutely unacceptable. They need help.
2	There isn't enough here for anyone to even hazard an armchair assessment. Rowdy kids are going to get yelled at, and someone has to do the yelling - I guess this time, it was the person you're talking about.
2	A rage, huh? Let’s see...\n\nA lack of mental health awareness in many foreign countries; in places like that, you’re deemed a fuck-up if you can’t perform.\n\nBeing gaslit and realizing I’m being gaslit. Also,  being told something is my fault when it’s clearly the fault of the other person.\n\nMy roommates were passive aggressive toward me last year for working out and taking care of myself academically, physically, and mentally; that really made me burst into seething rages, just because they started excluding me and making little jabs at things I did.\n\nThat’s about it really.
2	I can't speak for others but as for me personally, I would just flat out not do that. \n\nWhat does it even accomplish? If there's something (or someone) I'm unhappy with, I do my best to find a solution to that issue or avoid it via circumventing it - whichever is more efficient. Getting pissed off literally does nothing to help that unless a show of anger/force or threat of a repeat happening in the near future scares people into getting things done. Even then, that's usually not the best way to do things cos it will change the way you are perceived and for many, that's kinda of how they make their decisions so if you're in a scenario where your future hinges on the support of plebs, it would be pretty stupid to rock the boat.\n\nMain point being that random and/or frequent outbursts of anger does not sound like any ENTJ at all. \n\nRegarding mental health, personal opinion but if you need someone else in your life to tell you what or how to think, you aren't very well put together are you? I mean at the end of the day if it helps you, you should go regardless of your opinion on the topic but if its just talking about your feelings and shit then you can probably do those in your head instead of paying someone else to do it. Like literally just sit your ass down, think about how ridiculous shouting at random people is and you'll probably find a solution to the problem, if you don't, think harder - worked pretty well for me so far. \n\nWhat ticks me off? Speaking from military + work experience + silly group work in undergrad, inefficiency and an unwillingness of the team to address it because of dumb shit like tradition or feelings. Also people adding stuff that is completely redundant to the discussion or sidelining it to talk about useless stuff\n\nBut yeah, I'm basing a lot of how other ENTJs will act on how I myself would act. For the most part its been pretty accurate so far but you know, YMMV. Have you also considered the possibility that he isn't actually an ENTJ? 
12	Too Intense?	I'm 19, and everything I do, I'm just so intense. It makes me happy to get to pumped up and angry to go into the gym and lift until I can't touch my nose. When I go to class, I look my professor directly in the eyes the whole time. I love intense songs, I love intense motivational speeches, and even when I talk, I talk directly at someone. I like to think of myself as a lion because noone dares to bother me when I'm getting into *that mode*. But unfortunately I feel it's caused a few problems, people don't like talking to me because I'm intense and I like to talk about things I'm passionate about, or I like to hear about ssomeone else's passions. Does anyone else feel this way? 
25	A really important skill is interpersonal relations and communication. Read about it
10	I have experienced this issue for a long time. Being an ENTJ of course adds to this but even if we weren't, having passion and the guts to show it is a HUGE positive. It wasn't until recently when I realised that most people go about their daily lives without a great sense of passion underlying their day, as Thoreau said,\n\n"Most men lead lives of quiet desperation."\n\nSo, with that being said, take all of your passion and keep using it! Put your energy and brain power into something that means something to you AND as Gary Vee always points out, make sure you enjoy the process. \n\nAs for people, their a fucking mystery. I again take Gary Vee's advice, drop one loser friend and surround yourself with people that do you good. I'm sure you've heard the saying, 'You're the average of the five people you spend time with.' If you don't like that average, it may suck but change it.\n\nI made a personal decision some time ago to try and be more honest with my family and friends. Sometimes I can be brutal with people and since I've been 18-19 (I'm now 23) I've learnt that tact and a clever approach is needed with people. By being vocal and open with people, I naturally attract those who don't mind it and ward away those that don't. It's something that takes time and a CRAZY amount of practice.\n\nSuggestion-wise, I'd recommend picking up Jordan Peterson's 12 Rules for Life if that tickles your fancy as the fundamental rules he talks about are very useful to establish a balanced lifestyle for yourself and interactions with others. However, I have an even better suggestion, pick up Vanessa Van Edwards' book, Captivate. There's an audio book version online if you prefer that, though the book has additional resources and pictures to explain micro expressions, body language and other things with more clarity.\n\nAll together, be honest with yourself and others and figure out if the people you surround yourself with provide you with the average you wish to be. Captivate is definitely worth the read to become a better socialite and get into the minds of people to understand how to work WITH them and find common ground.\n\nLastly, read Timothy Leary's little rant often titled 'Find the Others'. That was a big catalyst for me, it may be the same for yourself.\n\nIf you wish to discuss things in more detail, shoot me a message and I'm happy to talk.

9	You're 19. It'll wear off. And if it doesn't, you better hope that you've picked up some better social skills. 
3	I'm an 18 yo INTP (about to be 19) so of course my experience is definitely not being in those shoes. However, my experience with ENTJ's our age is they come off as too cocky for my tastes(whether they are actually cocky or not), too intense for other peoples tastes, and seem too uncaring/volatile(like you can throw away people a lot)/unempathetic for most people to be friends with.\n\nFor why maybe people like you at first but then eventually don't, or why people will enjoy talking to you at first but eventually don't, I'm gonna into socionics a bit. --- ENTJ's role function (8th function) is Fe. Fe is like a mask, an initial impression you give to others, which will dissipate over time because ENTJ's don't value it. I won't give an example, because this is spur of the moment thinking and don't want to mess it up. However, this initial show given off simply just gives people the wrong impression and they can't handle your true motivations or energy or ambition, whatever. Same way I ask people questions about themselves and see what their values are (role Fi, supported by my shitty need to have harmony with others, Fe) and I can come off as more caring or more agreeing/connected than they think, because maybe I didn't want to say their beliefs or ideas are stupid, just simply debate, because I don't know them well enough to. So.. I can come off as an ass. \n\nThe point of the above is, maybe it's not all about how you are all the time, but how you differ from the initiation of knowing someone and your initial appearance to how you are 99% of the time. I'm not saying you SHOULD use your Fe or Fi more than you already do, but you should use your dominant function in a way to work with what your other functions, even shadow functions, bring to you. Find ways, and/or read about ways, to use your nature and passion and ambition to give the same emotions to others. Maybe people don't like talking to you, not because you're intense and passionate about what YOU think, but that you won't even try to understand or see how THEY think. It's okay to not have the same passions and motivations as someone, as long as you have the tact and skills to learn more about someone in an interpersonal way. The ENTJ's close to my age all have this common issue, so perhaps you do too. Ask people what they think of you and how you communicate, even the people that you ended with a bad note on—see if there's a pattern. Some way or another, find what you're missing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd what you've said to other people already, you can have great people skills and enjoy talking to people, but that doesn't mean you are thinking about what they think about you and themselves enough if that makes sense. You might need to be more subjective and outside of the box. Use your dominant function and your vision/objectives to FIRST find/use motivation methods and other ways to connect with people first, then to execute or lead whatever you are doing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe it's all just shit advice, maybe not. 
1	You're 19. You're not going to intimidate your professor, and you sure as hell wouldn't intimidate me if we worked together. More likely, you'll be seen as rude and get yourself alienated. \n\nHonestly, this post reads less like you're looking for advice and more that you're peacocking what you see as superior personality traits. \n\nMy advice: humble yourself now before the world does it after college. Learn to get out of your head and build relationships with people. I'd especially suggest you read and APPLY How to Win Friends and Influence People. \n\nRemember, there's some things us ENTJ's can learn from the other personality types.
-4	I am an INTJ with 53 % introvert. And I am way too intense for this world. I feel 100%. I have never met someone who is the same. Everyone is average and content with their average job and picture perfevt family. 2 kids, 1 dog, a main condo and a share time in puerto rico... \n\nEdit: point proven :)
2	inspire me to get tf back to work	homegirl needs a workaholic pep talk
7	Some man will take your job and promotion if you don’t work harder
3	You don't get to where you want to go by doing the things that are nice and fuzzy. Accept that there will be things you do not want to do but to achieve your final goal you will still have to, suck it up and carry on cos that shit isn't going to do itself. \n\nAdditionally, if you don't do what you're supposed to, someone else will and that person may be a lot more incompetent than you. You may not care but you should because in the long run, you might just get stuck with having to use that crappy piece of work.
24	Am I the only one who doesn't care for people who complain or who are defeatist?	I know, ironic given that I'm complaining about them.\n\nBut seriously, they're so draining to be around! I'm talking about the people who feel the need to harp on everything and act like things aren't their responsibility.\n\nLike today, I heard someone saying that an assignment in a class was "bullshit", when really he didn't put any work or effort into it at all, and tried to cram at the last minute. \n\nI'm talking about the kind of people that act like their shit doesn't stink, and who make everything seem way worse than how it actually is.\n\nI could go on, but I'll reiterate my question: does anyone else feel this way here?
12	All positive and healthy person get tired by negative and depressed people...
4	>Am I the only one who doesn't care for people who complain or who are defeatist?\n\nAre you aware that you are basically calling out your own post right now? :D\n\n
3	Yes whiny people in general aren't a very attractive asset for your time investment. Initially when I read the header I thought that some people, in particular those with low self-esteem(defeatists) need a good motivational kick of reality. I see a lot of INFP's lack confidence in their abilities, but they are some of my favorite people who are very capable if you set them straight.\n\nOn the other hand, nagging, whiny and without much meaning people that are always looking at the bad and negative and are bringing low-energy and unproductive atmosphere around just for the sake of it should generally annoy anyone with a dominant Te.. so that should probably only logically make sense.
7	It irritates me too
5	The man who carries the world on his back can't see that others are not suited for their position. ENTJs are prone to heart problems do to miss regulation. Try to understand as leaders there is no one to lead if we all were leaders.

8	How do I stop hating myself?	I'm an ENTJ (26M) who feels like every aspect of my life is completely worthless, and I hate myself and being alive. My passion is music, but my band is going nowhere and the music industry is dead. I can't find a girlfriend because I want to be with someone who I can trust, who I'm attracted to, who attempts to understand me (too ambitious). Most of my time is spent at my job, and because I have nothing worthwhile outside of work, I just feel like I'm wasting away in the office. I've been suicidal most of this year, but I can't even kill myself because I would just pass my suffering on to my family, which would be a completely selfish act. It's like I'm trapped alive.\n\nI don't know what to do, what to change, how to bring any kind of significant meaning to my life. In the past, romantic relationships have really helped to ground me, but I'm starting to give up on that. I have been burned too many times by people I trusted and am becoming bitter. I feel like I might as well be about 48 years old. Any advice / guidance is welcome. I know this post is pathetic, please don't be mean to me.

7	ENTJ tactical analysis:\nYou are overwhelmed and under heavy assault. You would benefit from restructuring and simplifying your life.\n\nIssue 1 - suicidal thoughts. Canary in the cage warning sign that you are overextended and hurting. Don’t hurt yourself.\n\nIssue 2 work - what can you do to guarantee an income and work towards a larger goal?\n\nIssue 3 music - clarify what the line between hobby and work. Lots of people have full time successful jobs and play music on the side\n\nIssue 4 relationships - possibly premature to get into a romantic relationship. How about establishing a support system\n\nIssue 5 video games - turn off the console or use in moderation\n\nIssue 6 establish battle rhythm. Create a list like this and update daily or weekly until things stabilize\n\nInternet support team out:)
2	Talk to a psychiatrist. If you are being even slightly accurate with the way you have presented things here then you are facing several problems that merit professional help. Do it for your family. Your suffering hurts them (less than your suicide would), even if you try to conceal it and not pass on the burden.

6	I stop doing the thing that is going poorly. Unless I have a reason to believe that the thing will stop going poorly in the future and the short-term pain is worth it.
3	Training, work, meditation, purging all negativity from my environments.

1	I think of something I love to do like running with my dogs, cooking, programming, writing, or even sparring (martial arts). Then I let that consume me and it really resets my system. 
1	Personally I would reassess the situation and think about whether or not I'm actually to blame. If I am, consider other ways I can overcome the obstacle in question or circumvent it completely. Things going poorly can only mean a few factors are\n\nRemember, its not about being the best in all aspects of life 24/7, its about meeting the minimum requirements for all of your targets (assuming they are in fact set properly and conducive to where you want to end up of course); anything more is just wasteful and inefficient. \n\nYou will undoubtedly encounter people that are better than you in certain aspects and you're going to have to accept that sometimes you will lose to them in areas they are specialized in. That is perfectly fine unless of course trouncing them is necessary to move on in which case you should probably rethink your strategy. Remember that the most obvious way is not usually the best, strike not where they are the strongest but against where they are the weakest and make it hurt.\n\nAfter all the thinking (or scheming to everyone else) is done with, I generally go do some sports like to get my mind off of things - you've already thought about it and presumably reached the most effective solution, why contemplate about it any longer? If you think that your solution is sub-optimal, why did you stop thinking about it in the first place? Get your ass back to the drawing board instead of trying to mish-mash things together in hopes of find a solution. \n\nFor de-stressing, I find that sports where you can't engage in thought about anything not related to the activity at hand are best. I prefer MMA or Muay Thai because its one of the most efficient ways to stay healthy and also because kicking smug people in the face is very entertaining (letting your mind wander back to your stressors/losing focus will definitely get you punished in sparring as well so that's definitely a effective way of getting you to forget about external issues).

16	I'm a gay ENTJ. We're not that rare.\n\n***Edit:*** Response to the OP's request for my more information on my experience:\n\nIt started to become clear that I am an ENTJ when I was in high school and continued on through college and 'til now (I'm 26). I've strongly excelled in classes dealing with abstract concepts (e.g., economics, math, physics; in college: political economy, international relations) and was vocal and often harsh with other students in my courses, especially seminars, sometimes feeling guilty about it later. I've always loved parties and having lots of friends, but some people don't like me because they think I'm inclined to get angry and mean or "moody." Some people have called me intimidating. I simultaneously wish I had more friends while also liking that people are afraid of me. In high school, I very much felt like no one was like me: I didn't feel lonely, but I felt different..unique. \n\nAt the beginning of college, I really wanted to be in a fraternity. All my guy friends were in fraternities, and I love(d) to party, so I wanted to join one too. So I rushed a fraternity. (For non-Americans, "rush"means to formally spend time with current members of a fraternity ("brothers")  so you can meet them and they can meet you. Naturally, "rush week" usually lasts one week, during which the brothers sponsor events each day for the guys interested in joining. Examples of events include sake bombing at a Japanese restaurant, drinking and smoking cigars on a yacht on a yacht, a golf outing, or even skydiving. At the end of rush week, if the brothers like you, they'll issue you a "bid," meaning they accept you as a "pledge," which is a guy who's training to become a brother, or sometimes pledges are thought of as "associate members," but that term is kind of misleading because at that point, it's not really certain they'll become brothers. Anyway, there's more to the process, but it's not relevant, so I'll leave it there. With regard to sororities, the process is similar, but I won't get into that.) At any rate, I began to rush three fraternities. For non-Americans or Americans unfamiliar with the Greek system, at most schools, even in liberal cities, gay guys rarely rush fraternities because guys in fraternities are often on the more conservative side (wealthy conservative, not hillbilly conservative) and fraternities often have a pretty masculinist, homophobic culture.  I was nervous the whole time because I thought they might not want me if they found out I was gay or even that they might make fun of me behind my back. I chose to continue rushing one and had an awful experience. The brothers ended up calling me the next morning to tell me they didn't want me to rush with them any further (which is totally customary, not a form of bullying). I don't think my being gay had much to do with my getting cut, but you can never be totally sure. Nonetheless, I was pleased to get calls from the other two fraternities, who told me they wanted me to rush with them, even though I'd missed a day with them. I chose the one I had the most friends in and made it all the way to the final round but at last got a call that they didn't want me. Later I found out I was cut because the fraternity had already met its "gay quota." Depressingly, this fraternity was considered the most gay-friendly on the row. A couple semesters later, some of my frat-guy friends urged me to rush a fraternity again, but I felt too traumatized: I'd even had a mixed manic-depressive episode as a result. (For non-Americans: It's really common to hear complaints of trauma from guys involved in the fraternity system, not just from rushees but also pledges and even brothers.)\n\nMoreover, apparently studies have shown that gay adolescents and men experience a "pendulum" of effeminacy and masculinity, usually being their most effeminate sometime around or just after puberty and then, over the following years, becoming more masculine before eventually ending up at the degree of masculinity that will be theirs for the rest of life. My "pendulum" has swung decidedly further in the masculine direction than most other gay guys to the point where now I don't really feel comfortable talking to straight girls I've just met and am more inclined to talk to their male counterparts. Even with regard to gay guys, I feel most comfortable talking to older gay guys (like in their 40s and 50s) or gay guys my age who also lean masculine. I usually find the effeminate ones bitchy and passive-aggressive. In fact, I used to really like going to gay bars and gay clubs, but I've all but stopped completely because so many gay guys are so bitchy. One could attribute a lot of my relatively pronounced masculinity to my ENTJ-ness.\n\nAs for love, I haven't really dated much at all. Three guys thought they were dating me, if you will, but I never saw any potential in them, and I knew from the beginning we weren't going to work out. The longest of those relationships lasted four months, which most would consider very short. (It was with a super stupid ESFP.) That so, I've had 43 sex partners. Supposedly the average gay man has had only 7 or so, so I guess that kind of makes me slutty, but one of my gay friends has had a few hundred. It's guys like him who bring up the gay average: supposedly the average straight man will have about 5 sex partners. 
5	Gay here as well, what is the point of your post?
6	I'm a gay ENTJ and I know a few, the secret is to *look in the right place*.\n\nBut wanting to find someone specific like that is a limiting train of thought. It's fine, but to disregard all the other 15 personalities seems more like shopping for a brand than opening up your social circle for another person.

1	Hey,\n\nI am also and INTJ, and some weeks ago I met the most precious ENTJ. I didn't know he was one. I had never met anyone like him before and out of curiosity I asked him to take the test, and indeed he resulted to be one.\n\nI was at a party on my own, just dancing and enjoying life. At some point in the night I saw him and complimented his moves. After which we started talking and hanging. We spent the rest of the night together, just dancing, chatting, laughing...We instantly connected. \n\nI hate small talk,  and I am quite straightforward, so I normally come off as rude. But it is just that what really interests me and gives me joy is having meaningful conversations, with people that show genuine interest in me and the topic. And he did. I found myself deep into a few hours long conversation, walking through the Amsterdam's cold night after the party, with a stranger. \n\nHe was a straight guy going through a break up, and I a gay guy struggling with the fact of being so immersed in my solitary life. And in an instant, I found the best friend I could ever have. All my struggles dissolved. This encounter gave me peace. \n\nHe redefined the concept of a friend for me. I still have to figure out a lot regarding relationships, love and human emotions, but he made it all far simpler. It gave me such and important sense of validation and belonging knowing  that there exists a genuinely kind-hearted person, that looks into themselves, who, from what I could gather, is brave when confronting inner fears, that wants others to do the same, wants others to be happy, and more over this person wanted to share a moment of their life with me. \n\nUntil this point in my life I had never looked that much into personality types. Now I think that it may be informative data about how well two people may stablish something between them. I was certainly mesmerized by how this random straight dude understood me more that no one ever did before. But hey, none of us had a fucking clue of what type of personality the other was. We met doing something that we both liked, that was the starting point.\n\nI made this great friend because I decided to go on my own to a techno music party. And once there I talked to people. Just talk and compliment people. A conversation might start and you might connect with someone. You can check personality types along the way, just to better understand the other person or out of pure interest in them. \n\nI had always struggled with meeting new people, but I dare say we INTJs have the play mode on hard when it comes to relationships. And I understand why you would want to find your ENTJ. However, my advice is to meet people with no goal in mind,  if your goal is to find an ENTJ for a relationship, you would be turning a whole human being into a simple tag. You know you yourself are more than an INTJ, and you might even know how bothersome it is when people want to meet you just because of what they believe you to be. \n\nIf you have to have a goal to meet and ENTJ, let it be to find a good friend. Certainly in my experience, the INTJ-ENTJ friendship is pure gold. 
1	Gay ENTJ-T divorcing my INTP of 13.5 years. Married for 3. 34 years old. We certainly loved each other but not even remotely healthy for each other. I've been spinning my wheels much of this time with him. Sex has always been out of this world. A lot of chemistry here. We clearly only made it this long due to that. I mean rock your socks off can't imagine better until the next level-up and it gets better.\n\nWe even explored Polyamory because I personally find being open gross. He was an ENFJ coming off a train wreck of a marriage we were friends with. We all just clicked with and suffered no jealousy (Particularly agreeable to both of us) but his husband was a nightmare of a cadet. If the emotional one could have simply relaxed and let the adults handle things, would have been perfectly fine. \n\n INTP can't accept he's a self destructive hot mess and micromanages every agreement together ever made entirely on his own as his emotions change with the wind. This resulted in absolute and utter failure or path of most resistance in all things always. Damn though is that ENFJ one hell of a personality for an ENTJ-T IMHO. 1st time I felt understood ever. The INTP micromanaging managed to warp reality so far out of bounds we all had to split after. Certainly wish I just left and grabbed the ENFJ and never let go. looking for another for myself, another ENTJ-T INTJ-ENFJ-ENTP. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm at the point I'd rather chop it off than live one more year without some intellectual challenge, logic, consistency and respect in my life. I'd been so sensitive to his needs at one point, I had a hard time retesting as an ENTJ. The INFP was simply a maelstrom of emotions that never failed to perceive every memory as both a great and a terrible things depending on the present environmental factors. I will say I may possibly be the most emotionally familiar ENTJ on earth now... What a terrible terrible PoW situation I foolishly thought I could get through to by example and communication. Nope...
1	Sounds like a power couple! Can't wait to see what happens when you two put your heads together.\n\nBtw, are you looking for a submissive tall and skinny gay ENTJ with long hair and a soft girly voice?\n
4	College sophomore in need of some advice.	So, here's my thing. I've adjusted to the college workload, I'm doing well, and I'm making sure that I understand the material that is presented to me.\n\nIn terms of organizations/clubs, I am actively involved in two now, and I'm currently working on achieving membership in another (Beta Alpha Psi, an accounting honor society - I have to wait until I'm enrolled in the next financial accounting course to actually join, but we're in the phase where you come to meetings first as a non-member). \n\nBut the one thing that's holding me back is the ability to make small talk and converse socially about anything that is not academics or professional related (yeah, I also have an internship experience under my belt, and with another coming next summer). \n\nI have aspirations about rushing a fraternity or business fraternity next semester, and I can vividly see myself shaking hands and making conversation and confidently putting myself out there. But for whatever reason, when it comes time to do it, I just seem to struggle with being social and making small talk.\n\nSo, this is where I come here: I am an ENTJ. I've taken that 16personalities test about 10-15 times at this point. I know that small talk is a problem for my personality type, but the thing is, I so desperately want to be good at it. What tips or tricks do you have to doing that?\n\nI'll leave the floor up to you all now.
5	One of my good friends is an ENTJ and is excellent at small talk and breaking the ice amongst people. Perhaps it's a skill you need to develop and understand that you HAVE to develop. After all, if people don't feel comfortable around you, it doesn't matter how rational you are and how much you make sense, if they don't feel at ease, they might not listen. This is just what I've noticed while observing from the shadows and also from what my ENTJ friend has told me. He's also the most archetypal ENTJ i've met so that's another thing. Are you sure you're an ENTJ? Taking the test doesn't convince me.
3	I would always use small talk as a chance to learn new things and show the person that you want to get to know them. Start by asking the person some basic questions and then go down a path when something seem interesting, leading to more and more interesting things and then you can throw in different comments or further questions or jokes. Does that make sense? \n\nMake sure you really are interested in the answers to the questions and listen really well. The person should not feel interrogated.
2	ENTJs like to make plans. Good conversations are not planned; they are free flowing exchanges of thought that ebb from one topic to another with grace and ease. So in order to make small talk, don't go somewhere "with a plan," but instead, go somewhere "prepared."\n\nThink of it like improvising. You don't have all the information from the outset, so you have to accept that. Bounce your ideas off theirs and don't force your talking points down their throat. Know when to keep your mouth shut, but if you have something really good or funny to say, be assertive.\n\nIf you're starting the conversation, keep it simple, and then dive in to various threads of what they say. "Where are you from? How big was your graduating class? What was that like? What's your major? Why did you choose it? What do you do for fun? Do you play music or make art?" If the other person gets especially excited about any aspect of their response, ask them to elaborate. People love talking about things that excite them. Notably, *actively listen to their responses.* Match the other person's eye contact (or lack thereof) and say "mhm" and "really?" and stuff like that. Don't just ask questions because you want to tell them your answer.\n\nIf you want to get ambitious and you have a good rapport with someone, you don't have to keep things at small talk. People love to talk about their passions -- that's meaningful talk, but easy enough to pull off. Depending on the person, you can get casual-philosophical. I like asking people, "If you replace every part on a boat over time, but you keep the same name, is it the same boat or a different boat?" Kind of stupid, but I like riffing on that question for some reason. You can probably come up with a better pseudo-philosophical question than that.\n\nI should add -- and this is important -- all of these things above are about "driving" the conversation. You need to let the other person drive as well. If they take the conversation in a totally different direction, *go with it.* Don't stubbornly continue asking questions about your preferred topic, or constantly return to what you were talking about before. Allowing the other person to "drive" as well is what creates a flowing, easy conversation.\n\nGood luck!
1	I’m an INTJ and I try to use memes to create conversation or try to use phycology to understand people and try to seem like I relate so I can share my interests.
1	be slightly cocky/arrogant, it goes a long way. Especially if your college age.
9	Long term planning doesn't work for me	I've been obsessed with finding my passion, obsessed because I have no idea what to spend my spare time on. I want to be able to spend hours on getting good at a thing and making a successfull career around it. Since I havn't found my passion it just feels like my spare time is a waste of time. Once in a while I choose to just decide a career path I'm going to take, just because I'm so tired of having no idea what to spend my time on. When I've decided that that career is going to be my future it feels good in the beginning, it feels like my time no longer is a waste of time, it's something that is going to prepare me for the future and increase the chance of making a successful career. But when a couple of days pass it just feels like I'm imprisioned, I just get sad and depressed. Even though ENTJ's usually plan for the future It doesn't work for me. So I've decided to just take life as it goes, hopefully I will find my passion along the way. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs anyone familiar with this?\n\nDo you have any suggestions on what I should spend my spare time on?\n\nThanks
2	How old are you? I ask because I want to be helpful.

2	29 year old ENTJ who is on top of her game right now. Trust me, when I was 17, I was half depressed and worried about my future all the time! The brain of us ENTJ just needs to solve problems constantly. And if there are no interesting issues that are problematic enough for us to solve, we move on trying to worry about other things to solve them. Some things just need time. Your time will come, be patient (I know it‘s hard) and try out different things, talk to lots of people and start using your time to learn new hobbies, skills etc. You‘ll find something you‘re passionate about soon enough! \n
3	Worry about the end goal and not the path.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy this I mean, don't say "be a doctor", it's "help 100,000 people".\n\nWork out that end goal and the path will guide you there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnce you've worked out how to do that in line with your other life commitments let me know - I could use a hand too. (ENTJ 35M) Don't bust your balls on this stuff at 17, your life experiences aren't there yet to let you see 1/1000th of the paths that are available to you. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo something fun and risky until you are 25 and then worry about the path, those 8 years might set you down a path purely you never forsaw... bungee jumping instructor entrepeneur in Peru sounds kind of fun :)
1	Lots of people enter college with an undeclared major.  Since it's such a big investment, you may want to start out at a community college so you won't rack up a ton of debt working on something that won't benefit you later.\n\nBusiness is kind of a major that you can do anything with.  Any industry needs good managers.  And you can always change your major if you decide you don't like it.
26	When people ask us for emotional advice, let’s make a point to help them find the answer within themselves through questions.	When people ask for emotional advice in this sub, we immediately give advice.\n\nWe should be asking them questions in return in order to help them find the answers within themselves.
13	I think the biggest problem isn't that ENTJs don't give good advice, it's that they don't care enough to figure out whether the other person can actually carry it out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's why you need to ask questions. Not because people are incapable of finding the answer themselves, but because you have to figure out where they are at first so you can give advice that is more immediately relevant to them.
7	That's good stuff. 
5	Hey, if you maybe might’ve seen my post and added this here then I’d like to thank you! \n\nOtherwise too...I’m glad you put this up! \nYes, us ENTJs do have compassion and love for people, let’s do this together! 
1	why do you have so many feelings?\n
4	Am I really an ENTJ?	My MBTI test from 16personalities.com always says that I’m an ENTJ. I’ve probably had that test maybe 35-40 times with variations in my answers but it still calls me as an ENTJ. \n\nI’m not sure if I’m a real ENTJ.\n\nThere are people online (ENTJs) who sound all tough and shit but I’m not so tough. In fact when the tough times roll, sometimes I’m not an ENTJ-like, I’m probably it’s exact opposite. \n\nOnly recently have I guided the things they’ve hurt me into my work and they did help but they went to a point of exhaustion and almost breakdown of sorts. \n\nWhen I say I got issues, some ENTJs say “Man up” , “What’s an ‘issue’ ? “ , “what’s a loss?” Etc etc etc. \n\nYou gotta accept that you win and lose in life and when you lose, you gotta acknowledge that you lost. \n\nAm I maybe a lost ENTJ? \nI surely was like an ENTJ before. \nNow I don’t know who I am. \nI feel like I’ve lost my identity. I give up easily. \nI just only recently started to pick up the towel and channel that energy into things and it has helped me tremendously but I should learn a little life organisation to not kill my self. 
7	> There are people online (ENTJs) who sound all tough and shit but I’m not so tough.\n\nYou are talking about ENTJs in their prime. \n\nI am an ENTJ, but I am barely coping with my OCD, GAD, Psychosis, and Bipolar. These things make me seem like I am pathetically weak, but I fight demons everyday, and that makes me exhausted. I also acknowledge the difficulty it takes to cope, and I let that boost my self-esteem. If you have depression or some other mental debuff like I do it can trick you into thinking you are weak. Also it can take time to get into your prime. I am sure the other ENTJs you talk about had weak points in their lives, so don't sweat it too much.\n\n> I should learn a little life organisation to not kill my self.\n\nI am trying to find a way to say I want to make sure you are okay without sounding like I am insulting you. I tried to commit suicide once, so if you need to talk feel free to PM me.
7	Just take time to develop your insight. When ENTJ are lost or stressed, they behave like INTP to find back who there are and ask a lot of questions of themself... Don't looking to be somebody, but do things that makes you sense! On practicing you will find back who you are! If you are an ENTJ, just do... and you will know...
3	ENTJ can act like INTP when there are stressed or when they are looking to develop their secondary functions to be able to face again existential problems until they find where to go.\n\nINTP can act also like ENTJ during a life period. But naturally the primary function will come over.
3	Don't worry about it too much. I know for certain I like to act tough but that's what it is, an act (I'm still an advocate for proper martial arts/combat sports training though cos sometimes you got to bite as well as you bark). When things fail I'm still sad and I think that's quite common actually. \n\nWhat I feel differentiates us from other types is that we don't wallow in self-pity for long. For example, I realize that I don't like failure and set up my life to minimize it by reducing general risk that may lead up to it. I give up my potential for insane success (I mean how likely is it I'll be the next bill gates?) in exchange for a near perfect strategy that essentially can't fail cos I really don't like to lose. I don't need to be the first I'm ok with being second as long as it doesn't compromise my end goal. You will eventually reach a similar realization in life (tailored to your goals and context of course) and once that happens, you'll be near unstoppable. \n\nSince you're already thinking about things/doubting yourself, why not use that negative energy to think about alternative ways that you could be better and how best to achieve such an ideal? Might as well derive value from something that's bad but already present right? \n\nAlso, you're just at the trough of your life - we've all been there. Once you learn to accept it and move on, you'll be chugging along in no time. 
2	Taking a quick moment out of my studying to try and help you look at this differently.\n\nI took 16personalities about 10 times, and they all came out to ENTJ. This puzzled me at first, only because I never really called myself a "leader" or someone to take initiative.\n\nBut, in my case, I dealt with undiagnosed ADHD for the first 18 years of my life. So, it wasn't so much that I didn't want to; it was just incredibly difficult to.\n\nThe more I started thinking about times since my diagnosis, the more apparent it became to me that this description fits.\n\nI mean, I'm not exactly the most verbose person at all times; but if it's a topic that I'm relatively well-versed in or that I'm passionate about, I'll talk on end about it. If I’m confident about the skill or subject at hand, I’ll be assertive and direct about it.\n\nI sure can't stand laziness, incompetence, and lack of effort; I hate those students around me that blame the professor rather than their lack of study skills (ironic, since I'm typing this while taking a break from studying).\n\nThere are more, I just need to get back to work.\n\nSo, what I recommend is, comb through yourself a little more; chances are that all the parts of an ENTJ are there, you're just glossing over it.
2	The MBTI theory is not about behaviors like being confrontational or agreeable. It is about how one digest information and make decisions. Who would've thought that Hitler, with all those war crimes he is responsible for, is a 'saintly' INFJ? You don't have to be tough to be an ENTJ at all. I suggest you read on cognitive functions, it might help figure out who you are. 
2	If you read type descriptions online they're a little like horoscopes, it's a hit or miss. Especially stuff like 16personalities will treat an ENTJ that barely made it over the 50% line like an ENTJ that scored nearly 100% on all traits. \n\nThere's also the thing that MBTI isn't about how tough / agreeable you are, but about how to take in and process information and how you prefer to make decisions. \n\nWe also got the issue with tests that can't take mental health issues in consideration. I've been typed INTP for years and related to it like crazy, thinking I'd be introverted as hell until it crossed my mind that the depression that haunted me for years influences that. \n\nSo you may want to learn a little about cognitive functions and get your type that way if you feel like you've been mistyped :p 
2	That's because most ENTJ type descriptions are wrong!\n\nENTJs aren't tough, bossy, and power-hungry. \n\nThey are professional, charismatic, problem-solvers.\n\nMany ENTJs are profs, or work in research/consulting capacities, some are music writers and conductors, artists of some sort. They try to remain unbiased and open-minded, and usually are passionate about what they do. They are not the commanders/filed marshals that MBTI descriptions portray, those are just copies of ESTJ profile (boss/executive), tweaked and re-packaged!\n\nObama, Elizabeth Warren, Carl Sagan, Fareed Zakaria, and David Letterman are actual examples of ENTJs. You can see that they're calm, polite, and professional, not bossy and tough. 
1	Exhausted Emotions leads to give up in 2 feet of water, even if you passed the whole ocean. Exhausted emotions – a Must hear for ENTJs feeling lost:\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_NPNzQows\n\n\nYes. You probably are. I also once „was“ an ENTJ, but since 2 years i have had a heavy winter in life. \n\nSometimes i questionned my type because i felt like an intravert and perceiver. Thats why i sometimes thought i was an ENTP because Ti & Ne, but in fact i just was in my INTP stress function.\n\nIts very disruptive, because I begin to focus on concepts than the execution of it. All discipline fades away and I seem to be a worst perceiver ever. A Bad thing as beeing a Young C-Level sales man (M27). \n\nSo you and I, and all the honest ENTJ in this Great Community, have to stabilize our life by creating an Environment to prosper. \n\nWe need to wash our face in Order to be able to run after our destiny\n\nWash your Face \nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzxlsgKUcc\n\nRun after it\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1X87PMJmnVY\n\n
5	INFP seeking advice: university major?	Hello! I realise there have been quite a few advice seeking posts from NF types, hopefully this isn't annoying. So the reason I've come to the ENTJ subreddit is because I really do want practical advice reflective of the current job market, but not too stringent, which I'm hoping the 'N' aspect will offset.\n\nSome background info: I live in Sydney, Australia, but I feel that the advice I'm looking for can be generalised to an extent. I'm in my last year of high school and in the process of applying to university. Here in Sydney, he have the HSC exams which I guess is our version of the SATs. My estimated score is 90+ which would place me in the 90-94th percentile of the state. In Australia, we can choose what subjects we wish to complete in our final years, so my marks exclude maths and are all humanities based, including English, history, legal studies.\n\nI don't remember the exact order but for my Holland code, my top two were artistic and social, middle two were investigative and enterprising and last two were conventional and realistic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy options are:\n\n\- Commerce\n\n\- Commerce/Arts (probs major in something that compliments commerce e.g. HR, international business, politics and international relations and minor in something purely for interest e.g. creative writing or English). Also, I can also major in psychological science, but there is 0 chance on becoming a registered psychologist, unlike actually doing a degree in psychology.\n\n\- Commerce/Psychology- I would have to do a masters after my bachelors in order to become a registered psychologist. Only 10% of students are accepted into the masters course so it is very difficult. Not sure if there's any point of battling through a science degree (I would be required to take science electives which I really detest) if there's such a slim chance on reaching the end goal of becoming a psychologist.\n\n\- Speech Pathology\n\n\- Nursing\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFYI, because idk if US colleges are different, but commerce is the Australian equivalent of business. I would most likely major in marketing. Arts is a generalist degree where there are many humanities majors that can be chosen.\n\nPsychology is a heavily research and theory based course, which makes me hesitant to choose it as have heard that thestatiskics component causes many people to drop out. I am terrible at maths by the way and I'm not sure how willing I could be to struggle through it (also a fear for the commerce course).\n\nI've heard that psychology compliments marketing well, but is that actually true? Or is it just a good pairing relative to other degrees like, just better than accounting + psychology.\n\nIf it were between psychology and speech pathology, I have greater interested in the former. However, psychology has poor employment prospects n Australia too, so practically speech pathology wins.\n\nNursing is a safe option employment wise everywhere I think, but I'm not sure if I'm dedicated/selfless enough to take on that career path.\n\nI am leaning towards double majoring, as I definitely don't feel safe doing psychology on its own. Here in Australia, commerce has become a pretty generalist degree so double majoring is often recommended to differentiate yourself from other students. I'm just not sure which degree to pair it with, or if I should do commerce at all.\n\nAny insight or advice would be fantastic. Thanks for getting this far!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: to clarify, speech path and psychology would require a masters degree. And I would need to have a bachelors in that field in order to do a masters. I'm more weary about these 2 than commerce since they are specialised degrees, rather than a more general degree like commerce which has a very broad range of career options. I can be quite fickle and my interests often change, so that aspect worries me.
3	Good, experienced ICU nurses can make 100k USD per year in the US, particularly in good hospitals. You can pick your difficulty level from nurse assistant to ICU (it is proportional to pay) and even work part time while studying. Hardly anyone will say no to a nurse on call. You can also get a car and help out patients in their homes.\n\nThe work is always there, it does pay decently and you can very easily pick up an extra shift if you are running low on $ that month.\n\nIt is also an honorable profession, if that means anything to you. if only you could program yourself to be dedicated  ...\n\nYou can invest a small amount of time into nursing and go from there. You do not have to be stuck with it.\n
2	Things are probably different between the US and Australia regarding the cost of attending university, but I'll say this, and you seem to get it, so I might be preaching to the choir. Regardless of whether or not you're directly paying for it, view it as if you were. Going to university is not only an investment of money, either from you or someone else, but also an investment of a hell of a lot of time. You need to make sure it's an investment that gives you a return.\n\nThat being said, I would avoid anything with a poor potential job market. I can tell you now that I would shy away from any field where all of my opportunity comes from others' whims or teaching the next generation of interested students. You want to make yourself absolutely invaluable, someone people can't go without.\n\nI'm not going to try to steer you directly into or away from one of the options you laid out. That's a decision you need to make for yourself. But, keep your long-term goals in mind for what you want and what you need in life.
2	Is it easier for you to evaluate whether you’ve been fulfilled by work before or after you’ve tried doing it for a day?\n\nWould it be hard to make up some objectives and do some daily-grind type work just to try it out in different fields?\n\nIs finding a job that fits the market more important than being satisfied by your work every day?
2	So idk about the Australian system, but my advice is to take general education requirements your first year to get the widest variety of subjects in your first year. Based on what you liked/didn't like, use that data to choose a major. Hope that helps.
1	I did commerce (Management & Marketing) as an undergrad and honestly, aside from being interesting to me, it wasn't really useful. Got a few job offers off of my degree but also have many friends that are still looking for a job. \n\nIf you want to touch marketing, you have to have an idea of what type of marketing you want to do and what kind of firms you want to go into. The degree doesn't magically make you specialized for all aspects of marketing. If you for example like social media marketing, then your electives should be oriented towards gearing you up for that or supporting that through acquiring peripheral skills. If you just take the courses as they come and don't exactly specialize in anything, you're going to come out with a general marketing degree with no particular area of expertise and you'll just be like 90% of other marketing grads. Also, do internships (even if you don't get paid) at good firms that are actually known for their marketing expertise or are just all around legendary in the industry, there isn't a point half-assing it and getting good pay as an intern in a shitty company because the whole point of doing an internship is so you can learn from the experience (or pretend that you have) and form connections, both of which are then used to springboard largely through name-dropping (cos you're just a fresh grad and have no proof you're worth your weight) into better positions. I personally aimed for internships in management consultancies and was offered jobs primarily because I just did a bit of name dropping during social events and had a stellar transcript that looked like I could back my claims up (I can) but anything less means you'll have to grind with the rest of the commerce grads and trust me, there are A LOT.\n\nGot accepted into USyd medicine (been wanting it since I was 14 and commerce was just a fun stepping stone vs something boring like biomed as an undergrad) and from what I've seen in the aussie healthcare industry, there isn't a lot of money to be made period. The americans make significantly more (which is why I intend to take my USMLE) but regardless of earning potential, the job itself is stable with undoubtedly above average pay. You won't be the richest out there but you'll definitely have stability, good pay and eventually if you do things well, a comfortable lifestyle. However, even nurses are going through degree inflation so you best be ready to continuously upgrade yourself to ensure competitiveness. \n\nIf I wanted to be really honest, your options are all kinda bad but of all of them speech path and nursing are the only 2 worth a damn unless you know you for certain that you can consistently be on the dean's list and land good internships then maybe you should risk commerce (against good sense but if you really wanted this, do marketing and data analytics if possible). My advise would be to pick the safer of the 2 options (nursing) and first secure a stable base from which you can upgrade yourself - it'll give you the freedom of choice (once qualified) on what else you can potentially pursue and provide for yourself a safety net to fall back upon if your risky endeavors fail. If you feel that what you earn in nursing isn't enough, come to the dark side of medicine. Your undergrad is irrelevant during application unlike american med schools so just do well in your GAMSAT and you're good. \n\nAlso lol, if you think nurses and doctors are selfless you're wrong, its very cut-throat just look around the medicine forums if you don't believe me. The only difference between doctors and nurses is that nurses do a whole lot better job of covering up their hostility (both to patients and public) but once positions for advanced training/practice open up, they're as bad if not worse than doctors. 
5	How do you define clingy?	I have an ENTJ boyfriend and we are in the early stage of the relationship. No “I love you’s” yet but we both like each other, dating exclusively. I am an ISFJ but I can be pretty assertive compared to women of the same type and so I have communicated my needs (some quality time, at least update me about your day, etc).  He’s a busy guy always out and about and sometimes I feel like when I’m out of sight, I’m out of his mind. He doesn’t text me everyday. While I am fairly independent, one of my love languages is quality time so him not texting me, at least a lame ass “good morning” can be a source of disappointment. Lately though I took it upon myself to not wait on him and text and call when he’s not busy. I wonder if this comes across as clingy though. So, ENTJs: what would qualify a partner as clingy? And is it bad?
5	You should talk to him about this. Just be honest with him, and tell him that you would like to have some form of contact throughout the day, whether that's a few texts or a call on days when you're not seeing each other, or something less on days when you have a date. That's not too much to ask, and if he's not cool with it, that should tell you something.\n\nTo me, clingy is doting, over-affectionate behavior that shows you can't bear being apart from the other person, or you're overly concerned for their wellbeing. Imo, wanting some kind of daily contact is not clingy, and is actually healthy in a romantic relationship.
4	I get where you're at and don't see much wrong with it. I do fail to see how texting is quality time. Seems to me that you want attention, and you want to know that your partner is thinking about you. 
5	First off I'm not turned off by clingy behavior most of the time, because almost always it stems from insecurity derived from a lack of love or communication, which means I'm part of the problem. There are exceptions, but this is the general rule.\n\nGiven this axiom the pleas for attention and affection are often understandable and an easily solvable issue assuming competency and desire.\n\nEvery person is different, some enjoy the attention and will reciprocate, others will prefer a low maintenence relationship.\n\nMy wife requires zero validation however prefers to keep her circle of trust to just 2 or 3 people and as a result expects me to be a willing listener. My previous partner required validation all the time, her mood was tied to that validation, and her emotional validation largely predicated our mutual happiness and success in other parts of each others lives. When I made her happy she reciprocated and made me feel like I was a rockstar or a superhero.\n\nI never thought of either of them as clingy, because each couple must decide their rules of the relationship and establish clear expectations. Clinginess is often the result of unclear expectations and failure to communicate and less often demonstrative of incompatibility. \n\nEach contributor must be able to feel like they are obtaining fulfillment. Space, frequency/duration of venting or 'how was your day' conversations, expectations regarding having independent lives or hobbies or what have you ("hey im gonna go hang with the guys, bbl"), expectations of the influence you will have in helping each other improve and change, what trust and good faith entails, the list goes on.\n\nYou don't want to feel like one of you is more invested in the relationship, that one of you loves the other person more or cares more, and that this is demonstrable through how much one makes the other the center of their life through behaviors like calling all the time and demanding attention incessantly and justifying suspicion when reciprocation of ones uncommunicated or not agreed upon expectations is lacking.
2	You know the overly attached girlfriend meme? That's kinda hot to have such crazy loyalty and obsession.\n\nWhat is not cool however is when it translates into really stupid shit that interferes with my goals. If he's working, leave him alone (just ask for a schedule so you'll know when he's doing what and tell him that it'll help him cos you won't disturb him during his work time). \n\nIf clingy means you being physically beside me almost 24/7 and as I do my work you don't disturb me, I definitely would not mind it. If its you incessantly bugging me about nonsense while I am doing my work and hitting me with the "do you not love me" bs then yes that would 100% be very irritating mostly because if you think about it logically, if we didn't love you we wouldn't be in a relationship with you. \n\nAlso, if its a chore (like sending the same thing every morning 365 days a year), we most likely won't enjoy doing it. You taking initiative to help us not do that chore is seen as a positive thing. Your bf probably likes talking to you but is just too lazy or more commonly forgot to initiate the conversation, you starting it and him continuing it should tell you what you need to know (ie: you aren't being irritating). Trust me, if you were interrupting something he would likely tell you outright. I have no problems cutting someone short with a, "got something to do, ttyl" so if you aren't hit by that, it probably means he's cool with the conversation. \n\nDon't overthink it or assume stuff. If you're in doubt if what you're doing is irritating, literally just open your mouth and ask him explicitly. I know for certain I don't like people that beat around the bush, if you've got something to say, say it. If you don't say anything I'm going to assume you have nothing to say and carry on. 
0	person with low selfesteem, demanding / requiring validation .   \nread the rest of your post. i would focus on being sane , lovable , optimal with ZERO validation from your partner. you can build from there.  \nbut having these needs and validation games take away a lot from your potential and your relationships potential
0	Contrary to what others are saying, who doesn't have the time send a quick "good morning" to their partner? Get Siri to do it for you.\n\n
11	Which type(s) are you most sexually and/or romantically attracted to?	Supposedly it's kind of rare for ENTJs, but personally, I find ESTPs scorching hot. Romantically, I'm not sure I can hold a conversation with lots of them. Maybe ENTPs. Still trying to figure it out.\n\nYou?
20	The disorganization of Ps can drive me crazy. 
10	My fiancé is an INTJ ...\n\nBut my preference is essentially anyone who thinks logically, speaks well, and can keep up with me in a conversation.
5	INFJs
10	INFJ. Absolutely incredible! 10/10 would date/wed.
8	It honestly depends on the maturity of the person. I've dated INTJ, INFJ, ENFP, ISFP, and another ENTJ. Here's what I'll rate them. \nINTJ 6/10 (stable but too slow in actions)\nINFJ 7/10 (committed but too needy)\nENFP 8/10 (Fun but not relationship ready)\nISFP 7/10 (best sex but gets caught up in what others think)\nENTJ 1/10 (2 dominant extroverts in relationships is a no go)
13	Speaking as as low introvert ISTP, I have had insane sexual chemistry with you lot!! Seems to be mutual, too. \n\nI also think compatibility is there too but we are both emotionally guarded in the same ways. So difficult to get to know each other as it takes a bit of time for us to figure each other out. \n\nOnce trust is established over time, normally, it’s pretty damn enjoyable and effortless with amazing sex. Damn near perfect. \n\nEdit: can someone tell me why this was downvoted? Wth lol
10	Currently in a crazy thing with an ENFP. Love that bubbly personality. Though they seem a little lost at all times and in need of help hahaha
7	I need an infp that’s sweeter than anything I could imagine 
3	INFP, ISFP, ENFP, INFJ. 
3	I’m with an ENFP and I’m miserable how idiotic they can be. From standard conversation I would say I prefer talking to INTPs, ENTJs, ENTPs, other INTJs and INFJs. Mostly if they have a brain and can see the bigger picture. 
3	You probably get this a lot but MBTI alone is insufficient alone to determine whether or not someone is compatible with you but if we were to base it on that alone, I personally prefer INTPs and INFPs. \n\nRomantically: INTPs cos they're likely as smart but are still liable to coaxing towards my goals and INFPs cos they're nice, sweet and most importantly as loyal as they get. Former is obviously much rarer in the female population but I would honestly preference them over INFPs because you can actually use logic to reason with them which is a pretty damn big plus - constantly using appeals to emotion can be very draining.\n\nSexual Compatibility: It is a penis in a vagina, it's not that complex. I like my sex like I like my ice cream and romance: vanilla. Only thing I worry about is frequency but that's more of hormones than anything so doubt it makes a difference. \n\nAs much as I'd like a fairy tale romance, its probably not going to happen :( \n\nAlso, I can't possible be the only ENTJ that has done up a balanced scorecard+decision tree style system to objectively rate potential compatibility (or something similar) right? 
10	INFP every time. Then ENFP. Then ISFP, then INFJ. 
7	With an infp currently. best match so far. \n\nedit: History: ISTP 6.5/10. ISFJ 4/10. INFP 9/10. 
5	Yep, like many people said here, INFP's I love them. Fun to listen to, fun to spend time with. Maybe not the best for career, business and work but great as friends, casual sex and relationships (at least from my perspective).
2	istj
2	I dated an ESFP some how for just shy of 2 years, it was both the best and worst thing that's ever happened to me.
1	My significant other is ISFP and I am ENTJ. Great match.
10	What do you feel is the essential differences between INTJ and ENTJ	And have you ever met someone who was stuck in the middle? 
13	My husband is a very outgoing INTJ so sometimes people mistake him for an ENTJ which I am. The biggest difference in our personalities is that he’s much more private than I am and feels very offended if I share too much about him.  I can be teased and be the butt of a joke no problem. He can to a certain extent but he will get his feelings hurt much more easily than I will. He’s always game for a party or get together but would prefer a one on one or small group hands down. He also doesn’t like loud noisy things that would get in the way of a deep meaningful conversation whereas the louder and more raucous it is the better for me. 
9	Well, I'm an ENTJ with 65% extraversion. So I can relate a bit to INTJs. But generally speaking the differences are somewhat easy to spot. Both can seem arrogant and cold but this is felt very noticeably with the ENTJ. Entj exude this cold hearted bastard energy that INTJs don't. The latter may come off simple shut off, reserved and a bit sour. Entjs are combative and get excited by the possibility of fighting for so.ething or fighting people. INTJs are a little more in their own world and want to contemplate ideas from a distance and how to plan for things, slowly. ENTJ are also strategic but are more goal and action oriented. They don't focus on minute details or processes but on the achievement of the goal.
7	Showyness
3	This is a really great question. I’d say the difference is although I am definitely calculating, I have got to see action or I lose my mind... and sometimes that means moving ahead based on a gut feeling. I don’t get the sense INTJs are happy campers when I sometimes do things like that.\n\nAt some point all of these scores/values are a spectrum and we all fall somewhere on them. It isn’t black and white.  My I/E score is closer to the line than most, and so I’m pretty sure for me the difference between someone just barely on the other side of the track isn’t that much compared to maybe even a fellow ENTJ who is way far to the right on the E scale. \n\n
5	I would say I'm an ambivert but the daily processes I use most are Te, Ni, Se, then Fi.\n\nI usually can tell an ENTJ apart from INTJ based on Se and Ni use alone. I guess it's moreso instinct? INTJs, to me, are very meticulous and calculated with their work and thought processes. I dislike working with them personally because I have to have results. I find them to be great at being self-sufficient but not adaptable when I may need them for ideas or projects. Again, just from personal experience of working with plenty of INTJs. \n\nI rarely meet ENTJs but I do work with one directly at the moment. \n\nIn terms of ENTJs, Te and Se stick out for me. Taking action and the must have attitude screams out ENTJ quickly. For me, I can be quite impulsive with my decision making but I ALWAYS think about what I say or do. I think myself pulling the trigger first then learning is how I would describe an ENTJ. Work hard, play hard is a good one too. \n\nINTJs are some smartass mofos. I may not like working with them but I do enjoy being around them when it is a casual environment. They are absolutely one of the smartest types around. Just make sure you have metal detectors around if you get one upset. 
4	simple: INTJ > ENTJ
4	One good difference is to see their preferences. ENTJs place emphasis on control, order and concrete, undeniable statistics and results. They are pretty action-oriented people as well. Act, then learn from the experience. INTJs on the other hand place emphasis on knowledge and patterns. Then they will act based on what they know and foresee. They are more careful than ENTJs in a sense. \n\nPersonally I don't recall seeing an ambivert in any sense before, much less an ambiverted NTJ. The topic of ambivert is pretty subjective too. Introversion and extroversion is not a binary thing but it is more in the line of a spectrum. For me, I see a scale similar to the acid-alkaline or the PH scale. ph1 for the extreme introvert and ph14 for the extreme extravert. Everyone is somewhere inbetween and everybody's definition of ambivert is a little different. Some consider ph6 to ph8 to be ambiverted and others will agree on another range. 
2	Another observation is PoLR (INTJ) vs. role (ENTJ) Fe. XTJs can be somewhat easy for me to spot because of PoLR Fe. Despite lower Te in the function stack, I think INTJs can actually appear colder than ENTJs because they either don't use Fe or have the appearance of being in pain when they do use it. They tend to be among the more vocal in shunning disingenuous displays of affection. Meanwhile, ENTJs are not brilliant at Fe and don't prefer it, but they will use it if they deem that the situation calls for it.

2	I'm 50/50 E/I NTJ, but I generally come out as ENTJ  (just) in tests.
1	INTJ are autists and more common, commoners.\n
14	Do you easily move on from people?	I find it easy to "move on" from people from my past, even those whom I was once friends with. Not even for inadequacies in the relationships, just that I don't see them anymore and make no effort to contact them. Anyone relate?
12	I do this. Over the years, I’ve realized it’s part of the way I compartmentalize everything. \n\nHowever, I also think it might be because I’ve developed the fastest route to move forward. \n\nNevertheless, I’m still a sentimental person but somehow I just find it easy to move past things quickly. 
6	Depends. If the relationship ended badly then I've got a hard time, otherwise yeah, it's almost trivial.
6	People that add value to my life are extremely difficult for me to forget and move on from. If you've shown me loyalty when I needed it, you've gained a lifelong friend, at least. It's been extremely difficult for me to move on, after my most recent ex. Wasn't nearly as difficult, for her.
3	I have an incredible disdain for people\nin general, across the board. If I am\nnot related to a person by blood or, in some cases, if I am not dating a person in a well founded relationship, I have zero motivation to truly keep in contact unless they put forth the effort.
2	If I mentally decide to “move on” because the friendship/relationship is no longer serving me, then yes I can move on extremely easily without having a second thought. \n\nI don’t just “move on” for no particular reason. If I’m good friends with someone and I don’t see them for a while, I can usually pick up right where we left off when I do see them again. 
2	Pretty easily, typically. Especially if the person has lost my respect through being dishonest or of poor character. I don’t need people like that in my life. 
2	Cutting off people comes almost like second nature. If they’re not adding anything of value to my life they’re essentially dead weight and slowing me down. \n\nRomantically, it is one of the hardest things because when I do fall for someone it has been due to a ridiculous connection that I rarely find in others. 
1	Yep, way too easily. I even cut off relationships very harshly of I feel justified.
1	No, not at all. I think this is where mbti is insufficient. This would depend on agreeableness and neuroticism. No entj is highly agreeable, but could be a bit. However sensitivity to negative emotion would be the 16 personalities - T/A postfixes.\n\nI'm a bit above avarage in neuroticism, which is atypical for ENTJs, but not determining, so I have a harder time.\n\nI'm typing this after a workout kinda distracted, so it probably does not make any sense, just ask if you care about me making this idea more understandable. 
3	Any ENTJ with a strong Ni?	Hello everyone, first post on this subreddit.\n\nI was kept getting a split INTJ/ENTJ (although for the most time the former) on an MBTI test, which lead me to question my results.\n\nSome people suggested I might be an ENTJ with a somewhat defined Ni, and that I should try taking a socionics test. It seemed like they were right, as I'd either get Lie-Ni or Lie-0 yet still with a superior Ni over Te.\n\nAny of you like that over here? I've briefly read the description for that particular subtype on socionics, although not really sure how accurate it is when it comes to me.\n\nI wanted to know whether there is some specific reading or some other material you may suggest for the Ni subtypes, perhaps any popular figures or maybe you can say something about you or what you're like. Maybe how you differ from most of other ENTJ's and whether there are some advantages (as well as disadvantages) you believe you may have.\n\nHope you all are having a nice day!
4	So, ENTJs are Te-Ni, while INTJs are Ni-Te. I was having the same question you had, which am I? For me, it started making sense once I realized that, yes, I do use Ni *a lot*, but it is always supporting my Te. How did I notice? \n\nMy thinking is always 'outside in'. My Ni framework of life and things and everything else gets referenced often, but it's always in response to something happening in the external world which makes my Te go 'hmm, that's interesting/weird/stupid/funny.' I don't know.. the maturing of my functions of my process made my Ni more visible. As my Te developed, it picked up smaller details in the external world and make more interconnections between constructs in the external worlds, while my Ni network of things just grew and grew the more info it got fed. In that sense, my Ni was *felt* as if it was developing much more than my Te, as it was more obvious. \n\nFor INTJs it's different. With INTJs, their Ni network of things is dominant, and they *project* their Ni unto the world. A bit like how an ENTJ goes: this is the world, this is how it *could* be, how to change it? While an INTJ goes: this is how the world *should* be,  this is how the world is, how do I change it?
1	Hey...LIE-Ni here. The Socionics description for the intuitive subtype is pretty accurate for me. I have also been looking for ENTJs in media I consume. \nGame of Thrones happens to be a show that I've identified a number of ENTJs:\nTywin Lannister - LIE-Te\nOlenna Tyrell -LIE-Ni\nThe Spice King of Qaarth - LIE-Ni\nJojen Reed - LIE-Te\n\nOther comparisons I can make:\nSteve Jobs - LIE-Te\nBill Gates - LIE-Ni\nWhoopi Goldberg - LIE-Ni
6	Do you have a role model?	In that case, who? 
4	elon musk, unfortunately. barack personality and charisma wise but not his actual policy effects 
3	Barack Obama, Bill Gates, Galileo Galilei...
5	Yes.\n\nJocko Willink and Jordan Peterson.\n\nJocko's book Extreme Ownership I have on my work desk, and 12 rules for life will follow soon. 
2	I've never liked the idea of role models. Every person has strengths and weaknesses. When I identify strengths in others, I try to incorporate them into my own arsenal.\n\nThis comment section looks pretty damn political, and I don't understand that at all. Take the best parts of each person with whom you agree *and* disagree, or you limit yourself.\n\nI want to present myself and speak like Obama. I want to understand branding and know how to command a space like Trump. I want others to be inspired by me like they are by Bernie. I want to be as persuasive as Jordan Peterson.
4	Bernie Sanders for me, I think. I always admire people who work hard and have integrity, and in my opinion he fits the bill very nicely. \n\nAnd it's rather embarrassing to admit, but oftentimes fictional characters will serve as a role model to me - the most recent example being Kiefer Sutherland's character in Designated Survivor. To be honest that character possesses the kind of empathy I wish I had, heh! I try my best.
1	Richard Dawkins.
1	Nope, and I’d rather keep it that way than limit myself to the potential failures of another.
1	I like to think that my role model is my future self. I feel like he'll have all his shit figured out and will have found both balance and happiness. It's unlikely, but I'm hoping, lol :P
0	No. I worship no other man. I do respect and admire certain men. Trump and Jordan Peterson come to mind. 
-3	Jordan Peterson
-4	Roger Federer. Tom Brady. Donald Trump 
3	I heard you peeps like Music so .. I have created mbti music subreddit	I think most people really underestimate the creative side of ENTJs and portray you as heartless bulldozers. I being the contrarian for contrarian sake obviously beg to differ ... even without being artists, you lot make fine patrons of the fine arts. Also Jack Nicholson, nuff said.\n\nNow I don't necessarily expect you to agree with my typing, but here are the ENTJ Musicians that I know of \n\n1. [Robbin Williams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy4mXZN1Zzk) (not the funny one) \n2. [Maroon 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpgTC9MDx1o)\n3. [Green Day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Soa3gO7tL-c)\n\nYou can obviously go .. too many feels ! But I'll just say that's what art is good for, to portray the inexplicable. Also I have not seen a female ENTJ musician till date, so please do provide examples you think of !\n\nI definitely think you lot have far more better counter examples to offer. Bulldoze here -> https://www.reddit.com/r/MBTIRadioStation/ <- \n\n\n
1	[Henry Rollins](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=awY1MRlMKMc) is ENTJ.
1	>Also I have not seen a female ENTJ musician till date, so please do provide examples you think of !\n\nAlready have at your subreddit. It's Shakira:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MBTIRadioStation/comments/9e4s68/shakira_las_de_la_intuici%C3%B3n_entj/
9	I’ve Lost It Folks	There is this ENFP that I’m crushing on too hard. I wish I didn’t have such strong feelings. It has only been maybe 2 weeks. But I just want to hurry it up! My life is always under control, and maintained by a strong fist, but I can’t help but feel I am no longer the one in control of this or my emotions. And that is a scary place to be! I’m trying to study and do homework but I can’t because I keep thinking about all the ways I can be with my crush, and I’m too busy studying all of my crush’s actions and movements, forecasting every part of him so that I can take him out. 😂😂 I swear it’s not malicious!\n\nBut this has been my experience as an ENTJ with a crush. A strong one. It’s pissing me off.\n\nJust wanted to share, I’m sure you can relate :)
9	https://xkcd.com/101/\n\nTake him out and don't miss.
1	Hehehe... you can never resist the charm of us ENFPs. Resistance is futile, just give in... yesssssss... give in to your crush... let the love flow through you. Shhhhhh no need to fight back... just let it happen, it'll be better for the both of you muahahahahaha
14	How do you guys handle loneliness?	I’m sorry if this question seems like a downer, I’m not an entrepreneur myself but I’m working for a startup which has like 10 people in it.\n\nI work hard throughout the week and then on the weekends I’ll have something or the other to learn cause it’ll be useful on Monday, so I spend most of Saturday on work related stuff and even about around half of Sunday I do that.\n\nWhen I’m free though, I don’t know which friend (whom I’ve not seen from a long time) to contact to like meet up or something. It’s been long since I’ve contacted anyone really. All my calls and messages are work related.\n\nI’d just got done with college (under grad) about three months ago and started this life. The transition has been a little rough I’d say.\n\nI’m okay to sacrifice, but I wanna know your stories. It just feels like it’s happening to me.\n\nThe loneliness bit.\n\nHopefully you’re not mad at me for posting this. I just wanna know the harsh truth cause I want to buckle up for the day I start on my own.
7	I am sorry that you are having to go through a low right now and hope that you find what you need to get through this. No one is mad at you, it is a legitimate question.\n\nNot well, so I try to do things to stay happy or motivated. I start by mass-texting friends/family "Hey! Just wanted to check in and say hi. Let me know if you are up for hanging out this weekend/etc" and see who bites. If someone is interested in hanging out, I make plans! Sometimes people just want to chat, so I ask if a phone call is okay via text, and they usually call to catch up.\n\nIf no one bites, I try to go where people are. Sometimes I eat at restaurants alone to be around buzz and activity. Chat up tables sitting nearby that appear to be social and wanting to do the same. \n\nSometimes I dress to the nines and go out to shop/people-watch. At the very least, if I don't feel good I can at least look good, and compliments always feel great. People on the street are usually kind enough to compliment a good outfit.\n\nBasically, when I'm down I try to seek out company or external stimulation. If I am REALLY down and know I will be a downer to others, I tend to stay in and sleep it off. I am fortunate that sleep usually does me good. If that STILL does not work, I read self-help articles, read forums online, and reddit. We are not alone in our experiences, and we do not have to be. :) 
5	Make a round of calls to some of your college buddies and just ask them: 'yo, you wanna hang out on friday and have a beer?'. It's really that easy. Besides that: YOU NEED HOBBIES. Something you enjoy, that ticks the boxes it needs to tick in terms of personal importance and makes you learn new stuff, but is NOT work related (though the skills you'd learn might be valuable regardless). Don't just do it through self-study either: follow classes, meet new people.
4	First few months at a job are hard, particularly for a noob. See how it goes after you are there for 6 months. If it starts to become a hassle and eating away at your personal life, then switch things up.\n
3	If you ask me you're working too much. You're hemorrhaging relationships in exchange for "usefulness" at work. Leave your work at work and use your free time to cultivate aspects of your life that aren't related to your paycheque. That's how you deal with loneliness: relationships are like a plant, if you neglect them and don't water them enough, they'll wilt, dry, and eventually die. Then you'll be in real trouble.
2	I would suggest that you have two or three friends who are not work related moving forward that you can just hang out with and not talk about business/work with. Trust me it’s nice to not talk about those things sometimes. \n\nHow do I deal with loneliness? Honestly I’m quite lonely, I have three friends who are all lawyers so they are very busy. I just relax when they are busy, go for a jog or go to the gym. \n\nIt dont care that I feel lonely. I don’t want to lower my threshold for friends, start hanging out with everybody just so that I don’t feel lonely because ultimately I know that the feeling of loneliness will pass anyway and I know that if I lower my threshold I won’t feel comfortable. Sometimes we have to be true to ourselves, we can’t pretend to be something we aren’t. This doesn’t stop us being nice respectful and charming. \n\nAlso spend time with your family if you can, help out your neighbours be friendly to people and they may invite you to social events. \n\nUltimate just try to have two or three very close people you can call at anytime. 
2	Video games and alcohol.

6	ISFP seeking life advice from ENTJs	[deleted]
7	Great you came here. We 're literally the best people to ask regarding this situation. I've dealt with people I don't like both in accommodation and in the workplace. First of all, I don't tend to get along with people and don't expect to. This is not a concern of mine in the slightest. But I can see you being ISFP that you generally want to get along with someone and therefore if you don't it creates a lot of discomfort for you.\n\nRule of thumb is be a cold bastard. As an ENTJ, if I don't get along with you then I'll play the whole cold bastard routine. Not recommending you start fights but be as cold and formal as possible. Don't engage in anything that is not strictly necessary. Any attempts to try and get you caught up in some BS arguments you just avoid and make excuses. Or do the ENTJ thing, just leave them hanging like a leaf hehe. It's actually a trick that is used in narcissistic relationships called stonewalling. You can read about it in your leisure time. It's good for dealing with toxic people and it's basically all about not feeding fuel into the fire. Simples. 
3	Context would probably help you get responses more in line with what you want. Is this your husband? What's his responsibility and loyalty toward you and your family? You said "our" kids so I'm guessing it's some sort of parent-of-my-kids/marriage situation. Not dating I guess?\n\nI might be able to help if I know more about this relationship.
3	The KEE**$**H is how I justify working with someone unsavory in the work environment. Also because, if they're rational they know it's in their best interest to create an amiable environment.\n\nWhen I found myself living with someone toxic I pretended they didn't exist. This only worked because the other two roommates who were conflict adverse agreed. Idk how it'd work with just two people.\n\nSorry idk how to tell you this but eject yourself. *Because if my work environment got really shitty I'd look for a new job lmao*. I'd accrue enough financial stability to do so. It might be a long ass time potentially. Like for you in the situation you describe.\n\nBut I know this has a lot to do with mindset. And that I'm not in your shoes. I don't know what country you live in or if you have the support to leave your flatmate. That's lame and sucks ass my dude. Life should not be this way - but it is. Immediately, right now start a [Fuck Off Fund](https://www.glamour.com/story/why-you-need-a-fuck-off-fund). I know this isn't want you want to hear, but it's what you need to hear.\n\nEdit: Or fake it until you make it. Fool yourself - lots of people do this everyday so you can do, but lots of people leave toxic relationships everyday too
2	You have to put the needs of the mission or business ahead of personal squabbles. If you are playing a sport you are on a team. Even if you despise each other, it is in your mutual interest to win. Therefore you must put your petty bullshit aside and focus on scoring touchdowns.
2	It sounds to me, based off this post and comments, that the relationship isn't salvageable. I don't think that's necessarily the case. While I would prepare for the future and do everything else the other ENTJs said, I would also consider couples counseling. It can really make a big difference, or so I've been told. Anyways, consider it as a possible option to improve your situation.
1	It seems like you kind of are into that kind of relationships. I don’t know about your previous relationship whom is your children’s father, but i assume he was from the same kind. \nBecause all of us tend to have certain relationships due to our traumas or self pity. \nSo my advice is: You should focus on your root reasons for this hell hole first. Try to remember your childhood and teenage years and your relationship with your father figure. \nDuring trying to figure out your disabling relationship tendency; behave cooler than you normally are. Don’t let him belittle you; you make fun of yourself when his friends are around. Talk with them; have fun with them; tell stupidest memories you have about him to them. Laugh with them. Make him see you confident around his environment. He obviously lacks self confidence. A lot!! That’s why he tries to see you weak and all those trash talking behind you and humiliating you are about proving himself that you are worthy of him. But obviously you are better than him and he is not comfortable with this reality. \nYou have to create your own reality. As another fellow entj adviced you; fake it. As an entj, I love to make people play the game with my rules. Especially the ones who seems to despise me before. I never felt uncomfortable when people i dislike are around. Just opposite happens to me everytime. It is kind of a challange to make people who hates you, your followers. For that number one thing is making yourself accepted within their circles. \nWhile playing this “i’m one of you guys” card, find out your traumas and don’t run away from them. Accept them. Ask yourself what would have been different if that didn’t happen to you. Bu the time you are honest to yourself, you won’t hesitate to do those Entj advices you got on each comment here. \nEventually, you’ll be the one torturing him mentally and he won’t be able to stay with you. But before that, he will try to brake you and rip your confidence. Don’t give in. Even the humiliation gets harder, laugh harder everytime. As long as you are from the circle, he won’t have fun mocking you anymore. So he will be the loser within the circle again. \nWhenever he talks trash, remember: he is weaker than you and pulling you down is the only way for him to equalize you with himself. Whatever he does, laugh out loud ;)\n
15	Any ENTJs currently/was in the military. If so what branch and how you dealt with the bullshit?	I'm currently in the Army and it's miserable. The pay sucks, and it's full of toxic leaders. XSTJ territory isn't for me, the micromanaging drives me crazy. Me personally don't feel like it's progressing me to move forward in life, it's like I'm in a rut doing pointless shit. Can anyone relate?
14	I was in for five years.\n\nI was on submarines, so it's a bit different experience than the army and (not saying this as a dig on the army) generally I'd say the people I dealt with were probably more intelligent than those that you do.\n\nI dealt with the bullshit by becoming good at my job and making rank. Once you get high enough then you can start making the bullshit deal with you instead of the other way around.\n\nDepending on your MOS and how long you've got left, think of getting out after your EAS. Work hard, study and retake your SAT/ACT and apply for college.\n\nThen kickass there.\n\nBut until then, focus on the things that you can do to make yourself - and vis a vis your unit - more successful. By doing that then you'll be given greater responsibility and you'll be able to make your unit as efficient and well managed as you'd like (to a point... right up until your SSGT says otherwise).\n\nFocus on small tasks, take in the small victories, and make them add up to something greater.
2	Yeah, I can relate.  I served 4 years as an officer in the 82nd airborne before I separated.  It had it's ups but they were not quite matched with the downs.  It also provided very little job satisfaction so I walked.  I spent so much time that I could not tolerably maintain a person life.  The army intruded all aspects of my time and my life that I consider it my first marriage.\n\nAs for dealing with bullshit, I don't know.  I never found a good way to do it.  It's not like it can be ignored, since it can't.  This is the perspective from an officer as we dealt with our problems most often directly from the commander.  Our high visibility role allowed to hypothetically effect more change but also meant that not delivering was not an option, unless you wanted to be killed in your evaluations.
1	Navy. be technical, I was a Machinist Mate, and I was widely respected for both my work ethic and technical expertise. The captain of my aircraft carrier knew me by name, which is odd on a 6000+ person ship. You do stand out from the crowd, and I actually recommend shying away from large commands. You will be more noticed and respected on smaller ships for what you do, what you contribute, and what you know. I highly recommend staying away from army style, as this puts you in a position of "bullshit catcher" and no matter how much they tell you that you are a leader, you are only a leader in the sense that if someone below you screws up (which WILL, and I mean WILL happen) it is your fault for not having your hand in their pocket. Even as an officer the navy treats you better.
4	How do I stop idealizing people ?	Okay so I repost it from R/ENFP . I just want another perspective. My ENTJ sister is in holiday and I don’t want to ask her for advice sir here I am .\n\nHow do I stop idealising people ? recently I idealised the shit out of this stranger on social media .\n\nHe just seems... perfect . I know nobody is but I am mesmerized by his thoughts everything he write seems being full of so much thoughts and depth . He seems so mature for a guy in his early twenties. Basically I was suppose to do a year abroad in his country for September and I wanted to do my master there at the same time even before seeing his Twitter. So when I saw his location adding to him having ( in appearance) the perfect personality for me I just thought that it was my destiny . That when I’ll get there I’ll be happy for once forgetting about my trash country having a new life and everything. Fast forward Strikes arrive in my uni exam are delays we stop having class for 4 months . Exam result come and I failed . need to do the year again . My undergraduate record now is so screw that I could not apply for master degree abroad I am stuck here for again 4 years . I really hate my country . Anyway there is no war I live in Europe I should be happy but I promised to myself since I am 17 that I will leave and now I am stuck for 4 more years .\n\nAnyway I have so many things to deal with finding a new uni new apartment new goal , changing my futur plan , preparing national contest for top private school to run away from our shitty uni education system . In my country private school are rate way more than uni degree which are consider worthless. I have my startup that I wanted to launch so many things . I also wanted to restart playing piano and improve my German and my English .\n\nAnd THE ONLY FUCKING THINGS THAT IS ROTING IN MY HEAD IS HOW I WILL NEVER LIVE MY IDEALISTIC ROMANCE with THIS GUY THAT I BARELY KNOW . I never talked to him but created a whole personality in my head . My friend talked to him once and sayed he was super friendly . He seems so down to earth , humble, ambitious , smart , but also deeeeply empathetic and it kill me inside that I will never know more . I can’t approach him bc I will probably never date him since we don’t even live in the same country .\n\nAt the same time I am living at 2 hour in train from his country so LDT could work for me . But now why the hell am I thinking about that ???!!!! I have better things to do but it’s like my heart and my feelings are in control of everything. There is this uni that is good for my program but the town is a shithole I considered it uncounsiously I think bc it’s only 1 hour in train from where he is living now I don’t want to go bc it’s fucking pathetic at the same time the uni is great at the same time I just hate myself for feeling and thinking this way . Why I just cannot be normal, having normal healthy emotions that are under control ? And healthy thoughts . I know for many people it’s nothing but I also feel so worthless bc I am late into my studies so it’s not like I will try anything with anyone bc of it . Anyway how can I stop obsessing over this stranger who basically don’t give me any reason to think that he is not my soulmate when logically I know this do not make sense ? Am I the only one fantasizing that much like that ? I swear I feel like I developped actual feelings for this guy when I never talked to him in my life . I am far from the ENFP stereotype I even wonder if I am not INFP sometimes bc I feel everything so powerfully and just cry a lot . I am not the happy go lucky ENFP I am not confident bc I have nothing clearly to be proud about . I also know what you must think « it’s bc you lack confidence that you are putting this stranger on a pedestal ». But clearly no it’s so rare for me to feel like that about a guy at all
10	What you are experiencing is common, natural, and simple to remedy. Silence your anxieties. You are in control. \n\nYou want this "stranger" so badly because something else is giving you pain or discomfort. There is nothing special about him. Life is putting pressure on you and it is pushing your emotions down the path of least resistance - to fantasies of idealistic romance. That actually says complimentary things about your character; it's easy for tough situations to drive people towards more monstrous urges. However, you seem to be realizing that the escapism is threatening your wellbeing - and it is. You can fix that.\n\nPicture your infatuation as a balloon covering the end of a faucet. It is growing too large because water keeps flowing into it. That water is stress. You need to turn off the faucet for a little while, and then you can pour some water out of the balloon to bring it back to a reasonable size. \n\nMany of the things you have mentioned that are bothering you have to do with your future - also very normal, it's a trap that most people fall into. Here is what you need to know: the only thing you can control is what you decide to do right now, in the present. There are infinite futures and no one can control them. Worrying about things you can't control is purely a waste of time. Exaggerate your fears until you see how ridiculous they are, then laugh at them and easily discard them.\n\nSumming it up: this is normal but you still need to fix it. Face your problems, focus on the present, and you will be able to find real happiness eventually.\n\nGood luck.
4	For me what works - but it could just be a personal thing - is to actually get rejected. In that case something interesting happens, i.e. I almost always quickly lose interest in that person.\n\nNot sure why, it could be my subconscious protecting myself; or what's more likely imo is that I just don't like people who don't like me, because I kinda like who I am, if that makes sense. Maybe you can try it out.
2	You might want to take a look at r/limerence  \n\n\nI've been there darling, it eventually fades away but it requires a lot of patience with yourself and time. Good luck!
2	Write down the characteristics of the admirable person. \n\nChoose two or three. Than figure out ways to do that in your daily life. 
1	It is just a crush. You are putting the cart before the horse. Try to shift your thinking. Think about the here and now. To get to the end state of relationship bliss you have to drag the cart through difficult conditions. To get from point A to F you have to go through B, C, D and E first....  You got a good idea you are just thinking from the wrong perspective.
1	Now I am dying to know - what are the countries involved?
1	I would echo what others say: it's due to the internet. Not only do online relationships safeguard us from the actual challenges of in person relationships, but they also thrive on the thrill of smart phone notifications. \n\nI know how you feel, as I've been in a vaguely similar situation. (I had met the person before, but when I got interested he lived across the country.) What worked for me was realizing I needed a cutoff and a change from that guy's hold over me. It didn't do to spend time wallowing and wondering over how he felt and what may come. It was simply too much time lost. Eventually, I drew a line with myself and said, "I need to focus my efforts on tangible possibilities." Before long I made new friends and got an offline boyfriend. In retrospect, I wouldn't keep the time I spent fawning over the long distance guy. It was a waste, and if I could do it over, I would have drawn that line much sooner.\n\nLast, I would say that feeling of love and idealization can be wrapped up in other feelings of anxiety about loss, and the anxiety is why it's so hard to move on. In my experience, however, the anxiety feels much more horrible than the actual loss. If you can push through that, you will find new hopes and possibilities on the other side, and attainable ones.
1	so what i think is, you are thinking the wrong way about this. the feelings you have are fine to have as long as they're tied to reality, if they're based on a realistic conception of him\n\nif they don’t accurately correspond to reality, or you're not sure they do or something, just consciously go through the posts of his you have read, plus whatever other true information you have on him (basically just gathering true information on him) and consciously form an accurate idea of the kind of person he is. i want to emphasize that this should be a true understanding, a true conception, so that the parts you have fantasized will be obvious and you can distinguish them from reality. try to be objective in this endeavor. you'll probably end up affecting the intensity of what you feel towards him; how much it gets affected depends on how accurate your original conception of him was.\n\nif your conception of him had turned out to be basically accurate, then wow, i mean, you have someone who is ideal for you. that's not really easy to shut down or get rid of. i suggest thinking about what you want to do. is it worth forming a relationship? can you make it work given other things you want/need to do? how much do you value these other things compared to pursuing a relationship with him? basically, you'd need to figure out how it would fit in with everything else in your life, how much you should prioritize it, cost-benefit, etc. etc.\n\nif you decide you shouldn't try pursuing any type of relationship with him, well, it obviously isn't easy to do this given your feelings. but what gives these feelings life? well, the thoughts of him, thoughts of what you like about him, and thoughts of having a relationship together. he (or your idealized version of him) basically represents what you would love in a partner. you can either focus on other things so that these thoughts gradually die out, or find a more practical replacement for him in someone else. i don't know if it's really possible to kill this off forever. probably the better alternative is to use this to figure out what you'd love in another partner, and use it to find someone you love :)
1	Have you ever seen this person do something imperfect?\n\nBecause it you haven’t you’re idealizing.\n\nHe picks his nose or doesn’t stand up for the right things or whatever sorts of stuff you don’t know. These things take him from being your imagination and perfect... to being a person who you can turn down.\n\nHomeboy pisses on the seat and won’t stop. He’s a dick to his dog. He has affluent parents and never earned anything. Whatever, just find something to bring him into reality for you.
12	Any happy ENTJ’s out there? What are you doing? I’m desperate to feel joy again. I am dissatisfied and bored with my job. My relationship with an ISTP male doesn’t meet my needs. He belittles and guilts me subtly and makes me feel inadequate. He expects me to change too much too fast. Advise?	
28	> I am dissatisfied and bored with my job.\n\nYou are an accountant. Who would not be?\n\n> My relationship with an ISTP male doesn’t meet my needs. He belittles and guilts me subtly and makes me feel inadequate.\n\nCut your losses now. Imagine how much your life would suck if you had kids with him.\n
15	So ask yourself; \n\n1. Why are you doing a job you hate? What's holding *you* back to make changes to your life?\n\n2. If your partner does not add value to your life, why are you with him?
6	If you’re an ENTJ, do what you do best. Take action, and break things off; you’ll be a lot happier. 
6	At first don't worry for the actual situation! (Panic doesn't help to find solutions) What you had to live with your job and your ISTP partner was important! You're just probably in a phase of your existence to wake up to your deeper needs to go to the next step...\n\nBy your natural intuitions skills and creativity, you will be more connected with people with a deeper soul, wisdom and consciousness. It's maybe time for you to reorganize your social circle to find a independent job to let your take control back of your existence.\n\nTo help you during this transition phase, practice fitness or sport to have the sensation to grow and to progress. Focused on yourself at first and take care to develop your health potential (healthy food, relaxation, meditation, practice music or creative activities, getting knowledge by your natural curiosity...).\n\nMaybe, it is time for you to find a new partner with the N type (intuitions). Depending on your past and your actual need, you have the choice of different personality type. As an ENTJ, I recognize that I fit better with ENTJ woman to solve complex problems in the couple and to reach ambitious goals together, but before you must let you time to connect with yourself...\n\nHope that my comment will help you! Take care!
9	Ditch the istp jerk. If they run you down they are not worth being with. \n\nSecond seek challenges at work, seek to rule the workspace by exceeding goals and leading the sheep. \nDefine a goal and work singled mindly toward it. \nYou can be happy.... just don't be pushed around (especially by shitty people like your current partner)\n\n\nIANApsychologist .... just a ENTJ who is also working to reclaim their happiness. \n
5	First and foremost, find happiness and yourself FIRST. When you seek it in others/things you’ll be dissatisfied every time. Work on you 
3	I told him if my job made me feel more needed than my lover than the problem was him.
3	The partner may not be a good fit, but make no mistake, *you* are responsible for how you feel, no one else can control that. Take responsibility for your emotions.
3	I'm happy but I think that's a byproduct of my nature. I think it's my default. Also a result of me avoiding things I dislike doing and moving towards things I do. I would keep moving forward and cut out things that don't bring you joy. 
2	Personally, I find the most success in any kind of relationship if the person is at least also an N, but especially also an NT. 
2	You already intuitively know what to do, you're just afraid to change cause of the sunk cost fallacy (look it up), believe in yourself and your ability to make decisions and you'll be fine/"happy"
2	Ever tried psychedelics for introspection?
2	While I am an unhappy ENTJ, I think I am a little further than you are in a similar situation. I was recently with an ISTP female who bluntly belittled me and guilted me to no end for over 3 years. Emotionally I wasn't enough for her but that was the one person who I tried harder than anyone to emotionally connect with. That person knew more about me than anyone else and that still was not enough. It was a downward spiral that I knew was going to happen but I was pretty desperate to connect with another person so I let it happen. At the end of the day, trust your gut. I'm not out of the tunnel yet, but I know that I am better off without her. I don't believe people can change a lot and also be happy. I wish you the best of luck!
2	Go out and do something fun, just do it. I find being stuck indoors all week to be one of the quickest ways to burnout and become depressed. Its sickening. Pick up a sport, play tennis or something.  Something that takes your mind off the day's troubles. \n\nI am of the mindset that Jobs aren't supposed to be satisfactory, they are a means to an end. At best, they can be a doorway to better things, but never satisfying or fulfilling. Do something else for fun and fulfillment. \n\nAbout your partner, just call him out on it. You definitely need to establish some boundaries that he understands he can't cross, without consequences. Everyone is disappointing in someway or another. Don't give up on the relationship unless something is terribly, unnaturally wrong. If you want to, you could talk to him about it and find out what is going on in his mind. To understand where he is coming from.  Be responsible for meeting your own needs. The best way to be happy is to take charge and be in control. 
2	you seem to have big problems  \nthe fact that your partner doesnt "meet" your needs is the least of them.  \nconsider your context, maybe his intention and solution is good.  \n1 develop perspective, creativity, create value from boredom, it can be done.  \n2 strive for 0 needs. a strong individual is an autonomous one. i have no needs from a partner.  \n\nps. a person with low selfesteem (like you seem to be) will easily misinterpret reality.
2	I am an ENTJ, from this post it seems like you two have a conflict of interest. If he's not making you happy and not helping you improve overall, dump him. Maybe you've had some growth with him, but if he isn't supporting you, benefiting your personal growth, or is not an asset that could become great in the future, it's not worth it. Invest your time into someone who is going to encourage you and who is not going to belittle you. You need a partner that can match your energy. That's essential in my opinion. I am currently dating an INTP and he motivates me to be the best version of myself that I can be. A very supportive relationship I would say. \n\nPlease don't put others before yourself. YOU are always going to be there for yourself. Self-care/improvement is key for me to maintain content. Challenge yourself and develop a new skill, do breathing exercises, exercise your body, read more. I'm on the health/education route, keeps me busy and focused. You seem like you already know what you want, don't be scared. You literally determine how your life is going to be. Good luck, love!
1	Thank you. He and I were able to work it out. 
1	http://www.personalityrelationships.net/isfp-relationships/
1	I left the job I hated and am now getting along with my partner.
2	What are some non-sterotype questions I can ask to determine if someone is an introvert or an extrovert?	I have a friend who has social anxiety and it makes it hard to tell. I’m fairly confident about the rest of his type but I’m torn about the I/E part. \n\nYour thoughts are appreciated. Thanks!
12	Why don't you just ask him which he is. 
10	I got you, man.\n\n“Can you take the Myers-Briggs Personality Test?”
3	I'm an extavert with a tad of social anxiety, so I know what it's like. Observe him at a party where he knows everyone and at a party where he doesn't know everyone. Or, observe him while you're at a party where he knows everyone but then a bunch of people he doesn't know arrive. If there's a noticeable change, it's probably the social anxiety. Or see if he's awkward around people all the time or only around people he doesn't know yet. Also figure out why he's awkward. People worth social anxiety can seem awkward because they seem uncomfortable and second guess themselves. Introverted can seem awkward because they don't want to be there, which makes it uncomfortable to talk to them. If he's extroverted he'll probably also like meeting new people but not a lot at once
4	just ask him if he wants to go to a bar / club on a weekend often.
2	Introversion vs. extroversion is about preference. We all have both sides, it's just figuring out which is more dominant. He could display different sides at different times. He could be an introvert now and become an extrovert after therapy for his anxiety.\n\nSome basics:\n\nYou tend to find talking to new people: energizing/awkward\n\nYou feel more yourself when you’re: center of attention/In the background \n\nWhen you meet someone for the first time: you mostly talk/mostly listen \n\nYou’re more likely to recharge your batteries by: going out with friends/staying home \n\nSomeone with social anxiety likely does not gain energy from being around other people, which is the basic definition of extroversion.
1	Try to check Socionics descriptions about E and I.  [Link IE](http://www.sociotype.com/socionics/dichotomies/ie).  \nAnd the other idea I have is try to ask your friend which description of these is more accurate.
10	ENFP/19 Would love to have an ENTJ penal to talk about life with	What was the craziest thing you did and it turned out just right?How do you manoeuvre your way around people?What the deepest things you would want to know about?Books,movies,the dark side of things....I would love to have deep conversations ...
12	I think you mean pen pal.  The title has the word "penal" instead.
6	When I was in the Navy, I forged a full set of leave papers so that I could take leave to Australia. I had two sets of papers. The legit ones that I had signed by my commanders approving my local leave, and the set I forged all of their signatures on.\n\nHad a fantastic time in Sydney with my new girlfriend and when I got back, nobody knew for sure, but some were suspicious.
3	I got into a years long fight with a YouTube troll after publicly challenging him for some shady real-life practices. \n\nRecently, his behavior has received widespread condemnation from local news outlets, and the local government is   pursuing a lawsuit against him.\n\n\nMostly because of the time spent fighting the troll, I ended up moving away and getting a job in a major US city, which is really helping my social life.
3	1. Backpacking across Europe with no plan, no bookings, and no return ticket.\n\n2. What do you mean?\n\n3. Regarding a person? How they achieve fulfillment and happiness and what drives them to live.\n
2	Yooooo hi talk with me 
2	So why an entj? Haha I’m a female 23. Not to say I’m bad at talks about life because I’d say I actually do it quite often I’m just curious what you seek. 
2	Conveniently I’d love a pen pal  
1	I don't know if I can talk about those questions you posted.\n\nBut, I can talk about this I'm into right now.\nSay, countries.\nI'm assuming you're from the US of A.\nI'd like to know what you think makes America American?\nWhat are some American values?\nWhat makes a thing American?
1	I agree with some of the folks that have posted already, to me these questions are too broad and somewhat not meaningful enough to spend energy on.  But if you were more specific, maybe? Also I used to date an ENFP and we argued a TON so not sure how that would work out...
1	Ok. When you look at the whole entire world, what would you call what you currently observe?
14	"How are you?"...	I hate this question, if one pays attention to the environment of communication between 2 people, this question is irrelevant and a waste of time. One can tell how anyone is doing just by observing.\n\nAnyone else relate to this and have similar feelings towards formalities? They're just formalities! Being nice just to be nice, isn't really nice, it's a waste of time. Kinda like me making a post on reddit just because I'm bored, but whatever, it was on my mind, and I find peoples responses interesting.
13	I see it as semantically insincere but conductive to furthering the conversation. The person who poses this question rarely wants to know how the person on the receiving end is, but he is actually saying, "Name a couple things going on in your life, or a couple things on your mind, and if I care about any of them, I'll keep the conversation going." I don't really mind the question.
9	Well. I can certainly respect looking for interesting responses. In the spirit of challenging you to strive for personal improvement...\n\n>I hate this question, if one pays attention to the environment of communication between 2 people, this question is irrelevant and a waste of time. One can tell how anyone is doing just by observing.\n\nThe hubris here is staggering. Yes, most people do broadcast plenty of hints about their emotional state, but two people exhibiting the same behavior can do it for opposite reasons. I smell the Dunning-Kruger effect at work in your attitude.\n\nOn to the meat of the subject: you view formalities as "being nice just to be nice" - that isn't the point. Social formalities are signals. They contain information, which you should recognize as valuable. If someone asks "How are you?" you can safely assume several things: their cultural context is likely American, they are trying to be perceived as friendly, and they are offering a small token of respect. Contrast with a greeting of "What do you want?", which shows impatience and disrespect within the American cultural context. Someone who follows your preference and dispenses with all formalities also sends a signal: that they view themselves as above the rules and fear no repercussions for failing to offer token respect.\n\nTo bluntly sum it up, your disdain for the cookie-cutter nature of these interactions accomplishes nothing. Learn instead how to work the system and quit whining about it.\n\nI've saved a quote that I found a while ago - not a fan of the originator but I completely agree with what is said:\n\n"Why do I hate small talk?"\n\n"Because you aren't good at listening and then carefully and attentively broadening the conversation. This may in part be because you are cynical with regards to the beginnings of social interaction. Why should strangers offer you anything of real value or take a risk with you until you have demonstrated your ability to handle simple social tasks competently (say without sarcasm or dismissiveness)? So they start off trading in pennies to check you out. You can be virtually certain, as well, that if you find initial small talk boring then the people who are boring you find you, in turn, awkward, charmless, equally boring and perhaps even a bit narcissistic."\n\n-Jordan Peterson 
5	I find this annoying in work context. If I call someone for work I don't care how they are or how their weekend was. Let's get on to the actual topic.\nAlso, when people write Hi, how are you? In phone messages, like on messenger. 
4	I hate small talk personally.\n\nHowever I actually do use, "How are you?" Why? Few reasons. One of the reasons being etiquette. Second reasoning is to open up the person at the minimum so there can be a conversation. \n\nThen again I am an ENTJ type 835 SP/So/sx working in Sales. I find it very critical to have people talking about themselves so I can find opportunities and pain points to close each transaction I have. \n\nThe question is never personal for me where people have to tell me how they actually are. It is just like a mere hello but it does add momentum for me to ask other questions.
3	I relate to this . However i believe its important to keep my momentum so when I hear this question casually I just expect to hear more talk coming my way. Dont take it personal , OP. 
3	It goes either way. Small talk sucks but it's part of our culture. You can't just start bombarding strangers with opinions and complex conversations (though I think all of us ENTJs wouldn't mind if someone were to do that to us, lol). Not to mention that "How are you?" can become sincere and exit the realm of small talk with a slight change in tone.
3	I highly suggest reading Captivate by Vanessa Van Edwards. There's an audio book version on YouTube but either way, there's solutions in there to help eliminate these terrible small talk conversation starters and create more meaningful conversation. Great book!
2	The use of this question is not to really know how the other feels, but just to be polite and to start the conversation. It’s a social behavior and it’s part of what allows us to live together. 
1	To me, the question is a conversation filler that is often unnecessary and annoying. \n\nMost people want to hear a quick response and move on. They don’t care about the actual content of your response.
1	This question is very useful. You can politely communicate that you aren't up to talk, or you can launch a topic you want to tackle. Expressing politeness is basic social hygiene, ignoring people you frequently meet will lead you nowhere.
1	[Fine & dandy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHhYLJMi7CE)\n
1	I like it when people ask me how I am :( It gives me the perfect excuse to go on and on about something I'm passionate about or mention something interesting I have done recently.

5	Improving Fi by Reading Novels?	I've always had a little social anxiety because I had a rough childhood, but over the last few years, I've become super socially awkward and insensitive, which I attribute to unhealthy Fi. There are a few reasons I've developed unhealthy Fi: (1) After completing my undergraduate studies in 2014, all my close friends and I scattered all over the country (the US), which abruptly and radically reduced the number of people I hang out with - overnight. (2) I've struggled a little bit with unemployment, which has been rough in and of itself, but even when I was working, my job was pretty solitary. (3) Similarly, I completed a graduate program, but the cohort had no sense of social cohesion because everyone was working on their super-intensive independent research projects the whole time. (4) I don't know any Feelers anymore, and now's not really the best time in my life to spend lots of time seeking out Feelers to befriend. (5) All my friends now are not just Thinkers but also Assholes. (I try to not hangout with them much). (6) I've had to spend a lot of time with my mother over the last couple years because she's getting old and sickish, and she was abusive when I was a kid, and also, more generally, she's incredibly neurotic. So, although I love her dearly, there's always been a small part of me that wishes she were dead. I'm sure others can relate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm looking to start a career in something social, as well as make a lot more friends, so I want to improve my Fi. I came across a list online of ways to improve Fi - there were many items on the list, but most of them aren't really feasible right now. However, for one item, the author, who seemed to know what she was talking about, listed reading novels, specifically novels that center around characters (i.e., most novels), and she said it's much more helpful than it might sound. Do you agree? Do you think reading novels can strengthen Fi?
5	>So, although I love her dearly, there's always been a small part of me that wishes she were dead. I'm sure others can relate.\n\nSomething about the way you wrote that paragraph and then that ending made me laugh out loud.. I must be a horrible person. \n\nAnyway I'm clearly not the right person to give you advice here so I'm not going to...
1	Not sure how much it helps but I write whenever I feel whatever I feel either in a diary or as an anonymous person on a poetry site (mine is closer to prose). Usually when I read it eons later I see some forgotten things they help me look around and understand what others might be going through and even what I was going through, apparently my memory sucks.\n\nYou could observe people, read novels or self help books on but all in all I think Fi is about where 'you' stand about something.
1	What did you study in undergrad and grad school?\n
1	Express your ideologies and beliefs to people. Or rant about something that triggered your morals.\n\nBTW, this sub could have and ISFP flair :(
1	Idk you just need to do something that \n1) doesnt advance some goal\n2) doesnt really improve yours or anyone elses "standing"\n3) your only justification to anyone for doing it is "cause i wanted to/ felt like it" \n
3	ENTJ myself with ISFP girlfriend	After a long time of talking about this with everyone i turn to you guys.\n\nI have the issue that i think i love my girlfriend a lot, i like being with her and just the thought  of her.\nBut while being with her we often have fights and we are completly different people in both morale and our goals in life.\n\nWe dont  really have a lot in common and i can feel myself getting  annoyed more and more by her behaviour and her way of thinking. We have been together for 2 years and 7 months now and i just  dont  know what to do anymore.\n\nAny advice?
11	Figure out how much of that is you being a shit person. If it's minimal then separate. 
6	Break it off.  I watched my brother end up marrying his gf, who was similar.  He said that he felt obligated to marry her, bc they had dated for so long, even though he wasn't that crazy about her.  \n\nThey've been married for about 10 years, they have two kids, she couldn't even deal with life w/o kids, couldn't handle life with one kid, not sure why she thought that two kids would be the answer, but she basically doesn't function at all at this point and seems to hold a lot of resentment.  They're both unhappy, he does everything, she just mopes around and whines.  My other brother and I have watched this play out exactly the way we thought it would, since we were never keen on his wife to begin with.  Marriage and all the other aspects of it (owning property together, children, family obligations, illness, etc.) will only complicate your life and if you already are having issues, it will only get worse, the longer you draw out a relationship, the harder it gets to just end it.
2	Determine what you want out of a relationship, and how much you are willing to sacrifice to achieve it. If you don't get what you want out at a reasonable price/sacrifice, it maybe time to consider someone else
2	It seems to me that you are in love with the idea of what your partner is or could be but the reality where that's not manifesting is frustrating you. If that is the case, take a moment to rethink is it maybe a bit selfish to expect someone to live up to your ideals of a perfect partner. I had a similar situation with an ENFP and the only way out was breakup.
1	ENTJ female with ISFP boyfriend here. In love but my needs are not met. Frustrated, broken-hearted, and crazy in love.
1	I needed him to be less critical of me. He didn’t like how I chopped vegetables, etc.
14	As an INFP, I know I may be your worst nightmare. Ask Me Anything!	Recently just got out of a serious and long term relationship with an ENTJ. I normally wouldn't post things like this but I'm curious and want to know your thoughts on the dynamic. Feel free to ask me anything! 
30	Why can't you explain anything? Why is hearing different options stressful? Why can't I offer possibilities without them being viewed as exactly what I want? Why do you think I'm convinced I'm right just because I said something? Why do you assume I think I can't be wrong?
16	youre not my worst nightmare. that honor belongs to the SJ temperament 
6	Think the INFP and ENTJ dynamic could create a synergistic effect. Maybe you need a Rosetta Stone to help you translate. I’m sorry your thing didn’t work out. With every breakup you learn something 
5	Oooof. I’m presently dating an INFP, four years and counting! Would love more context on what worked well for you and your ex, and what caused friction!\n\nThe opportunity for misunderstanding is enormous, but there are also weird synergies that seem to emerge...
5	I’ve been in a relationship with an INFP for 10 years; 7 years of marriage. Our relationship is very tough but also very rewarding. We have a lot of the same troubles you mentioned in previous comments — I am a robot, she has all the feelings.  We’ve both done a nontrivial amount of character development with a ridiculous amount of communication. She is extremely value based. I never, for any reason, disrespect her values. I think what connects us is our views about big ideas. 
6	I wouldn’t say INFP are the worst nightmares for ENTJ, but someone that is so incredibly complex to the ENTJ that it’s both frustrating and intriguing. Trying to unpack all that INFP is takes such an open mind and patience, it’s not for everyone, but it’s so so so worth it. [Me, ENTJ, 22 F dating INFP 22 M for almost 6 years]
4	Why are you guys our worst nightmare? 
4	Do we overwhelm you?

3	MBTI & Music Survey (Redesign) - Need respondents!	 I created an initial version of this survey a few days ago, but after receiving feedback and reviewing many of the responses, I restructured it to increase accuracy, depth, and easier data analysis. Even if you've already taken the previously posted survey, please take this new one as well.\n\nThis is a survey searching for correlation between MBTI and musical interests such as genres, instruments, singing, dance, and composition/production. Once I get a descent amount of responses, I will post the results in [r/mbti](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti) (unless [r/entj](https://www.reddit.com/r/estj) would like me to post them here as well). I've created individual surveys for each of the 16 personality types, and the one below is SPECIFICALLY for ENTJs.\n\nThe ENTJ survey link:\n\n[https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JTY7V59](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JTY7V59) \n\n​\n\nIf you are not an ENTJ please find the correct link for your type here:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/9a6hbw/mbti\_music\_survey\_redesign\_need\_respondents/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/9a6hbw/mbti_music_survey_redesign_need_respondents/)\n\n​\n\nThanks for your responses! As I said previously, I will post the results and analysis in [r/mbti](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti) once the survey is completed.
1	You can try posting this in r/samplesize for more responses FYI. I did this with a few research projects and got lots of help. 
7	A few questions from an INFP to you ENTJs	Hello! I am an INFP, and I had a few questions for ENTJs. I am trying to write an ENTJ character, and am stuck on a few key points. I would greatly appreciate any help! I know these questions may have been asked before, but it is likely I would like to do follow-up questions, and I don't want to bother people in old threads.\n\n​\n\n1. What is your enneagram, if you know it?\n2. Are you religious? If so... A) How strongly, B) What is your religion, C) Were you brought up with this religion, or did you discover it later in life? and D) what do you think of Eastern religions? If not, A) would you identify as agnostic, atheist or something else?, B) Were you brought up in a religious household? C) What do you think of religion as a whole?\n3. Are you into philosophy? If so, which philosophers/schools do you prefer?\n4. What is your relationship with your emotions? Are you in touch with them?\n5. What things would you *not* want me to write a character as, what common characterizations do you dislike etc.\n6. Anything other insight you can offer!\n\nThank you so much if you guys respond! :)
8	For your character, consider this: to an ENTJ  everything, every action has purpose. Going out with co-workers serves a purpose, even spur of the moment comments which come up naturally, serve a purpose. An ENTJ can be super bubbly and chatty and extravagant and *act* and present themselves like.. I don't know, ESFJ for example, if it serves their purpose. That purpose is effectively the sometimes hidden, sometimes not very hidden agenda (or more likely: agendas) of goals which the ENTJ has spent significant time contemplating about (which to many is a very private process, through their Ni).\n\nI think it will be important to have a very clear idea of *why* your ENTJ does what he does, as this may not be directly apparent from an ENTJs behaviour on first glance.\n\nOnly with their closest friends will agendas fade away and the interaction be more genuine (at least, that's what I imagine and F type to interpret it). This is where you're more likely to see the more emotional sides of ENTJs, which *can* run very deep and be a very profound part of an ENTJs life if the ENTJ values this and has spent time developing their emotional side in the past.\n\nI don't think any ENTJ would ever base their agendas on emotions, but in more developed ENTJs, the agendas will definitely have gone through some kind of emotional judgement filter and may be adapted somewhat based on the emotional needs of ENTJs. 
4	1. 2, with balanced wings, which as far as I can tell, makes me a weirdo as an ENTJ.\n\n2. I am a person of faith. I am a Christian. I was brought up in a Christian household, but my concept of what that religion means has changed over the course of my life. I have respect for other religions, and I think that they all hold different aspects of truth. I don’t think that that mutual exclusion between different faiths should be a focus. I think that religion as a whole gets twisted by human beings (as it is a human construct) and that we shouldn’t let people/religion get in the way of faith and the  unity of humanity.\n\n3. I enjoy philosophic concepts and always enjoy learning, but I don’t pretend to ascribe to one (or even several) philosophers. I think we all have a piece of the puzzle.\n\n4. I experience my emotions as thoughts, for the most part. Raw, unnamed emotion is overwhelming for me, and causes confusion that requires introspection and analysis before I can be comfortable with them. In that respect, I guess you could say I am in touch with my emotions, insofar that I realize that I am not and must apply effort to be so.\n\n5. Common characterizations are that we are brash and without appreciation for tenderness. We are squishy on the inside, and incredibly generous and loyal with our inner circles.\n
7	If you are writing a entj: get to the point.  Do it soon and ask for what you want in return.
3	[deleted]
3	1. I'm a three with a two wing\n\n2. A) I'm agnostic\n   B) Yes, I was raised Catholic\n   C) I think it's a great community builder. However, taken too seriously, it can also cause horrible things (Spanish Inquisition)\n\n3. YES! I like Bertrand Russel, Aristotle/Plato, and realist philosophy.\n\n4. I like to think I have an above average ability to control my emotions, turning them "off" and "on" at will. I know that I can't stay "off" forever though, and the longer I stay "off" the more it hurts to go back "on." In the past, I would shut down whenever I felt anything, but lately I've been practicing feeling my emotions and I think I'm pretty in touch with them now. \n\n5. I've often seen ENTJs characterized as arrogant and aloof, robotic. That's not me. My emotional capacity comes paired with a capacity to feel compassion *with people I care about.* If I don't care about you, I'll save myself from your pain by turning "off." I find that impossible to do when I see my friends or family hurting, though.\n\n6. The only thing that creates tension in the mind is wanting things to be different than they are now. Surrender to circumstance.
3	1) Just took a quiz, I'm a 3. 3w4 if wings are taken into account.\n\n2) a) Not strongly religious, recently begun to reconsider agnostic positions I'd taken over the past few years. b) Roman Catholic c) Brought up with it from birth, distanced myself for a few years, rediscovering my commitment now. d) I'm sure I could learn much from them, but I need to understand what I was brought up with before I can reliably branch out. For what it's worth, I do believe that Western religions have more to offer in Western societies (American here) being that our society is based on individualist values derived from Western religion and that don't seem as important in places in the East outside of Japan, South Korea, or the Philippines. Not criticizing (though I do have criticisms, lol), Singapore and Vietnam for example have something clearly working for them and keeping them happy, even if it's not democratic.\n\n3) Into philosophy in general. Particularly moral. John Stuart Mill is my jam, I've read On Liberty at least thirty times. I'm in security studies so international relations philosophy is naturally what I've drifted into. On that front, I'm a liberal realist, someone who believes that the largest corporations, NGOs, and supranational organizations are on-par or more powerful than states, and should be considered as such, but that each actor is pursuing their own interest, rather than working toward some 'liberal international order' as we call it in IR.\n\nWay more than you wanted but hey, I'm in a mood to elaborate.\n\n4) lol I've been told I'm cold and unemotional but I think I'm better at dealing with my emotions than most. I've noticed most folks go apeshit over things that would've just rolled off my back. And I've made a habit of taking a few minutes out of the day to get in touch with what's making me feel the way I'm feeling, good or bad. So I guess I've got it good.\n\n5) We're not robots and we don't always have a plan. Sometimes improv can be part of a strategy. Emotion can be a part of that strategy, even if it's disingenuous.
2	 \n\n1. Don't know what this is \n2. Devoutly atheist. The cynic in me believes that there is no better way to moderate behaviour then an imaginary best friend in the sky who watches you all the time. That said I do find it wonderful when others can live a better life due to the influence of religion. \n3. Stoicism. Letters from a stoic by Seneca. \n4. I feel like I recognise them. I understand them and their origin but they don't have an overwhelming influence on my decision making process. \n5. One of my personal gripes in indecisiveness in tense situations is probably best showcased in Terry Pratchett's 'Thief of Time' \n\n>'I see a lot of your sort,' Susan went on. 'Heroes have a very strange grasp of elementary maths, you know. If you'd smashed the clock *before* it struck, everything would have been fine. Now the world has stopped and we've been invaded and we're probably all going to die, just because you stopped to help someone. I mean, very worthy and all that, but very, very... human.'\n\nAnd yes, I was on Thanos's side in Infinity War. What he said made absolute sense 
4	1) I have no idea what that is\n\n2) Yes a) pretty strongly b) Christian but I’ve floated around to a few different denominations c) brought up with it d) they’re pretty neat \n\n3) uh meh? I wouldn’t say I’m into philosophy like I could name any schools or anything but I’m not against it. If you bring it up in conversation happily go on and on about my own personal thoughts \n\n4) I’m in control of them. Like I have them recognize them and change them. Not like cover them up actually just make myself feel different about a thing.\n\n5)oh got I could write a whole essay on this but to keep it short I like competent characters. Flaws and foibles yes but if a character is presented as good at something they better damn well be good at that thing. I hate characters who doubt their own abilities\n\n6) I generally don’t put a ton of stock in Myers-Briggs types as a whole. Like they’re a neat concept but people are all individuals and I really don’t think you should worry about it too much.
2	1.? \n2. No im not religious and i kinda believe in apatheism. I was raised kinda as a lax christian but after thinking about it i decided it wasnt for me. I respect eastern religions. I actually really like buddhism. I would call myself an apatheist/atheist/kinda buddhist bc I like a lot of busshist values and what they teach. I dont really like the big religions. I dont see buddha as a god fyi. \n3. I really like philosophy and im not sure which school of thought. I really like the big wigs like socrates, plato, and Aristotle. \n4. I really dont understand other peoples emotions. I do unterstand my own though. I have a good sense of self know what i want and how i will feel when something happens. I can try to predict what someone will feel but its always hit or miss. \n5. Idrk\n6. I also dont know 
1	1. 7w6. My tritype is 7-8-3, specifically 7w6, 8w9, and 3w2.  \n2. No, I'm not religious. I identify as agnostic atheist because I question the legitimacy of religion more than outright disbelieve it, but I still choose to not believe in a god. My family are slightly religious, though, particularly my mum who goes to church every Sunday. And I think religion has no place in modern society, but it's a fun way of creating moral codes and explaining the origin of life.  \n3. Eh, not particularly. I prefer more creatively abstract concepts, such as science and the psychology behind art and writing.  \n4. My handling of emotions is very poor lol But I'm still functionally developing (I'm 21), so my Fi is gonna get better as I get older. But I do see the value of emotion...in situations where it's necessary. I strongly prioritise logic over emotion.  \n5. Damsels in distress is a massive no. Timidness in general can be annoying, and an ENTJ character is gonna be far from weak. I also don't like submissive, oblivious characters that are unaware of what's going on around them on a stupid level (for example, someone oblivious to being manipulated). Stupidness is gonna be frowned upon. Disloyalty is a massive pet peeve of mine.  \n6. Remember we're all flawed. Write both the strengths and weaknesses of an ENTJ. They can be strong, intelligent, logical, and assertive, but also easily offended, narcisstic, and emotionally retarded.  
1	1. Enneagram, looking this up now, thank you.\n\n\n2. Atheist, pretty strongly. Was brought up Protestant Christian, grew out of it as an adult fairly easily. Just too many questions. In all honestly, I think religion should be eradicated from all societies across the whole entire world -or- they should be dramatically changed. Imagine where we could be if the money put into churches, was put into cancer research, or life extension, or a number of other things, depending on what one values. On a counter note, I imagine some churches have done some good for their local communities.\n\n\n3. I am into my own philosophy, as I think most everyone has their own, with or without realizing it. Nietzsche is probably the most relatable for me personally. But anyone that can get one to ask questions, is ok from my perspective!\n\n4. My emotions don't control me, I control them, to the best of my ability. They are going to happen, but I focus on desired outcome and what I can control. If I can't control it, I don't give a shit, that's a waste of time.\n\n5. Write a character however you like, as long as it's the truth, people make their own conclusions. \n\n6. Good luck & enjoy the ride, it's a fun one! Life is Amazing.
1	3w2, not religious at all, staunch atheist that thinks it is ridiculous and a means to control people, favorite philosopher is Sartre and I enjoyed "No Exit," I am deeply self-aware and embrace my emotions, I dislike weakness and indecisiveness. ENTJ perfectionism sometimes stems from having narcissistic parents that did not allow you to be anything less than perfect; lots of emotional trauma and burying of emotions involved as coping mechanisms.\n\nI hope your writing is successful, good luck. Maybe check back with us to tell us who your ENTJ is when you make it big!
1	1.	I’m most likely a 3w4 \n2.	No. A) Agnostic atheist although I empathize with pantheism a lot. B) I was brought up Roman Catholic. C) I respect people’s right to spirituality but am very wary of organized religion. All I see is culturally accepted variations of the Jim Jones situation. I actually wanted to be a traveling nun until I was like 12 before I began questioning what made my religion more valid than others. Let’s just say that didn’t go over well in Sunday school lol. \n3.	Yes. I really like Thoreau but lean towards schools of thought as opposed to philosophers. Stoicism, nihilism, libertarianism, and materialism are some schools I appreciate. \n4.	I tend to feel my emotions very strongly; I just don’t understand them for the most part and require alone time to evaluate them and decipher why I’m feeling this way, what are the implications of feeling this way, what can I do to not feel this (if it’s an unpleasant one), and, most importantly, how do I prevent this from interfering with my goals? When I’m with non-intuitives, especially if they’re not TJs, I find I come off as cold, robotic, and even disinterested. I come alive with people I find interesting or with topics I find interesting.\n5.	It’s really annoying when people write ENTJs as controlling of people, I think that’s more ESTJs and their micromanaging habits. ENTJs are too focused on trying to control the outcome to care if you’re doing everything as commanded. I think most ENTJs actually prefer team members who think outside the box AND provide the same if not better outcomes.\n6.	I find that a common theme for Fi inferiors is that their empathy is often characterized by the Golden Principle not feeling bad for others. Me and my ESTJ friend often talk about hearing about traumatic things happening to people we know but feel absolutely nothing, and often times it’s feeling nothing that makes us sad not the actual event that happened. I’ll help another person by thinking “What if that was me? that’s what I would want if I was in their shoes” but not feeling bad for that person. \n\n
1	1. n/a\n2. Atheopagan. I'm very strongly atheist, but I think religiousness is a deeply human thing, and we rely on ritualization, tradition, and community to feel secure and happy. Being atheopagan means I have the pros of being religious (holidays! gifts! socialization!), but can live and think scientifically. I was brought up casually christian. I love studying eastern religions. I think monotheistic religion as a whole poisons most things.\n3. I love philosophy!! I am a huge fan of stoic thought. Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus, Seneca.\n4. I strive to be very in touch with my emotions, in order to keep them in order and to keep everything in perspective. This goes hand in hand with stoicism.\n5. We certainly aren't robots devoid of empathy- each emotion is just well thought through. I cry at movies.\n6. We are serial obsessionists, we deep dive into subjects as they appeal to us- this means many of us have pockets of weird knowledge. Everything is done with intention- from what toothpaste I use to why I put on this shoe first instead of that one. 
0	1.6w5\n\n2.Nope Nope Nope\n\n3.Nope\n\n4.Not really the Emotional type. But I can Empathize with others, and I'm pretty charismatic.\n\n5.?\n\n6...?
0	1) idk, never liked enneagram as a test anyways\n\n2)No, atheist, brought up religious, religion is the opiate of the masses\n\n3) yes, this is a complicated and long answer that I don't care to write out. Please respond and clarify if you're asking what my position is on a specific issue.\n\n4) question is way too vague, be specific\n\n5) You're asking what I don't like to see in a written ENTJ character? tropey garbage that is one-dimensional and ignorant.\n\n6) I am god-become-flesh, worship me :)
-1	Fuck you...
7	The best app ever for us ENTJ's	A while ago a person here on r/entj recommended this app called ''Todoist'' for me (thanks to whoever). It's an app where you type the things you have to do and... yeah, finish them. But here is the thing that makes it perfect for us entj's: you can type ''Meditate every day'' and meditate will pop up on the list daily. It's difficult to remember all the daily things we entj's have to do due to our bad Si, this app does all the remembering for us. I think this is awesome.
15	I like your enthusiasm, but wouldn't this help every type get shit done?
10	I have a small notebook for this. Prefer the paper feel.
5	I recommend https://trello.com
3	Thanks! I will check it out!
2	I just use Google Keep. 
2	This is a function I've been wishing for in an app but I haven't sat down to find one specifically to do it. Thanks for sending this my way. 
1	I reccommend LifeRpg. Fits the NT nerd bill too
7	Inflated Egos	I like people. Most people, in my opinion, are well-intentioned  or at the least benign. However, there are some who have an opinion of themselves that reach far beyond their reality.\n\nI may have an issue with my temper (one that I consciously work on). Though, isn’t it the responsibility of us as members of society to check the megalomaniacs before they reach a position of power?\n\nIs the anger and aggravation that washes over me when in the company of such personalities justified, or am I wrong to Judge these people?
23	I am always right. Worship me.
10	I've heard that often were upset by the qualities of others that we see in ourselves that we don't like. 
10	When you come to realize that most people are NOT benign, and that there is a deep and ugly sense of depravity embedded in every human being, you'll start to feel a lot less anger, and more of stoicism instead.\n\nAnd some self reflection is in order considering that we ENTJs have bigger egos than most! I see this not as a weakness however, but as a cure to the kind of shamefulness that prevents great human beings from achieving their full potential.
2	Everyone has their flaws land works within the framework of their limitations. The challenge is to help people grow and work as a team.
1	Isn't it the responsibility of us as members of society...\n\nNo.
1	My ego is definitely inflated, but I try to keep it to myself & just enjoy the moment of whatever I'm in. 99% of the time, people are not looking for me to prove something, & people are much more effective in helping you, if you come off as likable and trustworthy.\n\nOne thing that may help, is just not to give a crap. If ya don't care, ya can never be let down, & it gives people the chance to surprise you once in a while if there's no expectations!
1	Over time you will see that most people are not good and distrusting their intentions is the quickest way to see why, in that individual’s particular case, any one person is not.
19	How would you describe the ENTJs you know (including yourself)?	I'm interested in seeing what your observations are about differences and similarities you've noticed between yourself and other real life ENTJs. So, I propose that each of us describe a couple ENTJs in our lives briefly so that I may pick apart the differences. I shall go first, because that's essentially how Reddit works.\n\n​\n\n**ENTJ 1: the fake introvert (me)**\n\nI really fall short of the stereotypes of ENTJs as commanding, bossy, and blunt. I do have a subdued controlling streak, where my will leads me to be persistent in sharing my opinions, but this never comes off aggressively. I prefer direct communication, but possess strong enough interpersonal skills that I don't offend anybody. My presence is dry, calm, and subdued. I make people feel comfortable - I hear that all the time. That's not because I'm overtly friendly; I'm just not intimidating. In times of indecision, I'm usually the person saying, "Well, what are we trying to accomplish?...Well, let's do this then." I am also the person quietly frustrated when others brainstorm random ideas with no application to group goals. Reading is probably my most consistent hobby, and that is likely because it is, in my mind, most easily justifiable as serving a purpose (improved thinking and writing). Overall, I think the question of, "Is this going to aid me in the future?" defines me and my contributions pretty well. I pay little attention to pop culture. When it comes to fashion, I do the bare minimum to look professional and contemporary, but prefer not to invest too much in it.\n\n​\n\n**ENTJ 2: the real extrovert (not me)**\n\nThis ENTJ differs from me in appearing much more overtly extroverted. His presence is much closer to commanding. While we both tend to be incisive in our humor, mine is subtle and dry but his is devastating and sharp. He dresses to be noticed. His fashion sense is unique, original, intentional, and thought out. He uses more products to maintain his hair than I've ever heard of. He is a lover of fantasy and extremely well read. He is equally versed in fantasy as in pop culture. He is very socially confident, but privately feels like an outcast.\n\nEdit: He has an enjoyable smug quality that shows in his every mannerism, as though he knows he's a genius. It's hard to fault him: he's quite brilliant, as well as kind and charismatic. Perhaps all ENTJs possess this in some fashion, but his can't be missed.\n\n​\n\n**ENTJ 3: the workaholic (not me)**\n\nThis ENTJ is characterized by her inability to sit still, a true workaholic who will probably be in some hospital leadership role by age 30. As with myself, I would not consider any demonstrative quality to be a major feature of this ENTJ's personality. She's socially inclined with many friends, but her demeanor too is mild compared to stereotypical portrayals. There is a certain punctuation to her speech, but I think this has to do with her inability to sit still. She does, however, occasionally get on others' nerves by questioning processes she knows little about. Her dress is contemporary, but professional without intention of appearing unique. Another prominent feature is her interest in hearing other people's stories and how they make sense of the world. She is a fantastic listener. She has the cheesiest sense of humor of anybody I know, and she's pretended to have a crush on me for years. I think the fake crush stems from a real appreciation for my intellect - a phenomenon that occurs naturally when two ENTJs find each other.
12	I’m not very good at describing myself, so I’ll just relate to the description that most closely fits me, which is your first one.\n\nTo many people I come off as a stereotypical introvert since I’m relatively quiet and appear to avoid social interaction.\n\nAt work, I act very similar to you. I’m generally not loud or persistent, but I am often the one who gets things moving by starting discussions. Usually, it’s for high level stuff such as figuring out what code is going to be released or suggesting tickets we should work on, or process improvements.\n\nUnlike most of my coworkers, I dislike working from home and will come into the office every single day. Several years ago, I ended up spending two days working at home without talking to anyone and practically lost my mind by the second day.  Also, I personally enjoy open office plans due to the interaction and don’t like the idea of having a private office.\n\n\nMany of my friends get confused when talking about my extroverted tendencies. For example, I recently told a friend that I was the most person in my team at work, and literally started laughing.  Another one of my close friends is convinced I am an INTJ. She had this obvious look of confusion when I told her I hated working from home and had a hard time going more than a few hours without social interaction. And I don’t blame them since I thought I was an introvert for a long time who regularly mistyped as an INTP or INTJ.\n\nTypically, I socialize by playing board games, because they allow me to exercise the strategic part of my brain while talking to people. Typically I prefer games with a lot of player interaction such as Catan and Risk.
3	I guess I would classify myself as the artificially warm entj. I know how important networking and friends are. I wish it was completely genuine but I know that in the back of my mind I'll be able to get something out of it. I guess one could say I'm a social workaholic. I perform best when others depend on me. I take my promises to the end of the earth. I wish there was a humble way to say it, but I can inspire hordes of people without realizing it. I'm more respected as a leader by my co-workers than my own manager. People know for a fact that I have their back. In a game of chess, I am a queen who saves her pawns. They are however pawns nonetheless. I dress meticulously and keep a commanding presence (I'm 6'5" and 240lbs). I prefer to persuade than intimidate although I have been known to use "the Johnson treatment" on more than one occasion. I have a sharp and direct sense of humor; I do standup comedy. I forgot who said it but a sense of humor is essentially a combination of honestly and intelligence, two essential entj traits. I'm confident and critical enough to know whether to blame the crowd or myself for a joke bombing. Being as perfectionist as I am, every set is better than the previous. I'm not always blunt; I'll be as direct as the situation allows because bluntness offends people and I don't want to waste time on damage control. I honestly hate how good I am at being manipulative. For context, I'm a tall, bulky bouncer who does standup and is killing it studying engineering.
3	I'm #3 with a sprinkling of #1, and the only other confirmed ENTJ I've ever met was an extreme #2. He didn't dress well but insisted on being outspoken in every way, regardless of the knowledge he had to back it up. He saw the world in black & white, right & wrong, and didn't seem to subscribe to ambiguity when it came to opinions of politics and morality. He was my best friend, but our natures conflicted so now we're no longer friends at all.\n\nHaving said that, we had had many interesting conversations on things like leadership in the past, and trying to fit ourselves into a model. He felt he was more poised for the pinnacle of leadership (top rank type stuff) and that I was more of a "dragon", like a right hand man. As I've grown older I've come to find that that is exactly where I feel comfortable. I like finding someone worthy for whom to work and to drive everything I've got into propelling our combined experience to new heights. I've thankfully worked under two great people in both my primary jobs thus far in my career and have excelled in exactly that position. I don't think I want to be at the top, but being a right hand isn't so bad at all. I suppose it comes down to finding someone with a clear vision, and propping it up with all the skills which make an ENTJ.
3	I think I'm a watered-down #2. I'm definitely "commanding, bossy, and blunt," and my humor is "devastating and sharp," but I wouldn't overstate the originality and boldness of my fashion sense. My favorite color to wear (and in general) is red, so naturally it can seem intense and it makes me feel important, but I wouldn't really call my style especially unique. I've only recently begun wearing product in my hair (I'm a 26-year-old male), e.g., clay and/or pomade, and I really only do so when my hair is grown out a bit. When it's grown out, I like to get a "Harvard clip" haircut, which gives you the I-majored-in-finance look, if you will, but I don't actually get a lot of compliments on this haircut unfortunately. So, recently I've been getting a tapered but all-around short haircut, which may give off an I-majored-in-finance-but-also-played-lacrosse look. It's nothing extravagant though. I'm not sure exactly what you mean by "fantasy." If you mean "fantasy" as in the genre of film or literature, then (1) it doesn't fit me at all, and (2) I'm not sure I agree with you in the first place. If by "fantasy" you mean daydreaming or the like, then definitely, I'm constantly fantasizing - like, all the time. Yes, I always feel like a little bit of an outcast. Over the last, say, ten years, I've had pretty good social confidence but not so much lately, though, because my friends (of convenience) are kind of assholes, but I've dumped them and am making new friends. I struggle a bit with social awkwardness, probably because of underdeveloped Fi or something.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm categorically not a #1.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne of my good friends is a #3. I have a lot in common with her, including as it pertains to having lots of ambition. I love to work; most people would probably consider me as a workaholic, but I'm strategic about the projects I take on. She is constantly taking on new projects, like the Energizer bunny, which ultimately works in her favor (she's further along in her career than I, albeit for more than this reason here). I'm not naturally inclined to do that. She's more socially inclined than I am, not least because, unlike me, she doesn't struggle with social awkwardness. She's probably a better listener than I am, but I'm not sure....maybe because I don't pay attention enough.
2	I can shift between 1 and 2 pretty easily. Not sure how accurate this is for other ENTJs, but I'm a pretty introverted guy with large groups and extroverted with small groups. Not sure if that has a name.
1	This is a very interesting thread. I'm somewhat in between INTJ and ENTJ, probably closer to the former. So I'm curious about how the extroversion of ENTJs play out. What type of personal interaction would each type crave do you think? Is it people to brainstorm with, or to give orders to, hold presentations for? 
1	2 Describes me quite accurately. The other two don’t really resonate with me much. 
1	By the way, what do you mean by fantasy? The genre? Daydreaming? Something else? 
1	In a podcast I listened to they talked about another type. Kinda like a stunted ENTJ who hides from their ambition and instead just persues sensory stimulation, like games or adrenaline filled activities. 
1	Oh man, ENTJ #2 describes me perfectly. However I have a few traits from ENTJ #1, where people have told me that I'm easy to approach and put people at ease. But I do notice that I try to 'intellectually trump' people or show off as a genius when deep down inside i know I'm not. Because of this, I've actually been typed as an ENFJ in multiple tests and I think that my empathy really grew as I pursued more management positions. Whereas being just an engineer I was focussed on efficiency, productivity and gaining more skills. 
-1	Nice ass.
4	Any of You Believe in Simulation Theory?	In case you haven’t heard about it: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_reality
12	I grew out of that about 20 years ago. I mean, it's a cool theory, as are all the other cool theories. If it's true, we'll probably never know. If it's not, well, we'll probably never know that either. Live your life, ya know?
5	Sure, anything is *possible*, but is it probable? Apply Occam's Razor. Is it more probable that we live in a complex simulation, presumably created by advanced technology that we can't prove in any meaningful way, or that we don't? If we can't prove it, and it makes no difference to our lives, does it matter?
4	> Any of You Believe in Simulation Theory?\n\nWell, someone does.\n\nI don't though, but that's just because that is how I was programmed.\n All that hippie Elon Musk / Sam Harris nonsense.\n\n"There is no such thing as free will" my ass!\n\nI believe in free will. I have no other choice.\n\nMusk said something about probabilities and us being in a simulation.\n\nIt is kind of funny when an atheist makes a religious statement.\n
1	I've looked into it a bit. Seems like a possibility. Things have happened that led me to finding out about the theory. Nobody really knows but I do find it very very interesting 
1	Nah, I'd rather not believe in a "true" reality.\nIf everything is fictional, everything is also subjectively true. 
1	If it made the headlines tomorrow that it was true, or that it wasn't, it wouldn't change any of the rules of the game.
1	Quantum Entanglement is making the simulation theory more, interesting.
1	I believe that it doesn't matter one way or another.
7	What’s your daily routine? Hobbies outside of work?	Hey folks,\n\nCurious to know what your daily grind is like and what you do beyond work— weekends / holidays / etc. Am looking for inspiration and ideas to expand my interests and to make my schedule more holistic.\n\nI spend 80% of my time in the office. First things to get cancelled from my schedule when workload becomes heavy are (a) gym sessions (i can get away w/ healthy eating) and (b) dates (a serious relationship is very low on my priority list). I do however spend a lot of time w/ friends on Friday nights. On weekends, I’m too drained to do anything besides stay in bed to recharge my batteries. So, I usually engage in “self-development” activities like reading, learning from various youtube channels, listening to podcasts, you know, the usual. I also make it a point to travel abroad once every 3 months for a culture & leisure boost.\n\nHow about you guys?
6	I read random shit i find interesting, gym, write stories, draw, and socialise mainly. I am looking to go back into a martial art, possibly ju jitsu. I used to play guitar but I got bored of that.\nIf i had more disposable income, there are many hobbies I would take up, i should be able to soon since I’ll have more free time and income in the next few years.\nIm possibly looking into doing rock climbing as my mates do it.
5	I'm in IT but I spend all my free time training Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, hand-balancing, juggling, and also teaching. When the body is a little run down, I read non-fiction; often the staple must reads within my interests.
4	8 to 10 hours a day in the office. \n\nDuring the week I read or watch Netflix for down time. \n\nDuring the week my exercise consists of walking/running or playing physical games on my HTC Vive. Seriously look into vr exercise. It's crazy. \n\nOn the weekend I combine exercise and fun. I go dancing, partner dancing  not that hip hop stuff. I also hang with friends, dinner parties, blow giant soap bubbles down at the beach, movies, hiking, ect.\n\nOtherwise its regular life and domestic stuff. Take care of the house and car, plan world domination, other social and community activities. All basic ENTJ stuff. 
3	Hiking, reading, writing and playing music. In each I have my goals that I work towards.\n\nI also force myself to go outside and do activities with people such as debating and judo. And the same for nature, taking my bike or walking in the nearby parks and forests. \n\nYes, very drained. But you gotta fit these in. It'll make you feel energized. You will be able to work more. 
3	Hiking, Biking, Hunting, Shooting, Gunsmithing, Travel, Languages. 
2	I learn how to build circuits, and some programming. As an engineering student however, this may not seem like much of a hobby
1	Before I talk about my schedule, I'm curious about your "travel abroad" thing every 3 months. How long do you go for? How does your employer feel about that? Only asking because I'd love to do the same, but I can't get the time off to do it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe main things I do to kill time during the week are seeing my girlfriend (2-3 days/week), bar trivia with friends (Tuesdays), gym (any days where I'm doing nothing after work), and bass lessons (every 2nd Friday or so, usually the non-bass Fridays are parties/going out).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWeekends are mostly for friends/girlfriend but if I get large chunks of time to myself I'll go for lengthy cycling or kayaking adventures (lots of nature trails and a Great Lake just down the street). When I've got a couple hours here and there (during the week too) I'll play games online with friends, write, or work on side projects.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBetween all that I don't have much "void" time (where I'm bored/struggling to find something to do).\n\n&#x200B;
1	YouTube, read, write, draw, photography. I also wanted to properly get into archery one time, but keep forgetting to do that lol
8	ENTJs, what do you think of a Machiavellian partner?	Romantic partner, to be specific.\n\n Do you think it's attractive, smart or unattractive, fake? \n\nI'm specially interested in ENTJ female's opinion, but males can answer too.
24	ENTJ F. Personally find it unattractive - would want my SO to be loving, kind, & generous especially after a long day’s work.
17	ENTJ value efficiency but also loyalty, which is more important in a relationship. At the end of the day, as long as my partner is loyal the getting shit done part can come from me, but if they aren’t loyal then we can’t achieve much as we aren’t working towards common/mutual goals a lot of the time. \n\nThey can act Machiavellian in plenty of situations, but if I felt it was to me as well (and if it’s just who they are then how can it not be) then it wouldn’t work out. 
13	I would say 99% of people misunderstand Machiavelli because they think that "the ends justifies the means" actually summarizes his views on political philosophy. 
8	Am female, find Machiavellian traits the exact opposite of attractive. 
8	Too much bs to deal with - I would run fast. 
7	I had one. He was awful. Manipulative, and honestly got really insecure when he realized that I was onto his game and less easily fooled than most.\n\nFor some, the appeal of a strong woman lies in “conquering” her, not being a true and respectful partner.
7	Hard pass.
5	It is fun for the short term but I would pass on a long term commitment with such personality because you can never trust and they will manipulate you to get their way mercilessly. 
5	Any S/O worth marrying has to be "ride or die."  If you can go home to your S/O and say "Baby, I just robbed an international bank and now we have to flee to another country and take new identities" and you know she'd start packing right away (even though she'd be justifiably pissed later) then you need to marry that person.\n\nI don't see what Machiavellian tendencies have to do with core personality traits like that.  We ENTJs are often manipulative as hell, but it doesn't preclude us from being loyal.  So you may just be asking the wrong questions when it comes to your relationship.
5	Ya agree with the girls. I wouldn't want that. Like I can see it being an ENTJ pedsoanilty to s degree. But ya I could be that way but I prefer my morals.
3	I was getting tired of emotional simpletons on the internet and started to flirt with a self-styled psychopath. It was fun at first, but then I learned that I am still emotional. Stepping on heads just because you can is not actually fun.\n
3	If you are pragmatic - which is a quality I appreciate in a person - you are to some degree always going to be Machiavellian in your approach towards life.\n\nBut if you ask whether I would be romantically interested in a psycho - which is probably what you mean - then the answer is hell no.\n\n
2	ENTJ, what's your opinion of partners who exhibit the other 2 traits of the dark triad?
1	Not ENTJ but this sub is open to any type so I'll answer. I believe Machiavellian's are all very intelligent people and I do sometimes envy their ability as I can come off as a bit too straight to the point. \n\nBut do I necessarily want to be around one? Hell no, they will manipulate me in whatever way possible, it doesn't matter whether the result of that manipulation is positive or negative, it was still manipulation. And there's no such thing as a Machiavellian that isn't fake at one point.
1	I can't be in such a relationship. I'm attracted to smart, confident and ambitious types, but not Machiavellian who are opportunistic and manipulative for a greater goal. That right there sounds like my ex-mother-in-law who thought ten steps ahead and enjoyed entrapment or cornering people. Every word you brought up could be used against you and she loved a good one sided debate.\n\n​\n\nI would strongly recommend against dating a Machivellian. When I hear the term I think of Cersi Lanister and Tywin Lanister from Game of Thrones. Imagine being caught up in that kind of drama. Instead you should try to be more machiavellen in your career and chasing opportunities.
1	If they are dumber, of course
37	Taking MBTI too seriously	MBTI types should not in anyway be a part of serious thought in terms of your personal/professional decision making process. This can lead to an extremely slippery slope that ends in assigning everyone you know a “type”.\n\nI feel it is important to very seriously understand this because we, as humans, look to join “teams” in every walk of life. This sub is not a team nor are ENTJs at large a team to rally behind or lead. (Unless that IS the goal of this sub - conspiracy?)\n\nJokes aside, I have seen a similar trend of posts where people have been overly concerned by what their or their friend/family’s type is.\n\nAssigning people personality characteristics based on anything other than firsthand experience is ignorant at the least and bigotry at its worst.\n\nMy intent is not to talk down to anyone. I simply want to preserve the high standards of threads on this sub instead of slipping further into posts like “How to deal with my ISFJ parent” (fictional example).\n\nDefinitely let me know if you believe I am off base here, otherwise, have a beautiful day! :)\n\nP.S I am overjoyed by the number of Jordan B Peterson fans on this sub!
16	The team comment resonates with me. I often feel like the folks who post in here are looking for exactly that... which I think completely misses the point of MBTIs. The other group of folks are looking to categorize everyone, which in itself isn’t bad if you’re in the work environment and are trying to figure out how to talk to or persuade someone, but it seems like folks often take it to extremes. \n\nIt’s also kind of weird the number of people who come in here because they “feel” that they are an ENTJ or whatever. That’s not how it works... go take the test. I think it’s part of the same wanting to be part of a team mentality.  Which is so far from ENTJ lol. \n\n\n\n
3	Agreed. Many people turn MBTI into a strict sorting box with rigid walls. Rather, it's more like lines in sand that help us understand differences in thought and behavior. \n\nUse it as a loose tool to help build relationships and understand yourself and others, but don't put it on a pedestal or let it rule your life.
3	Totally agree with you.\n\nAs an example, when I first took the test and discovered that I was an ENTJ, I found myself missing many opportunities for a couple of times because I was saying to myself « that’s the way ENTJs are... I should act like this. » \n\nAfter that I began to stop being obsessed with MBTI and I use it now just as a source of motivation once in a while when I feel like doing nothing.
2	Yea posted recently about this just cause stressed a bit but some fellow redditors helped out. Jordan b Peterson is awesome as hell. \n\nBut ya I agree with what you say. It has helped me realize some things about myself though and out them into words. 
4	Very well said! It’s a great guide and that’s all. 
3	I used it as a solid framework for my interactions with people. Has helped me strengthen so many relationships.\n\nMBTI is low resolution correct, once you know someone better - drop it wherever you can. 
2	I realized MBTI should be taken with little trascendence. I mean, MBTI are a poor example of who you really are because it almost never fit at all. Although it might be true, in some way what we are doing is restraining ourselves and saying things like: "That's the way I am, I can't change it". Personalities go beyond four letters and this just limits everyone to them and affect the way we socialize.\nAs OP said: "Don't take it too seriously". Personalities are still unpredictable and unknown fields for humans. Give yourself an opportunity to surpass those small boundaries and meet new people no matter what; you never know what you will find.\nP.S. I've got to mention MBTI served as a good insight for me, at the moment. It helped me correct some cumbersome behaviors in my life. However, I stopped using it because it was just like a "cage" where I was restrained.
3	I feel most content when acting like an ENTJ	I have done multiple myers briggs tests and always get ENTJ. Most of the description fit very well but I sometimes wonder if maybe part of it is wishful thinking of who I'd want to be rather than who I am. For example I like to think of me as an effective and decisive person, yet often at work and in other projects I get bogged down with small details that are not very important and feel the need to check and double check my work. I'm also not that good at inspiring people to do what I want but often prefer to just do it myself instead. I don't like to act this way but I often feel like I have to in order to succeed with the project. I've noticed though that I feel the best at times when I can let go of the details and work together with others, bouncing ideas on them. \n\nTLDR: I often don't act like an ENTJ but when I do it feels right. \n\nAnyone else have this experience?
4	Ya there was a post here earlier that talked about stuff like this. But basically we all don't fit into one area. My career isn't my driving force. My passions and kids are.\n\nWhen working on projects I'd rather do the whole thing myself if I have bad or incompetent team mates. Thouhh if I trust them I'm more than happy to delegate give advice and work on my fair share. 
3	> I get bogged down with small details that are not very important\n\nThis in particular is very unlike typical ENTJ behavior. Why do you think you get caught up in the details?
3	How many hours a week do you socialize for pure fun?	
4	At the current stage of my life maybe 4 hours a week, max.\n\nAdmittedly way too little. 
4	Lulz. I read that as “how many hours a week do you apologize for pure fun?” and was like wait it this /r/infj
2	If I’m not having fun whilst socializing I simply categorize it as work because that would be the only reason compelling enough to have me stay in a social situation I don’t enjoy.\n\nTo answer your question: about 9-12 hours a week which splits 50-50 between weekdays and weekends.
2	During the weekday, almost 0. I have way too much to do during the week(work, school, personal goals) and on weekends, I dedicate most of my time to those personal goals or seeing family, but on a good weekend, probably about 8-10 hours total 
2	Define "pure fun." Socialization can be both pragmatic and fun. If one went to a social event to simultaneously charm people, have a good time, and accumulate information on others as well as business contacts and relations then is it still pure fun? Arguably, integrating 'fun' socialization in a pragmatic work-purposed environment is pure fun. Equally so you may be able to argue it is not.
2	ENTJ folks - what are your unique strengths and how do you cultivate them? (Having a mini existential crisis)	Hey fellow ENTJs. Having a mini existential crisis. I'm curious to know the following:\n\n1. What do you think are your unique strengths as a person / in the workplace?\n2. How did you discover these strengths?\n3. How did you cultivate them / leverage on them to fulfill your goals?\n\nA realization dawned on me recently: that I may have been forcing myself to be this Type A ambitious/career-oriented/business-minded person when it's not really who I am. I have re-taken MBTI multiple times to prove to myself that maybe I'm not an ENTJ but the result isn't going away.\n\nFor context - I've been working for 2 years now (since I graduated from university) and it's been *meh.* I received feedback a few days ago that I need to stop trying to be good at everything and just focus on the 2-3 things that I can be truly excellent at. But when I think about what these 2-3 things may be - I just come to a blank. \n\nThanks and looking forward to know your thoughts.
2	I just posted a similar topic, about not being sure if I'm really ENTJ :P  \nBut here's my response anyway:\n\n1. What do you think are your unique strengths as a person / in the workplace?  \nI'm good at asking the difficult questions, facing a problem and trying to solve it, or at least prevent it from escalating. I'm also good at questioning the established "truths" and thinking about ways to improve the ways of thinking. This might sound like rather general skills but my work is mainly in project management where I organize input from a lot of different experts.   \n\n2. How did you discover these strengths?  \nI suppose it's mostly by comparison with other people. Sometimes I feel like what I'm doing is just what should be expected of everyone. But then I notice how little other people seem to do it in comparison and I realize that my expectations on myself are above the norm.  \n\n3. How did you cultivate them / leverage on them to fulfill your goals?  \nI haven't yet. Right now I feel like my movements are held back by the organization I work for. I would like to work somewhere where I have more autonomy to determine how a projects should be organized. I suppose that my current work has been good for letting me be in charge of projects I find interesting, even if I can't lead them the way I'd want to.   \n
1	What do you think are you unique strengths as a person/ in the workplace?\n\nSo I lack experience in some areas and that's what's roughest for me in most areas.\n\nMy strengths are my wide range of what kve learned as I've grown up and can apply those to other sceneraios. As a person I can compare those and use similar logical to bandle other issues. In the workplace I'm still in college but for my degree. I am decent at coding, lack experience and over analyze things, how we when I have a solid understanding of what some things can do and my end goal I can figure out multiple ways to reach that goal. So likely I'm ready good at adapting and learning new things fairly quick. As well I'm really food with people.\n\nHow did you discover these traits?\n\nThis was just a learning process and I still have a lot to learn. But I'd say I've always enjoyed picking up new things. Its one of my passions and I look up and ask questions constantly about things I find interesting. In and out of career things. What makes you really happy?\n\nHow did you cultivate them /leverage them to fulfill your goals?\n\nYou work on them. So you sound like your be similar to me. My field is CS. My plan is to learn was lot of things and get really good. But I don't want to master them. That being said. Here's my plan. Spend a few years working in a certain field, after I've spent long enough for me to know a good amount if it I plan on moving to another area. And doing the same thing there. When I feel I'm ready I'll start applying for management or leadership roles. \n\nWhat field are you in?
1	I have to second the Jack of All Trades monicker. I am good about finding something I want to do, even if it’s something new, and becoming really fricken good at it. If it’s still challenging and not boring after a year, I stick with it. 
3	I’m either an ESTP or ENTJ can someone help type me?	Just ask me questions to help with typing.
4	Do you mess with things on the go and then build your own frameworks or do you look at what needs to be, figure out what's the most pressing issue, and go at it? ESTPs are very go with the flow and the more they "do," the quicker they'll build frameworks to understand and master what they are doing. This makes them very good at fixing physical objects, for example. They aren't necessarily goal oriented and they may jump from task to task but mastery over those frameworks will give them a huge edge and they may seem naturally gifted at winging it if they do this more and more.\n\n\nENTJs may appear to be go with the flow but it's the decisiveness that propels them to move forward because they see a sequence of steps leading them to their end goal. Each time they get to a new step, they may withdraw momentarily and hash out using their intuition what they have to do in the grand scale of things. Once they are sure that it's the best thing to do, they engage in action and execute. They are very goal driven and are often looking for "what matters" in accomplishing their goal. They want to make sure that they don't focus massive amounts of effort on something that has no yield, wheras an ESTP will artistically favor those kind of things as they see it as part of the environment that needs "molding."
3	I feel like I have more in common with ESTPs than many other types, but still, I'm pretty different from ESTPs. I'll generalize based on my perceptions of ESTPs around me and on my perceptions of other ENTJs and myself.\n\nIntellectual pursuits seem to be a pretty central aspect of ENTJs' personalities, whereas ESTPs may or may not be smart. Conversely, ENTJs are often athletic, but athleticism seems to be an incidental aspect of their personality, whereas athleticism often remains central to the personalities of ESTPs.\n\nBoth ENTJs and ESTPs are notably confident, but ENTJs seem to be confident in their abilities, whereas ESTPs seem to have a more unconquerable upbeat-ness. ESTPs are smiley and laugh-ish a lot. ENTJs may have a big smile and big laugh, but we're not really smiley, laugh-ish people.\n\nESTPs truly have a tomfoolish side. ENTJs might be said to have a tomfoolish "spirit," but we're not tomfoolish.\n\nENTJs are long-term planners. I knew I wanted to go to Stanford by the time I was in the second grade (i.e., 7 years old). Most ESTPs haven't thought for two seconds about college at that age and just want to become athletes throughout their childhood, at least if they're boys.\n\nENTJs often don't have high social status until college. That's not to say they have low social status before then, but their social status just wouldn't normally be described as "high" before college, as the strengths they bring to the table aren't really appreciated until college age. ESTPs often have high social status from the time they're little kids.\n\nBoth ENTJs and ESTPs express anger openly, but for ENTJs, that's about it. I don't really feel comfortable expressing any other emotion outwardly besides sometimes amusement. I feel like ESTPs aren't like that. For example, I see ESTP guys all the time clowning around with their buddies and celebrating outwardly, often kind of obnoxiously. I only wish I could get like that. I just feel embarrassed whenever it's appropriate to get like that.\n\nENTJs are pretty pushy. I don't feel comfortable saying ESTPs aren't like that, because I'm not sure. But ENTJs are......pushy.\n\nIf I think of more, I'll add them below, but this is what comes to mind.
2	entj sense of humor is morbid and dry and dark. things like nuclear war and stalin are hilarious. \n\nalso what other types do you tend to get along with?
2	Some feedback	So I can give the details if you feel they matter or must want to know. But basialg here's a rough background. 27 make 3 kids. 8,5 and 10 months. A year from finishing my CS degree. \n\n I sometimes feel I don't fit into the ENTJ because how few I have seen that are hugely family oriented and my career interested. On top of that I don't see my career as something I'm worried about. I do plan on getting into a leadership/management or hire role just because I love leading. (Given I have competent colleagues) Also I know I spent more time this summer and in the past more concerned with getting better st this ranked game. Which ideally I'd really love to be able to coach others on how to get better. My career I see more as a way to support my family as well as investing in rentals since I can pass that on to my kids but also later I can retire and spend more time on either my own programs and if possible to to become a gaming coach.\n\nSo kinda long but one is this uncommon for an ENTJ?
3	There is no need for you to fit every single stereotype about ENTJs. If you're happy with your life then... I don't really know what you're looking for here
2	A personality type shouldn't fit you on every aspect so I wouldn't worry about it. Those are maybe small details that tend to happen but aren't reauired to be there. I'm family oriented in regards to my spouse and daughter as well and I work in pediatric subspecialty. Doesn't change that I  like to be in charge with objective  plans at work. The question I have for you is why are you concerned about whether or not you fit a "type" exactly? I think these tests are more for fun and guidelines for identifying thematic strengths/weakness but shouldnt define you or limit you, especially as you could barely be an I versus E etc.\n 
2	i wish we had a daily or weekly rant thread\n\nmy colleagues have zero leadership and i always end up having to take the lead :/
5	Interacting different from your type?	I am a bit stuck whether I am mistyped, personally unstable, or surrounded by idiots. Test wise, my scores have been XNTJ but people often say I interact like a ESFP or ISFP in most situations. Mostly because I don't know how to assert my Te in these situations. (How do you do it in a nonsense social setting? Whats the point?). Is this an occurrence with some entjs or a possible mistype from an unstable isfp just good in solving things?
6	Socially I think we implement Se more than Te. You’re totally right, there is no point. Socializing is an in-the-moment thing so go ahead and let Se handle it. You could be mistyped, but I think you have a well developed Se and that is the ESFP’s primary function. 
2	Not everyone is going to be a caricature of their personality type. I personally talk waaaay differently from the majority of the ENTJs I see on this board, but that doesn't change me being an ENTJ. Don't change the way you act just to fit in with ENTJ stereotypes. Do look into the cognitive functions more and figure out what you use. Not everyone will act the same. We're all raised differently, have different experiences, different personalities. Live ya life. 
1	Whenever I'm being social, I'd say I act much more Te-Se than Te-Ni. Ni doesn't really have much of a place socially, so I let my Se handle things, but I still fall back on Te and Ni to stop me from doing anything stupid. Though I will say that because I'm a 7w6, as well, my Te appears more like Fe because I quite like making and keeping friends, so while I still listen to people's reasons and logic over their values, I'm much more open to listening about that stuff.
7	DAE ever get annoyed when surprise third-wheels hijack conversations you start?	I am not sure if this is a common thing others experience, but I am increasingly annoyed by this weird thing that seems pattern.\n\nI instigate a conversation with someone, and then a third person jumps in to hijack the conversation. It has happened with several different 3rd wheels and the environments range from work to friends-groups. Here is an example of how the scenario usually goes:\n\n\n\nMe: "Hi person!"\n\nP1: "Hi OP, how are you doing?" \n\nMe: "I'm great, how was wakeboarding?" \n\n3rd wheel: "HI PERSON, DO YOU WAKEBOARD? ONE TIME I SAW ONE ON TV AND IT WAS RED, SO COOL" \n\nP1: "Yes. I just got back" \n\n3rd wheel: "WOW, THAT WATER LOOKED WET!" \n\nP1: "yes, water was wet, etc." \n\n3rd wheel: "Oh yes, water is definitely wet" \n\nOP: *cringe cringe*\n\n\n\n\nI am really annoyed by this because I take the time to invest and research people I strike up a conversation with, their likes, and try to grow a relationship. Third wheels cutting into my dance make me feel like, "WTF, can't you start your OWN conversations?!?!? How starved for attention are you?" 3rd wheel blathers on, wastes my time, aaaaaand... I don't even get to finish my casual conversation. My potential new friend has to go because third person has been blathering on hardly letting anyone get a word in. It's like they're so starved for human interaction that when they finally get it, they can't stop talking. I don't know what to do with these third wheels. They range from a guy in his mid 30's, a 30 yr old woman, a 40 yr old man, and a 28 yr old woman. All introverts. So bizarre. Come to think of it, these people tend to be in the background being super judgmental. So when I do get a good opening and convo reception, they swoop in and its like the awkward little sibling that won't go away.\n\n**TL;DR: Do other ENTJ's ever have someone "cut into their dance" with regard to conversation?**
16	Oh, you are being so optimistic here. \n\nHow about someone interrupting your conversation to talk about something completely unrelated? 
6	So you're a bit nicer than I am. I'm not saying I'm a complete ass to them. But let's say I'm in your spot. And a third person comes in. I'm receptive and willing to have multiple conversations. Granted if they make stupid comments or moving the conversation forward I'll say something about the way they're behaving or thing they are saying that makes them feel dumb or unwanted. \n\nBut if you really only want a one on one then do yourself a favor and don't start a deep conversation around other people.
5	If you have anything of substance to say you can easily take back control of the conversation.\n\nIn short, if you feel offended, undermine their interruption with something better.
3	This happens all the time in groups, it's only really annoying when they're cutting in with irrelevant nonsense and not actually adding anything to the conversation.
4	I think I have just found a goldmine with this sibreddit. Thank you for whoever done this.	
14	ENTJs have a higher income than any other types, so it makes sense. \n\nPlaying around NTPs won't earn you any gold, they just repost your post

3	Life's kinda fun. When you're living it it doesn't really seem like it, but even the tough experiences end up being good stories later on  that you may even look back on with a smile. Life's worth living for me simply because it is within me, and I am experiencing it.

I work for goals in life in spite of the fact they are sort of ambiguous; I am still clarifying them. I constantly need to refresh myself with new things.

2	Work
2	Doing the next thing, then the next thing, then another thing after that. Flow, I suppose. I lose my pain, insecurities, and broken heart in fully occupied moments.
22	“You’re so combative”	What is this supposed to mean? I always get into debates with an ESTP who starts something, prodding me for a debate, and once we get going, he says I’m too combative, and wants to move on. And then I’m left there with my dick hanging out, wondering why he can’t handle the debate he started. Anyone else come across this? I just explained to him that I’m more intense of a person than he’s used to. And when I wanted to talk it through with him to solve any issues, he said I wanted to prolong it and he just wanted to move on. Super unsatisfying! Am I approaching this friendship the wrong way?
20	can't take the heat then get out of the kitchen
13	Haha. I am an INTJ but had the same issue with an ESTJ. He would start an argument and when I would demonstrate by A+B that he was not completely right, he would get all rattled and yelling. I just kept my cool and it would drive him even more crazy. Fun times.\nI perceive the Sensor types to like to debate, but they don’t like to see the facts against the point they are trying to make
10	Lol, an ESTP is calling an ENTJ, "combative?"  I would just take this to mean that you bruised his ego and he didn't have a good retort so resorted to petty name calling.
8	It depends on the specifics.\n\nMy S.O. is the ENTJ, and sometimes seems to have a way of heatedly defending subjective or aesthetic choices as objective & measurable.  It's immensely frustrating and not a good way to build or preserve connections with others, so I'd recommend not doing that.\n\nHowever, there are tons of people out there who can't handle being confronted with facts that go against their bias, and that's definitely on them.  Feel free to keep shutting them down!  Somebody has to do it for the greater good, and us less confrontational types (INFP) are usually not up to it.
5	Ugh, I used to get this all the time in a relationship I was in with an ENFP. They would just shut down and say I was “attacking” them. Then I’d try and logic my way through their interpretation of what I did to “attack” and they would disengage immediately. Very frustrating to be accused of something you don’t understand.
5	Ahhh. I have the same issue with my ESTP cousin. Whenever a certain competitive situation against him arises (whether it be a healthy debate, argument, sport, or anything else really), my drive to win always affects him on a personal level when he’s being beaten. I don’t know whether he’s used to being the “alpha male”around other people, or if he’s just really immature in general. However, when the competitive situation isn’t against him, he seems to admire my combativeness.
7	Too many variables unaccounted for, can't make a judgment on this. \n\n * First uncertainty: is the friend really looking for a debate? You said that he prods you - have you discussed that with him? It could easily be a miscommunication of intent. If your friend is looking for a debate then is he looking for some kind of specific format or tone? Or perhaps he's just trolling you?\n\n * Second uncertainty: what does "once we get going" look like? How long of a timeframe, what sort of social setting, how do both of you act? This could be your first calm, measured response to his prodding but it could just as easily be an hour into the discussion with you getting animated and making hand gestures while shouting as your friend leans away from you. \n\nI'm sure you think that your perspective is reasonable but you need a reality check that nobody here can truly offer, so my recommendation is that you recruit a socially savvy person who can physically observe this kind of interaction and analyze it for you.
3	This is always an issue I have
3	I'm a little late to the game, but a few thoughts.\n\n1. It sounds like there's a lack of self-awareness on your companion's end. How are *you* too combative if the same degree of back and forth from your competitor got you to this point?\n2. My guess is that lack of self-awareness stems from an assumption, maybe borne out of experience with others, that at some point early on you would just acquiesce. So, what he doesn't realize is when he accuses you of being combative the real trait he takes issue with is his own level of argumentativeness.\n3. Perhaps he wanted to be right, felt threatened, and "prolonging" actually meant making the experience of being wrong last longer.\n\nOr the problem is that you debate with your pants off.
4	Am I a ENTJ or something else?	Hi\n\nAfter taking tests on various websites and reading through profiles and the cognitive functions I am positive im a TJ. The rest I'm looking for help which is usually not something I do.\n\nI question rules and bend them all the time. If it doesn't make sense or I just don't like them I will bend or question them. I've been pretty rebellious in my life and still am.\n\nI work in retail as a lead and my manager asks me to arrange product a certain way that to me seems dumb. So I do it my way instead and the other employees agree my way makes the most sense. But sadly my manager has me do it his way but 5 days later he asks me to re do it and it's the same way I tried telling him before. It's always like that. I'll do it my way,he has me do it his way and later I'm redoing back to my version.\n\nI question things a lot and it causes a lot of tension but I know I can be more efficient and see how things should look. I hate retail btw working with the public is excruciating and my management is incompetent a lot of the time. My manager says one thing and later isn't even following his rule but is pushing it on every one else.\n\nI've always butted heads with parents,teachers,employees for trying my way and questioning there's. I'm not saying I believe all rules are stupid, some are there for a good reason and should be followed.\n\nI encourage my kids to explore and learn for themselves. I want them to be independent. One of my kids she's very artsy and paints all over furniture which is fine by me. I encourage her to do what makes her happy. I obviously wouldn't let them do stupid things and I do have some guidelines for them like they must finish all homework and chores before anything else. But I'm not strict with them only if really need be.\n\nIm very goofy with my kids and wife. I like making people laugh.\n\nIm a gamer, and prefer fog and fps. I also play magic the gathering and prefer playing for those that know w/b or b/u.\n\nI love writing and reading fantasy sci fi and horror.\n\nI sing out loud and play air guitar for fun.\n\nI play actual bass.\n\nPower metal, death and black metal are some of my favorite genres and punk as well.\n\nI relate to the cognitive functions for entj estj but the profile typing I don't fully agree.\n\nI'm assertive and don't back down. I tend to trial and error when learning. I need to try it and solve it myself.\n\nI usually tend to dominate conversations.\n\nI'm very loving and caring to a select few. (Family and close ones)\n\nSome people think I'm a smart ass or a assholes. Growing up my parents always called me one.\n\nI enjoy debating and I'll play devils advocate for the sake of a debate.\n\nI tend to be in my head a lot thinking\n\nI like hanging out in small groups Instead of parties.\n\nI can be very talkative if I want to be\n\nI'm very impatient and short tempered. Always have been.\n\nI don't like being micro managed\n\nI love reading movie trivia. I like learning how movies are made. I took film throughout school. Dissecting movies is a lot of fun for me.\n\nI'm a huge horror movie fan. Im a walking encyclopedia of the genre.\n\nI work out frequently and enjoy doing so.\n\nI'm very protective of my wife and kids. My wife has pointed out that when for instance were in the parking lot and someone asks me for change she says I automatically put my self in front of them. I never noticed.\n\nI hate small talk\n\nBlunt
2	Scenario - you have a shitty day at work. Do you come home and talk about it in detail with your partner, or come home and if your partner asks, you say "I had a bad day, I don't really want to talk about it".\n\nScenario - the weekend is approaching. You have been invited to 3 different parties that overlap. Do you have have a plan about which party you are going to or are you leaving your options open to which one appeals most on that day?
1	This is very ENTJ behaviour. Certainly not INTJ or ISTJ. Could also be ESTJ but then again you need to think about something. How intuitive are you? Do you constantly get great ideas that people can't seem to u understand where they come from? Do you often rely on instinct to tell you what to do? Or do you rely more on sensing the outside the world and using that data to your advantage?

1	It’s very ENTJ. You should read the pinned post on the main page of this sub.
5	Opinion on having kids?	Hey there,  \n\nWhat are your opinions on having kids? It seems like a lot of ENTJ's are career oriented, not to mention possibly having them at the right time, which might take a while, since ENTJs plan a lot of things\n\nThe text above are my personal opinions, correct me if I'm wrong
19	Personally I love kids. I want lots of kids. But I also have this specific desire to have MY kids. Like I want specifically my own genetic offspring and the idea of things like adopting puts me off entirely. I also have this desire for my kids to be genetically ideal. Like I’m not a fan of eugenics or anything but just for me personally I want to give my kids the best stock so things like allergies or genetic diseases are actually major turn offs to me romantically. Evolution hit me hard I guess. 
15	Without wanting to sound flippant, I think having children would royally mess up my life, and as such I don't want them. I've got a fair few goals in mind, with regards to my career, my living conditions, etc. Kids aren't part of the equation. And to be honest I find a lot of babies and small children irritating - not their fault, of course, but that's how it is.\n\nI'm likely too young to get snipped, but I'm doing it as soon as I can.
9	I have two kids. No regrets, no way I’d do it differently.
7	I have a kid, best thing in my life. However, parenthood is not for the faint of heart. I'm not sure if I'd have another one.
8	My parents (both college educated) had 4.  Both having professional careers but gave up a lot of financial freedom for me and my siblings.  But yea, I don’t think it would have been as pleasant without the affluence.  \nThe ultimate worth of kids is legacy.  \nYour dogs won’t give you grandchildren.  Your Ferrari will rust away.\nYour boat will sink.  \nTo each their own, but remember that what you bring into this world is what you leave behind. 
5	I really want kids. I worked as a camp counselor when I was younger and loved every minute. Kids can be shit, but mostly they're fun. They make you find energy reserves within you that you never knew existed. That's a massive benefit (imo) on its own.\n\nHaving said that I think I'd get frustrated if my kids weren't driven, much like I do with people in general. I'd want them to have some sort of passion which they'd pursue either as work or in free time. For me it was sustainability and software dev, for my girlfriend it's veganism - honestly I don't care what it is so long as they have drive. Does that make sense?\n\nI'd hate for my kids to be like my cousin for instance, who is apathetic and has no idea what he wants from life. Just plays video games.
5	I wanted a kid... provided the kid would would not have any birth defects and (mental) disorders, and would be intelligent, easy to handle, would not mind frequent relocation all over the world, and of course, I would need a husband willing to work part time (or not at all) to take care of the kid. \n\nAll of which clashes with my belief around parenthood: In this overpopulated world, I *truly* belief only those people who fully aspire parenthood should have children. People who are born and live for parenthood. Who would love, nourish and support a child under any conditions and above all else. Yes, when you have children, the relationship between you and your SO still takes priority as a good relationship provides the foundation of raising happy children, but you as a *family unit* should put the needs of the child(ren) above anything else. The children come first, and should come first, because *you* decided to bring this child into the world. The child owes you nothing, you owe it *everything*.\n\nFrankly, if for example I would get an (even mildly) autistic child which would bind me to one place the rest of my life as my child needed stability, not allowing me to follow my own dreams, I could not get over my resentment because I wouldn't be able to *truly* and selflessly put the needs of this hypothetical child above my own. \n\nIn the end, my SO and I concluded parenthood is not for us. If we were to have children, it would be to fulfill the typical societal 'ideal' of family and not because it is our purpose in life.\n\n
3	My partner and I both want to be foster parents later in life, and I think I'd like a child of our own in the next 5-7 years. We've got some work to do before then, but luckily he's cool with being a stay-at-home dad. 
3	I have many plans that are simply not compatible with children or marriage. Plus I don't feel prepared to take such a big responsibility for someone's life. I could do the whole preparation thing, of course. I just don't want to.
4	i’m a female entj and i’m most likely not gonna have kids. i dont decide based on my emotion. i decied based on whats best for me if i wanna really achieve what im planning to do.\n\nim not buying this whole “its worth it, after you hold your baby in your hand” crap. pregnancy sounds awful that sounds not like something i need to experience. something growing inside of you that fucking moves! this doesnt sound sweet to me, it sounds really weird. i bet that if given the chance, a big percentage wouldnt want kids after theyve been through pregnancy and the first couple of years. they would never admit though, cause what kind of parent would? \n\nalso what was said in other comments about finding the perfect partner to reproduce is also true in my case. \n\nand the social stereotypes that a woman is supposed to look after the kid is really bothering me. successfull women often get asked who takes care after the kids while theyre gone. a man never gets asked that question. I dont want to constantly  explain myself to some narrow minded people why i dont give up myself for my kids or that i still would want to pursue a career and be an individual person. i dont wanna be defined as a “mom” fuck that. 
2	It's fine but not foo many. Kids can make your life hell. 1 or 2 are enough.
2	I dont want kids and dont mind to adopt one later. career and freedom to do whatever i want with my life are my main priorities. i also love cats and dogs, prefer living far away from friends and family. 
2	I definitely want two children (I was an only child and really didn’t like it) but I’m waiting to get myself to a solid position financially so that I don’t feel like I have to deny them any activities they’re interested in. That’s the worst, in my opinion, is taking care of a child who knows what they want to pursue but not being able to support them in that way. Once I’m certain the math works out, and that I can come back to my job after maternity leave I’ll go for it.
2	I have 3. I always wanted 2, number 3 was a happy accident. For me it's part of the process of adulting, rather than a fatherly instinct. My wife is ISFJ and her only life goal was to be a mother. Typical ISFJ haha.\n\nAs for the kids vs goals thing - they aren't mutually exclusive, but I'm a small-town-boy and won't climb the greasy pole as far as many of you might due to that. My lofty goals are untenable without destroying my marriage, and that's the priority for me right now, and hopefully the future too. My wife won't move to the big smoke, she's a family girl through and through, so big-pay-packet CEO is off the table. In that sense though, she's what I needed to enable me to have a family. No, not a womb, but a mothering mother who can do the F-y stuff I find difficult to do.
2	There are two main ways to propagate the information that is "you", or your essential self: 1) have children or 2) imprint your thoughts in art and live through it.\n\nIf you don't plan to leave any art (which is of sufficient popularity and substance) in the world, the only way to avoid becoming another meaningless speck of dirt in the eternity of the universe, is to hope that you genes propagate enough generations for there still to be some of "you" in a million years.
2	I just had my first child- I waited until my career was developed and I am very glad to have done it. It gives great persepctive and has lit a new fire of motivation to be efficient at work in order to optimize work and home life. I recommend it if you want them and are with a long term partner. 
2	I have a lot of goals that I need to achieve and a kid would hamper it tremendously. I don’t desire having children although i don’t mind other people’s children
1	So I was young and dumb and have kids. I always wanted kids just not that early. So its caused aot of stress. I miss out on a lot of stuff I want to do and spend time to improve myself in certain areas. And I'm not really career oriented perse. I want a fun and paying career to invest and have it support what I want to do. I plan on exceeding in my job and getting high up. But that's just more of an enjoyment thing. \n\nGiven all the issues and time I've had to put into them versus my self and putting me behind. I still don't regret having them though I would have chosen later in life if I wasn't stupid.\n\nThe baby times are ehhhh. But my oldest is 8 I'm 27. And being bale to teach him free thinking and about science and the world and new traits and skills. And to see them progress is super awesome. Like I saw in another thread or this thread. I'm really lax in some areas. But I have strict rules they do need to follow. Bad times on school nights. If I have to repeat myself I'll get mad. (situation and age dependent on what it is). \n\nTLDR\nI don't regret having kids but would have waited till later. I love them and enjoy seeing them progress and learn.
1	Life will be complete when I have kids. Everything I, as an ENTJ, love to do and be will absolutely be satisfied when I have kids: helping by teaching, growing, and providing wonderful experiences for the ones I love.
5	Inadequacy	So I have quite a predicament with having kids a bit earlier has made it difficult time wise to do the things i feel should be done. Im currently in process of finishing my CS degree starting my senior year this year. While I have done all the class work and I've done a few extra things to make me more desirable as a new higher. I still have this issue where I dont feel Im good enough in my field. What I'm asking is how do you shake or how did you fix this feeling?
4	What's the evidence of your inadequacy? My expectations of perfection are oftentimes more than what's necessary to get the job done. So determine the reason for the feelings of inadequacy. Finding a mentor helps, too. They can give career guidance and advice towards achieving your goals. 
2	One of the most desirable traits in a new hire is the hunger and willingness to learn, as well as self-awareness. Accept that you are not the finished product, but have a vision of where you want to be and a rough plan for how you're going to get there. If you look at that plan and feel like you are still behind where you think you should be then focus on filling the gaps. I'm 15 years into my professional career and I have loads to learn. Most things you can only learn by doing the job. It's always like that, be cool with it. I hire grads a lot and basically don't expect anything from them other some relevant book learning and a good attitude. 
2	The ultimate goal will always appear overbearingly large whilst aiming to perfect each step of the path.\nThis quality is a strength, not a weakness. \nOnce you truly understand this, the feeling of inadequacy will convert into one of your many sources of confidence.
2	> I still have this issue where I don't feel I'm good enough in my field.\n\nWell, you aren't. You will probably never be as good as the top users on StackOverflow. https://stackoverflow.com/users?tab=Reputation&filter=all\n\nNeither am I and I've been doing it for a number of years. And I am quite content with moving at my own speed. I don't live to work; I work to live, though I can enjoy my work on occasion.\n\nIf you find suicide a dumb way to go (you have kids, right?), then you have to work with what you've got. There is not another choice really.\n\nFrankly, you do not need to be the best in order to be useful. Becoming half-decent takes time.\n\nOther than being efficient and effective with your time, there aren't shortcuts.\n\nJust make it a point to become better at it whenever you have time.\n\nTop comedians: George Carlin, Dave Chapelle, Dave Attell, Joe Rogan, etc. never feel good enough.\n\nI am too lazy to find videos that back this up.\n\nThe advice "believe in yourself" might work for some people. Others are motivated by chronic fear of fucking up. Many of these people live to see an old age and have moderately happy lives.\n
12	What is your ideal other half?	I’m just curious how other ENTJs perceive their ideal other half to be. Please indicate your gender if possible since it may affect your preference. Would be great if you can share any real experience from your dating life to help me and others see how you come to the answer as well :)
26	27m The hardest part of dealing with the opposite sex is holding a conversation that is worth the air it took to have it. I like aggression, strength, creativity, resourcefulness, and a primal drive to go get what you want. 
17	I’m a male ENTJ and the ideal woman that I’d like is someone I can create an empire with, someone that works as hard as I do, someone I can become rich with and have a ton of adventures with. That’s exactly what I’m working towards. 
12	Words wouldn’t do it justice. It is and always will be a pure gut feel.
7	28F, lesbian. \nI am very attracted to women who are accomplished, whether it’s by being really brainy, really talented as a performer, really successful at their career, etc. But I also seem to get along well with women who are sort of introverted and more laid back than me. It’s hard to say exactly what I want, because I haven’t had any really fulfilling relationships yet in my life. \n\nI’ll tell you what I WON’T date: People who believe in conspiracy theories or sell MLM products. People who waste their time on “basic” cultural things such as the Kardashians. People who don’t present well in public (if you respect yourself, you should pay attention to how you dress, etc.) I also don’t like people who are self-centered. 
5	22M - Independence, sense of humor, well spoken, caring, hard-working, intelligent, happy, respectful, and of course, being a total babe.
6	23f. Not that I need to be serviced but a partner that constantly inspires me and accepts me in all my moments seems to be my most sought after attributes. Late night intellectual talks would be the cherry on top. 
7	33F. Someone who compensates for my weakness, who understands feelings better than I do. \n\nSomeone who is good, and kind, and able to hold both a logical and theoretical conversation. \n\nSomeone who is good at explaining to me when I’m over working, doing too much. \n\nHe isn’t a workhorse. He is both logical and emotional. He is kind and understanding, and in 7 years he has never gotten overly cross. He is smart and understands my drive. He is a good counterbalance for that. He has his own hobbies and passions and will tell me about them, but knows I would rather be building another business than a coffee table. But he makes a damn fine coffee table. \n\nAnywho, thanks Mister. 
6	Late 20s, male.\n\n\n* Not too extroverted. I don’t want to be dragged into random social events instead of hanging out with people I actually like.\n\n* Is intelligent and has some sort of ambition beyond working a minimum wage job or being a stay-at-home mom. I don’t want to be completely responsible for financially supporting a partner, especially when we started dating.\n\n* Someone I can have meaningful conversations with that don’t revolve around trivialities such as sports teams or the weather.\n\n* Someone I can share my niche hobbies with such as modern board games. \n\n* Can’t be clingy, especially when there are trying to drag me away from meeting friends. Many of my friends complain about having a hard time being social due to existing relationships, and that sounds awful.\n\n\n\nThere are probably many other qualities I’m not listing here. I’m quite bad at figuring out what I want. Until I was 20, I thought relationships were a pointless social construct and didn’t attempt to date any girls I was attracted to.\n\n\n
3	That girl in the train.
8	23, uh... let's go with male for now I guess. I think my ideal other half would be intelligent, independent and driven; it doesn't need to be extreme, but I love it when people have ambitions. Not clingy either, as I would imagine we'd both be busy. No desire for kids or pets, and I'm alright with the prospect of an open relationship if that's what they'd want. I could roll with either!\n\nSince we're going with ideals, I'd love to have a SO that could sing so we could harmonise. That's super fun.\n\nI see a perfect relationship as being less of a relationship and more of a partnership -  a team. We'd help each other achieve our goals. And then chill out together when we can.
3	M. I would want a person that is very forward and driven person. If they were sucessful in thier career that would be very nice. They need to be nice and caring as well. 
6	17M. I'd say, basically, an sterotypical XNFP, hopefully the girl is apolitical and at least deist/agnostic on religious terms. I'm quite spiritual for an ENTJ, so being in a relationship with an atheist girl would be weird.
3	23 female here. I often see my ideal partner as someone very honest and committed to whatever they want in life. I like people who assume full responsibility for themselves and their actions.\n\nDeeply dislike people who can't take commitment seriously, people who are indecisive, manipulative and self serving in general.
3	25F\n\n1. I’m okay with not having a partner.\n\n2. I don’t have an ideal PERSON in mind but I do have an ideal RELATIONSHIP in mind. \n\n3. I don’t want qualities I’ve already mastered—instead I want to learn and grow with and from my partner. \n\n4. I want my partner to compliment not add to what I already bring to the table. \n\n5. I’m not worried I’ll end up with my “not” ideal partner because just being with me would weed out everyone but the greatest possible person. \n\n6. Reference point number 1. \n\n
2	22M, I know a bit long but I think when used correctly effective to attract other girls with my member.
2	21 M, Uhhh moderately attractive or higher, highly intelligent, someone that can have interesting conversations for hours and call me on my bullshit. Someone kind, who wants to have a family someday but also challenges me to new adventures and new ways of looking at the world. Most importantly, someone as ambitious and passionate as I am.
2	22M \nShe is smarter than I am, She is compassionate but not clingy, She doesn’t put up with my bullshit, She is disciplined in her work, She has an incredible sense of humor, She is meticulous in everything she does, She flaunts her weaknesses and hides her strengths, She knows how to deal with my family better than I do, She cooks like an angel, She’s a beast between the sheets, She is a wholesome partner in the empire we build together, She fits into my jagged life like a puzzle piece\n\nBut above all else,\nShe is humble
2	20m. For me, someone I can respect. That's the kind of genuine respect that I only have for a select few. Selfless but vigilant and not naive. Interested in people. Able to articulate herself. Does stuff. Takes interest in some of my quirks and interests. Notices stuff about you that others don't. Someone I also have to earn the respect of, and also someone I can learn from. 
0	22M- Fitness is a must. I don’t think I’ll ever waver on that. Physically: Dark hair preferred, medium to large eyes(doey), a nice fit body and nice lips. \n\nEverything else: She must be nurturing, no baggage, GREAT FAMILY STRUCTURE AND LIFE. Mentally sound. Intellectually sound. Honestly think Adrian from Rocky. That’s how her temperament should be
0	27m here. In a girl ideally honestly a really good stay at home mom but I'd want her to have some passions or goals she wants to meet. As well as be supportive towards what I want to accomplish. \n\nThough depending on when I find her the stay at home mom can change. I already have three kids so I don't care if she wants more or doesn't. But we need to have quite a few similar interests as well as she has to be able to have her own opinion and not just be part of the crowd.
11	Do people open up to you?	Recently, I have noticed that people find it easy to tell me their secrets and im not entirely sure why because these same people say that I can come across as cold and uncaring..
15	The greatest actor isn’t the one who gets caught in the act...\nQuite the opposite actually; he somehow convinces people that he’s a bad actor, then continues to play the part with perfection.\n\nHow’s that for cold? \n\nJust because you seem like being cold doesn’t mean you’re one. Just like being an ENTJ doesn’t mean you always don’t care about things. You do care. ENTJs actually care very deeply, but they optimise what they care for. That power is something none can take away from you. \n\nOn the surface we seem like different people, ENTJs don’t necessarily seem cold from the outside, they can see jolly, they can seem serious or mellow, but that depends on which parts of you has someone seen you in, without knowing you that is. \n\nENTJs try to find a loyal friend for whatever happens.\n\nLoyalty = #1 \nENTJs can put up with their other bullshit if this major jump is taken care of. \n\nYou probably should try and see if they ones who are telling you this stuff  are truly loyal. \n\nI use this as a test...every now and then when I meet a new person and kind of develop a rapport with...I tell them a secret. Not the gravest, just a couple of levels or three below platonic so that even if it happens to spread (which most of the time it does) you’ll know if you’d want to abide in that mate again. You’ll be careful. \n\nYou don’t always need maths to figure shit out, you need to throw these small nuggets of info outside. Even if you never went through anything, make up some shit and send that information across as far as it doesn’t hurt you in a way. Then wait until you hear it again. And trust me, if your secret is spilled it’ll come back to you. \n\nMaybe not in hours or days, maybe in months, but it’ll come back to you. Someone will come and ask you \n\n“OMG, I didn’t know you liked <enter whatever>” \n\nThen you’d know who you told it to. \n\nBeyond this point, I become the actor. I can very easily catch on their whims, people get sloppy each and every time they meet you, from eye movements to tone of voice to other things. You don’t necessarily have to break with them, you can keep them in your company. Just that you should be careful. \n\nIt’s the little details that people miss that end up killing them later on. The smallest of things that seem like they don’t matter actually make up that person. That’s called judging. But keep an open mind...not everyone is that way. 
8	Maybe because of the fact that we are objective in the way we deal with feelings or secrets and find no pleasure in revealing things that don’t benefit us?
6	The thing about cold and uncaring is that it's also nonjudgmental and objective, not to mention the fact that cold and uncaring people do not typically hang around the water cooler telling everyone's secrets. I find that a lot of my friends trust me with many of their secrets, many of significant gravity. They trust me with them precisely because I'm not going to condemn them and shame them, and I am capable of offering objective advice or observations without being preachy and without them fearing that I'm going to gossip about it afterwards.\n\nAs a friend, the ENTJ makes one hell of a confidante. 
6	They always do. I am big on keeping confidence. I remember being at a house party years ago. It was the dead of winter and this was an every Friday night kind of thing. I step outside to have a smoke and one by one other guests would come outside for a bit and tell me things they did not want other people at the party to know. I listened politely; kept what they said private but wondered why they were telling me all this.
6	It's complicated. People don't really open up to me much probably because (i) they don't really see me as a resource for emotional support and (ii) they feel like I'm not really phased by or impressed with scandal, which lies at the heart of most secrets. That said, people know they can trust me and that I'm conscientious. As a result, for a long time, I've felt like those around me have turned to me for support when they've felt like they couldn't really trust their closer peers or when they've felt like others of their peers couldn't really handle the depth of their concerns.\n\nI remember when I graduated from junior high in 2006, one of my friend's dad pulled me aside at a graduation party and thanked me for being a steady rock for my friend (i.e., his daughter) throughout tough times. I was super surprised at the time because I felt like all I had really done was listen to her talk on the phone maybe two times for a couple minutes and just be her friend more generally, but I suppose that can mean a lot to a junior-high-schooler. Another one of my friends told me she had gotten an abortion years beforehand and that she hadn't told anyone in her family, all the members of which I knew. Others informed me they were experiencing suicidal ideation. Etc. Moreover, guys tend to open up less than girls, but even so, many of my guy friends have told me some of their more controversial political or social beliefs, their regrets, or some of their other concerns. I suspect they don't tell all of their friends the things they've told me.\n\nStill, people don't very often come to saying things like, "Oh my god, don't tell anyone, but I cheated on my boyfriend!"
2	Kind of said in other comments. But the cold part is because we care about certain thing and we don't usually care for venting but problem solving. Let's say you see a hobo. Chances are you'll make the comment he needs to get a job versus feing sorry as much. You say something that seems mean to someone but they think you're just being mean. But you're saying it because you care and want them to fix it.\n\nWe are typically blunt when it went hurt us. Which could be seen as being mean or caring like I stated earlier. But I don't know about all entjs people to confide in me really quick and also let me know they feel very safe and trusting of me for some reason though I can't explain why. Maybe we have some kind of aura we give off.
2	Yep! I always figured my face somewhere said "tell me your secrets and problems," I never considered it was an ENTJ thing.
2	The people that open up to me are the ones who don't feel comfortable opening up to ENFJs
1	Maybe you're running into too many entp's
13	What are your jobs?	I was just wondering what jobs you entj's have, what do you like about them and what don't you like? I thought I could get some insperation from this.
10	Project manager for a software engineering team. I like managing people, I don't like people making excuses and the stress of clients changing on a whim. 
10	College professor. Lots of my colleagues are ENTJs also, it's a good fit for us as nobody is telling us what to do and we get to be in charge most of the time.
11	I’m currently a laborer for a high end construction company. Before you say “no way he’s an entj!” I’m only 18. It’s only up from here. \nI love the consistency of the hours and the hard work that gets me in shape and the experience I’m getting but I’m also the bottom rung on the ladder and since the projects are high risk and very precise I don’t get to do much permanent work.
5	I'm a journalist covering state-level politics. It's really interesting most days because I get to learn new things and because I really enjoy writing. It can be stressful because I have daily deadlines, and every day I have to start from scratch. Also, the material can be really emotionally heavy and frankly disturbing. I would say it's worth it because I get to write every day, but it's not without its drawbacks. I'd rather be doing this than pushing paper in a government job or food or retail service. Good luck in your search OP! I hope you are able to find something you really enjoy doing.
6	Data Scientist for a fantasy football website.\n\nIt's great, it's my dream job. I spend all day doing the things I was doing for fun while I procrastinated school work.\n\nOne thing that's interesting from a personality standpoint is that it's entirely remote - I work from home. Everyone seems to love this, and I actually kind of don't. I certainly appreciate not commuting, but I sort of miss having a reason to shower and get dressed, and I find it a lot harder to stay on task than when I worked in an office. The fact that I work and relax in the same chair at the same computer makes it easy for those things to blend together. Also dealing with different time zones is kind of annoying.
5	Own a small business. Manage 22 employees, deal with customers and vendors, and am slowly getting it across that everyone better come to me with facts and not feelings. \n\nAlso doing a start up because my current business, while successful, has become less of a challenge. Oh, also finishing my MBA. \n\nI obviously don’t like to be idle. 
6	Legal consulting 
4	I run a business for a multinational company. 
4	I’m an artist. Love working for myself, love setting my own standards and goals, and love challenging the notion that its impossible to make a living this way. 
4	M&A lawyer. There isn’t much about my job that is particularly likeable. It’s the worst aspects of most jobs put together - requires minute attention to detail, perfection 100% of the time, it’s highly technical, highly regulated as to what you can and can’t do, incredibly high stakes (even for mundane tasks), global so you work all hours, deadlines are unrealistic and it’s a service job so you have to deal with unreasonable demands of unhelpful customers (clients). 
2	Product and growth manager
2	Director of Quality Management in a metropolitan hospital 
2	I teach high school! AP classes mostly, but I have 1 freshmen class this year, yknow, to keep things interesting.
2	Commercial/residential painter. 
2	I still fall in the recent-graduate category, but I've been doing work as an analyst for the federal government, and I'm transitioning over into cybersecurity. My plan is to become a CSO and then leverage my successes and contributions into beginning a career in politics. At this point, I will carry out a plan to take over the whole government and make myself dictator and then finally take over the world.
1	I’ve worn several hats, actually. I studied political science for my undergrad, ended up in supply chain, then finance and now doing travel compliance for a federal contractor. Currently studying project management as I enjoy efficiency, scheduling, people and process. :)
1	Software developer
1	I’m a software Developer for a startup and my manager had already told me that I should’ve taken up roles such as Business Dev and etc cause he sees me being more of a Product Manager in the future and told me that Product Managers generally go on to be CEOs eventually. \n\nAlthough I do believe in what he said but I can call a bluff when I see one. I’m certain he was sugarcoating things just to get me to do Business Dev work fulltime. I told him right on that I applied for Software Dev, I want to develop this part cause I’m not good at it yet, so he did just that. 
1	Fashion photographer, working both with editorial and commercial clients. People often are impressed by how I built my business all on my own and ”made it”, which is funny to me because I never saw any other possible outcome. Also, refining my craft and learning new things to get better than my competition is one of the most rewarding things I know. 
1	I'm a Technical Writer. I like writing end user hardware and software documents that are easy-to-use, are trustworthy, and don't waste time. 
1	Another owner of a small business and makeup artist in my free time.
1	Just graduated high school, now getting an economics degree before running for office.
1	Product manager at an ecommerce company. Currently responsible for fraud and security. I get bored easily so the occupation suits me where I get to lead a team and the projects change quite frequently
1	Real estate Sales
1	Counselor and teacher (psychology courses through a couple different avenues)
1	Mortgage loan originator/real estate developer.. I’m only 20 years old with no degree. 
1	Due diligence for M&A transaction services. 
1	Brand management in a multinational consumer goods company
1	On track to be an attorney who handles civil litigation 
10	Does any other ENTJs have issues with supporting their SO when it comes to bad news?	I am a 30M ENTJ and my girlfriend is a 28F INFP. She was diagnosed back in 2015 with a rare condition called ossifying fibroma. Basically its a condition where a non-cancerous tumor appears in the jawbone and, if untreated, can take over your mouth. The only treatment at the moment is to surgically remove the tumor but it has a chance to come back. In 2015, she had the surgery and lost a few of her back teeth.\n\nFast-forward to a few weeks ago and she finds out it came back. She was scheduled for surgery again, but it ended up getting postponed because it was discovered it appeared on the other side of her mouth. This time, she may need part of the nasal area removed to ensure the tumor is gone. She can still get reconstructive surgery and implants.\n\nWhen she found out, she was devastated. I tried to support her by getting her focused on what she could actually do about it (which isnt much) but it wasnt enough. She told me she had to call her dad (who is ENFP) for support.\n\nThat was rough for me although I know I am not very good with words or emotional support in bad news situations. \n\nDoes anyone else have this issue and if so, what techniques work for you to come off more F in those situations?
17	Somet the best way to fix things is to stop trying to fix things and just show those we care for how we feel. \n\nThere's a scene in Snow White where no matter how hard Dopey tries to grab the soap it slips out of his hands. The bar of soap is wet and so the harder he squeezes the faster it gets thrown out of his control until eventually he ends up accidentally swallowing it making the soap impossible to grab.\n\nIn this analogy we are Dopey, trying to fix the problem, the soap, but the more we try the more things fall apart because a gentle touch is needed as opposed to a full grip. If we continue to try to pressure a fix when we need to be supportive then the situation will eventually results in swallowing the soap, the problem can no longer be fixed at all because of our pressuring, and we are worse off than if we had just let things be.\n\nBut yes I have trouble with this.
9	Just be there. We ENTJ types will want to fix the issue.... but as we don't have the skill the best thing to do is be there. If she knows you, she will know you care. Ask if she needs something from you. The best I can say is 'Show' \nYes it is hard for us. My younger brother just passed and while everyone else cried I organized and made sure every memorial was right. My caring was doing and making things easier for the rest. \nJust be there 
4	Speaking as an E/INFP same as what these guys say. Just be there. Take care of the little things (housework, cooking, etc). Tell her you’re there for her and you know she can do this. Do things without being asked and all that jazz. \n\nAs you say, give her the options and rationalise the problem when she does want to talk about it, but don’t give advice or directions.\n\nThings will always be alright in the end, and if they’re not alright, it’s not the end.
4	[deleted]
4	Constantly have this problem. \n\nMy personal solution is to become hyper aware of it. I communicate with my SO, and he now tells me flat out if he wants help fixing it or just wants support. With people who I’m not as close with, I frequently ask if they want help fixing it or if they just want me to listen. They answer and then I know what my role is and am better able to comply. 
1	I've never had a SO so I can't speak to that, but I have had a hard time supporting my close friends after bad news. When I was in college, one of my best friends who lived elsewhere broke her ankle or something like that, so shortly thereafter she called me to tell me what had happened, and the first thing I said was: "Awesome! Now that you've taken a leave of absence from school, you can come visit me here in Los Angeles!" She was hurt at first because she felt like I didn't display enough empathy for her. But I reminded her that the excitement I showed over her being able to visit me was my way of showing her I much I care about her. \n\nI guess I just try to make sure my friends and loved ones understand the way I support them, which undoubtedly must seem strange to a lot of people. 
4	[Question] What do you do when you have multiple project ideas but benefit from focusing and mastering 1 thing at a time?	I know what I want to do, though whilst that's in progress, I find my business-brain and project-seeking mind always looks for more to do even though I know I'm at my best when I focus on mastery.\n\nAs an example, I enjoy art but as soon as I think of it, my mind wonders how to turn it into a business or a project I can make a profit with or share with others. When I was younger, my step dad ran and owned his own business and I embedded a seed of entrepreneurship in my mind to learn from him. Do any of you guys experience the same feelings and what do you do to keep yourself focused and on track, especially for long-term goals?\n\nAny thoughts appreciated, it's not a dire issue but a discussion I thought to raise nonetheless as it could be interesting to hear what people do to design a lifestyle focused on the mastery of their craft.\n\nThanks.
5	Inspiration and time management. Don’t burn energy on a project that requires you to be inspired when you’re not, this just leads to frustration and ineffectiveness. Balance your projects around priorities and then spend time on them each when you’re in the corresponding mode.
1	Your projects will be either duty or passion. For the passionate affairs you can only output the very best when your heart and mind are in it, if you have to alter your perception to focus on it then you are cheapening the desired goal. Don’t compromise just because you’re impatient, scattered focus isn’t necessarily a weakness, it may be how you’re mind works, so if that’s the case why fight against it when you can embrace it as an advantage? Jumping around to different projects gives your mind a break and a source for more stimulation and inspiration. 
1	Steve Jobs did drugs before he found his way in life.
4	Is your mom, dad or guardian an ENTJ?	Just curious if anyone had/has an ENTJ parent or guardian that may have guided them to be an ENTJ. It's my mom for me, my dad is defintiely ISTP! 
5	Mom is ENFP, and dad (I think) is ISTJ. Maybe I took EN from my mom and TJ from my dad?\n\nI think it's more likely that I was a weird, freakish kid, and I emerged out of that as an ENTJ of my own accord.
3	ESTJ mother, IxTP father. In functions tests I get highest Te followed by high Ti, so maybe. My mother and I are very similar, but that Si-Ne/Ni-Se makes for clash of the titans when we disagree about how to do something.
3	In my case, no. I have great parents but I'm fairly sure they're not ENTJs. I realise this doesn't help much, but figured I'd answer for the sake of having more data!
2	mom's a narcissist and dad used to beat us down (mentally and physically), so my parents 'guided' me, but not how you described.
2	nope, but my dad is clearly an INTx. in my case, i had all my childhood experiences through books and literature, reading about things instead of experiencing them. i personally cultivated my personality from INTP to ENTP. i can't tell how i became ENTJ, but i suspect that my P tendencies were due to youth and naturally faded over the years
2	Moms ISFJ and Father is ENTJ and I may have landed in the middle at INTJ. Although I’m still not convinced that I’m not an ENTJ who is just really lazy. (According to me anyways, my SO and friends tell me I’m not. They also tell me I’m smart all the time and I don’t believe that either.)\n\nSo hard to tell if Ni or Te is my dominate function.
1	Dad and brother are both intj.  I get the e from my momma 
1	AFAIK my parents have never taken tests, but I am certain my mom is ENTJ. If I had to guess, my dad is probably INFJ.
1	dad INTJ mom INFP little sister INTP im the black sheep yo 
1	Mom ISTP. Brother INTJ
13	How have you gone about finding your passion?	All the successful people seem to have found their passion, it feels like each day in my life is a waste of time since I havn't found mine. It's really stressing for me, especially when you're an ENTJ since we want to have a grip on everything. Right now I dont have a grip, it feels like I'm sleepwalking and getting nothing done. When I get stuff done it feels unessecary because I'm doing things that isn't going to improve my career. Do you feel like you have found your passion/purpose in life? How did you do it?\n\nEdit: This is what makes me crazy about this whole passion thing. Everyone says different things about it. One person says that finding your passion is your entire lifes mission, one person says that you shouldn't follow your passion, another person says that you have try out different stuff. What should I believe?
11	Read 'so good they can't ignore you'
11	Finding your passion and purpose should be your passion itself in this phase of your life. 
5	Step one: stop trying to make yourself happy and focus on improving other people's lives.  "Finding your passion" is some kind of my Little pony BS.\n\nStep two: when you have a chance to do something, do it. Don't engage in analysis paralysis. Just go do it. Accept failure.  Seek it out!\n\nIf you do those two things, you will stumble into something you are truly passionate about without looking for it, which is the only way this kind of thing happens. 
6	exploring new things and reading job descriptions
4	When I try new activities, I usually feel like I know deep inside how should I do it properly. You can become passionate about almost anything. Try for example handcrafting. One of my passions is blacksmithing and because it is a physical activity as well as an artistic one, it really calms my nerves and helps me to relax while making something worthwhile. 
3	It's taken me a little while, but I feel like I'm finally zeroing in on my purpose. Do you have a good grasp on what your unique strengths are? That's a good place to start.   \n\n\nAlso, it's a bit time consuming, but it can be immensely illuminating to sit down and reflect on all your past jobs, relationships, friendships, and living situations in order to articulate what you liked most about them and what you liked least. After that you play around and try to find patterns and themes in each area. You might be surprised at what you unearth. 
3	I got lucky, I figured it out by the 2nd semester of college, in a somewhat serendipitous manner. My advice would be to try out a bunch of stuff I guess. How old are you?  
3	My belief, and I too over-ruminated and got mired in the swamp in the back of my mind, is to just do shit that's fun, and when you finally find something you can do that doesn't get boring after 6 months, that's the passion you are trying to find.\n\nWhen I say do things, I don't mean go on a bender, but try guitar, paint, rock-climb, follow politics, coach a soccer team, do a youtube channel, etc, etc, etc.\n\nThe trick is to find the thing that you love enough to push through the grindy crappy parts. That becomes your passion, not the winning or the dollars or the scorecard.\n\nPeople for whom "playing guitar" is their passion got there through the 100,000 hours of mindnumbing practice, and because of it.\n\nSame for dancers, or chefs, or computer programmers.
3	Found my passion via deep, deep self-awareness, reflection, turning wounds to wisdom and learning. Writing a book about it now, to help others do it quicker. Any ENTJ publishers out there?
2	Yes. I have always gone in the direction of jobs and careers that interest me. They are varied and short-lived, usually no more than two years. I advise you to do the same and equally important, take this next piece of advice. Listen to the feedback that older people give you. In my life, they have been the ones to correctly identify my strengths that will best suit me for the long run and my deficits that could destroy me if left unabated. Older people also pointed out that I should go into teaching. Eventually that is what I did. I am entering my 14th year as a teacher.
2	Oof, I can really sympathize with this one.\n\nI didn't really have any of my shit together until I was about 22. I sort of figured things would work themselves out and basically lived my life on autopilot until I joined my current company. My eyes were opened to what the outside world is really like and how you **can** end up broke and homeless if you don't take your work seriously.\n\nFrom ages 22 to present (25), I racked my brain to figure out what my passions are. Every time I thought I had something, I realized I would fall out of it quickly and I wouldn't consider it to be something I felt "passionate" about. Traveling, food, all that generic stuff didn't work despite me actually doing a lot of both.\n\nIt sort of just hit me as I was coming close to my 25th birthday - the things I did on a daily basis were the things I felt passionate about. I handle a few different types of work at my office, which I have found to be something I love because it gives me a sense of freshness in my day-to-day work. I would always try to find the best way to do something, which then made me aware of how much I love optimizing the things that I do (even on a personal level).\n\nSo here I am now, 25 and still no concrete answer as to what my passion for work is. But I don't really think that matter anymore, because I don't think I need to find a specific industry that I'm passionate about. I'm passionate about a lot of different subject and industries, so picking one won't work. Instead, I like to focus on my passion for the actual type of work that I do. Can I get paid to optimize things in my company and manage a bunch of different projects that change every so often? Great - sign me up!\n\nHope this was of some help to you. I know how irritating it can be to get nowhere even though you put your mind to it to solve the problem. Just figure out the kind of work you like doing first, and hope it can help lead you to your passion.
2	This might sound like a cop out answer but I think enjoying something you do is a lot more of a mindset than a passion. Anything you do will become work eventually if you become a professional. \n\nAs an ENTJ you probably like to feel challenged so find a career where you get challenged in your arena, whether that’s with people and debate, logic, or something more physical.\n\nAlso don’t make the mistake of thinking everyone has one passion in life. There have been many people who did desk jobs that became famous writers. There have also been athletes that studied philosophy or art. Fostering a growth mindset of habit forming and dedication is more important than what you choose (in my humble opinion).
2	If you would make a tattoo or have one, what would it be?	
8	[deleted]
4	I'd only have tattoo in one situation, if i had a child that died. I'd tattoo their name. Other than that I'd never do it. 
3	
2	Thought about it at one point.  Then realized most things are fads and I don't want something like that forever.
1	i have a wolf armband and an arrow in the other arm 
1	Something from the following instagram artists:\n\n * [matthewnuttalltattoo](https://www.instagram.com/matthewnuttalltattoo/?hl=en), favorite piece: [[1]](https://www.instagram.com/p/BjNhbc3H6xn/?hl=en&taken-by=matthewnuttalltattoo)\n * [natalienox](https://www.instagram.com/natalienox/?hl=en), favorite pieces: [[1]](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bk5qq0KhrVy/?taken-by=natalienox) [[2]](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bi7cmUTBh8X/?taken-by=natalienox)\n * (maybe) [sashaunisex](https://www.instagram.com/sashaunisex/?hl=en), favorite pieces: all of them\n\nOverall tho, a big fan of the sketch/abstract tattoo pieces (or [trash polka](https://www.google.com/search?q=trash+polka+tattoos&client=opera&hs=1sK&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiX35KDgu3cAhXRtlkKHSw8D_wQ_AUICigB&biw=1707&bih=1060)) more than I am of clean lines.

I don't know yet which style I'll be happier with in the long term, but once I have the extraneous income I'm going to be pretty serious about my tattoos. They'll all flow with each other; I'm just not a fan of standalone tattoos or ones that seem ~~random~~ without intention.\n\nEdit: I'm pretty adamant about having a tattoo sleeve [made of book spines](https://www.google.com/search?client=opera&hs=zF0&biw=1707&bih=1060&tbm=isch&sa=1&ei=5gpzW7a0C5Hz5gLgi62YAQ&q=book+spines+drawn&oq=book+spines+drawn&gs_l=img.3..0.6624.7140.0.7223.6.5.0.0.0.0.170.514.2j2.4.0....0...1.1.64.img..2.4.506...0i30k1j0i8i30k1j0i24k1.0.c-kXAx7-0f0) with books (or author names) that were formative of my worldview.
1	tattoos are degenerate  for the most part I think 
1	i have a few most of them i designed myself, two are drafting related with golden ratio and drafting measurements on the other.  But the boxing mitts above the bits, is perfect\n\nJust find what you think is cool and find a good tattooer and your gonna get a good tattoo. its pretty simple. "good is good forever"
1	A Donatello headband from TMNT around my right bicep.  My day one boi.  Have a few additional ones planned:\nStar Fleet Delta (Star Trek) on my chest.\nWolffe Pack (SW Clone Wars) shoulder pad on my right shoulder.\nAnd trying to find a good Green Day tat.\n
0	What is the best way to meet an ENTJ. The only time I met a few was on a boat scubadiving. The problem is... I am in New York. Where do ENTJ people go in New York!!	To be read with a sarcastic tone. But seriously, where? I am an INTJ female
11	You don’t find them. They find you.
9	Get on tinder and put on your bio, "INTJ looking for an ENTJ. Super like me if you are one. " lmao. \n\nYou miss 100% of the shots you dont take :)
12	ENTJ is a personality type, not a hobby. ENTJs are everywhere, like every other type.
3	There are more of them above the water.
3	When I’m in NYC I’m usually in The Ramble with a book or randomly exploring on foot. 
2	I work on a sailboat in New York so I guess the short answer is boat related places. \n\nThere are plenty of quirky social things we do here. New York has a ridiculous niche for everyone and great opportunities to experience cool shit with random people. Plenty of bars to meet people at too. \n\nIn my three years here I learned it’s a city where you really have to be able to shoot the shit for a bit before actually getting anywhere in a conversation, but we’re out there among the 8 million. 
2	I'm ENTJ and my BF of a year is INTJ :) this has been my favorite pair to date. We met on an app and clicked instantly. Tbh I don't think he would have frequented the same places as me but that's part of it, we've introduced each other to new worlds of interest.
7	Estj vs entj	I have a couple of questions.\n\n-Which one tends to be goofier?\n\n-which one tends to be rebellious in the sense if a rule doesnt make sense they will question or break it?\n\n-which one likes to just do what they want and not be told what to do?
16	ENTJs are more intuitive, which means they are more likely to innovate, to break the rules if they appear to them as not justified anymore. \n\nI wouldn't say "do what they want", I'd say "do what's best/more logical". It's painfully hard to do something stupid just because you are told to or because we've always done this way. But as an ENTJ, I often do things I don't want to do, because I think it's the right thing to do from a morale/efficience/logical viewpoint. For instance, I hate cleaning up, but it's logical to clean up, so I do it without any more questioning. 
15	ESTJ’s definitely have a silly side but that’s once you get past the seriousness. They can be big kids. \n\nI had an ESTJ ex that would reach in and sneak turn the shower to cold when I was shampooing my hair then continue brushing his teeth like he didn’t know anything. \n\nENTJ’s humor is...more flat in delivery but really, really subtle wit. \n\nWhile camping I told an ENTJ that it takes me a really long time to fall asleep and I wish I could fall asleep fast like others do...to which he deadpan replied, “better get started then.” \n\nBoth are fun. \n\n\n\n
4	I would say ESTJ could be goofier. And your two other questions - ENTJ
2	ESTJs tend to be goofier because tertiary Ne. But if we take Socionics in consideration, then ENTjs also can be, if they have the Ni subtype.
1	I'm dating an ESTJ right now and she is goofy, but I think I'm a lot more goofy. I can get deadly serious, really fast, but when I'm just chilling out I find that I say and do silly things all the time. \n\nI'll let you know how things go. I do really enjoy her though, she talks just as much as I do and sometimes I need to step away and recharge my battery. She'll tell me all about her day and things in the "here and now" where I find myself constantly talking about the future and the end-game. \n\nWe're both great planners, but I do see a pattern where she's looking at the trees and I'm looking at the forest. 
11	What's your favorite Harvey Specter quote?	For all the Suits fans here, what are some of your favorite quotes from the most badass ENTJ on television?
19	I don’t get lucky. I make my own luck.
5	Harvey is such a bad ass. 
7	Life is like this _ ; I like this -.\n\nGet it through your head - you start behind the eight ball, you're never gonna get in front.\n\nLoyalty is a two way street. If I'm asking for it from you, then you're getting it from me.
2	“Fight one more round. When your feet are so tired that you have to shuffle back to the centre of the ring, fight one more round. When your arms are so tired that you can hardly lift your hands to come on guard, fight one more round. When your nose is bleeding and your eyes are black and you are so tired you wish your opponent would crack you one on the jaw and put you to sleep, fight one more round – remembering that the man who always fights one more round is never whipped.”
2	I don’t agree with typing him as ENTJ though... he strikes me as an Introvert - that‘s quite obvious! \nAnd the most badass ENTJ on television is Frank Underwood from House of Cards, imo.
5	ENTJ for hire [meta]	Seems that there's lots of people that want free advice or consultation. I'm not sure on the rules of reddit, but I'm sure in exchange for "donations" we'd be more motivated to actually help others. Perhaps another sub, /r/ENTJ4Hire or something, but really, no one would want to pay, haha. I can definitely see that some questions/posts are looking for help are easily answered, but the time to handhold for nothing in return makes me bitter and frustrated. I think really though, many of us are on here to dick around and engage on fun conversations or whatever. 
8	I mean im down to help others when ever for the good karmas 
2	What gives value to your specific advice? How many TED talks have you done? How many courses?\n\nIts easy to say you want to be paid for your time, but its even easier to just ignore content you don't want to reply to.\n\nThat'll be $3.50 pls
2	I honestly don't know why, maybe bitter/frustrated might be the wrong word, maybe more like seeing those posts makes me feel "eye-rolly" or "like really"? No idea what that feeling/word is atm. 
1	Create that sub! Maybe it work
7	Can an "E" change to an "I" as we age?	Hi everybody,\nTests after tests have shown me that I'm an ENTJ and that I share many traits of a typical ENTJ: controlling, competitive, goal-oriented, intuitive, logical, rude/blunt, arrogant, etc.\n\nHowever, after graduation, when I started working for about 2 years now, as my job involves meeting a lot of people, I usually got exhausted at the end of the day and prefer spending time alone at home reading book or watching movie alone. During the weekend, I also prefer doing light activities or stay at home reading books.\nMy life is hectic so that means I often need to work at home during the weekend as well. Meeting strangers during non-work hours is usually a chore to me and so is dating.\nThis gets me thinking if I'm an "E", am I supposed to gain energy socialising instead of spending time alone? Or have I been converted to an "I" instead?
4	Both "E"s and "I"s can get worn out by social interaction, just like both can get lonely. I don't think you are suddenly an "I", I think you are probably just getting enough social interaction through your job, and need the time to recharge.\n\nI think the SIMS games really got this right. There is a social interaction meter.  When it is full you feel good, when it is overfull you start to want to be alone, when it is empty, you start to feel like you want to see people. I am an "I", and when I had a job which involved meeting a lot of people, I wanted to quit, every. single. day.  I still interact with people at work, but not as much (maybe 2 hours a day), and I still need to spend some time by myself when I get home. I could probably go comfortably for a week or more without seeing anyone and be totally cool with that.
5	I received 51% E over I, so ever so slightly am I more extroverted..though I get good energy from people..I muuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuust have my alone time..or else!\n\nI feel as though we would answer differently to the questions as we age through different life circumstances.\n\nPerhaps we are just able to switch on and off as need be..jack of both trades?
2	[deleted]
2	Introversion or extroversion is a core part of your personality and doesn’t change as you get older. However, many people are placed into situations where they end up acting contrary to their personality type. Or they may act outwardly different.\n\n\nFor example, as a kid, I seemed like the stereotypical introvert and did end up testing as one. The issue was that I ended up adopting an introverted personality, and it took me a long time to realize I hated being alone. From past experience being forced to work from home, even during normal business hours would make me want to quit.\n\n\nIt’s hard to tell, but I think you are an introvert who is mistyped. You tend to avoid social engagements outside of work in order to recharge, which sounds like introvert behavior. An extrovert would look forward to at least some socializing on weekends.
1	Depends on the other 3 letters, there's a huge difference for I & E for xSFP or xSFJ but not much for xNTJ or XNFP.
1	Just remember " **I before E**, **except after C."** 
3	How willing are you to compromise or change yourself for an ideal partner if you had a character trait that he or she finds off putting?	Please answer any number of the following questions, ideally all of them but I understand 5 may be too many. These questions are to understand how ENTJs think and behave. By ideal partner, I mean someone who meets all your standards, so picture that person, real or imaginary, when answering these questions.\n\n1. How willing are you to compromise or change yourself for an ideal partner if you had a character trait that he or she finds off putting?\n2. How important is having a beautiful partner to you? Essentially, how shallow are you?\n3. If you met someone who is gorgeous, intelligent and driven, or replace any of the adjectives with ones that describe your ideal partner, would you be intimidated and if so how intimidated? How would you go about approaching them?\n4. If you were rejected by your ideal partner, how would you react? Obviously, no one enjoys rejection, but if and how much would you be affected?\n5. How long does it take for you to trust your partner enough to get shit done? To be vulnerable emotionally?
5	1) yes, if it means improving myself, no if it's related to irrational expectations from my partner.\n\n2) it's not important, the mindset, the feeling of proximity, intelligence are way more fundamental. That's a strange question btw. \n\n3) Surprising/original. ENTJs are not easily intimidated. I can be speechless if I see somebody I admire a lot for his/her talent, but it's one in a million. \n\n4) I'd try to understand what went wrong, the logics behind this failure.\n\n5) A while. At least several weeks. 
2	You forgot to ask sex/gender of the respondent and their preference. It can matter.\n\nIdeal partner, LOL get out of here.\n\n> How important is having a beautiful partner to you? Essentially, how shallow are you?\n\nThis is just a bullshit leading question. What if I look 9/10 myself? What if my net worth was 100M and beautiful women flocked to me? I could still choose the one with the brain and the right personality, but why go uglier than I can?\n\n> If you were rejected by your ideal partner, how would you react? Obviously, no one enjoys rejection, but if and how much would you be affected?\n\nI would not know. never met an ideal partner. All rejections hurt. And water is wet. And dogs tend to be cute. What kind of question is this?\n
3	1. I am currently heavily compromising on my need to control and organize others. It is very off putting to someone I'm dating. I am willing to compromise on all of the negative facets of my strong parts. It's a dichotomy.\n\n2. They have to be attractive. There is no other way. It just doesn't work biologically.\n\n3. I would work on myself even harder.\n\n4. Would be very tough, but gotta move on and go forward. It's about building that relationship and not finding it already done.\n\n5. A month or so. 
3	1. Highly likely in a committed relationship, if it seems justified.\n2. I must be attracted to them. My partner absolutely does it for me, but he isn't some posterboy pinup. It works in my favour.\n3. Not intimidated, I'm not without my own charms. I'd casually introduce myself, start a conversation, and subtly quiz them to see if we have long term compatibility. Relationships are more to do with the dynamic than what looks good on a dating profile.\n4. I'm pretty good at gauging interest, so I'd figure this out before I get emotionally invested. If they're not interested that's fine, I'll move on. If my partner dumped me I'd be devastated, try to understand why, if I can fix it, and try to change his mind or move on in misery for a while.\n5. "Enough to get shit done", like what? Full steam ahead, let's get started right away. I can be emotionally vulnerable reasonably quickly, but sometimes the mechanism jams and I get scared and uncertain. It's all just a matter of trust.
1	No compromise. I wouldn't expect them to compromise themselves for me either. If they are the type that would, they're definitely not my type.
1	> How important is having a beautiful partner to you? Essentially, how shallow are you?\n\nFalse dichotomy. Demanding a beautiful partner and being shallow can be separate.

16	How has your personality affected how you view relationships?	I have had flings here and there but nothing that I would consider pursuing and putting an effort in for the past couple years. Usually because I put the high standards that I have on myself on a potential partner but can’t seem to find someone who meets any of my simple (at least to me) must haves when it comes to personality traits. I find it very hard to find people who are driven and can keep up in conversation and it has been quite frustrating. I can’t dumb myself down to put up with the current dating pool, so I’m curious about how you have gone about dating and ways to make meeting someone less tedious. 
10	[deleted]
10	I'll say don't settle (too much, compromise is needed to a certain extent.  She's not perfect, and neither am I).  As an ENTJ, eventually some personality traits that I purposely overlooked in the beginning, eventually eat me and I'm always the one to end the relationship.  I know I'm not good at compromise, so the less amount of compromise I'll need from the get go the better chance at a successful relationship.  As for finding the one... I would concentrate on hobbies/projects/goals that are core to you.  As an ENTJ you're relishing in accomplishing things, and if you find someone like-minded along the way for a relationship, that's just gravy.  I use [meetup.com](https://meetup.com) as a good example.  If I join a few hiking groups, I'm out there hiking with like minded people.  If I get to know someone along the way that fits other hobbies/projects/goals of mine, saweet!  GL.
4	When I think of a relationship, I understand that it’s going to require lots of my time and money. Therefore, I view relationships as something akin to a long-term investment. Unfortunately, this can cause problems for me since I end up getting way too picky about who I will and won’t date, because I don’t want my invested time and money to go to waste.
2	it's quite easy:\n\nstep one: go to gay dance club\n\nstep two: look for intp male who's just standing there being sexy\n\nstep three: go talk to him\n\nstep four: ???\n\nstep five: profit
1	I had all these same issues but it was actually my SO that changed a lot of them. He is an ESFP and when I first tired to break the relationship preemptively because I was moving away he actually got in my face told me to stop. In all other aspects he is very chill and while he doesn't understand all the facets of my work I know I would be terribly suited a d miserable doing his job. I actually think my relationship has given me a reprieve from work at times because I am not holding myself to as high standards since I know he already accepts me as is verses in work where I have more perfectionist tendencies. I always joke that he made me more human but thats exactly what happened. So yeah wait for the right person but just keep trying because they are out there. \n\nEdit: Sorry for typos. Phones suck. 
1	I've always viewed relationships as a luxary, not a nessesity. I've found that I'm aboslutely miserable with "feelers" because it can be overbearing and have ill-logical arguments. I love having a few same sex friends that are feelers, but it's always ended in "catching feelings" for oppostie sex friends. I basically find myself in this constant cycle of getting into a really serious relationship, having it end, rebounding, being miserable, being single, trying to find that relationship with someone else, failure, being miserable again, being single/loving life, then stumbling into another serious relationship. The best advice for finding a realtionship as an ENTJ is to not look for one, it will find you. You gotta love yourself before people will love you, trust me, people can tell when you don't. Just by being your outgoing, confident, exctroverted self, people tend to be really drawn to your energy.\n\nEdit: I'm currently seeing a ISTP and he's the motivator to my ideas. 
7	Hey ENTJs, could you take a second to take my MBTI Romantic Relationship Survey?	 [https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/2QSNJPP](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/2QSNJPP)\n\nAny type can take it. If you know your and your current or ex partner's mbti, please fill out as many times as you've had partners!\n\nIt's simple and I would love to expand on it in the future but these are all the variables I need to complete my Multivariate Statistics Analysis class.\n\nThank you!
2	Very cool, good luck!
2	Why is an Entp curious about this? Funny thing is my current date is Entp...

0	ENTJ CEOs: Solve this problem for me	What would be your proposed solutions to eradicate homelessness in America?\n\nWhat kind of businesses can be targeted to train and perhaps hire homeless people?\n\nKeep in mind a significant portion of homeless people are women and children in shelters and military vets.
10	Not a solvable problem. Prevention at the root causes are more likely, but no silver bullet exists.
13	Not a CEO (yet).\nIf you want to solve a problem as complex,\nlook at existing models.\nCountries with lowest homeless/unproductive rate: \nUnfortunately most homeless people don’t show in census so you’ll have to accept the potential for politicized/advocate data.\n\nDenmark - claimed .1% homeless population.  \n\nThe things most notable about Denmark is: \n1. Ethnical and cultural homogenous,\nNational unity + civic participation (state supported religion is participated by 80% of population) \n2. Well situated between stabilized well-developed nations\n3. ~20% youth, ~60% working age, ~20% elderly\n1:3:1 ratio, keeps population stable, avoids decline of economy.  Also makes creates constant jobs that shift into new generations that can support the ever essential family structure.  \n\nThere are several thousand circumstances that have created this nation, which is the presumable goal, not that is was the intended outcome.\nYou can talk intellectual influences, education, infrastructure efficiencies, resource regulations/distributions, but I’m trying to stay off the hot topic button.\n\nAlso a “significant portion of homeless people” are not women and children, unless you’re taking about a fictional society.  
7	To eradicate homelessness, first I must learn why these people are homeless. Second, I would filter/sort for those reasons, which are most common. Third, I would seek education and expert/legislative advice on how to tackle those reasons. Fourth, I would seek to draft and promote as well as attain sponsorship for said legislation, which could address those issues.\n\nThis would be a simple approach, I did not want to go too deep into it. I'm sure there are other hurdles that would need to be addressed or things I missed 
3	purge them all\n\n/s
2	There is usually a reason why they are poor that has to do with them. If they can't crack it in the USA, imagine how fucked they would be in most other places on the planet Earth.\n\nOne of my proposed solutions is: stop paying people to have kids. Stop govt from subsidizing college loans, thus driving up the price of education. Spread awareness to people that they can usually get a job without having to pay for a fancy degree.  Abolish the unions, the minimal wage, legalize weed everywhere, reform the for-profit prison system, abolish the federal Reserve, the department of education (thus allowing schools to compete), the department of agriculture (thus allowing small farmers to compete with Big Ag) and lots of other departments.\n\nMake ownership of tiny houses legal. Cut federal spending, lower taxes, minimize burden on small and large businesses. Enforce the law better. Build that fucking wall. Abolish licensing for barbers and hair salons. Tax homesteaders at a lower rate. Change building codes to allow for more flexible housing. Ease zoning restrictions, particularly in the large cities.\n
2	In this scenario, is it allowed to offer them payment, however, it would be lower than minimum wage, like $1.00 an hour, which is, more than they're making doing nothing.
1	Not an ENTJ, but... Research from places like Utah strongly suggest that the best way to deal with the homeless is simply to give them a home. That's actually cheaper for the state than trying to provide social services to the homeless when they don't have a roof over their heads and doors they can lock. (E.g., ER visits.) Even homeless people who are drug addicts or have mental illnesses have less problems that way if they have a safe place they can call their own. It's not a one-size-fits-all silver-bullet solution, but it's a one-size-fits-most solution, and would probably be about 90% of the way to "solving" the "problem".\n\nThe podcast 99% Invisible had an episode on "half-a-house" or "site and services" approach towards public housing that's being tried in places like Latin America. Basically, the government builds the hard parts of the house - the foundation, the roof, two exterior walls, a utility wall where the plumbing and electricity come in. And one barebones, bare minimum room. The government then hands the new owners/occupants diy directions on how to build the rest of the house when they have the time and the money. This allows them to take true ownership of the house,  customize the house however they want, and learn valuable skills while doing so. Good for impoverished people and families, probably not so good for disabled people, but hey. One size fits most.\n\nHardest problem is dealing with NIMBY (Not In My BackYard). Who wants a shanty town in their neighborhood? Plus, if an area gets a reputation for not treating the homeless like utter crap, there is a high probability of the homeless flocking there so much that the services the area provides them get overwhelmed. If you can solve the NIMBY problem, money isn't so much of an issue - like I said, just giving the homeless homes is actually cheaper than trying to care for them while they're homeless.\n\nThe Nordic countries and places like Switzerland (which others have mentioned in this thread) seem to use their ethnic and cultural homogenity as a way of overcoming the NIMBY problem. Which does say disturbing things about human nature. \n\nA better model might be Austria, which made public housing that the middle class wouldn't mind living in, and then worked things so you wouldn't be able to tell if your neighbor is middle class or dirt poor. (Read an article about that recently.)\n\nThomas Piketty has pointed out  that the public is less likely to object to massive social programs where the vast majority of them are directly benefiting from them and they're much more likely to object to much smaller social programs that benefit a very small minority of the poor. Think public schools and Social Security (public pensions, to non-Americans) vs. Food Stamps. The budget for food stamps is microscopic compared to the budgets for public schools and Social Security, yet is endlessly controversial because only "those people" benefit. How dare they! So if you could figure out a solution to the problem that would benefit the majority of the public, even if it costs more than tailoring the solution to the minority that needs it, that would probably be easier politically.
-1	Universal Health Care (including medical care, prescription drugs, mental health, and dental), Guaranteed Basic Income\n\nNow homeless people can focus on going back to school, working on their mental health issues, looking after their children, and becoming part of the economy again.

2	Saving everyone time. I went to the website advertised by this Ad. For ENTJ there are a total of five "gifts" one is a hot sauce pack in the shape of an ACME dynamite pack like you would see in a cartoon. An oven mitt with stupid crap written on it. Two coffee cups with stupid crap written on them, and the book "How to win Friends and Influence people" By Dale Carnegie which I assume all of us read by the time we got our first management position.  
2	Fuck off with the advertisements.
1	Are you guys really glued to your desk that much?  I always imagined ENTJs out there having meetings, and less time at the desk.
9	Processing feelings of love	Yes I said it guys and gals. I think I’m falling in love again after 4/5 years of being single and just picking up girls. \n\nHonestly I feel very strange because it’s been so long since I felt some type of emotion for another person. I’m quite nervous too because as much as we ENTJ’s like to say we’re not emotional, we are when it comes to deep love. \n\nI feel like I’ll mess this up because I don’t know how to love and be in a long term relationship anymore, texting all day is a chore to me. Help me pls
11	[deleted]
8	I’m an ENTJ in a long term relationship (with an INFP) and I have to tell you it isn’t easy and you’re going to have to learn to be patient. \n\nSomething that was really unproductive in the early phases of my relationship was that I was so terribly controlling and I didn’t spend enough time trying to figure out my partner and understanding the consequences of my actions and how they made him feel. Emotions are hard for us and scary even, but I think being patient and being genuinely open to our partners is so important. As ENTJs we have to be more open to letting others guide our emotions because we sure as hell suck at them. \n\nOverall I’d say don’t be afraid to let someone in and let them teach you something about yourself. Love is not easy, but it’s incredibly worth it when you’ve found someone that’s worth going through tough emotions with. \n\nGood luck!
5	Decide on goal. Work out path to success. Enact path to success.\n\nMarried 13 years here. \n\nI get it, I hate texting back and forth for what feels like no real outcome. Wifey loves it. It's part of the parcel. \n\nJust work towards showing them the affection you think they deserve from someone who loves them. Abstract it if you need, but allow that little part of yourself to do what it needs. \n\nDon't overthink it. \n\nEverytime you start getting frustrated or its tedious (i.e. the stereotypical ENTJ takes over), you need to stop, check your behaviour aligns with your goals, and pivot appropriately.\n\nMore importantly, STOP STRESSING AND ENJOY THE PROCESS. Doesn't happen often, let yourself be fully immersed.
3	Honestly, for the time being, till you get comfortable in your own skin, which you definitely will, i say crack it down to a few tasks. one of them being, since you mentioned texting, a simple tell me about your day can go a long way. and actually listen and pay attention to these little stuff, then after a while, use them.\n\nhey,how was your day? it was good, saw my friend Ben. he got a new job.\n\nafter a while, you can ask about how Ben is doing at his new job.\n\nit's a very simple and useful thing to do and i love doing it.\n\ndo stuff like, i saw this and it reminded me of you. those can also go a long way.\n\nyou have to tailor your wooing to your partners unique personality, so that's beyond me. but my advice is, don't hold back on the love,, but channel it properly. Also, please enjoy it?it's such a sweet feeling to be so deeply in love. be an ENTJ about it, plan on how to show it, analyze the situation carefully and then act decisively(that doesn't mean dominantly, means don't hesitate and second guess yourself)that's my 2cents mate. sorry if it's not much help.
1	Wouldn't hurt for you to find out her personality type, might help you figure out what a reasonable plan is. 
8	How Dominant Are You?	Hi guy, I’ve recently started dating an ENTJ and it’s going well. But I could use some insights regarding dominance. My goal is to understand him better.\n\nQuick background: I’m a 34yr old gay ENFP who most people would assume I’m straight due to how masculine I appear (I’m a tall big guy, not flamboyant, and I don’t mind leading where there is a lack of leader in group dynamics). Because of this, my past relationships (mostly casual) I was casted into the leader, decision-maker, stereotypically masculine role.\n\nThis is the first time I’m dating an ENTJ, and I instantly find his confidence and leadership skill attractive. For the first time, I can kick back and completely trust in someone else’s decisions (he’s very efficient). I also enjoy his dominance over me when it comes to sex. Yet, I’ve come to realize it starts to conflict with my male ego — while I enjoy him taking the lead, I also want to dominate back times to times. However, he’s most comfortable leading, deciding, and doing, so whenever I want to dominate him back physically or take leadership in our agreed activities, I can sense his unease. He does compromise by letting me lead when I want (which I appreciate), but I can feel he rather does things himself.\n\nOne recent example is that I picked him up at his place with my car to go to dinner, but he immediately told me to get off the driver’s seat because he wanted to be the one driving. I told him he needn’t to, and that I don’t mind driving. But he insisted again, and I just told him actually I preferred to drive. So he got into the passenger’s seat, but became visibly less talkative. So I tried to break the air by asking him whether I offended him by not letting him drive, in which he answered that he himself doesn’t know why he was upset. His mood then changed back to his talkative self, and told me that it didn’t bother him anymore, and thanked me for asking the question.\n\nWe never had a big fight or anything, but there were small moments of friction like this. I’m not even sure whether this is about him preferring to lead, or is it something else? Was the offer to drive was how he showed affection, and I shot him down?
8	It's going to be tough. Same exact situation with an ENFP girl, did not work out. Maybe talk it trough. Best of luck! 
8	In life in general, I'm pretty dominant, or at least self-assured and confident. Romantically though I'm submissive, and also straight. If I were with a guy, I would definitely feel conflicted about it because I consider other men competitors, but don't feel that way about women.
4	Feelings are hard. Self analysis is hard. And when insight in those areas does come up, putting it into words is also hard. But like anything, practice makes perfect. \n\nMy SO and I have a rule in our relationship: *anything* that bothered you gets talked about that same day, or you must be willing to put the matter aside without letting it fester and linger in your mind after today. Every evening before bed, we take a moment to drink a cup of tea on our balcony. No devices, no nothing. This is the prime moment for us to discuss things. Sometimes we end up staying outside for hours, sometimes we just sit next to each other in silence for the 10 minutes it takes to finish the tea. Having dedicated 'talk time' improved my introspective abilities a lot, and really strengthened our relationship.
3	My husband and I are both very strong and there are different parts of our life where I lead and there are certain parts where he leads.  This is good bc we each have our turn and maintain balance, and we can also admire the other one for that leadership in those areas, which builds respect... does that make sense?
3	Since he's an NT type, I think you're better off asking *him* why. He may appreciate the straightforwardness, and seeing you ask he may open up. I'm not too great when it comes to relationship advice involving F types (or even in general), but hope this helps anyway
2	I think you two should talk these moments through when they come up. I'm a very, very dominant person, but I also know sometimes other people need to be in charge. I don't really like or feel comfortable with letting other people take charge, but sometimes you have to.\n\n\nPerhaps he really didn't mean to be upset. Sometimes things just bother you for no real reason and it isn't the other person's fault, but a weird insecurity or the lingering effects of a bad day. If you are really into this man, just talk to him about these things. He might be uncomfortable with it at first, but opening up to each other will help you two get through this issue while deepening the relationship. Win-win, right? 
2	Are you a ‘bad’ driver or prone to take risks while driving? I’m very driven in situations when I have no confidence in someone’s ability to perform the task, even if it’s a likely outcome but could be questionable. I’d rather ensure a positive outcome then experience mental gymnastics along the way. \n\nPerhaps your partner feels a strong urge to court you. It could come from conversations between the two of you, or is really more influenced by intuition from previous relationships. 
2	I'm boggled by the example you gave. How did he get the idea that it would be okay to demand to drive your car? Why did he give up on it when you showed backbone? Why couldn't he identify his reasons for wanting to drive, or if he could do that then why didn't he share them?\n\nYou did the right thing, you stuck up for yourself and then went the extra mile by making sure you weren't ignoring his feelings. Him thanking you for asking the question is an excellent sign. It doesn't do much to tell me about the reasons for his behavior, though.\n\nI can completely understand him wanting to drive - I offer to drive my friends whenever I can and am cautious about accepting rides. Still, flatly demanding the privilege *in someone else's car* (?!?!) is brazen and seems like it would make people uncooperative and resentful.
2	I totally understand your boyfriend.  i guess entj’s are just used to be in control and we have a hard time to give someone else control. especially in the early stages of a friendship/relationship. \n\nyour example with the driving. i can totally relate to him.  ive found myself in situations where i was pissed because i didnt get my way. in hindsight it’s ridiculous that i was pissed but it still happens sometimes. i guess its because i’m afraid this person won’t finish the task up to my standards or forget something and then i’ll be pissed but more at myself for not doing it myself. \n\nso i guess you kinda have to prove yourself here. you have to know his ticks, what he loves what he hates in order to gain control. if you know all these things about him you better start with small things. or you can try to wow him with like a well planned out weekend getaway. but then it’s gotta be perfect, efficient. something you both like. once he trusts you, he will have less problems to let you take control\n\nin bed. try some soft bdsm. like, chain him to the bed. if he’s open for that. i was surprised that i liked it. 
2	OP, this is what i think. when we love you, we want to take care of you, protect you and we know we are very good at it. we will want to make sure u don't have to worry about anything. that's why we can appear as overprotective. his offer to drive is both an action to show he cares and to make him feel at ease: he is doing what he does best by taking care of you. \n\nOn the other hand, be well aware that we don't handle emotions well. The fact that he let you drove means he respects your needs and he trusts you. Part of the reasons we want to be in control is because we don't really believe that others could do better than us, and we hate to clean up the mess. You are doing a good job by communicate clearly with him about your needs, and he is showing his willingness to accommodate to your needs, which is a very good sign. When he opens up to you about his feelings, please listen carefully and offer your insights to help him understand himself better.  I have a positive feeling about your relationship dynamic. Hope this helps. 
2	Immature ENTJs will feel irritated or not comfortable to let you drive, won't communicate about how they feel (hence the classic line "I'm fine"), avoiding the elephant of the room by discussing something they are more comfortable dealing using logic and not showing their vulnerable side. I was like this. I share the same intuition with you that he is caring and mature, that's why i said I have positive feeling.\n\nAnd yes you're right about the fact that cleaning up mess and not letting other people to grow are not constructive. Mature ENTJs acknowledge this problem and once we trust you, seeing u as part of our future, beware that we could push you very very hard, hoping to help you reach your potential. Trusting people is one of the most difficult things for us to do, because trusting means letting them having a chance to break our heart. But if we feel safe with you, you basically have the best co-pilots you could ever imagine. And yes im saying co-pilots because we love to see independence in ourselves and in our beloved as well :) Bonne chance! 
1	Honestly, ime you really need to be secure in yourself to date or really even be around an entj. For enfp that probabally comes down to having fi at a healthy level. If not, they will definitely find a weakness and exploit it. \n\nYoull probabaly also have to deal with a lot of weird passive-aggressiveness, loyalty tests and general trust-issues that itty baby fi will like to throw out. And noooooo matter what, no matter how much something definitely is their fault, its not their fault.
10	VULGARITY	I don’t know about you all, but I tend to be extremely vulgar around people that I’m comfortable with. Sometimes to a point where I start censoring myself because I’ve been spouting “fuck”, “shit”, and “ass” far too often. I don’t know whether swearing helps me intensify my beliefs or something, but it can get a bit incessant. \n\nHowever, the most interesting part is that I have no trouble transitioning into a completely appropriate and kind-worded individual. \n\nCan anyone else relate?
9	I have an ENTJ friend who is notorious for this. He knows when it's an appropriate time to tone it down though (like you) and is able to do that. However, alcohol + ENTJ seems to be an amusing combination where he tends to become more aggressive and less filtered. But he can usually talk his way out of it and convince people that his potty mouth is actually just his inner passion and drive. I love seeing the Fi come out when he's drunk, it's so aggressively passionate lol.
8	People who curse have a tendency to be more honest and very blunt about things, that's the practicality and forwardness of ENTJs shining through. Speaking from fucking ENTJ experience here
5	Yep that’s exactly me. \n\nI tend to swear a lot with my family and friends but once I’m with strangers, teachers or someone a bit more serious like that, I automatically, and sometimes unconsciously, switch my filter mode on. And I can switch from a mode to another pretty rapidly. \n\nAnd by the way, there is very well known ENTJ that is the perfect example of this phenomenon : Gary Vaynerchuck. \nI bet you already know him. If not, I let you check him on YouTube. 
3	Entj bf used to be like this, told him to tone it down though as its not always appropriate
4	I swear, I raise my voice a tad, and everyone in the room tells me I need to calm down.
4	i am precisely this. it really depends on how comfortable i am with them/ or if they are also cursing around me. i can pull a 180 a go to so appropriate that my friends wouldn't believe.  \n
3	Swear like a sailor, able to reel it in if I’m not drinking. \n\nDrinking?  Yeah, fuck that. It’s on. 
3	This seems to happen to me when I'm in a really emotional state, which, only happens around people I really trust.
3	People tend to associate excessive vulgarity with a lack of grace and offensiveness. However - the free  usage of vulgarity can also be a sign of freedom and power. It can be a sign that you don't need to live by the middle-class ethics and behavior also known as English manners.\n\nMyself I use it because there are some things that "fuck" conveys much more powerfully and succinctly than a whole host of other words. It's efficient, it's colorful and it saves me time from scanning a dictionary in order to sufficiently describe how much of a fucking waste of time the other person can be 
5	I do swear but I try to limit it only to situations when swearing is warranted. Don't want to end up like the boy who cried fuck!
2	I have been notoriously “vulgar” (it’s really just being open) in my group of friends regarding sex. To me, the more you know the better you get at it and it’s great to share ideas and be exposed to things you never thought you’d be into. Needless to say, this has allowed my sex life to reach new levels of pleasure and mind play. 
1	Curse words are just an expression of passion to me, & when people are willing to say them so freely in their speech, it's like they're being more real.
0	Anyone else not take advice from anybody they know?	I mean anybody. Mother, father, partner. Mostly people you know so not including what you read or leaders of their field etc..\n\nI only came to this realisation a couple weeks ago. I'm going to stop taking advice from everyone I know. \n\nNone of them are in a position I aspire to, so now on I'm only listening to people who I wish to emulate, which will be 100 percent online since I don't know anyone like this personally. \n\nIt's quite a lift off my shoulders actually. \n\nEdit: Downvoting because...\nedit2: you man are washed with your downvoting\n
6	I take small bits and pieces which I vet thoughtfully. 
3	I think if you're confident in your ability to value things, you can take every piece of advice and information and give it a value. I think some random people you know have bursts of really good advice born from different life experiences and it's worth filtering to find that gold. Wisdom doesn't come from status, but you can get a higher status from wisdom.
5	Go home your drunk, literally adding no value to this conversation\n\nr/iamverysmart will welcome you, take a trip over there\n\n
4	something baby something bath water\n\nWhat makes you think that youtubers are best at giving an advice and aren't just merely making money off of your eyeballs?\n\nWhat makes you think that remote strangers can know nuances of your life?\n\nI like to crowd-source some questions in the right places. I can take an advice from a mechanic or a doctor without aspiring to become either.\n
2	Not ENTJ but when it comes to advice, I usually never listen to anyone other than someone who I know has worked similarly hard in their own respective field to achieve huge lengths of success. Even if I do listen to someone, it's obviously understood as being in a perspective fitting to their vision and it's not emulated but understood, vetted and catalogued.
2	I know better than to listen to most people I know.  Not because I'm snotty but because I only look to experts in their field for knowledge.  Very few people have generally good universal advice.
2	I don’t usually take their advice unless there is hard evidence and good reasoning behind it. If it can be broken down and analyzed to where their point is the most efficient way to get to the goal then I take them in consideration. 
1	By blindly dismissing people's perspectives on things, you might be missing something that is painfully obvious to others that you're completely oblivious to. Nobody is completely infallible. Confidence in yourself and your life path is one thing, but it never hurts to listen to what other people have to say about the matter. Just because you have a vision for yourself, that doesn't mean that there aren't many ways to manifest what you have in mind for yourself. Instead, maybe you should consider exercising good judgment and determine whether someone's advice actually makes sense objectively, which is what anyone should do. Being impartial is important, and it shouldn't matter where the advice comes from, as long as it's good.
14	Last post was a day ago. Posting so the sub doesn't feel so dead	~~:.|:;~~
11	I’ll mention what I’ve been thinking.\n\n1 in 100 women is ENTJ. That means something like 1 in 1000 random women will be ENTJ, in my age range and single. \n\nThen I haven’t even filtered for whether we vibe well, have compatible interests, views, values, aesthetics etc.\n\nI’m thinking I’m going to have to sort through 10,000 women.\n\nDifficult, but not insurmountable odds. I’m confident I can improve those odds by 100x by looking in the right places.\n\nBut if I do find who I’m looking for I’m pretty damn sure I’ll never let her go LOL

1	My third year of college I think. I don't remember much of my day to day happiness, but I had just chosen my major (I think that's the best equivalent of the concept in English) and realized it was something I was very passionate about and a field which I could see a lot of potential in. A lot of my time was dedicated to studying and I felt I was growing as a person. Now I feel a bit stuck and I wish I could get this feeling again, not the studying per se but the feeling of potential. 
22	DAE get irrationally angry at pretentious people?	Whether it's at a restaurant or other enclosed spaces, just being in the vicinity of those with pretension seems to rub me up the wrong way to a point where my friends will tell me to chill.\n\nI see it's not a big deal and not my problem but it makes me rage regardless.
19	Yeah I don't know why this bothers me as much as it does.\n\nI'm pretty chill and non-judgemental but I think it's because pretension comes from a place of insecurity, inauthenticity and immaturity. Which is pretty much the opposite of an ENTJ.
7	I don't care. Through the attitude, I see the fears, the complexes, the insecurities. I can't be angry to such people, only compassionate.
3	I never feel angry tbh. Slightly annoyed but nothing stronger.\n\nAnger builds nothing but can destroy everything, so I just don't see the value in entertaining anger when I feel that emotion. 
2	I don't exactly get angry. it's more or less like, why do i have to suffer through you feeding your own insecurities? usually i try to leave the scene.
1	I wouldn't say they make me angry, but they do irritate me.\n\nMost of the time I would just leave them be and carry on minding my own business, but I'll have to admit I somewhat enjoy putting arrogant people in their place.
1	Getting angry at pretentious people is by nature, rational 
3	What kind of dogs do you enjoy?	My wife and I have 2 border collies that I love and adore, but we've been playing around with the idea of eventually getting a third dog. If you have dogs or want a dog, what breeds are you interested in and why?
5	Primarily the human ones over at /r/yiffcomics. It's when man's best friend becomes best friends with man! \n\nIn that aspect, golden retrievers, Labradors, really any with cute ears and muzzles :)\n\nI'd fill my home with them! You just start rubbing their tummies and they turn over and their cock gets hard and they pee all over you! \n\nThey're cute for a reason!\n\nThey want to smell your butt, and breath, and crotch! It's an okay story when you read a story about a girl getting fucked by dogs or "bitching" or something like that, but what's really great is when they have minds! People are always joking about "what do you think he/she/it is saying?" Well, let's find out! \n\nFor this to really work, it has to be the cartoon world just like with /r/yiff because real animals and fur and everything is a bit too gross to be near. \n\nThere's horses too, but you didn't really mention that. \n\nIn essence I think it's about pure innocent fun and fucking and love. \n\nAnd the way their fucking floppy ears just flop! 
2	I’m more a cat than a dog person. \n\nI find cats very calm and autonomous. They also tend to comfort me when I’m upset about something in my life. It’s like if they knew something is wrong. Btw I have 2 Persian cats. \n\nHowever, if I had one day to get myself a dog, I would definitly go for a French Bulldog just because they kinda remind me a bit of cats haha. 
2	Border collies and Australian Shepherds are my favorites. I love the focus, endurance, and determination. We rescued a mutt and have never regretted it. He's whippet-chihuahua mix. 
2	my two dogs are rescues and both mutts (a pomeranian/spitz mix and chihuahua/terrier looking mix), so I'm a bit partial to adopting. If I were to add another member to the family, I'd look into chow chows (low energy, heat-averse, protective/loyal of their family, but can be aggressive if not properly trained) or maybe pekingese if I wanted another lap dog (small, charmingly ugly-cute and not too rowdy, but a lot of potential health problems). 
1	pit bulls! i was raised with one and they're my favorite. so cute and sweet and they're really the most beautiful dogs. i have two right now and they have the MOST interesting and unique personalities.
1	Rottweiler.\nIt's a good challenge to train them!
0	Great question.\n\n[I kidnap and raise feral dogs as pets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2lSZPTa3ho)
0	You know most dogs are even more stupid then  humans and do not contribute to your life in  a progressive way\n\nBesides this most race dogs have been inbred and completely fucked  with to look pure (lol lets be hitlers😆) look it up they  have headaches or back aches just so they look  pretty it is disgusting.
2	Is it that entjs don't get along well among themselves? Because you guys sound so annoying	I took a test several times and it comes up entj mostly. But why most threads sound like bullshit here? They're so annoying to read through.
19	There are some who found out they were entj before and some after finding out the average income of Entjs.
13	Keep in mind lots of threads here are people coming to ENTJ for some kind of help in a manner.  Not to mention sampling bias.  This sub hardly accounts for a representative sample.
8	It’s not that we fight among ourselves, we are just very competitive individuals, being around other competitors brings it out in us lol 
17	Being an ENTJ is a fetish for most people so you’ve got a lot of hardcore edgy “I don’t use emotions” “my EQ is low and proud” “I’m a dick to people so I’m probably an ENTJ”. So this sub can get super edgy a lot of times. \n\nFYI to anybody reading [emotions are normal and essential. ](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/jenniferlerner/files/annual_review_manuscript_june_16_final.final_.pdf) \n\nAm friends with irl ENTJs and they’re fucking assholes deep inside so you’re not missing out on much. 
2	Hmmm...what makes them annoying to you?\n\nI think part of what's difficult for me around other ENTJ's is that I assume they must not be so very different than I am, but without my own specific experiences (I was originally an ENFJ all my life until consistently until I took it at 24 and had changed from a 'weak F' to a 'moderately strong T') that caused me to highly value the happiness and fulfillment of others, even while I also have my goals that I want to entice them into investing their time, talents, and abilities into.\n\nWith other ENTJ's I assume (mostly out of respect) that they too must have my capacity for managing others, emotional acuity, and I even assume they are similarly intelligent (I'd add in a snippet here normally trying to be self aware about how arrogant this may come off and how apropos this is given the propensity for ENTJ's to be perceived this way but  what's the point..all the ENTJ's here will likely see through it) but they may not truly understand leadership and the nuance between the two and the value of taking other people's needs into account. \n\nLong winded, but the point is I tend to be concerned that ENTJ's don't value other people the way I do and this disconnect makes it difficult for me to trust ENTJ's to be authentic as friends.\n\nThey make fantastic acquaintances however.
15	Serious face?	I was told today that I have a serious face all the time. Any other ENTJ’s experience this?

4	Yes all the time I once had a co worker tell me "don't look so evil Darth_Debate"\n\nI use it for intimidation when needed, but it is hard not to look, so serious all the time. When I want to be friendly I just spook people it is difficult to avoid that.
7	My face is always full of expression, but most of the time it is when I'm discussing something highly interesting, like a puzzle or something in my profession (I'm a consultant in IT.)\n\nMy face is often very stern and piercing when I find people are wasting my time and I find myself making extreme eye contact and people often give me that "oh shit" look when I make direct eye contact with a confused, time wasted look and ask direct questions.\n\nIt really depends on who and what I am talking about at the given time. \n\nI have a very serious face when I order food and my waitress asks me questions which I answered in advance.\n\n"I want the filet, rare, with broccoli and salad."\n\n"Okay sir, what two sides would you like, and uh, how did you want your steak?"
3	I have been told I have a bad case of RBF.  Yes. 
3	Yeah I always seem serious
3	RBF here as well. It helps me more than it hurts me. 
3	Yeah I do it all the time, but I can tell it makes people uncomfortable.. oh well!
3	Yes I look pissed off permanently, it has it's advantages I very rarely get stopped on the street from people selling shit.
2	My wife says I have a super serious, almost villainy face if I am lost in thought and not paying attention in comparison to most of the time when I am conscientiously choosing what emotions I want to facially express.
2	I still can’t shake my RBF syndrome, even if I’m actually happy. 
2	That's interesting, since my experience was the opposite. An ENTJ colleague was always smiling and clowning--sort of a resting smiling face--and he only lost the pseudo-flippant air when he was overtly being serious. \n\nTo be specific, he was actually always serious beneath the surface but covered it up with a humorous/sarcastic manner, always joking, except for those rare occasions when he'd allow himself to be visibly serious.\n\nI formed the impression that most of your tribe were like that--I mean, look at this subreddit! But perhaps I'm mistaken.
1	Was reading a book by a former FBI Agent about how micro expressions give away so much without us realising. \n\nHad a similar comment made about me looking annoyed/angered - didn't even realize but others were picking up on the micro expression. To be fair, it helps getting the point across.
3	Music and personality data gathering (5 minute survey)	Hello all, if you are interested, I created a survey regarding Mbti type and music preferences. It's just for fun, but I am curious to see the results. I personally don't expect to see a huge difference between types, but who knows! It'll only take a few minutes, so please check it out.\n\nI will be posting results after all the data has been compiled.\nhttps://goo.gl/forms/wgMY0z9LvWmN0NY23\n\n***Edit: I will be closing the test to do data stuff at 2pm CT on Sunday, August 5. Sorry if you didn't get it a chance to take the test. Look for the results post in a day or two.***

5	ENTJ and ESTP	To preface: I don’t like to read into personality testing too much, but what I’ve noticed recently is very odd.\n\nI know that the INTP and ENTJ are supposed to be “natural partners” due to their specific array of certain cognitive functions. In fact, my closest friend is an INTP. However, the majority of my friends are ESTP’s. I can’t even exaggerate it either. Literally, 5 of my closest friends are ESTP’s. I’ve had all of them take the test and I’ve noticed remarkable similarities between each of them. So, the ultimate question is: \n\ndo ENTJ’s attract ESTP’s and vice versa?
9	ESTPs have funny, witty personalities and complementary skills sets with ENTJs. Whereas ENTJs typically refrain from saying what's directly on their minds, the ESTPs will verbalize them, providing nonstop entertainment LOL.\n\nAlso ESTPs do all the things ENTJs hate - like sales, schmoozing with other salespeople, not to mention taking jabs at your enemies LOL\n\nENTJs are rational so we prevent ESTPs from making short-sighted mistakes based on emotion, whereas ESTPs are "seize the moment" types who bring a little humor into the ENTJ's life.\n\nBoth types consider loyalty very important so we tend not to cross each other if there is a mutual understanding. ESTPs have generous personalities, like ENTJs, so if ever we were in a bind, we could depend on each other for help.\n\nESTPs appreciate the organization and insight that ENTJs provide and ENTJs appreciate the practical, street smart advice of ESTPs.
2	Any tips on where to meet an ENTJ female?	Don’t want to put too much emphasis on the mbti tag, but I figure it’s an excellent starting place.\n\nI’m offering.. Big Dick Energy\n\n\n\n
13	I'm just gonna list a couple of clichés:\n\n1) gay dance clubs\n\n2) "boardrooms" (could be business, charity etc.)\n\n3) private parties (many ENTJs enjoy rather small gatherings instead of mass events)
7	[deleted]
3	You know, you look like a twat with that "big dick energy" for thoses who don't know what you're refering to. \n\n
2	Networking events. My ENTJ friend is always dragging me to networking.
2	[deleted]
1	I’m an entj female and I showed up at my mothers house to pick up some mail that had been sent there and she and my brother said I always bring “big dick energy” 😂😂
1	Most of my spare time is spent at coffee shops or other semi-social locations where I can observe but not necessarily have to take part in the socialization; places like that are inspiring to me. Im also often found at libraries - the tables in the centres of libraries where I can be around people while keeping to myself
0	female entj here. man i guess its hard to find us in clubs. that would be the worst. the gay dance club idea is not wrong though, because no one would hit on me and i love gay guys.  \ni think a female entj is easy spotted if you look at how a woman behaves around men. i dont get intimidated. i find it fun sometimes to emasculate a guy. especially if he doesnt see it coming. i always have good comebacks especially with cocky guys. 
10	ENTJs and their ability to cooperate in a relationship	Maybe i'm blaming my problems on MBTI and i'm just being immature, but do any other ENTJs struggle with long term relationships? I went into a relationship with an ISFJ (I'm not saying type compatibility anywhere in this post, i'm just bringing that up), and we were different in a lot of ways. Those differences became the demise of our relationship, as she described me as overbearing and controlling, and I didn't put consideration into her opinions and what she considers important. She definitely isn't wrong, but I think that i'm open minded. It's not like i'm against dating someone different. I don't know what it is about me that pushes people away so much from me. I don't notice the coldness and lack of emotion as other people do. I recognize it, but it just seems natural and of my nature. Am I fundamentally immature, or do others struggle with this too, and it's just a common problem?  
13	>She definitely isn't wrong, but I think that i'm open minded.\n\nYou think she's correct, but you're "more correct" than her -- that's not open-minded. While you might have considered her views and ideas valid, it sounds like you did not fully accept them. People are not blind to an ENTJ's implications, even if the ENTJ is unaware he is making them. It is natural for an ENTJ to want to correct something or offer a different perspective purely from a place of goodwill -- but a lot of people view this as criticism. To you, you were not overtly intellectually imposing on her because you assumed she would be as confident in her own system of beliefs as any ENTJ, but to her, you showed an unwillingness for true acceptance of who she was, an unwilliness to compromise between you and change yourself.\n\nLike many ENTJs, you conducted your romance with Te. This very seldom works in the long run. Te wants to gather information and organize -- as you said, this can be inherently overbearing and controlling.\n\nYou are not the only one who struggles with this. It takes lots and LOTS of practice to learn how to turn off Te and just *accept* people, especially when you are able to see the reasons for their failures and the paths they need to take to correct them. Any long term relationship will be a struggle of acceptance and compromise from both parties.
6	I'm 13 years into a marriage with an ISFJ. It's not fun nor easy sometimes, but its worthwhile.\n\nAs an ENTJ you can either rule the entire world or just parts of it. With an ISFJ who has their heart and focus in the hearth/home, you need to relinquish the power to them in this facet of your life. I've learnt to give my wife space, that's probably the biggest thing. She needs solo downtime much much more than I ever will, and without that time my exuberance would crush her.\n\nI guess my advice is this, you need to be considerate of the person you intend to spend all your time with. Its not a fling, its a partnership. You need to work them into your mind as another voice, another part of your conciousness. Empathise and pre-empt what they will say, and let them have control of the part of their life that is most important to them. You can help and guide, as all good partners do, but I've needed to trust her to carry some load, and to not get shitty when she doesnt live up to my expectations. Her expectations of me are just as poorly lived up to. \n\nISFJs also need that personal touch, and trust me it's hard, but sometimes I need to let down my wall and do something a little out-of-the-box to snap her back to reality. I'm just as happy going about my business and touching base with her over breakfast, but that toucy-feely stuff matters to her.\n\nI'm probably immature too, but I do struggle with this, and for me, it's not a thing that I think I will ever just conquer. It's always going to be a fight that I have to try and keep forefront of my mind.
2	ISFJ's....hahahaha...ISFJ's can be both wonderful and an absolute nightmare, especially young ones that are completely incapable of communicating their feelings. I dated one in high school for two years. Sometimes I would be chatting to a female friend about anime and she would burst into tears and run out of the room...other times she would snuggle and we would spend time together and she was lovely. I eventually ended it because of my personal issues, not her, but it was definitely a stressful relationship at times.
2	ENTJ's have among the greatest capacity to evaluate other people. It is one of our gifts. Using this gift to identify who you can be compatible with should also develop out of this trait. Furthermore you should as you grow and mature be able to grasp better how to couch your logic in such a way that it speaks to others in their language without being condescending. This is also dependent on your experience and ergo proficiency at understanding conflict resolution in relationships and how to nurture them.\n\nA lot of it is just learned experience. Examples include the idea that criticism should follow the CPR method (Constructively, Privately, Respectfully), or that you use 'we' instead of 'you' in most cases of discussing a problem so they don't feel personally attacked, reinforcing that anger solves absolutely nothing and is thus illogical as a choice (if my wife gets angry I remind her gently that she knows that saying words in anger won't help anything and won't give her satisfaction...especially because I can't be baited into reciprocating), keeping it clear that neither of you is perfect and both have things to work on and it's never about oneupmanship or belittling, it's an opportunity to grow and learn and improve together so we can be happier in our marriage.
1	Did she voice her opinions to you?  If so, did you just steamroll over them?  If so, I can see why she's upset.  However, if she didn't really come out to make her opinion/thoughts known, then it's not all on you, it's on her too.\n\nFME, not romantically, but an a female INTJ who has to deal with a lot of other female xSFJs... they are not good at vocalizing their needs/opinion.  You have to coax it out of them, and even then, they may not be very direct about it.  However, they will get upset and hold it against you, if they feel like their needs/opinion didn't seem like a top priority, EVEN if you tried to figure it out and it was still as clear as mud with a beating around the bush type of, wishy-washy response.  It is one reason why I struggle with xSFJs.  It's kind of this weird passive-aggressive thing, where they expect you to be a mind-reader and they will act like they'll just go along with it, but then you find out later on that they were really upset about it.  By then, they've been stewing over it and their imagination has run off with them blowing things out of proportion and you're left wondering how the heck you made them so angry when you *thought* that you asked their opinion on it and they acted like it was no big deal, so you did what you thought was best, and then it was a problem, after all.
1	Theres nothing wrong with being controlling but there are just some cases where you do not need to be overbearing and controlling. \n\n\nyou said that  you didnt put consideration in her opinion and you are just open- minded? Well thats no excuse to dismiss it like that. That's just selfish and somewhat arrogant . If you could just exercise and improve your patience level, that would be a benefit not just for you but also for your SO\n\nMost isfjs are sensitive but if you communicate it to her, she will understand.ISFJs are the most understanding people i know
1	Maybe you're just not a good match for a feeler (or a sensor). I certainly wouldn't be, too much hassle.
1	Knocking it out of the park in relationships	ENTJs, think of a time in a relationship where you did something really right and your S/O really lit up and was very appreciative. If this has never happened to you, then imagine it! :P\n\nHow did it make you feel? Sorry if asking about feelings is lame or annoying, but I'm interested in getting a picture of your internal landscape. I know INTJs tend to get the feels when their S/O views them as competent, so I'm wondering how ENTJs are.
8	Thoroughly enjoy it. Makes me strive towards doing things that make her feel great. My greater challenge is when I can't impact her feelings by doing something. Instead I have to just listen and appreciate her feelings, which often takes me a little to realise that others don't always need something done, but just need to be heard and felt, and sometimes need help making sense of their feelings.
5	I'm thankful my SO appreciates what I did, but in short time I'm all "yeah, yeah, on to the next goal, I don't want to waste time." 
3	"Knocking it out of the park in relationships"\n\nThat's such an ENTJ thing to say :D
2	For me it is meeting the end goal of a lot of planning. If she does not enjoy it then I have failed in my planning and/or execution, if she did then I succeeded and I get a small ego boost to incentivize myself to set another similar goal.
2	I felt emotionally close to my SO. He's an INTP, and I think one thing we have to be mindful of is that we both work on the relationship using logic over emotions. We're great at navigating the day to day tasks, or big challenges in life that require "thinking" (example: we're both moving in together soon so I'm the organiser, he's the researcher, it works perfect). \n\nWe're not so great at the emotional stuff though. However, it's something we both are aware that we need to work on. So when I try something and it works, I just feel so close to him, and that in itself feels great. But it also makes me feel hopeful because I have found a tool I can use to recreate that feeling again if we both start feeling emotionally distant from each other.
4	Should I Have Tried? (ENTJ + Relationships)	Alright so here's the thing, I recently hooked up with a guy that I thought was a real catch: incredibly smart, handsome and someone who I thought I could really talk with and connect to. Essentially someone who I could see myself with in the future. We got along splendidly, but the thing is that he's just recently gotten out of a pretty serious relationship of over 2 years and I could tell that he was still affected by it and probably still in the process of getting over it. \n\nWe ended up hooking up a couple of times and I had a really good time. But there was this one night after sex when we were just talking and staring into each others eyes, starting to really connect when he all of a sudden gets up to go to the bathroom saying that he feels sick and that something suddenly came over him. \n\nAnd when he comes back he apologises, says he feels like a total jerk and asks me to polietly leave. \n\nNot being one to make a habbit of becoming someone's rebound or really be in any relationship where I have to second guess where I stand, I ended things with him the following day. But before that we did have an honest discussion on where this was heading - he admitted that he didn't really know how he felt at the moment and that he wasn't ready - and by the end of that we agreed to go our seperate ways. \n\nAnd now... Well now I'm not sure whether I was too harsh or quick to jump the gun. Should I have been more patient and maybe been the sort of gal who could help him through something like that? Maybe even be someone who was emotionally there for him and willing to help him heal? \n\nIn some ways I think me being so quick to end things was partly an ego thing and also a way to stop myself from possibly getting hurt. \n\nLet me know what you guys think :) 
5	He is clearly emotionally overwhelmed, and definitely was at that moment during the night. \n\nHe is processing his experience now and you have to be patient. None of this rules out any future possibility.\n\nMy 2p.
4	I think you did the right thing. You've established your boundaries - you don't want to be in a position where you don't know where you stand - and he'll see your value from that. You're honoring yourself by walking away. It's not like you were mean or malicious to him. Never be afraid to close a door and ask for something different, because sometimes a closed door is what is necessary to open it back up, or to open a new one.\n\nI like this quote - "Close your door. If something belongs in your life, it'll knock." \n\nHe might come back, he might not. But at least you've taught him how you want to be treated and the ball is in his court to either step up or back away.
3	I think you did the right thing.  He isn't ready for a relationship and he showed/told you that.  If you wanted just sex with someone who emotionally would be hot & cold, then maybe you could have continued it.  But my guess is that you don't really want that, so cutting it off before it got too deep seems very reasonable.
2	Sounds like you made the right call. He didn't sound to be in a place where he could have a healthy relationship.\n\nInvesting time and energy into building up other people is usually wasted. A buddy of mine does that continuously (5 times now) and ends up getting dumped and heartbroken at the end. His partner sees herself as leapfrogging him after she heals and move on to someone that didn't see her at her worst.
1	If it's someone I'm very interested I'll let shit ride out for a little bit as long as it's not interfering with my life in any significant way. But in my experience, even with patience and emotional availability, some folks are just a pain in the ass. 
1	Who’s the entj? You or him?
1	I think you made the right call. You're nobody's rebound, so stick to it. I've never met anyone who ended up bagging someone by waiting around until they were ready unless they were strictly friends the entire time and only AFTER said person was ready, decided to make a move.
0	I hate to be the one, but it seems like he's just not that into you. He's likely still fucking his ex, too. Just move one to someone that his shit together. You're an ENTJ for God's sake ;) What do you want with such a drama queen?
3	Need some advice about a serious issue	Hey everyone! \n\nEssentially, my father psychologically abused my mum and myself and they divorced 3 years ago. (My father actually initiated the divorce claiming my mum cheated on him when it was painstakingly apparent it was the other way around and we had tonnes of proof)\n\nI don’t want any contact with him but he keeps finding ways to try and contact me (mainly on social media). Obviously I blocked him but today was not so nice as he added me on Instagram under an alias and then messaged me out of nowhere.\n\nMainly I’m asking what should I do to move on and have a way to heal whenever he does try and reach out. \n\nThanks everyone :) 
9	don't show him any weakness, don't give him anything to work with. act indifferent. block and move on. he wants attention and i dont think anything you say can change how he'll act
8	I would scoot over to r/raisedbynarcissists\n\nThey might have some good coping strategies for going no contact with your parent. 
3	My father only stopped this kind of behavior when he died. 
2	Interesting that you chose r/entj for this post.\n\nYou could start using social media under a different alias yourself. Nicknames given by your friends could work or whatever you like.
1	You aren't going to be able to avoid him without confrontation of some variety. He will be able to follow you around creating aliases continuously.\n\nYour best option will likely to be coming to peace with it. There is no guarantee you can get him to do what you want.
5	What makes you laugh?	What makes you laugh?\nWhat do you enjoy in a conversation? \nWhat do you enjoy / look for in a friendship?\n\nCertain female ENTJ is an acquaintance to me, but would like to befriend. Even though we hang out in a same group, personal connection is missing and I would like to try and change that. \n
17	When someone insults me. 
11	Irreverence makes my entj laugh if that helps.
9	Bernie Sanders
5	Here's the unfortunate thing with me - if it's predictable, I'm not going to like it.\n\nMost recent example - \nBefore the seminar began, we were in the break room with the professors & one of the was talking about how one of his students thanked him.\nHe said "If I had only a few days left to live..". \nI burst out laughing at this point, because I saw where this joke was going.\nThe professor continued "... I'd like to spend it in your class".\nHe said he asked why.\nThe student replies "Because in your class, a minute feels like a year".\nI was done 2 sentences ago.\n\nOr even in Captain America - Civil War, when Cap meets Spidey for the first time - I literally said Cap's line for him, with him.\nParaphrasing below.\nCap - "Where're you from?"\nSpidey - "Queens"\nCap - "Brooklyn"\nSaw that coming.\n\nYesterday, when I was watching a Bo Burnham stand up - I caught something before Bo himself said it.\n\nTo put it simply I like jokes that are novel.\n\nBut, that's just me. I can't speak for all.
5	Being irreverent and passionate about something ridiculous. Being able to take a good dig and play it off and give back with the same level of intensity. Predictable jokes, being totally goofy, or being socially unacceptable to get a laugh will definitely not go over well.
7	I would describe my sense of humor as sassy, dark, smart, and caricatural. To rephrase for clarity, it's irreverent, politically incorrect, intellectual, and it exaggerates people's ridiculousness.
10	A good witty joke, high quality memes, and good old schadenfreude.
3	Excessively dramatic fictional character drama makes me laugh something fierce. Haven't figured out why yet though.\n\nOtherwise, witty humor. Especially contextually relevant humor with multiple meanings baked into it.
6	[deleted]
2	That scene in Brooklyn 99 where Peralta pretends to be an exterminator to break in to a high school, and the front desk lady is just like yeah! You’re here for the snakes! \n\nA+ humor.
2	Some slapstick, good puns, but for really making me laugh there isn't really something I can out my finger on. Sometimes how my kids react but kinda picky otherwise
2	i like good word play, sarcasm, cynicism. when someone can work a joke into the conversation. i like good insults, original comparison. (by that i mean insults, i really like witty insults) 
1	You.
1	Honesty so brutal, it makes 98% of the people in the room get quiet & even unnerved. If it's honest, I don't care how ugly the truth is, the MORE honest and MORE unlikable that honesty is, the more I just want to laugh my arse off for someone having the go-nads to say what nobody else will, when deep down inside, we all know it's true.
3	Flirting/wooing an INTP	I’m an ENTJ guy and the girl just fascinated me. The thing is, the type or at least she seem to be very bad at agreeing to plans and need flexibility. So how do you agree on a date with someone who needs forewarning, but also needs to feel like doing the activity when the time comes, and is forgetful. \nAny other tips on talking to/flirting/interpreting/etc INTPs would be appreciated! 
5	Be genuine. INTPs females already tend to crush on you guys.
5	I would say give her a 6-8 hour window. Call her in afternoon for plans that evening. I do best when I don’t have time to overthink things. If she likes you, what you do together won’t be as important as the ability to talk and discuss stuff. So....not too loud as to not have conversation. 
3	I find with INTPs you have to first gauge interest, "wanna hang out this weekend?", and then check in with them on the day to see if they feel like it. No plans are confirmed until they show up on the day. If it's something fun they'll typically make the effort, but hounding them doesn't work.
1	I would make sure that activity that you are planning to do together is something she would normally do when she has no other obligations.  That way when the time comes and she remembers that she made the commitment to hangout, but really wanted to do her own thing that day, it doesn't seem as big as a hassle.\n\nAND / OR\n\nGive her a deadline. Tell her you want to hang out *this week.* And if she won't agree on a certain day, say you're going to consistently bug her everyday about it until she decides.  This will show you're very interested and persistent which may help your chances.\n\nTake with a grain a salt, just what I would personally do.\n\nEdit: a word
1	Be yourself, try to be open-minded and more chilled out than usual yet decisive when it matters. 
1	realize that as long as she's still talking to you you're doing things right\n\nI can't speak for other intps but I'm deeply conscious of time being the most valuable commodity so if we spend it on you that's the best compliment there is, imo
2	(Cross-post) Temperament and Humor (All over 14 Welcome)	 Hello! I recently posted a survey you might find interesting. It would really help me out if you would participate!\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/SampleSize/comments/92ynz1/academic\_temperament\_and\_humor\_all\_over\_14\_welcome/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SampleSize/comments/92ynz1/academic_temperament_and_humor_all_over_14_welcome/)
13	ENTJ and Sex Hangups?	I’m a 33F ENTJ who hasn’t quite figured out the sex equation.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nA little background on me... \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI was raised in a very strict religious home with a mother who got pregnant in her teens so her whole approach to sex education was shaming and telling me to wait until I got married.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI waited until 23 to lose my virginity. In typical ENTJ fashion, I have trouble getting out of my own head enough to enjoy the sexual experiences. I tried to “read up” on sex to see if I could compensate for my lack of experience with my first boyfriend - but the whole thing felt awkward and forced. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nI did go through a time where I was coming out of my shell and quite good at flirting and attracting men, but unfortunately some real creeps slipped through my radar and I was sexually assaulted a few times. Funny how easy it is for some guys to just decide “hey, fuck your consent” whenever they don’t feel like listening to you even so called “nice guys”. And the sex I did have left a lot to be desired. Some guys would quickly get lazy or think they could just stop trying after the sex it was ridiculous. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo after a lot of unfulfilling sexual relationships and bad partners, it’s almost impossible for me to get out of my own head during sex as I’m always keenly aware of the physical and social power differential, and I don’t like feeling out of control.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**So - ENTJs with sexual hangups, how did you get past them? What kinds of changes in your life did you have to make to find more fulfilling sex and to learn to “let go”?**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*EDIT: Please stop inboxing me asking to be the guy to “show me a good time”. WTF, brehs.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
9	I've read that enneagram-type-8 ENTJs are often uncomfortable with sex, which makes sense because type 8s' underlying fear is that others will betray them and hurt them. For me this is definitely true. I've gone to a lot of sex clubs and gay bathhouses, so I've had a lot of sex partners. This information might lead many to think I'm very comfortable with sex, but in reality, I gravitate to sex in this sort of setting because it is anonymous. I don't have to worry about rumors spreading about me because none of the guys I'm getting with really know me or my friends. I think my hangup here is compounded by my sexual orientation because (1) gay guys often do gossip about their sex partners in this sort of way and (2) because being gay gives me access to a lot of anonymous-sex opportunities like bathhouses and sex clubs. Even in college, I only slept with guys who didn't go to my school, even though there were more scorching hot guys at my school than books. I used grindr to meet guys elsewhere.\n\nNow I see I need to address this hangup.
3	I get drunk. I handle my alcohol well, so all it does is space me out enough that the last thing I can do is stay in my own head. Apart from that, more than a few guys have told me that men in general like women to be demanding in bed, so just let it go and demand that they make you feel good I guess haha
3	Honest question that I hope does not offend: are you 100% sure that you prefer men? 
3	I would recommend "The Truth" by Neil Strauss, it's more about relationship than about sex, but it's a lot about sex, and a lot about psychology and how we grow up as the partner we are (and how we chose our partners).
2	I'm not so different than you. \n\nI had a lot of practice in high school though and even more so in college.\n\nI guess at one point I decided that I just have to do what I like/want in the bedroom. \n\nIf the woman doesn't like it she'll tell me and I present myself in a way socially beforehand that she knows information/knowledge/thoughts are transparent, so tell me if you have something on your mind.\n\nIt honestly just sounds like you don't have enough sexual experience and you've let it go to a point where you're second guessing yourself. Sex can still be awkward for me, but I just remind myself I know what I'm doing and to proceed. \n\nA women in bed taking control might be the type of thing every man desires, I would just say that you should be selfish about who you are.\n\nIf none of this works, take your time and pace yourself finding the right guy to sleep with, someone you may wish to date long-term. 
2	Hey, I'm also a 33F ENTJ. I've literally dated two girls in my life, and I ended up marrying both of them... (Insert lesbian uhaul joke.)\n\nIt's become clear to me during my second relationship that I had a hard time connecting to my body during sex. I feel like I'm "playing a role" trying to look sexy, smile sexy, talk sexy, etc.\n\nMy wife at one point said to me "what's with all the role play all the time" and I realized that I never really shut up and tried to just *enjoy* sex. I realized that I trust her completely with my safety, and she's always respected my need to stop for a second whenever I say "stop."\n\nI guess for me, I needed to be with someone who I could completely trust before all the walls could come down. It was exciting to just give up control.
1	Treat the experience as a cutscene in a video game. Be in control of your situation before and be ready to be again afterwards, but during the cutscenes put the controller down and enjoy the ride. If you have your ducks in a row when you go into it you have nothing to fear.
1	Gonna have to find someone you actually care about enough to share it with.
1	Lol at that edit
1	I have a very similar problem, and a weird off hand comment by my mom once actually has helped.  If you are going to be stuck in your head the whole time, then make up a story in your head that you can get off to.  It was weird at first but apparently its not uncommon at all.  
1	Hrm. I don't think I can offer any advice, as such... Maybe commiseration. I've had a bad experience coming the other way, but I don't feel comfortable talking about it on the public Reddit. Maybe we can have a conversation first, and if you feel comfortable enough, we could pm about it?\n\nSo... I'd like to zoom out from your immediate problem a bit, take in a wider view. (I've noticed that ENTJs can often be *too* task-oriented, and miss out on things in the wider environment. Sort of like how what an argument in a relationship is *apparently* about is never what the argument is *actually* about.)\n\nSaw your crosspost on r/sex, about your experiences with the three different boyfriends. What was your relationship with these guys like *other* than the sex? Also, what's your work life like?
0	Any other ENTJs cheat on their partners?	Just got out of a 3 year relationship because I’ve cheated on them multiple times and they found out. Is this just me being incredibly insecure and selfish or is it common for this personality type?  Either way it’s selfish but I can’t understand why I keep doing it \n\n***Can I add that I told them each time this was just my final chance. \n\nI know this means I don’t love them, and I know this isn’t just a personality trait but I really am trying to figure out why I do it and how to stop it, I know how wrong it is 
40	Lmao you’re just a dick personality type doesn’t excuse you from being a flaming asshole. 
25	Wait...fucking excuse me? LMAO \n\nLet me reassure you this is not a personality trait this is a CHARACTER trait.\n\nBye falicia.\n\nNot to mention ENTJs are known for their loyalty and commitment. Get out of here. 
11	Nope, you're just a dick. Nothing to do with ENTJ's.
8	get out of here
9	No, you're just an asshole
6	you are on a Te-Se loop, not concerning the future and keep living by the moment. Do you really love your partner? What would happen if you are cheated on? Ignoring your Ni/Fi maybe the reason why
6	try a therapist if you really wanna know why and how to stop.
4	Absolutely not. If anything, I would argue ENTJs are less likely to cheat than a lot of other types; we're fiercely loyal and take our relationships and commitments very seriously.\n\nGo talk to a therapist? 
0	Did you end up gaining in value while your partner stayed the same or lost some? That tends to cause people to cheat. If you find yourself in the same situation again in the future it is probably time to end the relationship and move on.
10	How to tell if a male entj likes ya?	Title says it all.\n\nI'm a female entp, 18 yrs of age. So we're talking about relatively young entjs. (asking for a friend, *obviously*)
14	I'm very no nonsense when I'm into a girl. If I figure out she's into me, I'll find a good time to be open with her and let her know somehow. I feel like male ENTJ's are typically funnier people too, so if you make him laugh, and he wants to spend time with you, he's all your's.
15	A typical ENTJ won't let you waste their time.  If they let you make demands of their time then that's a plus.  If they seek you out, that's a big plus.
6	They're very direct. They'll pursue you. They will ask you on a date and not use the word hanging out. They'll escalate physically. At least in my experience. 
3	Ask him
2	The N leads to have a good feeling/impression about the person. The T means you also have a rational approach. \nSo you must feel closeness and imagine that things could work out well. If not entjs flee the other kind of relationships. Or it’s just hookups. 
2	Check for a boner.
2	I accidentally set up my ENTJ and ENFP friend by accident on a messenger call, by teasing them about how they're on a date when I leave them alone. I find initiation is dependent on the other person. The ENTJ and ENFP would often come up to individually talking about how they start developing feelings for the other, calling it a form of magic. I found it adorable and heartwarming that they ended up married real quick and relatively young! I teased the two, and it just sorta happened. They thank me for helping them realize their feeling for the other. Te users will be incredibly blunt as it seems, especially that Fi, they don't hesitate to feel what they love and value. Something to note of, just in case about my ENTJ friend...\n\n 1) He became more lovey dovey, somewhat affectionate, and traditional definition of having a special someone. He'd sometimes share his notebook with me describing his now ENFP wife, quite touching. He'd write poems, excerpts, meaning into the finding of love, it was like he was an artist completely different from what I knew him as the friendly, yet bold professional demeanor. Someone trying to grasp and hold dearly to a concept. He'd often tell me all the time about how his wife is doing, I treat his wife like my older sister, and how they'd only want to communicate with each other. \n\n2) He's preparing a future, don't you think he would have asked you out by now? The ENTJ in sight I mean. I imagine they'd have the initiative. If not, then it best to ask then out yourself. ENTJs, on a universal scale of knowledge view dating like a job interview. Very intriguing to go about, but true nonetheless. Quite attracted to intelligence. \n\nWell,  I don't think I can add on anything more insightful, but good luck, OP! May the ENTJ fall for ya! :)
1	Let’s keep it simple first by dismissing his type and focusing on his behaviour as a male. Do you sense that he is acting in ways that are suggestive of some undercurrents? Some things are not type exclusive but manifests in all people, e.g. some nervousness or awkwardness, testing the waters, behaving somewhat unusually, treating you differently than other females, etc. \n\nBut if we consider ENTJ males specifically, one I know is testing the waters by increasing some physical contact, trying to spend more time together, trying to gauge a reaction (e.g. how would a female react to his encounters with other girls), or even asks questions about the future plans, etc. 
4	How long does it usually take for a male entj to fall deeply in love?	
10	Oh, for the ENTJ it is super easy to be charmed by th idea of the person, but falling in LOVE takes like at least 6 months of dating. At least from my experience (being an ENTJ and dating such guys).
14	Speaking from personal I experience I fall quickly into and out of love.\n\nWhen I decide a partner is right for me I go after it full force. When I realize they’re not I leave quickly.
3	I fall deeply in love quickly and then I have a deep loyalty and commitment for the person who reciprocates my love. \n\nIn my case I fell in love with my wife rather quickly after beginning to date and quickly realized that she possesses a lot of traits that I value highly while also being a good yang to my yin and thus someone I could learn from and improve with, and she also felt similarly about loyalty and commitment. \n\nI think there are definitely people out there I could have been more suited to, but I'm very content with my wife, love her very much (even if I don't feel the same type of infatuation I did when we were first dating), and have a deep rooted motivating principle that I want to make her happy and give her everything I can because her happiness is tied to my own and every bit of happiness I can inspire in her is magnified a 100 fold in me and brings me great satisfaction. \n\n

10	ENTJs and being a subordinate: What qualities or actions causes you to respect a perceived "good" leader?	Self-explanatory title; what qualities or actions does a supervisor/manager/teacher/professor do that earn your respect? We tend to hate having to respect incompetent authority, so what kind of person are you willing to allow to influence and mentor over you?\n\nPersonally, I like leaders that respect even the janitor; I am particularly off-put by managers that act like they are better than anyone. We were all at the bottom of the totem pole once, so have some common decency for your fellow human being. You never know where you will find wisdom.
18	Don’t put me on a leash, but give me enough rope to hang myself with. Also, don’t treat me like you’re inherently smarter than I am. If you are, I’ll recognize that. When I screw it up by being overly ambitious don’t make a fuss, I’ll always come through in the clutch. \n\nEdit: anytime you talk about being smart, you will grammatically fuck your message up every time. 
9	Give me freedom and trust me. Also entrust me with responsibilities and let me execute. I show loyalty and respect back. Yes, one day I want to do the leading, but I know I have to work my way up properly.\n\n
9	It’s easy for an ENTJ to respect a leader who just takes the reins and lead, but what makes for an exceptional leader is one who can articulate their rationale and communicates with subordinates. The toughest lesson for me to learn as an ENTJ is to lead alongside and not from the front — leaders who do the same will always get my support. 
5	1) Someone who is gracious and diplomatic with their rivals.\n\n2) Someone who is a realist and gives you practical advice and ways to improve your life or shares insights with you about overcoming certain situations.\n\n3) Someone who respects and supports women and does not use his/ her position of power in order to engage in sex with his/ her subordinates.\n\n4) Someone who is tough minded, and does not easily cave to pressure. \n\n5) Someone who has empathy for people and treats everyone with equal diplomacy and respect from people with differing political opinions to elderly people to service workers to foreigners to everyday people. \n\n6) Someone whom I have confidence in which I can thrive under, learn many new things, and not feel stifled. 
4	I like a leader with a vision, who is willing to do what it takes, but at the same time can be diplomatic. In my mind, leaders need to be able to solve issues and get others across the finish line. A leader needs to be able to say "we're in this race no matter what, but would you rather run the 200 or the 400m? What lane would you like to run in? and, is that the best way for us to win and finish this race?"\n\nFor your example, I that seems less like a bad leadership quality specifically and more like a bad person quality. 
1	In my current job I needed to learn that my boss isn't as... fleet of mind as I am. It's not that he is incompetent or dumb, it just takes him longer to proces things than it takes me. So I've had to learn restraint. Apart from that, he's been all the things an ENTJ wants. I can manage up very effectively, poke, prod, suggest, take action, do what I want, but as long as I keeep him in the loop he is happy.\n\nOften times I'm sure I step beyond the box he wants me in, but until he calls me out (and I've asked many times) then I'm taking the lead.
17	Any ENTJs Here With Social Anxiety?	How do you manage it if you do? What are some ways I can overcome it? I feel like I have unlimited potential if I can get over it, it’s just crippling at times.
23	I thought I had social anxiety but realized I was just depressed 
11	Literally push yourself. It does help
9	>"Doing something makes me feel uncomfortable"\n\nAlmost always the way to make it go away is do it more. \n\nTalk to people more. It is easier if you talk to strangers about small stuff with no expectation about how the conversation will go.
3	I take CBD for situations that are particularly anxiety provoking. 
3	> How do you manage it if you do?\n\nI push through what I am afraid of as horrible as that sounds. I also have a mentality that if anything goes wrong or awkward in a interaction nothing bad will happen even if I am 100% responsible for something going awkward I say it is okay even if that happens.\n\n> What are some ways I can overcome it?\n\nI wouldn't suggest this as the thing you do first, but if you are up to the nastiness of it total, and complete confrontation with the fear. Whatever you are afraid doing do it anyway. For me it was ordering food for myself instead of my parents. The more in person it is the better, and honestly if you make a mistake that is good because it increases your awkward tolerance which decreases your fear for future interaction.\n\nThe easier option is making solid chunks of progress over a medium amount of time. You could hold open doors for people, and saying yw to them look at them in the eyes if you can. In general just do things that require a couple of words, and then the interaction stops overtime it will make your fear decrease heavily overtime, but it never truly goes away, but don't let that stop you. If you have any questions feel free to message me.
6	Everyone has some amount of social anxiety. It's part of being human. 
2	Can you elaborate what you mean by Social Anxiety - just a few specifics would help.
2	I struggle with social anxiety. I've found that part of the problem can be who you're associating with. I have a few different "groups of friends," if you will, and naturally all of them treat me a little differently. My favorite group of friends, my college friends, treat me like I'm cool, like they value and admire the qualities in me. I've noticed that after hanging out with them for a while, my general level of everyday social anxiety falls, even when I approach other people outside the group, and as a result, those other people outside the group pickup on my confidence. On the other hand, I have another group of friends, my "going-out friends," who invite me out all the time and think I'm fun yet treat me sort of like I'm the smart, eccentric one in the group who will probably be very successful one day (I'm 26 now) but whose qualities they wouldn't really want in themselves. They're not really going anywhere: In fact, two of them are apparently addicted to cocaine, and one of them is a stripper. So it's easy to consciously write them off, but subconsciously, no one likes to be around people who don't really seem to think highly of you. I don't really go out that much with them anymore.
2	I tried to make up for it in other areas\n\nWhen that was inadaquate, I forced myself to do the things I had to \n\nWhen that was inadequate, I went to a psychologist.  Wish I'd done that from the start.  
2	\---> psychiatrist.
9	I thrive under pressure but what do i do when there is none?	I am a high school student and I have big dreams and I get what I want to be done during the school year when I am very busy. Now that its the summer I am so lazy and I cant get my goals done and i feel like a failure. So in moments of no pressure how do you motivate yourself do to stuff?
6	Pickup a hobby, start a summer business, take online classes or tutorials, start applying for scholarships for college, find ways to make yourself busy. Do something that you enjoy or something that will help your future.
4	Find something you want to get better at, and find someone to compete with while doing it for increased motivation.

I’ve been told that I do this and that it’s mildly unsettling at times." - Kathleen-June Horne\n\n"I think it’s that I have a tendency to think about **eight things at once**, leaving me only about 55% focused on what’s going on in front of me, especially if I’m not stressed out by my surroundings." - Kathleen-June Horne

0	Hypothetical Question: Let's say you had a work opportunity	Of course, this is completely hypothetical. \n\nLet's say you had a work opportunity in which you could work with the following people - and they would effectively become your managers/ bosses.\n\nA) Whom would you choose from this list? B) And why?\n\n1) Hillary Clinton\n2) Michelle Obama\n3) Barack Obama\n4) David Cameron\n5) Donald Trump\n\n\n
3	Here comes the political arguments yay
3	Lock this :/
3	duck sized horses....
2	Obama, trump seems a but too unethical for me and the hate i would get would be too much 
2	None of the above! Pretty terrible and limited choices. If I had a gun to my head ...\n\nTrump because he actually built businesses and is not entirely full of shit.\n\nMaybe Cameron. Do not know much about him.\n
2	Enfp trying not to scare an entj.	I had a boss, but then I quit due to some really unfortunate circumstances (he was actually sad, which was odd) so we got to be very close friends. He is a model example of a healthy entj and I am a model example of a healthy enfp. Our friendship is great and he controls pretty much the whole relationship when. Where. How long we see each other in perfect entj form. And I-in perfect enfp form like him all the more for it. I sort of feel like I should tell him I like him because I think he feels the same about me (even though I don't think he is totally aware of why he decides to see me on a whim or says sorry after not talking which is unnecessary because if he never stopped the convo, I would never shut up so it's not personal to me) but I don't want to freak him out with the feelings stuff because I'm not trying to commit but I've been really loyal to him and am very open about my admiration.  Will I totally freak him out? Should I wait for him?
4	> I sort of feel like I should tell him I like him because I think he feels the same about me\n\nI say go for it you won't scare an ENTJ by confessing your feelings. It may catch him off-guard, but that isn't a big issue.\n\n> I don't want to freak him out with the feelings stuff because I'm not trying to commit\n\nCommit to what? an official relationship or marriage? if you don't want to commit to either do you just want a friend?\n\n>  I've been really loyal to him and am very open about my admiration.\n\nI see 2 options he is interested in you romantically or he is just using you to stroke his ego.\n\n>  Will I totally freak him out? \n\nNo.\n\n> Should I wait for him?\n\nNo just tell him that you like him, and if he is interested in a romantic relationship. If he is a healthy ENTJ he will tell you what he wants.
4	It feels unequal. Human relationships are transactional and the unbalanced ones do not last.
1	If he's spending his time with you, it sounds like he enjoys having you around.  Go for it - you won't scare him.
7	Being used?	Hello everyone!\n\nThis isn't a post about what to do when being used but rather an open question, because of our traits of working hard and getting things done, do you find we get "used" more often than others?\n\nCouple of examples: online business idea/project where I have to do all the technical work (development, infrastructure, etc), develop core product, lead it and coordinate resources and have the pleasure of splitting the profit 50-50.\n\nPerson needs help for a job application, because of my experience they want me at 10pm to rewrite and shorten their 10 page CV to 2 for the next day. \n\nSlight rant there. Seem to keep finding myself both in work and outside in situations where people are short of demanding I do these things usually because they say "I'm asking you because I know you  will get it done". Pretty quick at calling these out and letting them fend for themselves. Always one sided with these relationships where you get nothing in return.\n\nHave any of you experienced similar situations?\n\nWhat's the most outrageous thing someone has asked you to do?
14	#Learn to say no.\n\nEven to things that you would otherwise be able to do, if you have been "used" by that person before.\n\nI've been a victim of that trap, but eventually I got tired of not being a) compensated or b) reciprocated for my work.\n\nIf it's someone you are obligated to do things for, one technique is to tell them that it will take you a few (hours/days/weeks) imply that if they need it sooner, they should ask someone else.\n\nIt's hard, if you think that people won't like you because you won't help them. It's fine, because they don't like you ~for you~ only for what you can do for them.
3	Yep, people use you for your productivity. Because it makes sense to, from their perspective. People would much rather get a fish for free than learn to fish.\n\nBut it sounds like you're on the right track by learning how to say no. For the collaborative things, you just need to carry them less / ask them to do more with the assumption that they won't carry their weight otherwise. By asking or telling them to do something, you introduce accountability for their actions (or lack thereof.)
3	The first thing that popped in my mind was when my mom asked me to come over and help her get stuff out of the attic  when I was 7 months pregnant.  
2	> Always one sided with these relationships where you get nothing in return.\n\nWhile practice also helps you, gradually move away from the users and start charging people for your work [more]. Just have an exit strategy. What if the answer is no? Are you willing too burn acuaintance-ship, business, employment? You must have the ability to walk away. 
2	Relax.\n\nBeing used is not as bad as being sued.
2	Happens quite often. They know shit will get done if I’m in charge of it. As long as it doesn’t get in the way of other projects and my productivity, I usually don’t mind. \n\nWith resumes I have helped out quite a few people. Some people can’t take the heat though. \nI helped my sister with her resume, I was very direct and told her how stupid some things she had added in were (you can’t just add a section with words with bullet points in between them; example: responsible•honest•time management•). She ended up feeling “attacked” because I wasn’t sugar coating my criticism and advice. I told her to quantify and have the result of any action or achievements reflect the qualities she had listed. \n
1	That is very generous. I find usually technical founders should receive less than 50% profit or revenue. Usually, a fixed pay or a percentage of the equity (around 30% is the norm).\n\nThis is because the development is a one-off job in the life cycle of the company; as a company grows, many interchangeable developers are utilised until someone takes a leadership position. \n\nFor instance, after building the core product, or website, adjustments are necessary but the company moves from that point into customer service (in the example of the online business). A startup fails usually due to lack of good customer service or a good product. \n\nIf you find yourself in a position where someone offers you 50% of the revenue, that is extremely generous. Most developers only receive initial funds to build a product or for equity. \n\nThis is because there is an influx of competitive developers who are willing to work for absolutely nothing who all have high skill sets (eg, China, India, South Korea). That is why as a developer, you need to develop good communication skills, and learn to be diplomatic. People will value your work, if you learn people-skills. \n\nI know many in demand developers, and it is not necessarily due to their technical skill set, but because they are just cool people everyone wants to hang out with and work with. 
9	I feel very alone.	I don't have any real life friends because I hate small talk, and \nI hate that they never talk about anything important.\n\nUnfortunately my extroverted part of me needs social interaction to remain healthy or I get unstable (I have psychosis) I hate that, but I need it. Any advice on how to get friends that I like would be appreciated. \n\nAs my username suggests I love debating with people because it is the only time when anything important gets discussed, but even then most people are horrifically bad at it, so I feel intellectually alone. I am open to people disagreeing with me it is actually fun, but most of the time their logic is just so bad it hurts.\n\nThe feeling of being alone is very intense. I also really hate it when people morally judge me with their horrible almost child like logic. This even happens with my damn family.\n\nI also hate how people talk they sugar coat everything, and never say what they are actually saying, and then blame me for not understanding them. The alternative I have is constantly being fake and manipulative, but that just increases the feeling of being alone.\n\nI fucking hate this, and it is depressing.\n\nIf you made it this far thank you.\n\n\n\n
7	You just need to meet more people. If you want intellectuals, then you need to be looking in places where they are likely to congregate... so put your brainpower to that end.\n\nGo join debating clubs, movie critics, book reading clubs, etc. \n\nAlso realise that while the things people talk about are not important to you, they might be super important to them. Before I was a dad I get 0 hoots about kids, and now they seem to be major topic of conversation. Times change, as do what's important in people's lives.
4	This might not be the answer you want to hear, but I have just learned to embrace it, if we get specific enough, we're all alone at some level anyway. Instead, I allow myself to become obsessed with whatever I want, & work towards it like crazy. I also have to allow myself to trust people at least enough to believe them, when they say they enjoy my time & company. Making a big difference, takes a lot of time, but if you at least know what you want & are doing something to get closer to it, no matter how big or small, it's still better than anyone who doesn't even try in the first place.\n\nI have also come to the conclusion that life has no inherit meaning, it's all pointless, which caused me to realize something amazing, we really can make our lives whatever we want, & that makes us more powerful than many of us will ever truly realize.
2	Totally second what /u/retsef said. Need to meet more people. For lack of a more exact term... Just put yourself where "smart people" would be. \n\nAs far as coping with small talk.. this may be generally poor advice, but instead of just going along with small talk, start making layered jabs within the small talk. Start twisting words and meaning more and you might be surprised to see who starts catching on to what you're doing.
2	pm me if you want to talk :)\n
1	You can skip small talk. Try going directly into topics you want to talk about with people. They'll generally let you know right away if they care to engage in it.
1	Will pray for you my friend.
3	Who's your favourite ENTJ personality?	I know that us ENTJ's like ourselves as a personality but I'm sure we have someone we look upto. Who's yours?
7	Possibly the wrong question, but is it possible to have nobody to look up to, & only be truly inspired by oneself?\n\nHaving said that, I found the quote "Do not compare yourself to others, if you do so, you are insulting yourself" one I seem to always remember.
3	Have a lot of different possible answers for this, but here’s a fun one: The Tick from the Amazon Prime series. He’s just a bulldozer of positivity and I love it.

0	Jiu Jitsu	Hi guys :) was wondering if anybody had experience with Jiu jitsu? Looking to start a new sport after summer break and this is my choice. If you have any tips or tricks i will be very glad <3
4	What does this have to do with MBTI
2	I did a full year of ju-jitsu and liked it. It's a very complete martial art, which displeased me at that time (late teenage years) because I was mostly relying on my strength and mobility, so I was all in for the kickboxing part (basically karate) and not so interested in grappling and seizing (judo and aikido part). I don't know if it's right to see jujitsu as a crossover between karate, aikido and judo, but I always did.\n\nNow, if you ask me to suggest a martial art, I will always go for savate (French kickboxing) because it's physically and strategically demanding. Full bodypower and stamina wasn't enough anymore, I got to stretch and practice accuracy.\n\nTips or tricks: practice yoga/stretching, cardio training and work out the trunk (abs, tights, ass). Makes your life easier when your brain has to compute immediate decisions about moving, dodging and striking.
2	If you mean Brazilian jiu-jitsu, then yes it's good for ground techniques using your opponents  weight. Though... Jiu Jitsu itself is probably not enough since most fights start standing but end on the ground. Jiu Jitsu is also good if you're smaller than your opponent.\n\nI recommend complimenting it with some other martial art of your choosing to deal with the initial fight when standing and have Jiu Jitsu as a backup/mixup/opportunity if you're ever in a pickle or your opponent is on the ground. \n\nOverall I think Jiu Jitsu is definitely a very useful martial art and looks kinky as fook...\n\nThis is based on my limited knowledge of the subject so there may be some biases that are not accurate.\n\nAh...don't forget to train your physical body as well.\n\n_Edit: I did not take a class in Jiu Jitsu_
1	Haven't practiced it myself, but I've recently started doing Krav Maga (street fighting oriented self defence) and I've been enjoying it a lot. Don't want to analyse it in regards to MBTI, but I'm sure there are aspects of feeling power and control, as well as knowing that you are more able to keep yourself and friends safe in a confrontation that you'd like. 
17	ENTJ relationships	I read some forums saying that people who date ENTJs feel like we're all always sizing them up or trying to see what we can get out of the situation. Not saying this is all ENTJs but I fit the description and I hate it. I understand that putting time into something like a relationship has to be beneficial for both parties. At the same time those closest to me tend to pick up on the fact that I'm constantly weighing the significance of the relationship.
21	Totally in this boat right now. I think as an ENTJ I recognize my own worth. I'm organized with my time and recognize the amount of mental resources I have to devote to people. If someone isn't returning the amount of time or resources I spend on them, it causes me to question whether the relationship is worth it.\n\nI wonder if that isn't actually a HEALTHY way to see relationships, though. You know your worth, the person is lucky to be with you. Shouldn't they be offering value the same way you offer value to them?\n\n
16	No. In my experience dating a ENTJ, if they choose to spend time with you they really like you and have ascertained your value early on, therefore are quite devoted and loving, a side not necessarily seen by others. I never felt sized up at all. Actually felt like I was put on a pedestal.
2	I don't think it's nearly as calculated as you make it seem. When I like someone (as a friend or more), I automatically assess their good and bad qualities and then make a decision regarding how close I want them to be to me. It has nothing to do with how much they do for me (I've certainly fallen for people who can't help me) as much as it has to do with whether I admire their qualities or not.\n\nObviously, my standards for who I keep really close are much higher than my standards for somebody I'll keep as an acquaintance. But once I think you'll gel with me, I'll study everything about you and boost your strengths and mitigate your weaknesses. It's less "What can this person do for me?" and more "How can I help this person be the best they can be?" when I fall in love.\n\nThat's also why I think ENTJs can run into problems with relationships. If an ENTJ decides you're worth it and puts time and effort into maintaining the relationship, they can be totally blindsided by actions exhibited by the other person that hurt the ENTJ or show that that person doesn't value the ENTJ as much as they value that person. I'm much more objective when it doesn't come to my love interests. This is probably why more experienced ENTJs appear very skeptical of people they know at first. We're incredibly vulnerable to the actions of other people once they make it through our walls. Sadly, the more I care about someone, the more damage I'll let them wreak on my inner mental state before I kick them out and change the locks.
3	I've gotten that before. When I was younger a couple girls complained that they felt like it was an interview (it is), and that killed the vibe, so now I hide my "interview" questions in silly conversation. It's more playful, and I haven't gotten the complaint since.
2	It's OK to question your relationships and develop standards and expectations but if you're wearing that on your sleave you're going to alienate people and find yourself with a dwindling social circle. 
2	Nothing wrong with sizing people up just make sure that if you are in a relationship with the person (friend, family, lover, whatever) you take some time to stop sizing them up every now and then and just appreciate that they are there and do something nice for them.
1	Step one, tell those you're most concerned about, that you feel this way.\n\nStep two, accept that even if you try to please everyone, you will upset a lot of people.\n\nStep three, accept that this is how you process situations/people but it doesn't make you worth less or more than the people around you, and if they can't accept you or wait to understand, then that is their loss, even though it will feel like your loss. \n\nWho gone love you if you can't love yoself!!! \n\nTLDR; own it, don't groan it
2	Sad ENTJ tested as INFJ?	I've been tested as an ENTJ many many times so I'm confident to conclude that I'm an ENTJ. But recently I've been feeling incredibly sad/upset because of personal problems and I decided to retake the test and got INFJ. \n\nI was honestly really surprised, but it kinda makes sense. Because I'm upset, I decide to introspect to understand my emotions and try and deal with them and fix them, and this in turn can cause me to be more F?\n\nWhat are your thoughts? And what do you guys usually turn into during periods of sadness, if you do at all.
4	I think personality tests are just a snapshot of who we are at the moment; we all change when we’re sad. Of course normal ENTJ you is testing as an INFJ. You’re depressed! You’re focused inward - give yourself time and don’t put too much stock in the fact that you’re testing a little differently.\n\nIt’s to be expected. \n\nInstead, take some magnesium (it boosts serotonin naturally), do some yoga, cut the alcohol and coffee and give yourself a small list of five things relating to self care you “must do” everyday; and remember above all to be kind to yourself (as my mom says).\n\nYou are worth kindness. So take care of yourself and nurture yourself.
2	It happened to me, but that was in high school. We were given 2 lines about each profile and told to pick the one that best fit us.\n\nThen in my first month at college I took an actual online test and got ENFP. But it was a very emotional time. Took it again and got ENTP. It didn't feel right though, and so I "tried on" ENTJ to see if it fit my actual personality better.\n\nIt did.\n\nThe thing is, once you get into a profile, you start to act like the profile subconsciously. It doesn't change who you are. And a wrong typing will cause a lot of cognitive dissonance between who you are and who you think you are.
2	Inferior Fi is quite different to aux Fe. I'd look into ENFJ too if I were you. 
2	ENTJs I find are very similar to INFPs \n\nbut...the TOTAL OPPOSITE of INFJs lol
2	I believe this happened to me.\n\nI rely on the cognitive functions to explain my understanding. \n\n[http://www.cognitiveprocesses.com/Cognitive-Functions/](http://www.cognitiveprocesses.com/Cognitive-Functions/)\n\nThis is all my interpretation of what I experienced.\n\nWhen I don't approach a situation with any Te, I can fall back on Ni. As an ENTJ when I lead with Ni I am either INFJ or INTJ. If I were to slip into INTJ, then the secondary function is Te again, and I loop back into an ENTJ way of thinking. Link shows of order of functions by MBTI:\n\n[https://falconnl.github.io/TypeSquare/](https://falconnl.github.io/TypeSquare/)\n\nIf I totally ignore Te, I have to be INFJ. Unfortunately, I'm not great at Fe, so I end up as a half-assed problem solver not relying on the mental processes which really make me tick (fully engaging Te and Ni together with a spice of Se to accomplish Fi is my personal definition of flow state). \n\nThis makes me sad, lazy, tired, and introverted if I keep it up for more than a few hours of a time. It also makes me really good at listening to people and understanding their problems and emotions. When I choose to fully engage Ni and temporarily drop Te, great things happen.\n\nI first recognized this could happen to me when I realized I had been trying to problem solve as an INFJ for months straight. During those months I could describe myself as sad and upset. I also wasn't as body aware and had no sex drive.
1	An ENTJs grip is introverted feeling, so it makes sense that you would get that result at this moment. 
1	I'm much more introverted when I'm sad and depressed. I think it's a function of how you feel in the moment.
2	How do you ENTJ’s deal with a challenge and what do you do when you lose it?	
15	What's a lose
9	Analyze the challenge to find the most beneficial outcome, act on it, of failure occurs take new information and adjust the plan.
6	Losses are information. The only thing stopping you from having unlimited upside, and zero downside is your mental resilience to pain, failure and trauma.
2	Well, just learn from it and move on. How am I suppose to grow as a human being if I'm just fixated on the thing that I lost on? \n\nA breakup, for example, can be challenging for an ENTJ because it'll feel like I could do something to fix it when the person doesn't want to do anything with me and move on. That's something an ENTJ has trouble with, losing something he put so much time and dedication for it all to be lost. \n\nTo conclude, the way I deal with it is to learn and move on; there is no point in reminiscing about the past.
2	I only care about losing at stuff I am good at. Everything else is irrelevant to me, as I don’t have the energy to be good at all things in life. I’ve strategically chosen what to excell at, and thus being bad at, say, board games or sports means very little to me. \n\nAlso, I love when my friends expect me to be a sore loser and I’m not. That really messes with their heads. 
1	Does MBTI even matter? Who cares	Is it really worth looking into analyzing people and categorizing them? Seems silly to spend so much time researching into this as some people are. 
12	It's fun and gives me a channel to let out my narcissistic energy so that my friends and family don't have to deal with it.
5	It's a useful tool but not an end-all-be-all, as you've noticed.  Similarly, why are you concerned with what other people do?
4	> Is it really worth looking into analyzing people and categorizing them?\n\nIf you want to be powerful yes.
3	Some people turn it into a bit of a time waster but others use it well. \n\nEx. We found out each other's in my team at work and it's a lot easier to work with each other.\n\nOr it can be just something for fun. I am INTJ and I like to find out what my friend's are after being friends for a while. Almost all my long term friends turned out to be INTJ, ENTJ, or another type that is compatible. \n\nIt can be a big time waster. When my team shared ours, my direct competition spent so much time researching himself that I was able to pull far ahead in that week's work and set another record. 
3	it's fun and that's all that matters. \n\n\nbut yeah some people do go crazy overboard. 
2	What a productive and meaningful post  
2	It makes you feel understood.
3	I recently retook the test and was given (ENTJ, -A/-T). Can someone explain the (-A/-T) portion to me? I’m having trouble finding anything online. Thanks much!	
5	It measures the Big5 dimension called Neuroticism, "A" standing for low Neuroticism.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroticism\n\n16p added that dichotomy so they seem more special, and because it's basically a Big5 test, not MBTI.
2	It is 16 personalities gimmick to try to get people to buy their stuff. It isn't standard MBTI.
1	I wouldn't rely on 16personalities as a valid source of information. 
0	entjs are like....?	i noticed that the entj willpower differs from the enfj willpower.entjs ni tends to be sharper and quicker(you know what i mean) while the enfj willpower tends to be more rounded and strong.entjs willpower is like a laser peircing a hole through a wall.while the entj willpower is like a bulldozer crashing through the wall...makes sense?
9	We talked about this. That is the clickbait title again. Stop doing it.
2	Your post history makes me laugh
40	Dating people less intelligent than you.	At the risk of sounding like a pompous asshole, I often find it difficult to connect with other people. I'm not sure why (and contrary to the title, I don't think it's because of intelligence per se). Hopefully we can figure it out:\n\n* **Most millennials these days have no sense of real purpose in their lives, and are distracted by things of trivial value to me.**\n\n* That being said, I think we can learn something from everyone. That being said, I think it is a valuable skill to learn how to interact with people in general. That being said, often times where people lack in intelligence, they can have great "social" or "emotional" intelligence, certainly areas of our own we can work on.\n\n* I love interacting with girls -- they can provide a different sense of energy and fulfill a different emotional/spiritual need that you can't get from your male counterparts.\n\nAssuming the previous three statements are true:\n\nThat being said, I find it difficult to connect with them. Because a lot of the people my age (20-30) don't really have a clear sense of purpose in life, they carry out their day in seemingly random fashion. This manifests itself as **(a) Flakes, "Ghosting", inability to set up or follow-through with plans, (b) Superficial mindless banter over Deep thoughtful discussion, (c) LOTS of uncertainty in relationships -- you can never really tell where you stand with someone, you'd have "friends" who you'd have a good time with BUT cannot rely on for support**. \n\nMaybe I'm the abnormal one: At a young age, vaguely speaking, I know what I want and I knew how to get what I want. Over the years throughout my adolescence, my direction has only become more clear, and my execution has only become more refined. This came about both as I improved my self-awareness (strengths and limitations) and my awareness of reality (what works, what doesn't). Today, everything in my life has a clear sense of purpose, everything has its place. *Mise-en-place*. Each morning I'm like a surgeon entering an operating room, a chef entering the kitchen -- everything is clearly laid out, everything has its purpose.\n\nBut it seems like most people don't.\n\nAnd because of that, they're like a leaf blowing in the wind. Their eyeballs mindlessly scrolling through social media instead of paying attention to what's right in front of them -- who they are, their sense of identity, their purpose.\n\nAnd I'm not sure how to connect with people like that.\n\n**I feel fucking alone**.
13	Stopped reading after the third "that being said".
28	You need to be aware that your life is full of purpose from your perspective, which may look empty for others. \n\nYou also shouldn't judge others with the apparent purpose of their lives, rather with the reasoning behind it.\n\n
11	[deleted]
17	You sound really, really young. First off: the difference in interactions between 18-20 year olds is totally different compared to 23-25 year olds for example. It gets better so give it time (or date older people, that's what I did at least).\n\nSome things:\n\n1. You *will* change direction multiple times over the next years. That's normal and okay. The perfect girl right now might not be perfect in a year or two from now. \n2. Quit judging people. It's a bad quality to have, and by only judging people against what you qualify as 'good enough' you will miss out on a lot of opportunities to learn and grow by looking for value in people who are different from you. You are doing you a disservice.\n3. Solve your own problems first and add a relationship in the mix after. A relationship will not solve your unhappiness or loneliness. Work on YOU and work to be the version of you which you are happy to live with the rest of your life, and multiply that happiness with a relationship with a woman that has the same strength of character and stability in life. 
8	I wish I could hug you.\n\nI know what you mean. There's only a few people I can connect to. Really connect to.\n\nOne of my favorite thinkers said this exactly "Not everyone is capable of abstract thinking", which is what I meant when I told my friend I don't think critical thinking is common at all.\n\nI need to have conversations of Mazlov levels 3+ to make any sort of connections with people.\n\nI can't speak at lower terms than that. I don't mean to sound like a douche, but I just can't. I have tried, believe me. It makes me & the other party uncomfortable.\n\n
8	Man, I’m sorry for you you’re sad, but two things:\nFirst, three thousand years of philosophy have not given a clear answer to the meaning of (one’s) life, so you should think about the fact that you think you’re better than Plato, Descartes or Nietzsche may indeed appear pompous to others.\nSecond, when you meet one asshole in one day, he’s an asshole. When you meet loads of assholes in one day, then you’re the asshole. 
6	I feel there is no one way to look at intelligence, my girlfriend and I are intelligent in separate things and that is something I enjoy. You have variety without compromising on craft. For instance, I'm a great stock investor and she is a software engineer, is emotionally intelligent, and a pleasure to have around. I am a dick so it all works out
3	You're not alone. I'm about your age, and I've felt this way too. If you have standards, you have to be more patient than people who are willing to make big compromises. You will find someone.
3	I relate and agree with everything you said, BUT...\n\n\> **I feel fucking alone**. \n\nThis comes not from a lack of interactions, it has something to do with being comfortable as the person you are. Accept being different, accept that you are the only responsible for being happy, with people or alone. Once you get that, you don't feel loneliness even if you don't speak to a human being for a few days straight. This feeling can be fixed. I believe having close friends, relatives with whom you have a strong bound which is honest and in which you can be fully yourself helps a lot.
1	Nice :P
1	I very much empathize with where you're coming from. I'd say that, over time, we have to accept the crushing fact that the majority of people we will ever meet will be qualitatively unfit for friendship or be worthy of a meaningful bond.\n\nThat's one part of it.\n\nI've been fortunate enough to not only find a partner, but a group of very close friends (3) who empathize with this and share that feeling of loneliness. Just actively spending time with them, and keeping myself busy with goals that I consider meaningful, are what keep me sane.\n\nI've known many other high-IQ, deep-thinking, people who feel this way, but failing to find genuine connections, allow themselves to fall into depression. Do not let that happen to you. Keep on hustling and hang tight to the people that actually give you joy. Ignore all else.
1	I'm kind of in the same boat. I feel very disconnected from my peers. \n\n
1	I've asked out many girls who were smart and attractive, to which, they agreed to go out. \n\nIt only takes that one "hey we need to reschedule" for me to completely cut them out of my life. Sometimes I feel like they are legitimately being honest and sometimes I feel like they are either scared or backing out for <insert reason here.> \n\nHowever, when we make plans, unless you're dying sick, don't send me a stupid text with a stupid reason. You better really sell that shit and make me believe it or you better delete my number.\n\nDoes this make me a bad person? I don't know, but all my friends are married to completely controlling women and I find playing the "game" with them leads to this exact scenario. I don't play games and I don't date bitches, especially stupid bitches.
1	I have the same problem as you do. It is frustrating to go on a date with someone and have them ramble about how they’re finally “finding” themselves (which in my opinion they might as well be saying they’re mindlessly drifting with no actual sense of purpose - one obviously builds themselves). I’m in that same age group and have accomplished plenty at my young age which most call intimidating, instantly reducing my interest in them because if they think that way, in my eyes they don’t think they’re at a level where they can challenge me. 
1	i totally understand how you feel. i’m a female ENTJ (24y/o) from a very conservative family. now imagine what dating is like for me.  But i’ve learned to accept that some people just don’t to have a big plan they can follow their whole life, like you and i think of it. My sisters big plan is to be a mother. thats it. for years i couldnt understand how that can be all she wants in life. like thats all that represents her as an individual. she has a boring office job cause she gets paid well and works office hours and weekends free. she doesnt dream big and tries to achieve that. she wants a comfortable life.
1	People are different and yes some people have no sense of purpose in life. That's because every person is shaped by their background and life experiences. What I mean is that , for example, this boy's parents died in a car crash and he is left nothing but only himself. Therefore, he might resort into inappropriate things  that have no purpose ( Some people).\n\nIndeed most people are shallow which is i absolutely hate but that's what they are. It's a reality.\n\nNo offense but you shouldn't judge those people you think are below you. Kind of sounds arrogant and condescending.\n\nFinally, accept people just the way they are\n\n
1	I'm an INFJ and feel the exact same way. \nIt's the perils of having a higher than average intelligence, overactive mind and a conscientious personality. 
0	What type is likely to be a Neoreactionary?	[Neoreactionaries and MBTI](https://iamlegionnaire.wordpress.com/2015/02/13/friday-night-fragments-15/)\n\nThe above link says no one in Neoreaction isn’t an NT Rational of some sort. Could this be true? The primary figure in Neoreaction (also known as the Dark Enlightenment) is Nick Land and he published a manifesto in 2012 which could viewed as follows:\n\n[The Dark Enlightenment, by Nick Land](http://www.thedarkenlightenment.com/the-dark-enlightenment-by-nick-land/)
8	I'd rate random-person-on-the-internet as being wrong with the link between NT and a neo-reactionary. N rarely cares for tradition and T isn't going to trade in this heaven for creating new affiliate marketing businesses to generate more market value. I would guess SF as being more likely to be NRx because of traditionalist and sentimental values.\n\nIf this is an attempt to spread NRx, it sucks and I hope you fail. Go find some flat-earthers to commiserate with.
4	How do I picked a career ?	I am asking help from this sub because I feel like ENTJ know everything or just a lot of things and all the one around me are the most successful I just one to make huge changes in my life . \n\nSo I am 22 years old and I failed my degree that I hated . I don’t want to force myself to do stuff that I don’t want anymore because I want to please my parents . Stuff happened in my life and Now I am like fuck it , I want to start all over again . So I took the Clifton strengths finder test and they told me my 5 strengths are : thinker , brainstormer, strategist, empathizer and philomath\n\nThe thing is I don’t know what does it mean ? If you could tell me the type of career where I could be useful I would be glad . Because I have no idea of where to go . I am not good at math . But I love economics business startup and everything tech relate. I also enjoy politics, international relation but I am more thrilled buy the startup world lately .\n\nData scientist, Business analyst , Investor , Entrepreneur ( I have a few ideas but it’s not a good reasons to start) I don’t know and I would like more help thanks for reading\n\n
6	Have you had a go at programming? I know a few ENTJs worked their way up from software engineer into software project management and they love it. 
3	From one ENFP to another, work on hammering out your commitments. I have been heavily influenced by my ENTJ twin brother to exhibit these traits and I am much more successful for it.\n\nAs far as options go, scratch most of the things you listed if math is a weak point (especially data science). Although, your math skills are probably better than you credit yourself for. You might have had teachers that could not hold your focus and fail to capture your interest.\n\nSecondly, I'd recommend honing a technical skill. I have my undergrad in business management and spent 4 years as an officer in the US army. Your be surprised at how unwanted unskilled management is these days.  I don't have a useful enough set of technical skills to fill positions I would want.  Thus I'm starting a paramedic course in order to add a skill to my leadership experience.\n\nDo you anything in particular that you would like to do? 
1	Hi there ENTJ 3w2 sp/so here. So, I understand the struggle there, but I had enough determination to get through it. I am a 3w2 so people and their influence is big.\n\nFirst step is to recognize this and then to try to please nobody but yourself. Does it make me happy? Is this what I am good at? Do I think I will be successful, and not what Joe or bob or mary thinks? Who’s influence is this, is this my own opinion? I would worry less about finding what to do for the moment but engage in self-identification. What are my hobbies? My interest? What do I believe in? Where do I stand on issues? What do I see as successful and a good life? What job can I do happily and make me at least stable? In fact, why do I even want a job?\n\nNot everyone is an NT. Not everyone is going to like school or learning. I’ll read anything, varaciously, anything academic, but not so everyone. So, don’t beat yourself up over that. Figure out your priorities first then maybe then you can figure out how to set goals for them. Goal setting is integral to your success but you can’t set any goals if you don’t even know who you are or what exactly you want. I know this too well. I am 25 and in school for 7 years now, entering in my 8th year. All because of failed goals which were too idealistic, grand, or unrealistic goals.\n\nI hope that helps you a bit? Ask or stay in contact if you need help. I went through this myself.
1	What did you do with your time when you were a teenager? What do you generally default to doing now? Those will show you what you are the most passionate and probably the best at. If you can and want to transform those into a career you'll be pretty set.\n\nFor the ones you brought up at the end:\n\n* Data science is basically just statistics. Skip it unless stats really are fun.\n* Business analyst, and related: product owner, project management, agile coach, are generally decent to good fits for ENFPs.\n* Scratch investor off the list. That isn't realistic.\n* For entrepreneur, I have serious doubts and reservations about the success you would be able to find in that right field now. You are still very young and haven't had a lot of time to become a fully integrated person yet and also haven't had time to integrate any sizable portion of aspects of the world out there into your worldview yet. You need to be one of the absolute most passionate people in the world about what your business will focus on or you won't be able to survive let alone compete. That kind of passion isn't asking these questions.
1	So I'm just an INTP here spying on everyone (¬\_¬)\n\nBut if you can tolerate taking one more career test, I built [Career Test Guru](https://www.careertest.guru) for just this purpose. I've found people looking for a change are able to glean much more meaning from a test like this than people just starting out realizing what they're interested in.\n\nAnyway, my test leverages data from [O\*NET](https://www.onetonline.org/) (comprehensive jobs data maintained by the US government). And I've tried to build a test that's bit more fun/less boring than others you've probably seen. I'd say it's more practical, modern, and realistic. And totally free of course.\n\nKeep in mind, obviously your Career Test Guru results are not the be-all end-all answer to everything. But it will show you new paths you hadn't considered, lots of detail relevant to you, and maybe show you a new side to yourself. Good luck!
1	I did an Apprenticeship that i didnt wanna do to begin with, only because i wanted to please my parents. i barely graduated but only because i perfom good under pressure. i learned 3 years worth of school in 4 days. After i graduated i got a job offer at the same place i did my apprenticeship. i had it so good but i was too spoiled. i didnt know how fucked up other jobs are but i didnt like it so i ended up calling in sick a lot and got a really bad review at the end. this totally ruined my chance of getting another job in my field.  \n\n\n\n i spent 3 years to find some sort of other education for another proficiency. i did all sorts of tests and research to help me find something but nothing really made my heart race. i was unemployed for almost 2 years and went really down the rabbit hole cause i thought i ruined my life with this decision and didnt know what to do after doing so much research. i ended up working parttime as a promoter and then i realized i wanna be my own boss. after some time i had a business idea. now im working on that while im working in retail (cause thats the only thing i can endure to do for money and that im qualified for) and i hope for the best with my business idea. \n\nwhat ive learned: don’t  start an education  just to please your parents. try to figure out what you want and get any job. at least to earn some money in the meantime while you sort things out. ive lost a couple of years because i wanted to please my parents
2	Will reading a lot (3-4 hours a day) make me smarter/more successful?	Hi, I am always wondering if reading investment books, self help books, etc. Actually  benefit you.\n\nIs time better spent networking, joining communities, or initiating business ventures and learning on the fly?\n\nI am ambitious but reading seems to be the only thing that I can do to make me feel as if I am doing something that will help me improve.
3	Reading is an inefficient way to learn. Do things don't read about them. That is the best way to learn.
2	Okay so ENTJ Ni subtype probably, here. I am wondering if those others are actually ENTJ or NTs. I would say to say either extreme is a good thing is unhealthy. You can learn great and inordinate amounts of things from people. You can do to learn, and that is the way I seem to learn best. However, I wouldn’t discount reading, honestly. As an NT I can be really intellectual. I also read to learn and have read volumes of different types of books. As an NT I tend to spoute off inordinate amount of information. My advice is to have some sort of balance between the two. I know what I am talking about in terms of politics, history, philosophy, and other humanities. I am known to be intellectual and nerdy but I do socialize well. I am majoring in communications. I think books and reading things can provide with the abstract concepts and theories and can feed your conversations and your overall  knowledge. It can increase your conceptual knowledge. So, I do encourage you to continue to read voraciously, but also don’t forget to socialize. I don’t see why you can’t do both, absolutely.
2	I'm a typical entj. I'm successful, pretty good at anything I turn my hand to. I have an insatiable desire to learn all the time and am obsessed with doing that efficiently. This has provided me with a lot of skills.\n\nI've always read a lot. I'm at a point in my career now where everything is about understanding people, managing people, building effective relationships. Anyone who is successful in their field will get to this point. I strongly feel that those skills in particular are are improved through reading a wide range of things.  I read bographies, history books, non-fiction, self-help, pop-science. It's all useful in building a broader knowledgebase and understanding of different people and the way they see the world. \n\nBeing well-read also helps with your own communication: writing, speaking, understanding.\n\nI'd also say that the best of humanity is in our books. Take a typically movie adaptation of a book, the book is always 100x richer.\n\nYou may be able to learn things quickly with youtube videos etc but i think you need to read a lot to be wise. 
2	Reading isn't as good as doing. People that usually foist "read more!" on people generally suffer from using reading as a buffer to insulate themselves from doing. However, reading is an excellent starting point. It can be used to hone you and your experience at a decently low cost. Once you've passed that starting point though swap the book for doing an actually accomplish something.\n\nMost networking is extremely lame. You'll want to be able to filter all the noise for what events and conferences are the most valuable to attend. Find a few thought leaders in your field on what-have-you social media platform and see where they decide to spend their time.\n\nJoining communities is also generally low value. It should really be considered entertainment time.
2	Retention from books is extremely low. Consider making flashcards if you're going to read for anything other than pleasure. Or perhaps a subject that isn't too complex but you're for some reason completely in the dark on.
1	Anyone can write a book. Most authors are full of shit. Including those who made a killing in a stock market once. I would start with Nassim Taleb's work so that you can see for yourself how full of shit most of the so-called experts are. Also I would read like one or two books per month, not more. Quality over quantity.
1	That amount is just plain unecessary. 1 hour is more than enough, and there are plentiful of other ways to learn.
1	It's hard to guess the specific effects as they depend on what kinds of books you read, whether you actually apply the information to something or just go "neat" and move on. In general, reading a lot will make you better at reading a lot. Is that something you need for your personal success?
0	>Hi, I am always wondering if reading investment books, self help books, etc. Actually benefit you.\n\nNo, not really as they're too long and don't really get straight to the point.\n\n>Is time better spent networking, joining communities, or initiating business ventures and learning on the fly?\n\nNow that sounds better and I would say even the internet is better than reading paper copy books despite potential misleading and/or propaganda kinds of stuff.\n\n>I am ambitious but reading seems to be the only thing that I can do to make me feel as if I am doing something that will help me improve.\n\nI guess you're in a helpless situation then.
22	I [28F] Just Found Out I'm an ENTJ: This Explains Everything	It really does - and was somewhat comforting too. Like an "ah-ha!" moment. \n\nMy biggest thing with dating lately that's made me uncomfortable is admitting to who I am - strong-willed, stubborn, independent, decisive, and selective about who I'm emotionally open with. I always feel like I need to be this sweet, docile, little thing; I am not that type.\n\nBut for whatever odd reason, somehow this has made me feel a little more comfortable owning up to my ENTJness. And like that. 
10	Congrats! I’m also a 28F ENTJ, and I agree - it’s taken me a while to fully accept who I am and to be okay with not having conventionally “feminine” personality traits. \n\nI recommend listening to this episode of the Personality Hacker podcast, “Advice for NT Women” (episode 94): \n\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/ca/podcast/personality-hacker-podcast/id793330058?mt=2&i=1000378080388
11	Congratulations on having backbone and being proud of it. It's not necessarily the most convenient thing in the world but it's definitely rewarding.
6	welcome to the dark side of the force
4	welcome aboard. awareness is the first step, now harness all of this new found knowledge and let it guide you in love and life. do you, boo-boo.
4	I was 28 when I rediscovered I was ENTJ and really got into MBTI. It was eye opening for me. 5 years later and it’s still illuminating things for me. Welcome. 
4	I was 19 when I realized it was totally okay to discard the image of who I wanted to be in favor of who I was, and I have been much happier for it!\n\nMaybe I'm not sweet and docile, but I'm compassionate and not afraid to fight for what I want. And the less afraid I have been about showing up as the person I really am, the more accepting others have been.
6	Congratulations from a 24F ENTJ! 
3	"selective about who I'm emotionally open with"\nI agree with all others but I'm not sure this is an ENTJ trait though? I'm emotionally open with everyone...
3	ENTJ’s on a typical day, when you sense competition or a challenge that seems impossible, what do you do to buckle up?	
11	I don't
4	Are there competitions or challenges that are impossible? Some might not be worth my time, but I get done whatever I decide to get done without having to “buckle up.”\nThere I go taking things too seriously again 😏
2	Well, I'm going through something emotionally challenging right now. To me it seems kinda fun to try and beat it although I can't rush it and it's kinda painful for it to linger on in my mind.
2	Seems impossible to whom?I ask myself why it seems impossible to me, set goals to achieve it, and see if it gets anywhere. Is research about this topic possible, if so I’ll read about it. If not, I’ll just take a stab.\n\nIf it’s seeming impossible to others I love proving them wrong and why indeed it is in fact not impossible.
2	I’m extremely competitive - I very much have, “I’m going to succeed or die trying” mentality.
6	ENTP looking to befriend ENTJs	I'm an ENTP-A 7w8 male who, having had an ESTJ-A mom, grew up being obsessed with efficiency but my personality and my values conflicted each other heavily. Always admired Napoleon (ENTJ) as a kid and wanted to make a change, yet it looked like too much work and I would usually end up just admiring the view from my Ne passive perspective.\n\nI want to know more about you guys, and ask what you think about us! 
6	Whereas the ENTP is always joking and always has their guard up, the ENTJ has to work extra hard to relax and detach themselves from the situation at hand. This is why Napoleon was such a hot-head and easily taunted. \n\nLike ESFPs the ENTJ is subject to bouts of frustration and rage from faulty logic leading them astray. Te logic and Ni vision often have the result of expectations not meeting reality.\n\nThis happens so much growing up that ENTJs often overcompensate and learn quickly to confirm that what they know is fact and to make less assumptions. While the ENTP does this naturally, they don't jump into action nearly as often since they don't make great use of their knowledge in a physical sense.\n\nThe ENTJ becomes efficient about their life but at the cost of not actually having enough of a social life if they don't work extra hard to maintain it. You'll find the best ENTJs work to develop their personality since they are group oriented achievers. But nobody wants to be in a group with someone who is lame. Now imagine trying to teach a robot how to behave in social situations. Once they "get" it they are quite good at it. Just like some INTJ are quite surprisingly good with people.\n\nThe trick to having an ENTJ friend is to constantly challenge them and break their egos down. An ENTJ who lashes out at you for this is not worth your time. But one who can take the jokes and use your keen ENTP perceptions of them (they have poor self awareness) they will become an unmatched peer in the art of memes and debauchery.\n\n
5	I like ENTPs and their energy. Many of my good friends are Enneagram 7’s. What do you want to know?\n
4	I have an ENTP friend that also has a ESTJ mom. We both also share an ENTJ friend and I can say that even though we all get along and have a good time the INTJ (me) and ENTP friendship is stronger. We both kind of feel like we are secondary friends to the ENTJ because the three of us only met in college while he still had his neighborhood childhood friends (one of whom is also an ENTP) that he puts bigger priority on.\n\nMy ENTP friend also had that whole idea that he could learn how to be more active from the ENTJ but he then figured out that the *type* of change the ENTJ provides is not the type of change he wants to provide. You have to understand that the end goal of Te and Fi people (ENTJ, INTJ, ISTJ, ESTJ and all the xxFP types) isn't a rational ideal but and emotional ideal. If reality is breaking our emotional ideal (aka making us feel bad) we'll use our reason and logic (Te) to change reality until it's more in the accords with our emotional ideals. Napoleon didn't change Europe because he *thought* aristocracy was an *irrational* system but because he *felt* that it was a *bad* system. For Te people ideas are fleeting things and there is no motivation to work for them unlike Fi feelings that last us for day, months or years. For you as a Fe person emotions are fleeting and ideas (Ti) everlasting so there is nothing you can learn from ENTJs (or any other Te-Fi type) to become more active because all the advice you'll get is either a plethora of disconnected tool like logic advice on how to bridge the gap from reality to your inner emotional desire or how to spark your own inner emotional desires. \n\nThe Ti Fe desires stem from the world making sense, being rational, efficient. The anchoring point of your ego is the ability to choose rationally from all the options and pick the most efficient judgment on how the world works. You'll spring into action when that ideal is not aligned with reality, when the world is slipping out of the optimal system you figured out/decided that is the most efficient one. That's not how we Te people see efficiency. Efficiency is just a tool to close the gab between reality and our emotional ideals as fast as possible. "Is this system haphazardly put together and will only work for 2 days"; "Yes but it's enough time to get the thing I wan't and move on to getting other things I want" \n\nI'm not saying that you shouldn't befriend an ENTJ far from it but don't expect to learn from us Te people in general about personal growth. If you want to learn how to focus your life and complete projects learn from top tier Si users (ISTJ, ISFJ, ESTJ, ESFJ) and if you want to learn how to navigate the waters of people and how to heard them in proper directions learn from top tier Fe users (INFJ, ISFJ, ENFJ, ESFJ)\n\nEdit: spelling
4	I want to date an ENTP, but I only really know one right now, and I'm pretty sure he's a sociopath, though he's charming and attractive nonetheless.
3	Could you share what being obsessed with efficiency means to you? You admired it as a value but couldn't intuitively prioritize it in your life? How would you rate yourself on efficiency from 1 to 10?
8	How does depression manifest in an ENTJ?	Additionally, what kind of support would a depressed ENTJ like from their friends?
19	For me it's a general sense of uselessness that spreads to specific areas of my life and I begin feeling like I can't fix the problems anymore because I let them get out of hand due to my own incompetence and as I over analyze it I feel more useless than before and the cycle continues until I get enough mental stability to say "enough" and GSD anyway.
14	My house gets messy and I get listless and start drinking more. I usually start watching tv shows and quit journaling, too. I also get insomnia and struggle to work out. I go from driven, dream-focused, and full of plans for the future to a slob who pretends to have it together for everyone else. Most people wouldn’t guess that I was struggling unless I let them in my house.
6	Depressed ENTJ here\n\nDepression can be wildly different, and not just due to personality type. \n\nMy depression is of the "dangerously high functioning, prone to over work and crash" variety . Think Elsa from Frozen. \n\nGood ways to support are to allow the individual to choose the course of action for your support. If they don't know their support choices offer the following: give space, distract from issue, listen (nonjudgementally!) or help talk through issues and feelings. \n\nDont default to the last one unless asked. Not helpful. 
6	ENTJ's aren't depressed/suicidal because of abuse, that just drives their hatred and makes them want to fight back. ENTJ's are suicidal because of the lack of meaning, or emptiness. Just not being able to accomplish anything.
4	I have bipolar disorder, so I have a solid history of depression. Most notably, my depressive episodes in the past have featured irrational guilt and incessant rumination, the goal of which was always to find a reason to justify whatever I was feeling guilty about, to thereby end the episode. To analogize, think of a person who is drowning, struggling to come up for air: this is what my past depressive episodes have felt like. I would definitely describe these episodes as painful.\n\nAlthough people afflicted with bipolar disorder experience full-blown episodes, we don't need to be in the midst of an episode to feel depressed. On the contrary. People with bipolar disorder feel depressed very very often, as we are affected by life's seasons more deeply than neurotypical people. Commonly I'll get depressed when I fail to achieve my goals, which will leave me feeling like a loser. Moreover, often I feel depressed if I feel like my social status has been weakened, which will make me feel lonely, embarrassed, and less confident: I may withdraw and refrain from socializing (even though I want to), which may lead others to think I'm timid, which will make me feel even more embarrassed.\n\nA caveat: I'm sure many ENTJs will report similar experiences, as you can clearly identify typical ENTJ traits in my experiences, e.g., incessant persistence. That said, we can't over-attribute things to personality type, neglecting to talk about personal experiences and background. For example, my struggles with guilt in particular may bear some relation to my ENTJ-ness, but the fact that I attended Catholic school for 11 years didn't help either. Similarly, I've read a couple times now that ENTJs typically don't have super high social status in high school, even though later in life ENTJs of most any species display qualities typical of the alpha-male or CEO archetypes. Thus, probably many ENTJs have similar hangups about their social status. Even so, you must also take into account that, as a child, I was dealing with additional challenges that most other kids (including ENTJ kids) were not: being ADHD, gay, obese (not anymore), gifted, and mentally ill; all of which made it especially difficult to fit in with the other kids. All those things notwithstanding, I had decently high social status in junior high, high school, etc., but these things deeply affected me, so I'd venture the guess that I have more of a hangup about social status than the average ENTJ. In fact, most ENTJs at my age, 26, probably think about social status mostly subconsciously.\n\nI want to say, though, that, these days, I struggle more with anger than depression, which is unsurprising, as I'm a type-8 ENTJ. Also, in spite of everything, I consider myself a happy person who is excited about the future. Depression is a staple in my life, though.\n\n***Edit:***\n\nI forgot to answer your question about the kind of support I want from loved ones when I'm depressed. Definitely during my most severe episodes in my childhood, I wished my parents had noticed that I was severely depressed and had taken action to get me help. (My parents were busy working all the time, and when they weren't working, they wanted to relax, not take care of children.) Now that I'm an adult, though, I don't really expect support from anyone. I view my mental health problems as things I need to take care of personally, in conjunction only with my psychiatrist and clinical psychologist. It's difficult for me to even imagine how my friends and family would help. I don't really know what they'd really do. It's nice, though, when they give small signs every now and then that show they remember that you struggle with depression and that they're there to help you if you ever want them to, even though they recognize it's not really your style to ask for help.
2	I’m not sure if I’ve been depressed, I’m not sure can’t say, I’ll need more input from people to say that. \n\nOn the other hand, I’ve definitely been low (not sad, there’s a difference) for days on stretch and I’ve either ended up not doing anything (I have ADHD) and feeling completely useless. The tough principal in me talks shit to me. \n\nOr else you can use those feelings to do better for yourself and I’ve only lately been ever be able to do that. Let’s say it’s been almost around 7-8 years since I’ve used the negative energy and turned it into a positive in my own way and did better off for myself. \n\nI am pretty optimistic. I’m not stupid-optimistic, but yes, I’m optimistic. Optimism can truly move you forward even in the tougher times. 
2	What kind of depression? Is it dysthymia or is it major depressive disorder?\n\nDoes she/he visit a psychiatrist, attend psychotherapy?
2	[deleted]
2	Extreme guilt over trivial things, belittling and even demonizing myself. Usually I'm much a talkative and open person, until the big D comes and eats me up, I'll become very withdrawn and appearing without ambitions at all. To be honest my heart has hardened too early on at age 22.
8	Where can I find an INTP	What is the easiest way to identify one? 
6	>What is the easiest way to identify one? \n\nYou don't haha 😂.\n\n----\nSerious answer: \n\nStatistically speaking...If I had to make an intellectual guess...probably in the STEM field, with more focus on computers and programming....\n\nIn terms of appearance...they would probably wear dark colors. They have no fashion sense, preferring comfort over looks_(Ex: Wearing pajamas to the grocery store, wearing their favorite video game shirt to a formal gathering)_ and look tired all the time even if they're not. Probably show little to no emotion. Not paying attention to their surroundings. \n\n_(Be careful though because an older INTP or any older type for that matter, would develop their inferior functions making it hard to tell...which requires more time and effort to know the person.)_\n\nThey keep to themselves, don't talk much....walk slow to take their jolly good time thinking about stuff... _(If there's a strict appointment with high importance, this may be an exception.)_\n\nFor dating, I guess you could follow the stereotypical introverted bookworm of trying to find an INTP in a library but I don't see how that would help since a library is meant for peace and focus. \n\nHail, even I don't go to the library everyday, preferring to just be on my computer in the comfort of my own place browsing the internet. And the times I do go to a library are mostly because I have a big assignment that is due and don't want any people bothering me.\n\n----\n\nHowever, I realize this and so I'm basing my life goal on actually **_finding you ENTJ's_** with the intent of being either best friends or business partners or both. So gender roles don't apply. \n\nI know as an INTP, I can't do everything by myself so I definitely need a close group of trusted friends to make at least one of my big ideas a reality haha.\n\nWe can be like the next Facebook or Google!\n\nThough it won't be until a few years that I will meet one of you but when we do...\n\n❤ Let's change the world together! ❤\n😊\n\n----\nOne other note:\n\n...Sorry but I still prefer INTJ's as the best compatible romance partner due to the assumption that they will have more in common because of their introverted side.
5	I was in a relationship with an INTP for about 10 months and we were the perfect match. Never had anything so exhilarating and so intense - even though we‘re both the rational type. But when you have the feeling your partner just gets you and you keep having aha-moments and can analyze the world together, it‘s very bonding. \nWe broke up because of changes in personal situation but we are still very close. \n\nWhere you can find them? Mine is a smart, hard working guy with a high corporate position. It was total coincidence that we met. \n
3	The INTP I know keeps to themselves but has zero problems socialising. They have a healthy group of friends/acquaintances but tend not to initiate any plans unless they're very close to the other person. Risk-averse and an efficient worker. A solid person all around.\n\nAnyway you're definitely going to have to take the first step in getting to know a potential INTP. Unless you share a lot of common interests.
7	Overrated. They're really lazy. I know one. I wouldn't say he's my best friend cause my definition of that is a business partner.\n\nBut yeah, to sum it up? He's clueless, indecisive, so fucking indecisive... He just cannot make up his damn mind to work for money and improve his life.\n\nI don't know. They're super chill and not easily offended for sure.
2	I know a few. They’re either in the woods all alone or hiding in the recesses of their local library. 
2	A book store
2	yo\n\nwanna be my travel buddy
2	In your dream.
1	🖑
1	I can't even spot them in public and I'm INTP. I would say it's dependant upon interests and hobbies which in my case are always changing. Game, book and music stores would be a good start or other places with free WiFi.
1	You just used it 
1	Where is pretty easy: you're already on Reddit. We're rare enough birds that you're probably better off going to a website where we congregate, and then finding a (single?) one that lives in your area than trying to find and identify one in the wild.\n\nAs for identifying one in the wild, well, there's probably type-watching web-pages out there that could tell you better than I could. Good chance you do actually already know one, but could be a bit of a job flushing them out of their book-ladden den.
1	As a male INTP, I'd say: "You can't." I keep to myself and only talk to people that talk to me. Basically, look for someone who's generally alone and studying something intensely. Look for someone who stares at you and thinks/hopes you don't notice. INTP = I never talk to people. Generally, I only talk to people who engage me, and I won't continue talking to them unless they talk about things that go beyond surface level. 
7	Including Fi in decision making process... Or how to stop hitting the same dead end?	Hi! My post/question may not even be tailored to all ENTJs, but here it goes. \n\nI have stayed in a habit of dismissing my own needs and desires (Fi) my whole life. Everything I try to do falls apart because my Fi eventually intrudes telling me, "This thing you're doing... you don't even care about it, do you? Neither do you even want it in the first place." Then I give up on the thing, go and try to "solve" my emotions, but I usually cannot handle dealing with them for too long, so I dismiss them. The problem is that I continue to possess an incomplete, shallow and skewed understanding of my own needs, or what the turmoil meant, and so the process eventually repeats itself. (To be honest, I never realized that this was the actual problem, but now I don't know how to solve it.)\n\nResult? My life is in shambles, I am dysfunctional, and I am disconnected from myself enough to not be able to make important life decisions or understand what I actually want. Cynicism and existential issues are also present, where every Se experience seems rather pointless because I don't understand what's important.\n\nLastly, when I try to engage in Fi, my Te tramples on it, telling it it's too self-indulgent and not serious enough. \n\nBasically, my functions are underdeveloped, in MBTI terms, due to some unfortunate events in childhood. Yikes.\n\nHave any of you dealt with a similar issue? Perhaps not to this extent. I know that ENTJs are known for their rather strong Fi stances, and I want it as well. I miss certainty and I don't want to hit the same dead end anymore. How do you, ENTJs, reconnect with yourselves, and, most importantly, know what you really want? \n\nThanks so much in advance. And sorry if the post is confusing.
5	I think a lot of entj's have this problem when they're younger, at the very least I did. I was really unhappy with the direction my life was headed and I basically stopped caring about myself. You need to work through whatever it was in your childhood that kept you from fully developing. This might mean taking a little break from advancing your career to focus on yourself. That's not something that comes easy to us but if you can do it you can come out of it a better, more well rounded person, and then you can actually put all your attention to furthering other aspects of your life.
4	Your Fi is a notification system for your brain. I'm sure you don't click EVERY Facebook notification or EVERY Email, you look at the notification heading or the email subject and decide if it's important. You still look to see what it says though to make sure it's not something important, because if you don't you may miss something huge. Then again it may be spam.\n\nThe point is pay attention to your emotions, but don't let them control you. Acknowledge them, understand them, logically choose whether to act on them or not, then let it go or let it fuel your next actions. If this is difficult to do in the beginning then every time you realize you feel some new emotion mentally make a "ding!" Sound. It will help you see your emotions more as a tool and less as an out of control car you're sitting in.
1	Have you considered therapy or reading about therapy techniques? I see some ENTJs on this board dismissing emotions and I'm glad to see you're trying not to. It can be hard to tune in. I had a Not Great childhood as well, which made me more in touch with what I wanted/my emotions (although I dealt with some emotional numbness and am trying to work past that). \n\n\nI think a big problem is dismissing your emotions. I do it as well, and I think it's normal (especially for our type) to not want to be weak or imperfect. But it helps me to look at emotions and wants and desires logically. Not just as in analyzing why you feel that way, but in that it's human nature to get emotional whether you want to or not. I think a big thing that's helped me is just acknowledging how I feel and even if it's kind of dumb, recognizing that sometimes you feel things that are disproportionate or make no logical sense. Sometimes you just feel like shit. There won't always be a reason, and if you had a bad childhood, sometimes things just sting more than you'd think or want them to. \n\n\nI think asking for help, even from randos on the internet, is a good first step. You seem like you've been focusing on other people for a long time. Maybe you had to be a caretaker in your childhood and push your own needs away? I did, and it's hard to pull yourself out of. I don't really know how to get back in touch -- for me it was getting off the medicine I was on and a few life events that made me realize I'd completely forgotten what I wanted -- but that's going to be different for everyone. What are you in your wildest fantasies? What is it that you imagine yourself doing more than anything, but push away for being stupid or unrealistic? Even if you can't do that exact thing, maybe you can do something close enough. Even if it's a bit illogical or unrealistic, it's better than waking up when you're like 40 and realizing you've wasted your whole life. 
1	You need philosophy (Ayn Rand) and behavioral neuroscience, more concepts, more information imo.
1	I assume that my emotions have logical sources. They may be momentary, vague feelings but they've been created from logical responses to past events. If I'm feeling an emotion and I have the time to introspect it, I'll ask myself "why do I feel that? Where is it coming from? What memories arise when I think about it?". I continue asking those questions until I'm certain I know all the logical pieces involved with the emotion.\n\nIn daily life, I consciously work to include my emotions beside or inside the abstract swimming pool of logical concepts my Ni process pulls from. They're important factors to consider, even if I choose to ignore them in a decision (I usually regret ignoring them in hindsight).\n\nMonthly-ish, I set aside at least 3 hours to structure out my long term and short term goals, and similar to when I inspect my emotions, I'll repeatedly ask myself 'Why do I want that?' until I feel certain I know all of the reasons I want to pursue something. There is a lot of self work involved here. I freakin' love these days. I feel renewed and focused for at least the week following.\n\nOnce or twice I year I do the monthly exercise, but block off an entire day and include a small mushroom dose. This turns out to be as much as I can take while still wanting to and being capable of journaling for 4+ hours.
0	i got bullied in high school by entjs	believe it or not the estps didnt actualy bully me,it was mostly entjs,i dont know why...lool..?
8	Seems like you have a wrong depiction of ENTJs (you're not the first, neither the last).
6	When I learned that knocking someone the fuck out stops everyone from bullying you; I started turning into the people who bullied me for a while. I think it is more of an abuse cycle thing than a personality type.
4	I'm going to guess high school was last week and you really haven't experienced enough of "life" to truly know what you're talking about. No offense, but you don't get the luxury of assuming the people who bullied you in high school are ENTJ just "because" -- furthermore, ENTJ would likely find it pointless to bully you, as it does not advance their grand plan or solve a problem. ENTJ would think that it would be wasted effort and move on to bigger things. \n\nReminds me of Easter as a child; why go search for all the eggs when you know there is a bag of chocolate inside? Seems pointless when you have a more efficient solution. 
3	Bullies are less of a personality type thing. I know feeling bullies who use emotions to bully people. I know perceiving people who are bullies. You cannot tell someone's personality type based on them bullying you. Why do you think they were ENTJs?
2	That's interesting. I've never met an ENTJ who hadn't been an outcast for long enough to have developed a sense of comradeship with bullying victims; most of those I know only tended to really show their "I'm an ENTJ bastard" colours when they were like 14-16. However, knowing myself and others, we're definitely the right type for it.\n\nIt's really bad that you had to deal with it. Did the bullies seem emotionally immature? - my guess would be that they didn't know how to handle their emotions and felt the need to dominate others to make themselves feel rational and in control.
4	entjs how did you deal with bullies?	entjs in high school how did you deal with bullies?,
3	Bullies fees on your anguish.  Get rid of that and you win.  Any way you slice it, you have to force yourself to mature a bit.  As a male, your options are cool off and develop a thicker skin (this is the easier option for smaller guys) or get tough and be ready to intimidate them into not bullying you (easier for bigger guys). You can’t change anyone but yourself. Remember that. It’s key advice.
2	Be tough back and lay out my expectations for their behaviors and consequences if they don’t follow through. I don’t tolerate bullies picking on people who can’t stand up to them.
2	Confront them. That will 1. Surprise them. 2. Most likely make them stop unless you bail out.
2	As a kid, I punched them. As an adult, I don't get bullied because I look like I'd punch them.

2	Yeah, our dubble edged sword. All work no play I’m afraid. Can’t speak for everyone though
7	Your Goals	Hey Fellow ENTJS \n\nI was wondering since EnTJ are very ambitious and look at the Big Picture. Thought okay I want to know your big picture and Plan to get toward your goal.\n\nWhat is the big picture?\nHow do you plan of achieving this goal? \nIf you have a plan what are the steps?\nHow many steps have you done ? 
7	[deleted]
4	Put simply...most ENTJs won’t openly discuss their goals until they kinda-sorta know you. \n\nI’m a lil scared...who knows another ENTJ might end up taking my position sometime? \n\nOn the other hand...the process? Sure! We love speaking about that.

16	ENTJ’s with ADHD/ADD	What do you guys do to deal with your ADHD/ADD ? \nI personally believe that an ENTJ with ADHD is a brain on fire. This brain definitely helps you discover a lot but at the same time any one of the two would happen...either you’ll use that ADHD to your advantage and move to the next level or you’ll just drown in your whirlpool. \n\nWhat do you guys think? 
16	I'm diagnosed ADHD and an ENTJ. Fire is a good analogy, because much like fire my thoughts run all over the place and are difficult to control and apply to anything productive. I would work in bursts of energy, at times going a million miles an hour, and when I was disinterested not being able to motivate myself at all. Medication has helped me be more consistent, and follow through when enthusiasm for a project has faded.
8	ENTJ here with ADHD, didn't use medicine for many years as high school was extremely easy for me, early college was extremely easy. I took my junior/senior level classes as a freshman and sophomore in college so I was highly engaged and interested. Once all that came to a halt I had to go back for things like Spanish, sociology, etc... I finally went on medicine. It did wonders for me.\n\nEven with medication, some days are very hard. It isn't as if I don't want to accomplish my goals, I just find myself day dreaming about the most efficient way to complete what I am supposed to work on or how this or that could be so much better and more effective, or how what I am doing works fine in a small scope but on an enterprise level it would be inadequate. I then try and solve these problems instead of just doing whatever task I am supposed to do.\n\nThe best medication I've found has been Vyvanse and I've tried them all. I also believe working out and eating healthy makes a massive impact on ADHD.\n\nFor those who will say ADHD is fake or we are abusing drugs or whatever, get your Ph.D in psychiatry and show me your case study, otherwise save your armchair analysis.\n\nEDIT: spelling
5	Meditation. Do the work and you'll never need anything else. Do anything else and you'll never go as far. 
5	It means I turn into a machine when I'm on adderall.
3	My life feels like a Tame Impala song (“Feels like we only go backwards” to be specific :p ) until I grab onto something strong and then it feels like I’m a leader. 
2	ENTJs have Si trickster, so they actually forget a lot of things, and their interests are in the moment. They probably use the most interesting things looking for superior results, so they get bored of a lot of tasks or people.
1	I’ve not used medication, I should try. \nBut on my side, I’m trying to be disciplined. \nLike disciplined with everything, from my eating habits to the way I work. My sleep cycles have changed as a result of my job cause I work at a startup but it’s not bad. I should get disciplined to get enough rest too. \n\nI believe being disciplined helps. \nAnd a fire in the belly for something, it can be to get or achieve this thing you had in your mind or it can just be to prove someone wrong. \n\nI’ve only lately come to realise that although having the willpower to do things is great, but you need to have that burning desire and only your heart can get you through times when your brain seems to go nowhere.\n\nIt’s been a while (almost five years) since I’ve been empathetic a lot more. I’m just 21 and I don’t know if I should’ve become empathetic this early given that ENTJs like being egoistic and all. \nBut I’ve embraced a lot of things I might’ve previously abandoned. \n\nWhat’s your story? 
1	I have used it to help multitask. If I can't stay on one task at a time then at least get more than one task done at a time.
1	Hahaha from all the jokes aside, I actually agree that Meditation helps. It’s okay if you’re not one of those who would want to try it, but I think eventually when to get to it and taste the power that lies within, you’ll get a knack of it, maybe you’ll end up wanting even more! \n\nMeditation comes under the discipline part. 
1	ENTJ with ADD here. I use coffee and the lowest dosage of meds possible. Oh, and extra coffee.\n\nI don't relate to your fire analogy, but perhaps because I don't quite understand the experience you're trying to relate, what you're trying to say by it. Certainly, my most common emotion when it comes to my ADD is frustration that my drive hasn't been met because I was unable to stay on task for part or all of the day.\n\nIf you have any questions, ask away. I will try to help, though I'm probably not particularly qualified.
-1	Interesting how ADHD was only officially listed in the DHM AFTER Ritalin was being manufactured. \n\nWhat normal person would have a lot of different interests and a lot of energy and not want to concentrate on the same boring thing all the time?
4	Te-se loop?	What does this look like? And can anyone like to compare this to a te-ne loop.?
6	This will be a bit long but highly informative - I encourage you to read through it.\n\n# ENTJs:\n\n**Tertiary Se (ENxJ):** As these two types overindulge Ni, they become increasingly inflexible, extreme, and out of touch with reality. Therefore, the tertiary Se function should be used to bring them back to what really matters in life. When a person listens to the need for tertiary Se development, they will suddenly start to value being more: amenable, adaptable, grounded, present, adventurous, fun (in enjoying simple pleasures), honest and accepting (about human weaknesses and limitations), attuned to beauty and the sublime. If one resists Se development, overindulgence of Ni is likely to lead to increasingly negative consequences, perhaps repeatedly shooting oneself in the foot by indulging unreasonable ideals/demands that create the perfect conditions for eventual defeat/disappointment. However, if Ni has remained chronically underdeveloped for whatever reason, a person is likely to develop serious Se looping tendencies in adulthood as a lame attempt to cope with development failure. With Se looping, they can continually excuse the lack of Ni development and justify never slowing down to properly introspect. Unfortunately, over time, this produces a creeping sense of losing control that can lead to inferior Ti/Fi grip.\n\n* defensive loop tendencies: selectively gathers superficial details as evidence to justify problematic beliefs or hasty action; believes oneself “deep” or “special” but actually cannot see past superficial appearances; impulsive or error-prone because of overlooking/ignoring important facts and details; rationalizes taking the path of least resistance instead of the morally correct path as long as desirable result is obtained (end justifies the means); does whatever feels good in the moment when feeling aimless/restless; indulges in sensory pleasures to escape from (self-imposed) stress or negative emotions; emotionally volatile, highly reactive to setbacks, problems, challenges, negative feedback; covers up flaws or mistakes instead of addressing them transparently, unable to admit to wrongdoing, unable to apologize for mistakes; prone to being over-competitive, incorrectly uses social comparison to define personal success/worth, tends to be jealous/envious of material gains or possessions that signal high/respected social standing; prone to adopting extreme and superficial societal standards to define “intelligence” or “achievement”; externalizes personal issues/insecurities by controlling the environment; compartmentalizes private life from public persona, able to rationalize doing bad/questionable things as long as public appearances/reputation remain intact; stubborn or combative mindset, defends beliefs and values with the unconscious intent to repress feelings of uncertainty or ambiguity\n* Te-Se loop dynamics: selectively seeks out evidence in support of pursuing goals/objectives or to justify one’s ideas and methods as being (intellectually) superior -> but cannot understand the deeper meaning and moral implications of one’s actions, resulting in critical failures that stoke underlying inferior Fi anxieties about being morally weak or spiritually bankrupt\n\n# \n\n# ESTJs:\n\n**Tertiary Ne (ESxJ):** As these two types overindulge Si, they become increasingly overbearing, risk-averse, and overly conventional. Therefore, the tertiary Ne function should be used to open them up to new ideas and possibilities. When a person listens to the need for tertiary Ne development, they will suddenly start to value being more: flexible, open-minded, creative, forward-looking, forgiving (of self and others), attuned to achieving good personal growth and incremental progress in life. If one resists Ne development, overindulgence of Si is likely to lead to increasingly negative consequences, perhaps repeatedly shooting oneself in the foot by indulging mental rigidity that creates the exact conditions to be easily disturbed/disrupted. However, if Si has remained chronically underdeveloped for whatever reason, a person is likely to develop serious Ne looping tendencies in adulthood as a lame attempt to cope with development failure. With Ne looping, they can continually excuse the lack of Si development and justify their hasty or sloppy decision making. Unfortunately, over time, this produces a creeping sense of life being chaotic/misguided that can lead to inferior Ti/Fi grip.\n\n* defensive loop tendencies: prone to unconscious negative visualizations about making mistakes, overlooking details, or impending disaster; impulsive, unfocused, ineffectual, unable to prioritize well and reach goals even after effortful planning; makes harsh but often contradictory/hypocritical judgments, able to justify taking hasty or preemptive action that overrides the will of others; unable to feel genuinely content with any result when it does not fit with rigid preconceived expectations; tends to be irrationally suspicious about people’s intentions, prone to imagining or expecting the worst; chases risky endeavors or dangerous possibilities to escape from feelings of unhappiness/discontent; often feels one’s efforts are unappreciated or undervalued; cannot admit to mistakes, disowns responsibility, makes excuses, deflects criticism, blames circumstances, pretends to not care about failure, lowers expectations to avoid disappointment; tries to maintain a sense of control over relationships/situations with the unconscious intent to repress feelings of instability or discontent\n* Te-Ne loop dynamics: easily led astray by subconscious and irrational intuitive beliefs into micromanaging perceived problems -> but lacks proper focus and methodical attention to detail, resulting in unforced errors that stoke underlying inferior Fi fears about being exposed as weak, incompetent, or undeserving of respect \n\n(This is taken from a Tumblr blog mbti-notes.)
3	**Te-Se** loops ignore their Ni for quick, now solutions. They make plans to gratify immediate needs/goals rather than think of terms of the long haul. Alternatively, it can be about empowering their image. Again, optimizing their material goods or sensory experiences about short term impulses.\n\n**Te-Ne** loops ignore their Si for multiple, quick solutions. They make plans to gratify a million, potential possibilities rather than use their past, accrued knowledge or deploy strategies of what is known to work. They become burn-out because they're trying to juggle unrealistic outcomes.\n\nEdit: *^Notice: ^I'm ^just ^a ^simple ^MBTI ^functions ^hobbiest ^and ^do ^not ^claim ^authority ^on ^the ^full ^comprehension ^on ^the ^functions ^so ^my ^interpretations ^are ^up ^to ^interpretations*
4	Not an assertive ENTJ..	In social situations, when I'm out with friends and etc, even though I know they're speaking crap to convince themselves they're right, I don't intrude, reasons being that they' just try and intimidate me and get me to accept rather than listening my point of view. Which sucks but is true, so throughout under-grad I hardly gave a shit about the stuff they spoke even when I knew they were wrong. They thought I was a guy who just like doesn't take things seriously. I sure liked to be easy-going but they thought I would be the same all the way. (sic)  \n\n\nHave you ever gone through something like this? 
6	I’ve changed from being that person who wants to win a debate for fucks sake to really actually extracting knowledge which will work. \n\nOtherwise I don’t mind anyone doing anything at all, but, listening to everyone’s point of view is something I value. You can later tell them where they’re lacking or you’ll get to know where you’re lacking and that helps, not this mental-masturbation which just boosts your ego. 
3	I don't think you should think of yourself as not assertive. Rather, think of yourself as someone who grasps the meaning of the adage "pick your battles," and even if you don't realize this is what's going on subconsciously in your head: what you do is you choose to not pick battles over issues you don't care about. To illustrate: For a while I was thinking about becoming a teacher, and I ultimately decided against it, and one of the reasons why is that teachers have to discipline students, and I don't want to deal with all that. It's not that I'm not assertive enough to discipline students - it's just that I don't care enough about them and the stupid things they do to get mad at them and expend a lot of energy getting them in trouble. Are ENTJs combative? Yes, we are. But we're also smart. And we don't fight about stupid shit we don't care about: like stupid stuff our friends talk about.
3	I suffer from being a bit too passive as well, it comes from, for me, a history of neglect. I have been working recently to improve, but with it has come some anger at being disrespected.
1	Sure. Depends on if the interaction is even worth anything. Most people have a host issues and arguing to win a debate changes nothing but the amount of time you have to do something useful.
1	I'm INTJ (might not have updated my flair here), but I always think it's inefficient to try and argue with someone with whom words can't resonate properly.\n\nIt is a form of Ni and Te, so I could see that happening too. ENTJs I know always like to debate though, but I feel like it is more for the sake of winning a fight rather than reaching some truth through brainstorming
2	Willpower or Discipline – what drives you?	What drives you more in life?
3	Willpower is waaaay overrated. It is a nasty burning fuel that runs out real fast. Discipline all the way.
3	I am motivated by a vagina.
3	Uhhhh...neither.  The concept of not going broke drives me.  
3	What entry level jobs are there with a heavy focus on Public Speaking skills?	
8	Sales rep
5	Waiting tables/bartending
7	Ride operator at an amusement park. \n\nTour guide. \n\nUS President. 
6	Bullying by older females at work	Hi All..Need advice as a fellow ENTJ\n\nI am 28 years old and in the nursing profession. I've been a nurse for 7 years and worked in my sector for almost 10 years. I've been very lucky in my career and well supported by great managers and talent management schemes at previous organisations. I'm really proud of what I've learnt, achieved and how I've grown and really looking forward to a great career in Nursing. \n\nI left my old organisation where I had worked for 6 years and moved up the ladder in last year. It was a good move, I felt stagnant and needed a change and even moved to a new city. \n\nI've been doing this job which is quite strategic for about 9 months, and I love the strategic element- it's my forte, it's what I am good at and it's what I know. I have been trying to meet with a key professional lead since I started, and have only met with her twice...both times she proceeded to criticise me quite harshly infront of others. \n\nFinally got a meeting with her as I wanted to improve a key relationship and got some really difficult feedback\n\n1) An e-mail I sent praising her team and nursing staff over a large open day they had helped me run and support, that I sent to the CEO to acknowledge their work, was me apparently showing off. \n\n2) I asked some senior staff (only one band above me) to come in uniform to an event I was running where they were helping, was apparently 'above where I am' and I should not be speaking up and directing them in that way. \n\n3) I'm getting ahead of myself, need to rememeber my place and what I am. \n\nWhat i think frustrated me the most, is the one good thing I recieved was "You are good at promoting our work on twitter"....like, what the hell? Really? Is that what I am doing well at, because I damn hell should go for a career change in social media then. \n\nI don't want to be one of those people that are known to not take feedback on board, I can be quite introverted in this way because I listen and then spend ages mulling things over and figuring it out. \n\nThis has just annoyed me...I'm trying to make sense of the feedback and wonder what I could do, but at the same time I also don't want to change my values system. \n\nI really believe in supporting others, acknowledging good work and  celebrating achievements when they are due and I don't want to be made to feel I need to change this, just incase it ever gets misinterpreted as showing off?\n\nI am also a big believer in bottom up change, that we need to engage our frontline staff to bring embed a change culture, and I will sit in meetings and ask managers if they've asked the staff and what are we doing to engage...to get looked at and spoken to like I am an idiot. \n\nI am not sure if I was spoilt in my previous trust, there really was a culture of sharing your success, and engaging teams in work etc and I feel so alone trying to champion this here. \n\nAm I going off on some ENTJ  world....or do I need to sit back and listen here? 
10	I don't understand why she is being so difficult with you. Take it from a Fe user, ask around and see if any weird gossip has circulated around about her opinion of you. Or if she's poorly liked in general.  Obviously take gossip with a grain of salt, but if you notice she has a bad reputation, that could better prepare you for further bullshit or to dismiss her criticisms if they lack merit. \n\nStick to your guns. There are precious little of your kind of hardworking earnestness in this world, let alone the nursing profession. The only thing I've noticed in the above worth criticism might be the directing up thing, hierarchies tend not to like newcoming Ni users who shake up their Si establishments.  That can be attributed to youthful zeal tho, still doesn't merit an open criticism.\n\nThen again, I'm in graphic design where it's much, much chiller. But still. Stick to what you believe in and continue to foster that positive and fruitful environment. 
5	As soon as I read the title I instantly thought it's got to be about nursing.\n\nDon't take it personally. I'm sure you're aware of the tendency older nurses have for eating their young.\n\nI would just keep my head down about the petty stuff, but don't be afraid to stand up for yourself if it gets to the point where it's effecting your job. Don't change your values because someone else is insecure and feels threatened by you.\n
3	Listen\n\nI consistently get challenged at work by other women. Most of the time it’s an extreme power dynamic they perceive and think they’re on the wrong side etc. They simply don’t want you to have power over them even though it’s clearly a perception they have and not real.\n\n1. Seniority: it’s a real thing apparently. You’re new, it’s resistant because they HAVE to make room for you but it will pass—promise. \n\n2. Insecurities: coming from them not from anything tangible. Let it ride because if it’s their problem then they either a) going to have to get over it b) they have to get over it.\n\n3. Timing, timing, timing: it’s everything. If you see resistance backoff. Depending on how long you’ve been at the company this is a set of NEW people that have established THEIR rules and you need to be initiated first. They have their own initiation process so let them come to you etc. \n\nConclusion: Develop personal, individual, relationships with people. Break the bullying culture down. The only way to break down dynamics is to tackle one person at a time. \n\nExample: I have a co-worker that believes she deserves a lot more than what she gets, she is entitled to lead based on seniority and she alludes that it has to do with gender, race, or a combination of other things. \n\nWhat I see: She is passive aggressive, she states inappropriate things about other co-workers, her attitude is dismissive and negative, she complains openly, her behavior is petty outside and inside of work. \n\nHow she sees me: Know it all, commanding, assertive, aggressive, sneaky, and thinks I’m out for her job/responsibilities. I need to watch my “tone” etc. \n\nHow I think I am: I am commanding, I am assertive, and at times could watch my tone. But I’m like this because I expect more from her. I expect to work with competent people, it’s okay if she doesn’t want to put in the effort but move out of my way and let me do it. \n\nHope this helped but basically people will view things differently and are more inclined to view a threat than extend sympathy to understand the other view point. How can we right? When the subject matter is...us, a very personal part of who we are.
3	When there are people just like you've described, it's more about them than you. They feel threatened if there's some self assured, young upstart coming in. In their eyes, they got there first and you need to be humble to learn from them and be part of a team. They're not personally criticising you - they are trying to diminish your competence in front of others and also, to make them feel less bad about themselves.\n\nThey like the status quo. Also, I'm not being rude and dismissive, and I know there are exceptions to every rule etc but nurses in general are ESFJ/ISFJ types aka: the stereotypical way women are socialised into being. They thrive off hierarchy, convention and processes from experience and what is defined as industry best practice in medical journals etc. If you rock the boat, then they use verbal & relational aggression to try and undermine your reputation.\n\nYou're not some external management consultant coming in on a project. You're in the nursing industry. Don't go in there all guns blazing and suggesting new ideas to improve current processes. Although we both know you're just trying to help - but there is a fine line where it can come off as arrogance. \n\nYou seem like an intelligent person that thinks laterally, but the types of people to get a vocational profession tend to be less so. They are more linear thinkers and just want to automatically know when to apply X in Y situation.  I do wonder, it's not just the fact that you're a self proclaimed ENTJ, but the way you write and your personality type is a poor fit for the nursing profession. I would suggest branching out and moving upwards into a more managerial/strategy role as you have recently moved into.

3	How do you feel when you fail at something?	Do you learn from you failures? Do you get a strong regret feeling when you fail for not putting more of you? How do you express your self when you face a personal failure?\n\n**TL,DR:** I have just failed in a project (I developed in the ENTJ way), when I saw the email with the bad news I just felt nothing. I'm afraid I`m not learning with my mistakes. \n\nI have been developing a software project for an specialization course: \n\n**When I had a lot of time to do it:** I tried to make the stuffs perfect, with all the pieces fitting well together. Sometimes a given part was hard to develop in the perfect way(high quality standards), but I avoided using a shit approach (with low quality standards) but that actually would work. Also, I tried to keep sleeping in time and eventually putting a little time in hobby.\n\n**Then, I realized the time is short:** Under pressure, I took two days off to focus and develop it, a week before the deadline, still with good quality. Soon, I changed the mode and begun accepting low quality approach for my project, but the time seemed not enough. As one last breath I took a journey of 36 hours of work just before the deadline in order to finish it. So, I deliver it, not complete as I would like, but the main part was working and some was bit buggy.\n\n**The day after:** I received the e-mail telling me I didn't reach the grade enough to pass. When I noticed, I read the feedback, it seemed a bit unstructured and bad written I would say. I dint feel upset, I didn't get sad, I bit concerned on how to reply that e-mail asking for a talk or something. But I had no bad feelings.\n\nMy fear about this is I didn't feel something strong enough to make me learn or at least I didn't processed it emotionally just rationally.\n\nHave you ever faced something like this?\n\nedit: formatting
4	You don't have to feel regret in order to learn. This entire post is a reflection - that's how you actually learn.
2	XSTP here...you don’t learn to be great without failure...and it’s only a true failure if you don’t take a lesson and build from it. \n\nBy reading, I would say solving the problem wasn’t your priority but rather how you solved it was. \n\nSometimes you have to take a step back and get out of your own way. A complex or elegant design is only as good if it gets the desired result.

1	MBA financial planning?	Hi everyone, I have a personal goal to get into a top 10 MBA program. The program will be a two and a half year full time commitment so I will not be making much of a salary.\n\nI will take out loans for tuition.\n\nConsidering I have to pay rent, car, gas, etc. I realized that I would need to save 1000 dollars a month for 24 months = about 24k to live.\n\nCurrently all my savings (11k) are staying in a regular checking account where they are the most liquid. I feel that I could reach the 24k goal by the end of the year. However, I am wondering if I should instead invest som monthly income in ETFs or put it into a mutual fund instead of sitting in a bank account.\n\nNote: I also use Robinhood and have 8k in there. \n\nAny other suggestions on how to prepare financially for the MBA?
3	r/finance would probably be able to better help you with this.
3	You want r/personalfinance or r/mba but I’ll skip to the first comments you’ll get which are\n\nNo, do not invest money you will need within 30 months. Maybe a high yield savings account, but that’s going to be fairly inconsequential \n\nIncredible, if you can live off $1000 a month. What top 10 program is located in that kind of LCOL area? Most will have you paying that in rent alone (or more), with no money for local networking or travel, which is just as important as curriculum in a top mba program. You need to socialize as part of these programs. Not for fun. For the future. This is how boys clubs are formed. Don’t skip your membership because you didn’t budget for socializing. \n\nYou are talking about draining an emergency fund, which most everyone will advise you against. Leave 3 months (at least) of living expenses aside for emergencies. Do not touch except in case of emergency. Discretionary education is not an emergency. 
1	> Hi everyone, I have a personal goal to get into a top 10 MBA program.\n\nWhy???\n\n> However, I am wondering if I should instead invest som monthly income in ETFs or put it into a mutual fund instead of sitting in a bank account.\n\nFuck no! Your ETF fund could lose 7% in one day.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_daily_changes_in_the_Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average#Largest_percentage_changes\n\nWe are currently in a bubble territory.\n\n> Any other suggestions on how to prepare financially for the MBA?\n\nDon't do it.\n
1	apparently no one here's aware that for grad school, the government hands out loan money like candy, especially for programs such as a top 10 mba. this money covers the full cost of attendance (coa), which includes a healthy, generous budget for living costs such as room & board and transportation, even if you're living off campus.\n\nyou don't need to save any money for grad school to "survive" on. go ahead and invest if you're interested, or use your savings to take out just a few less k in loans if you'd prefer.\n\nbest of luck!
18	Anyone else have nightmare of trying to drive a car from the backseat? Or trying to control a car that’s out of control?	I’ve had this nightmare exactly 4 times in my life since childhood. It was definitely related to a stressful point in my life as well.\n\nMore about the dream: the car would be out of control and moving. I can see where it’s going, but I can’t quite reach the steering wheel or pedals from the backseat. There’s noone else in the car. Another variation is I’m in the driver seat and it’s out of control. When I was younger and didn’t know how to drive I was in the backseat and the car was driving itself safely, away from home into heaven lol. 
4	Driving a car that doesn't have brakes from a back or side seat is a regular one for me.
4	Classic. Or the house is on fire but you can't leave because you can't find your shoes. 
3	Oh yes-- generally the steering wheel doesn't work or the brakes are out on a mountain road. I usually wake up when I go over a cliff...never a collision, it's always some sort of free-falling thing resulting from my inability to control the car. Ick.
2	Yes - during a really stressful time. After I made some changes, the dreams stopped. 
2	The car is your life and you sitting in the backseat ( back seat driver) is a sign that you need to get on top of things or things will get on top of you. 
1	Yep, definitely had this kind of nightmare amd remember it vividly....\n
1	I do all the time! I never really thought about others having it. But usually I start in the back seat, then I stay stationary (floating I guess) while I watch the car keep going. The problem is I'm totally controlling the (empty) car, but I can't see where it's going since I was left behind. It usually crashes unless the dream ends first. I always feel bad about crashing. 
1	I have these all the time. Got medication, didn't helped. Stopped it. Now it's worse.
1	Take control of your life back!
1	Yes, I have had that 'trying to drive a car from the backseat' dream fairly recently, and now I feel blind for not connecting the dots.\n\nThen again, in the dreams I remember I'm not capable of much, with a couple heinous exceptions.\n\nI hate dreaming.
1	Actually, my bigget reoccuring nightmare is that the planets, without warning, change trajectory and head straight towards Earth.  To me, there are few things as scary as impending doom that you can’t do anything about.  Seeing Venus take up a quarter of the visible sky is terrifying.
1	Yes!!!  All the time!!! \nOr flying in a plane down city streets or highways!!
1	In college, I woke up in the middle of the night on several occasions amid a panic attack, fearing Russia or North Korea would fire a nuclear missile on Los Angeles, where I lived at the time, and there was nothing I could do about it. For a while, I considered moving to the country and becoming a recluse to stay safe.\n\nI've also had a couple dreams in which I lose control of myself. I have bipolar disorder, and it makes me uncomfortable that I don't have more control over my own behavior.\n\nMost recently, I had a dream in which my mother began to choke on something, so I started to perform the Heimlich maneuver on her, but she grew progressively fatter and fatter while my arms were around here until I could no longer reach far enough to carry out the maneuver.\n\nControl definitely seems to be a theme in my nightmares.
1	I was blaming those dreams on real life experience with a car not braking as well as it should. Interesting to think that it might be a personal pressure point even without those memories.   \n\nIn my dreams the car is usually on uneven ground and either the brake pedal is hard to reach and I don't manage to push it all the way down no matter how hard I try, or I push it all the way down and it just does nothing. The car then slides and rolls around in whichever direction it was already going. Interestingly, I don't remember dreaming of any serious collisions, so it really does seem to be about the loss of control moreso than about fearing physical accidents. The torturous feeling is being stuck in this vehicle just going where gravity and momentum take it for seconds that feel like minutes.
1	I’m an INFP and I used to have slight variations of the same dream in which I would be driving a car down a hill and the brakes wouldn’t work or the steering wheel wouldn’t turn fast enough. I haven’t had this dream in awhile I think because I’m finally at the point where driving’s become second nature, but it was pretty recurring back while I had my permit.  
1	Just had this and I know I've had it at least a few times before. This time I was visiting relatives and driving back home and remember it being a long drive. Somehow I end up in the back seat and I can still steer but I can't brake and I'm on the freeway. I saw a lot of Ford Explorer police cars and then the freeway becomes a curvy ramp with lots of traffic and I could not brake and that jolted me awake.\n\nEdit: I don't record my dreams but decided to Google this one and found this post lol
5	Looking for answers about love, friendships, and personality disorders	Hey everyone. I’m an ENTJ-t and I have a few questions for other ENTJ’s out there and hopefully I won’t feel so alone lol:\n\nI’m 25, male, musician, stoner, raver, and just like most of us, the advice giver.\n\nI was diagnosed with depression at a young age, and it’s something I’ve struggled with my entire life. Most brought on by my upbringing. I’ve noticed that as the years have gone on, I’ve slipped out of my body and I’m viewing my entire life like I’m a director and I’m watching myself do these actions and trying to control the entire environment around me. Knowing what buttons to push when and how to keep myself out of any danger. I’m at a point where i feel like I’ve become masochistic and I’m watching myself fail over and over again and just laughing. I feel like I’m losing control.\n\nI get an incredible joy from watching other succeed, however when I succeed it doesn’t feel like I’ve done anything. I don’t have any sense of accomplishment. It’s just, “move on, next project” sort of thing. I’m stuck in a corporate world as a middle wage worker, so you know as an ENTJ I probably hate my job because I hate when people are inefficient and this tends to happen a lot where I work. I feel stuck. I almost lost my job today because I got brutally honest with my boss. I was polite, I was just honest at how much shit was wrong.\n\nMy love life and friendships and all messed up. To be honest I’m having trouble actually being in the moment and connecting with anyone. I can talk to anyone and anyone can talk and trust me, but I’m having issues talking about how I feel, and feeling connection with someone. To be honest I don’t know what my sexuality is. I think I’m bi? I’ve been with both men and women because I felt in order to find what I like, I should try both, and to be honest sex isn’t really interesting at all to me. It’s more of a pain in the ass lol. I really only see it as a primal need when it does happen or for reproduction. I can get off with either sex and still just see it as a physical act. I honestly could see myself living within a group of people rather than one partner. I don’t see the point in monogamy. I just lost this chance at this girl I really fucking liked because of my inability to speak about my feelings. I’m not really an affectionate person, at least when it comes to myself. I’m also having trouble finding a best friend, someone to rely on. I feel super alone. I always have. I’m better at connecting people and creating best friends rather than ever finding one myself. \n\nSo my questions For my fellow ENTJ’s are:\n▪️have you ever experienced life to a level of being in a 3rd person point of view? It’s like dissociation with life. Are you able to put yourself back into yourself? Any suggestions how?\n▪️I’ve heard of something called self-defeating (masochistic) personality disorder, have any of you experienced this or anything like this? \n▪️do any of you feel disconnected from everyone around you? Like there’s a big puzzle and it’s missing a piece, but you’re a piece from another completely different puzzle in same box as that big puzzle? \n▪️do you have trouble expressing your feelings? Do you see your feeling as “unimportant” and move on and wait until things boil up? How do you get your emotional issues out?\n▪️what’s your view on sex and sexuality? Is sex important to you? Why or why not? What’s your view on monogamy? \n▪️do you have issues expressing your feelings to your partner(s)?\n▪️do any of you experience issues in finding a best friend or connecting with someone who you’re able to share with and have an actual good time with (to the point where you stop breaking down the world around you)?\n▪️does life ever feel like you’re faking it till you make it constantly? \n\nThanks for reading everyone. I appreciate all the help. Hope your day is great 🙂 \n
18	Your post is very touchy-feely for an ENTJ ... 👀
5	Frankly, your issues don't sound like they have much to do with MBTI. I would try to think outside of it since it doesn't really sound it's that useful or relevant here.  \n\nDo you have access to mental health services? It sounds like they could be a lot more helpful here than random Redditors.  \n\nOn the subject of personality disorders, your issues with unstable interpersonal relationships, feelings of loneliness, emptiness, desire for someone to rely on, dissociation, insecurity, self-defeating nature and masochism, all sound IMO very characteristic of borderline personality disorder.\n\nI'm not a doctor, but it may be something to look into. Many who work with mental health are often inexperienced with BPD and it often goes undiagnosed and untreated. Your problems are real no matter the label, though--a label is only a way to facilitate treatment. So don't get too hung up on it.\n\nDissociative symptoms can also be caused (or if you already have them, worsened) by weed. If you're a stoner, it may be worth thinking about stopping. Look up depersonalization/derealization in particular. Despite not being talked about much, it's actually a pretty common problem from weed and psychedelics.
4	Most of your points are depression symptoms mixing with the way your mind thinks. I had basically every point you've mentioned plus a couple others that were specific to my situation at the time.\n\nDifficulty expressing emptions is quite a textbook ENTJ trait, don't look into it too much or beat yourself up over it. Comfort with the person is key and you'll let yourself out little by little so that you retain that feeling of safety while also slowly getting the other person to understand how you show affection. \n\nIf all else fails, a few drinks is a pretty good way to loosen the barriers a bit and allow you to enjoy the moment.
1	This reads like my bad days, and I'm an intp.  In any case, your type doesn't matter to your predicament.\n\n(1)  3-rd person pov:  yes, that's how I see my life.  I get used to it. \n\n(2) self-defeating:  it's a bad habit, but habits can be broken with extra effort (more effort than mindlessly repeating patterns)\n\n(3)  not-fitting-in:  yes, and it takes effort to small talk and find common ground with strangers, but it can be done.\n\n(4) feelings:  I sleep on them and then sort it out.  Over time you learn your own stressors and can predict what a certain situation would do to you.  \n\n(5)  sexuality:  asexuality or you are under alot of stress and what you naturally are isn't apparent right now\n\n(6) partner communication:  I'm with an extrovert, so usually it gets fleshed out b/c of partner\n\n(7) deconstruction Vs friendship:  yes, I married him\n\n(8) imposter syndrome: yes
1	Sounds like a typical 8w9 problem, too much supression. You became your real self momentarily by being brutally honest and it almost costed you your job. You're asleep. You let others drive you around, never touching the wheels. You don't know yourself. You have no anxieties but no desires either. You're not even interested in sex because it's lustful and that's too close from your real self that you've drown. \n\nYou gotta a lot to work on tbh. Here's a good start [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsJ8CWSXbzg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsJ8CWSXbzg) 
1	You have a lot of dicks stuck up your ass. You just have to pull them out one by one. You can sort the dicks according to the criteria that makes most sense to you and then attack the dick at the top first.\n\nSome approaches:\n\n* biggest dick first. Pros: minimizes gastro-intestinal damage fast. Cons: requires courage and effort.\n* smallest dick first. Pros: easier to get started. Cons: prolongs anal suffering.\n\nIn the credit card context these methods are also called https://www.moneyunder30.com/snowball-vs-avalanche
2	any entj enneagram 8s?	ny entjs enneagram 8s here,and do you often struggle with temper or anger issues? and in the past have you realy snaped at someone and went into rage?
5	Type 8 ENTJ here. Yeah, I struggle with rage. Sometimes I get super worked up just thinking about something someone said to me or did to me (it could have happened 10 or 15 years ago even), and the only way I can calm down is to think violent thoughts. I go to therapy now for it. \n\nI have bad road rage too. I've nearly caused accidents a couple times, and I've scared the shit out of some other people, who, I'm sure, to this day remember the time a "psycho" was messing with them. I'm happy I live in the city now and thus don't have to drive.\n\nI worry I'll lose control one day and hurt someone, and not to mention potentially ruin my own life.\n\nIt comes from a place of hurt deep inside. For a long time, I tried to come up with my own definition of "trauma," and it took me a long time, but I think I finally have come up with something good. trauma **(*****n*****): injury that, unlike most other psychological or physical harm, fails to heal on its own overtime but instead degenerates if no help is sought.** I hope the help I've sought works.
4	Yes. ENTJ 8w7. You have to understand that this type is generally born from exposure to violence and abuse, so there's a 'feral' aspect to this personality. I did not adhere to a number of the ENTJ stereotypes until a bit later in life because I was rebellious and rejected authority.\n\nI'm more composed now because I have outlets for this energy (working out, career) and you'll rarely see me get mad, but when I do, shit hits the fan. 
3	I'll let you know as soon as I find out what an enneagram is.
3	Sure. Of course. I hate stupid employees who can't understand me or can't finish their task. I tell them how to do everyday, again and again. Everyday!!! But they still can't understand how to make our clients feel good at our products. And that is my life, my job. God damn! Anyhow, I must be used to do it.\n\nI'm 25 years old, chinese.\n\nAnd the most foolish behavior is that I must keep smile for the stupid employees. Countlessly I want to say "fuck you!" in my company but I know I must control myself and give my employees confidence to achieve our plan.
2	haven't you posted this same exact thing like 3 times? \n\nalso, i'm sure there are a lot of enneagram 8 entjs. it's the most common type for entjs.
10	I am an INFJ female asking for ENTJ relationship advice.	My ENTJ boyfriend and I have been together for almost four years. We are both 22 now.  In that time we have argued about the same things time and time again. We have hurt each other so many times that we are bored, sick, and tired of each other. I hate him so much and love him so much still. I will always want him to do well and succeed in every endeavor he sets out to do. I just don't know how to make this work anymore.\n\nWe can't talk. I get too sensitive and cry about the way he talks with me. He gets too fed up and angry at me for crying. This usually starts with him talking about something and me not getting it. And to be honest, I don't really get a lot of things. I ask a lot of questions and I have to have a lot of things repeated because of this. After this, it leads to him calling me stupid, a dumb bitch, a retarded cunt, etc. I obviously get upset and start crying, he starts yelling. Sometimes, he will be talking normally, but also raise his voice a little and start hitting things around him. This still makes me upset and sad. I usually try to hide and hold in my crying. He hates that. But he also hates it when I cry, so I feel like I'm stuck. He says just not to cry, but I don't know how to do that. I have also tried to logic my own reasons to not cry, but because I am so overwhelmed with emotion it is hard to hold in and control. We would argue for hours.\n\nAt first, when we started dating, he would tell me the things to improve on (admittedly, I would go about change the wrong way) and always try to be loving when I cried. Over time because of constant mistakes on my part, he got more and more violent and temperamental. I was also mad and showed it when we were halfway in the relationship. I got tired of being mad. And I only got mad because I was so resentful of him being like that, but he on the other hand tried really hard not to be. I hate myself for not appreciating this more. My dumbass back then was so shitty and unappreciative.\n\nAnyway we argued for hours because he would always want to try to talk the problem out while I would want some time to collect myself. When I have some time, I can calm down most of the time. However, I almost never had that time and so I always say something I would regret, that would hurt him, etc. I have missed family events, friend meet ups, and even exams. We 99&#37; of the time never solve anything. It ends up with us being tired. Sometimes I wouldn't even come home because we argue. He has broken the windshield of my car and choked me during a couple of arguments. We forget about it and move on without every solving anything. We might talk about it and try some shitty solutions, but we mostly forget. This cycle goes on.\n\nI can't ever tell him how I feel. He doesn't understand my emotions and will always logic my problem or emotion. For me, just because it is logic-ed out doesn't mean I'll feel better. He also has said that he can't comfort me either because he'll feel like it's false comfort and that would be lying to me. This is a common ENTJ thing to not understand emotion like INFJs do. All I would like is a hug or cuddle while we talk about how to make it better. Or better yet, cuddling and maybe letting me cry about it first, and then talk about how to make the problem better.\n\nIt wasn't ever really like this when we started dating. I think the honeymoon stage really blind-sided us to what each of our flaws are. I was really immature and shitty when we started dating. I wasn't very open and what I shared was trivial, while he shared so much. This was my mistake, this would lead to him getting mad and the cycle mentioned before. I would lie about how I feel, omit certain details from things because I knew he would just get mad at me for them and end up with the cycle above.\n\nHe's tired and bored of me and honestly I feel like I am 2&#37; of who I really am. My close friend says she hasn't seen me happy for years. He deserves better. The time I've spent with him, I have learned so much, found new things to be excited about, learned new perspectives, and mature in such a way I wouldn't have without him. I haven't offered him shit. I have only made sure he's stayed alive; eating, drinking, sleeping, etc. I got him things I knew he needed. I offered little for him to learn from, which is what he values a lot. He depends on me a lot for these things now and he knows that if I leave him, he'll be close to dying. I don't want to die, I want him to succeed even if I'm not around. I promised him I would not break up with him and I won't or else my promise would be a lie. He doesn't want to though, because of his reliance on me. I want to be able to make him not dead inside, but I don't know how.\n\nI know we are both terrible for each other. But I really, really want to at the VERY LEAST make it so that if we end, it can be on a good note, and I can disappear without remorse.\n\nHow would you, an ENTJ, from an outsider's perspective, try to go about this problem? And how would I make my own ENTJ SO understand that I want to work it out? And how to work it out?\n\nSorry I couldn't make this anymore concise or organized. The background here is important. You guys can be as critical and harsh as you'd like; I can handle it. Thank you so much in advance for the advice and responses.\n\nEDIT: I don't want to make him seem like he only did bad things to me. I have also many times made him so frustrated that he had to hit his head or hit the pavement. I also feel like I left out a lot, so if you want more information, please ask!\n\nEDIT: I didn't want to demonize ENTJ! Sorry if I made it seem that way. He just happens to be an ENTJ, so I figured I would ask here. I know not every ENTJ is like him, but I wanted to advice from people who have similar to him.
30	Sounds like an abusive relationship. He sounds immature. You need to stop blaming yourself. I would encourage you to seek professional help for your mental health. Suggest it to him and leave it at that. \n\nYou are not responsible for his behaviour or life, he is. You need to be responsible for your own and move on. You do not owe him anything, nor are you there to support and "fix" him or care for him to be fixed. If you're concerned, suggest for him to get support from his family/friends or even better a professional. If he was capable of being "fixed" he would have realised his faults in managing his behaviour around you. You will both grow more by separating and moving on with your life.
12	I’m really sorry for your situation but you *need to get out*. The fact that he has physically and mentally abused you isn’t an ENTJ thing but just plain toxic. This isn’t a healthy relationship and you deserve so much more. \n\nI know it can be hard to cut ties but honestly this isn’t love. It’s entrapment. He’s manipulating you and hurting you. Don’t sacrifice your happiness ever and even though it may be hard, you need to put *yourself first*.\n\nThere are plenty of people out there - you’ll be much happier if you move on. \n\n(Based on a lot of varying relationships in the past of both myself and others close to me)
11	I know that INFJ’s are the self-sacrificing type but this kind of behavior is unacceptable, regardless of MBTI type. You should not have to sacrifice your own sanity and happiness for him. Of course, there is no real way to be completely objective by just hearing what you describe but he sounds abusive. \n\nI would encourage you to let him go or in the very least, seriously distance yourself.
10	First of all, it’s upsetting to hear you had to go through all of what you described. \n\nDon’t blame yourself for things not working out. ENTJs share a lot of common traits but it’s not synonymous with abusive or toxic. I would advise you to get out of this relationship and spend your time on things you enjoy doing or piquing your interests.\n\nJust because it didn’t work out with this ENTJ doesn’t mean it wouldn’t work out with another.\n\nBest of luck to you!

5	I stopped at him calling you a bitch and a dumb cunt. That's abusive behavior, I'd get outta that. You'll move on and be happier overall. Tell him exactly why you're ending it, and try your best to not cry or get overly emotional. It'll make his big bad manly aura crumble into nothing if you hold your composure.
3	I think this guy is going loco. Never have I heard ENTJs choking their partner. And even if we leave that aside , every MBTI type has at least a bit of emotion. \n\nI am an ISTJ.  People here will know how blunt we can be , and our resting bitch face can make anyone irritated . Still , we do give out emotional support when required , and can connect with the feeler types when we want to ( I know it's slang , sorry ).\n\nI say it's getting pretty toxic . Not funny .  And I'm going to go against everyone here and say that both of you have a hand in it . You tried logic , but couldn't manage it , and ended up crying . He tried the emotional path , and failed miserably . This created fights . As I don't know the complete thing , and your history for the last 4 years , I would not pass judgement on who is right or wrong. It's just that you are in dire need of help , and from my point of view , should leave this relationship . Otherwise you stand the chance of being emotionally wrecked ( unless you're there already ).\n\nSorry if I seem harsh . But I like the blunt truth.
3	You need to cut that turd out of your life as soon as possible. Doesn't matter what type he is, he is broken and you aren't equipped to handle it. Good luck with your future endeavors.
2	Leave the relationship and sort your feelings later.
2	Codependence. According to your friend you've been nothing but miserable for years, yet you reframe that state as "learning so much". And he...     \n\n>depends on me a lot for these things now and he knows that if I leave him, he'll be close to dying.   \n\nWtf are you doing for him that he couldn't do for himself, survival-wise? Anyone can make spaghetti, vegetables from a can and some type of meat. It literally says how on the packaging usually, and if it doesn't you can google it. Anyone can go to a store and buy these things (in a first world country). This is all too absurd. You need to learn not to dramatize everything. I'm not saying you need to be logical about everything. But you can be an emotional person and yet stick to the facts, such as: He can survive just fine without you. And you shouldn't be crying regularly, that's an obvious symptom you're under too much stress of some kind. I'm specifically referring to this part:   \n\n>All I would like is a hug or cuddle while we talk about how to make it better. Or better yet, cuddling and maybe letting me cry about it first   \n\nIt sounds like you've made crying a *habit*. You seem to think crying is a normal reaction to every day events. It's not. If normal things that happen frequently devastate you so much you have to cry then something is seriously wrong with you. As I said, stress of some kind. I'm not going to speculate too much but for one thing this boyfriend of yours seems like a great source of stress. He can't solve your problems because he is one.
1	Probably list the same things that you mentioned here and that the most logical option is to separate and just let each other be happy. I was with an ENFJ for 6 years and we had trouble seeing eye to eye, he actually told me I had no soul. It's not true but we just go about things in a very different way. I'm with INTJ now and we're much more compatible. However, the name calling and everything else that you mention stems from a lack of respect. It's one thing to be different people and another to be disrespectful and intentionally causing harm. He may not even realize that's what those actions are showing in the moment. Best luck to both of you.
1	I can't join on the pity party. I believe this course was inexorable as predicted by socionics. It's actually amazing that you guys survived that long, usually this relationship ends within 2 weeks to 3 months. You must have had a very strong bond. But just like you said, the honey moon is over, all the positive you guys could give to one another has reached a dead point and you're now left with the honesty of this dynamic.\n\nI would suggest you to read [http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/content.php/78-Supervision-relations](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/content.php/78-Supervision-relations) to find some closer in the fatality of this outcome. Breaking up really is what's best for both of you. You can remain friends, it should be just fine.
9	Young ENTJs with older friends	I’m an 18-year-old, ENTJ female. For my entire life, I have always gotten along better with people who are older than me as opposed to my peers. When I say older, this ranges anywhere from mature people in their mid twenties to senior citizens. Conversations tend to come more easily and I usually relate to them more.  While I’m liked by many groups of people, I’ve always been one to befriend my professors, adults involved in my field of interest, and parents. Is this typical of ENTJs? 
6	Yes. Felt marginalized in high school for I couldn't relate to what my friends and most people at the time enjoyed. Not meaning that I felt superior, but different. So I had closer relationships with older pals met on the internet.  Should had try to socialize with the introverts back then, but I was too shy and influenced to get out of my badly suited social circle.\n\nBy now, most of my close friends are older than me.
6	ENTJs seek constant self improvement. Probabilistically speaking, older people would have had more experiences and therefore a greater quantity of information derived from those experiences. This makes them more valuable connections than younger people.
3	That's how it is for myself as well.
3	ENTJs tend to be more mature, at least in my personal experience and from what I've seen. It makes more sense that you get along well with people older than 18, which is a stupid age for most people, including myself.
2	I moved out at 18 and started working full time while paying my way through school. I couldn't really relate to anyone in my college classes who didn't care if they skipped class, flunked, etc while I had worked so hard to be there. That's when I first noticed a difference in values and ever since then I've just felt more comfortable with older people. I'm 25 and my group of friends are all in their early thirties. My boyfriend is INTJ and will be 33 in October. It's hard enough for me to click with other women, even more difficult if it's women my own age or younger.
2	Yeh boi\n\nI'm not ENTJ, but ESTJ and I have similar experiences. Most of my friends/fiancees tend to be older than me and I can relate to them more because their demeanor seems like the same as mines, while I tend to find my peers somewhat naive in their own respect (dwelling too much in their present endeavors, trying to live young too much, being annoying LOL). \n\nI have an innate desire to talk to older people, because I can dissect their own life experiences and apply them to my own. I learn a lot from them and how to handle things later on in life, and it is also interesting to discover who they were in the past and what led to them now and why. In contrast to my peers, there is not much to think about in the future when all of their experiences are about the same as yours so it's hard to believe them more trustworthy unless they really have gone through it or know what they are doing.
1	I think you’re just latching onto people you look up to. And when the Values you look up to take a while to manifest in someone such as proper intelligence and achievement it leads you to befriend people like professors or interesting adults. \n\nLower your standards a little for peers your own age and grade them on ambition it’s a worthwhile endeavor especially if you’re in a setting such as a somewhat selective university where you’re guaranteed that who you are talking to at least scores well on standardized tests.
1	I'm 26, but the vast majority of the guys I've slept with have been in their 40s and 50s.
1	Older friends with benefits?
1	Indeed very relatable to me as well. 
15	The Problem with ENTJ and INFJ Relationships	This is solely based off of my personal experience, but I thought I would write a quick warning regarding why such a pairing might not work.\n\nSocionics describes the relationship between ENTJs (LIE) and INFJs (IEI) as one of supervision, where the ENTJ is the supervisor and supervisee. If you guys want to read the socionics description of this kind of relation, you can look it up. Basically, the relation is an unbalanced one where the supervisee ends up feeling stifled. \n\nI recently called it quits on a potential relationship with an INFJ I really cared about, and ended up talking to a close friend about it.\n\nShe asked me something along the lines of, "Do you know the difference between caring deeply about someone and loving them?", and that's when things started to click for me.\n\nThe response I gave her back was what I felt was an accurate description of the dynamic I felt with the INFJ. It is as follows:\n\n"I think you're on to something. I deeply care about \_\_\_\_\_, but I have never been in love with him. When I care about somebody, I do things for them. When I love somebody, I also do things for them. So when I end up doing things for people, I assume that I love them if I see them as people worth loving. I'm always trying to make my close relationships more perfect, so I assumed that the goal was to love him and acted accordingly. But love for me is actually based off of vulnerability, trust, respect, and good communication. I think that since I couldn't get those things, that is why I was always unhappy. Nothing he did ever seemed like enough because his actions never hit on those four notes. I thought that if I acted affectionate towards him that I could take things to the next level and finally get what I needed, but my expression of love when I wasn't even sure if it was a genuine feeling or just something I had to do to get what I wanted made me feel like I was simply performing a role. And that lead to some resentment on my part. His inability to evoke emotions from me on a consistent basis probably just made him feel inadequate and like he had to try harder to win my approval.\n\nHe lied to me a lot, you know. But I think I never felt angry because there must have been a part of me that realized things were skewed in my favor. I'm a shitty person who should have realized this about us earlier. The whole time, he must have felt uncomfortable but unable to voice his concerns. \n\nI should have paid closer attention to what he had been trying to tell me all along."\n\nSo I guess that's it. I hope this helps any ENTJ who is either thinking of entering a relationship with an INFJ or is trying to get some insight into why things may have ended up the way they did.\n\nOnce again, this is based off of my personal experience with one INFJ I will always have a special place in my heart for. I'm not saying ENTJ-INFJ relationships can't work, but it didn't end up working for me. I think some of the pitfalls of the relation between the two could be lessened, but it seems like it would require a great deal of effort for both parties. In the end, it made sense for me to let him go. I hope we can still be friends and he finds somebody who is a better fit.\n\nAm I sad? Absolutely. But after writing everything out, I truly believe it was for the best.

4	INFJ here.I’ve dated a couple of ENTJ guys and each time I told myself it could work out if only sth changed from the previous relationship . Really never works though. I just resolved that we really don’t work.\nAlbeit, these are the hardest relationships to get over. 
4	INFJ here that’s been with an ENTJ for almost six years. I can see what you mean about the supervisor/supervised dynamic... but! As I’ve grown from an immature to mature and less turbulent INFJ, that inequality dynamic isn’t really there anymore. \n\nI feel like ENTJ and INFJ are a power couple if both have well developed shadow functions, have similar values, and are mature. Perhaps that can be said for any couple, however, because reaching those ideals in a relationship is quite challenging yet the payoff is immense.
2	I don't know if this is to do with mbti or just not being right for each other... I'm with my ENTJ and I'd say he omits the truth and withholds certain things to keep me happy, and I feel like a supervisor of him at times (particularly in regards to dealing with others in a more rational and sensitive manner). \nI let loose what I think and feel way more than he does. I don't lie at all. I think lying is a learned behaviour that serves a certain purpose eg. Fear of punishment. 
-8	I am an ENTJ.  ENTJs are shitty people.  I don’t know what MBTI my wife is but she’s an I-something and we argue a lot because of my shitty ENTJ-isms.  And because she expects me to be able to read her mind.  
20	I DESPISE romance: ENTJs pls comment	This is really getting old folks. I cannot count the stream of people that have turned out to be disingenuous, antithetical to my values, or just completely uncommitted. Just again, tonight, I’ve had to cut all the strings to someone I liked because this person lied to me. I will only take maybe one lie, two cancellations, otherwise my heart has become way too callous to be lenient. It upsets me over and over again to have to cut so many people out, but I know that I cannot make the same mistake twice by keeping them around. It makes me all so weary and I’m thinking it is maybe time to get a therapist. Maybe it’s hurtful to myself to keep cutting out these misfits, but I also wonder how a therapist could tell me to improve when I know best what my own standards are...\n\nIs this the case for any other ENTJs out there? Are we just too selective? Or is the barren wasteland of potential mates just something we need to get used to?
21	The vast majority of people I’ve experienced are non-committal in general because they prioritize themselves over all else. It takes selflessness to form true bonds. Don’t lower your standards, set the standard by being the best example of reciprocation you would expected from a relationship. \n\nYou insight change by leading it. You cannot expect others to meet a standard of yours if you comprise your standard when things become difficult, and you cannot set a standard higher than what you are prepared to live by. \n\nDefine your goals for friends and a potential partner. Live how you must to achieve it. \n\nI have many friends, but only those who reciprocate my values and consideration are in my circle. 
4	When a person has high standards for their self, they typically hold a high standard for others (i.e. someone they like). This statement is not true for everyone. It's common though. Those things and to whom will vary.\n\nI understand it's hurtful when others don't meet you half way or even all the way, especially if you always make the effort to go all the way. I think this is why it can help to go slow with people and also have enough room for patience and understanding. If you can do that then you are likely to see other good qualities and for improved reciprocation-- possibly commitment down the road. No one is perfect. You aren't perfect. So while you may be doing everything to make it work, you could be falling short in other things. Maybe down the timeline you need those people to take a few cancellations or you need to take a break from people to recuperate. Not every person you date is going to lie and cancel in the same parameters. Granted there are definitely lies that should never be done. Let's just say you dated someone for 1 month and their ex, who was also their childhood best friend died, and your date lies and cancels on you. Even whether the love going strong, why should your date have to be so committed to you to tell you things that cause him/her great pain while they are trying to keep things going in life? Sometimes people lie because they don't want to hurt someone or cause them confusion. This is not a solution and the truth has to come out, but its not for you to say at what point they should be ready to commit to you or to be honest about everything.\n\nYou might be more ready to commit, but others are still seeing if they want to commit to you. It's not that people don't like to commit. Most people are gradually making their decision to whom they want to commit to.\n\nYou should have values that you live by, and it would likely work with someone who share those values, but dating in particular is different from making friends. Both people are looking at the whole person, the deeper qualities, and the overall experience of conversation and being with other. There's a lot that you are taking in to imagine a life with someone. So if you aren't going to be more flexible and understanding towards others, your likely to cut off a lot of people who might have been worth it for you. I'm not saying you should let go big things, like someone lying about their identity or someone playing as a con artist. When your rules or expectations are so high, that can often be more than what others can take and you're asking to be disappointed. You need to give more-- be patient, understanding, forgiving, flexible, caring-- to allow others to see qualities about you that they feel they can commit to or work with as they are different from you.
4	As a 21 yr old ENTJ male, I grow weary of girls my age who want to play games and are absolutely freaked by commitment. However, I doubt that these state of affairs will stay the same over the course of the next 5 years or so when it comes to my experience with dating.
3	You laid it our very well. Totally relatable. I can only add one technique I've learned.\n\nMake sure to always monitor ANY feeling of resentment. They are guide that tells you if you are going in the righ or wrong direction. If you feel it:\n- You should stop sacrificing yourself OR\n- You need to grow up as a person and take on more responsibility\n\nIt's just hard to tell sometimes which is which in edge cases.
3	I like romantic things. But I general hate PEOPLE, because of the usual ENTJ reasons - too emotional, worried about things that aren't relevant, sappy and soft, whining about things they want and never doing anything to achieve them, etc.\n\nSo I stay away from romance
3	Keep trying. Keep working on yourself. Recognize that many ENTJs are incredibly stubborn about the slightest sign of incompetence or someone making us deviate from our standard of self dependence. Don't lower your standards, but consider lowering your expectations. Give more. Don't treat your partners like you do yourself - they aren't you. Learn to live with them, not force them into the mold of what you think they should/could be.\nI'm really, really good at being single. Trying really hard to be better at being with an imperfect person, cause heaven knows they are.
-1	Oh. come on! Give us some juice details!\n\nSo you are a male. How old?\n
0	You seem irresponsible. List the things that you could do better and not that you're too selective and that your environment is shit.
7	When we mess up	I just messed up so bad and I know that it was completely my fault. I think we are extremely hard on ourselves when we mess up but I can’t be stuck in this state. \n\nHow can I forgive myself even though logically I know it was all my fault. 
8	Time helps. As time passes, you’ll feel less and less connected to the event, and you’ll be able to view it as a learning opportunity. \n\nI made a major mistake two weeks ago and only now am I starting to forgive myself. The worst part was the mistake was caused by my emotions - I did something drastic and lashed out without logically thinking it though first, and I hate myself for it. But I’m slowly starting to not only forgive myself, but forgive the situation as well. Self-compassion can be hard when we have such high standards for ourselves. \n\nBut at the end of the day, we’re human. We make mistakes. If you can recognize why you made the mistake, learn from it and commit to never making the same mistake again and eventually you will get over it. \n\nI’m sorry you’re going through this. :/
4	At this point the only mistake left to make is not to learn and grow from it. Self flagelation isn't useful at all, it's just masochistic moping.\n\nYou can't undo your error. Own it, humbly apologize to those affected (and see if there is any way to make it up to them) , and take responsibility not only for your actions in the past but also for your duty to not repeat that mistake again. 
3	You are human.
2	Where, not how, did you fuck up? Specifics don't really matter, but was this something in your personal relationship or did you lose a million dollars on a bad trade at work?\n\nWhat really matters is who *you* think knows about your fuck up and how *you* believe those witnesses see you differently.\n\nFirstly, establish ownership and dominance. Be all over this fuck up. If it's a work fuck up, whenever it matters, be there to show your face covered in the sweat and shit you got from fixing your fuck up. If it's a relationship, own up your partner, but don't ask them to forgive you. Just own it and move forward, even if you have to carry your blown off arm in your pack. Right up through if/when they fire/dump your incompetent/insensitive ass.\n\nSecondly, you already know you'll do better.
1	Make the most of it and reflect on what happened and how you can improve for the future. At that point no need to be hard on yourself and yes, allowing time to pass will make the akward feeling go away.
1	You can forgive yourself if you can prevent this mistake from happening ever again, I think. There's no logic in grieving over something that has already happened. *Deal* with what happened, use your emotions to open a path, work in preventing any future similar occurrences, hang around with loved ones, and you'll be fine.\n\nOh, also, sometimes one can be too harsh on themselves. Make sure your logic is right, maybe ask loved ones.
1	Because beating yourself up for it is illogical. You already felt bad and will feel the consequences of your actions, that is punishment enough. Now it is logical to take your actions and consequences from an objective perspective and learn from the situation. Not just the mistakes but the successes. Everything that worked out wrong and why it did so, and everything that worked out well and why it did so.
1	Try and see failure as opportunity,\n\nNot everyone fails, some don't even try.\n\nSuccessful people fail waaaaaay more than unsuccessful people.\n\nIf you fail it means you're doing well.\n\nAlso I'd give Arnold Schwarzenegger rules of success video a listen, gets me through.
0	You messed up? Worry not; to err is human. Don't be too hard on yourself and just focus on your next goals and on minimizing the damage.\n\n\nOh and stop fucking little children! They have not matured physically or emotionally yet.
3	I just need a boost right now	Hey everyone, \n\nThis probably isn’t something I’d usually post but I wanted to ask for some words of clarity and advice for the future.\n\nI recently went through having to deal with debtors and the threat of bailiffs on behalf of my partner and I just feel mentally drained. At the last minute, my partner decided to pay the debt even though we had no knowledge of it (couple of parking/driving fines).\nWe’d gone to sign papers and sent them off yesterday and I even prepared some evidence to send out today. \n\nMy head isn’t in the right place and I don’t know how to refocus as I’m about to go back to work after a long break (was on holiday)\n\nThanks everyone :) 
2	Relax and disconnect then motivate yourself the way it works best for you
2	Try to meditate. Do something that eases your tension ever so slightly everyday. \nGet a massage - even massage yourself. Eye massages can be relaxing too - especially the hot & cool method.\nGeneral exercise/working out will certainly help.\nI'm sorry that you feel drained.
5	People are hating you.	How do you solve this problem?
28	Fuck them
19	- Determine if you're giving them a valid reason to do so.\n\n- If yes, you need a change.\n\n- If no, that's just negativity rooting out from jealousy or some other shit , that you don't need to care about.
3	You can't make everyone likes you, dude. Just pay more attention to who can really understand you and be willing to chat with you. That's fine. That always happenes in my life.\nJust explain why you must do something. Don't expect they can understand what you think.\nFor business, sometimes you must do something you hate to do but don't let them hurt yourself, don't care too much.\n\nBy the way, I'm chinese and my english may be not good enough but you can understand, right? Do what you want to do. Elite is less than stupid, believe it.
3	Depends solely on the reason.
4	I take a moment to pretend I care and then I keep working at becoming more successful than they are :) 
2	become virtuous.
1	Do 20 push-ups.
1	I know. 
1	I think my Girlfriend might be an ENTJ...	Everything I read about ENTJ seems to fit and I was hoping you guys could help me understand ENTJs better because I sure don't.\n\nThings like Criticism, insecurities, what they need from a partner to feel fulfilled, anything relevant?
8	I agree with the rest of the comments that your post is a bit ambiguous. \n\nBut I can give advice on how to make her feel fulfilled - take initiative. Plan dates. Surprise her with fun things to do. As a female ENTJ, I find I'm often the one initiating/planning things and it gets EXHAUSTING. I just want a man who will come in and take over and get shit done. Damn that would be hot. There is nothing more attracive than a man that knows what he wants and goes for it.
5	rephrase.  \nENTJ are selfsuficient, u being here ia a bad sign )  be afraid  
2	You're not giving us much to go on, but I'll try.\n\nThe ENTJ is fundamentally a problem-solver that looks to the future. The type wants to have a high degree of control and be able to constantly improve systems in a tangible way, including themselves. ENTJ's see people's strengths and weaknesses and generally use that information to help optimize what they can do. However, ENTJ's often feel disconnected, uncomfortable, and incapable when it comes to their own feelings and values - they can be at a loss for how to process strong emotions or conflicts relating to their values.\n\nAs far as criticism goes, constructive suggestions delivered without rancor are often very appreciated. Criticisms that are not supported by facts tend to be ignored, resented, or counterattacked.
1	Criticism to or from her?
17	Do you ever feel like just annihilating all obstacles?... maybe even in a violent way?	Like an urge.. like something or someone is in your way and it's stopping you from some goals you have\n\n
12	Every day at work. That’s why I’m productive AF
8	Every day I exercise some form of restraint or finesse to suppress the exact feeling you described. Though I'm happiest when I'm doing things that require all obstacles to be annihilated, things that demand 100% of my focus and allow me to push myself to my limits.\n\nTo be fair, it's not always an obstacle that needs annihilating -- but I totally understand your meaning.
5	Is there any other way?  :)
3	I get angry when I can't and it actually cuts into my self-esteem. My environment trained me to be completely passive until I overcame that training a few years ago, but now after a life of passivity I am not entirely sure how to eliminate certain obstacles. \nThe two biggest ones I have to fight my anger on are stupid random accidents like dropping things or bumping into something when I'm trying to move quickly, and people procrastinating or being so lax about doing something they need to be doing or telling me that it interferes with my plans or to the point wheee I get in trouble for being proactive at work because my boss doesn't want to do the job yet.
3	Yup. I have anger issues, and I'm apperently an ENTJ also.
1	Oh yeah.  That anger is one of my biggest motivators.  Like, if I go to the gym, and I’m perfectly satisfied with life, I will not get a good workout in.  The angrier I am, the better I perform.  \n\nI try to keep that a secret though, because I don’t like being angry.

3	I don't WANT to be an ass... Professional insight request	For those that run your own company, especially with partners, how do you set expectations/targets for others that don't carry the same standards?   \n\n\nHow do you hold them accountable when they don't hit them?  \n\n\nAnd of course the ultimate question, how do you center focus on the beauty of the greater picture, instead of getting  emotionally charged/frustrated with others?  \n\n\nI am often complimented for being well rounded and am generally lighthearted, but I've started a company with friends (because youthful ignorance) and we're not "Fucking Dominating and Crushing the Skulls of our Competition". To develop myself, I see this as a reflection of my own lack of wisdom and an opportunity to further develop leadership skills, but I was looking for some direction from others with similar mindsets. Halp?
6	[deleted]
2	What line of business are you in?\n\n> "Fucking Dominating and Crushing the Skulls of our Competition"\n\nYou see, you could do that without having others to work 80 or 60 or even 50 hour weeks.\n\n-----\n\nIf you were in the software business, then choosing the right people (sometimes a few ultimate \n & crazy hackers can do what a floor full of stellar employees can) and the right technology. Those hackers are very hard to find and next to impossible to herd.\n\nhttp://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html\n\nAlso if you find these hackers in the right place abroad, you can pay them like $15/hr instead of $50/hr. This introduces some complexity, but also pays off. So, when your profit margins are higher, you can afford to be more aggressive by throwing more bodies at the problem, without having to create a permanent crunch time. If you have to create a crunch time in order to reach a short-term goal, plan to give people rest and to hire more people thereafter.\n\nThink of it like driving in a 40 mile per hour zone. Could you go 45? If there is no traffic - no problem. Once you start needing to cross the 45 mph threshold, you should budget more time for your trip. Could you go 50? Yes, but now you are pushing it. A hungry cop can pull you over at any minute. Could you go 55? Yes, but only temporarily, only if you are a good driver and during day time and clear weather and having a police-detecting gadget - ok, you could. Could you go 60 in the 40 mile zone? Probably not for very long. what you do not want to do is be speeding at 70 mph at night in fog and rain and hit a car in which a pregnant wife of the district attorney happened to be driving, and then to panic and leave the scene. This would make your life a lot more difficult. It was not worth shortening your ride by 5-10 minutes, trust me.\n\nYou can find people who are self-motivated and near-perfectionists (but not necessarily want to crush skulls; some just want to do a good job), but only ExTJs tend to like to work crazy hours. Strategically take care of things that could make your team inefficient. Maybe partner with a competent INTJ for that.\n\nThen watch the speedometer. I mean, you can drive in the very left lane if you want, but your teammates should not have to (unless they are just like you). If people start to work closer to 50 rather than 40 hours per week, then you know it is time to hire someone else. it is not like you will run out of work. If you are growing, you will need this person for sure anyway. So just hire them 2-3 months sooner.\n
1	The only way is to get them to set their own standards and hold them accountable to what they signed up for.\n\nYou cannot expect people to live up to your standards. There's a possibility (a fairly likely one) that your 75&#37; is their 110&#37; and that they just need to step back more frequently than you do to cool down.\n\nIt's like when you were a kid, if you said "these are the chores I will do" it's a heap different than mum says "this is the list that's yours".\n\nSo that's my suggestion, go to the partners and say - "We are not "Fucking Dominating and Crushing the Skulls of our Competition", and I want to change that. To do this we need to re-set targets, expectations and \[blah blah blah\]. Let's sit down and go over where we stand, what we consider acceptable in our own teams/depts/etc and start setting some KPIs."\n\nKeep in mind you have to submit to them as well, they might say "less micromanaging" or "stay out of the Sales dept" and that's fine. When people start flaring up, which they will, come back to the mission/goal/big picture. Ask the question calmly - "Does this move us towards, or away, from our goals?" To quote Tom Bilyeu - "Do that which moves you towards your goals." and  "Do NOT do that which moves you away from your goals."\n\nYou all need to be held accountable to your own standards, and you may need to accept if theirs is lower than yours. Not everyone wants to put in 100hrs/week, even if you think that's the only practical path forwards.
7	Do any of you find that people tend to easily open up and ask for your advice?	Over the years people have been fairly quick to open up about personal problems and ask for advice. I've been told I am a good, non-judgemental listener, and offer logical, practical solutions. Does anyone else find they are the person people tend to go to for a listener and advice? \n\nI'm fairly new to mbti, and am 90&#37; sure I'm a borderline entj/intj, however I tend to use extroverted thinking over introverted intuition.

1	Yes. It has been such a pervasive pattern that it gave me trouble during my formative years; I was not emotionally strong enough to handle so much shared worry and stress.\n\nGood, non-judgmental listeners are apparently rare.
13	Do you guys also hate parties or is it just me?	I have always hated parties. I just don't see the point of them. They see inefficient and a waste of time. I honestly rather be doing something else. I see dancing as meaningless and the atmosphere just isn't for me. I'm not sure if hating parties is a learned behavior or if this is just my type.\n\nI would love to know what you guys think about parties  in general, it would give me some insight. Thanks!
32	I love parties! I am the party king! Usually the last one to leave too. Fun to dance and let loose and meet all your friends! And I always go hard and get DRUUUNK, but I always hold it together very well, and always get home.
12	I really like being exposed to / learning from new people, but I've been to many parties where it's difficult to converse with others. So it ultimately depends on who's there. I'm not the most sociable person, but if I have a crowd that I know I like around me, I can be quite the social butterfly.\n\nI love to throw parties way more than I enjoy going to them, just because I have more control. The downside is that a lot of people will start to inadvertently trash my place when they're heavily intoxicated.
8	INTJ
6	If by party you mean a large gathering of people socializing I enjoy it, but have trouble overcoming mild social anxiety.\n\nIf you mean more like a club atmosphere I loathe it and cannot abide the overt PDA, the pissing contests, the guys that can't take a hint, and I don't enjoy the loss of control that comes from being intoxicated.\n\nI do LOVE hosting parties though of any kind. I love getting everything together then stepping back to let everyone enjoy the ride while I may sure it stays on track.
5	I suppose it depends what you define as a "party". I absolutely love gatherings with my closest friends (there's a large group of us, probably about 16 or so). However, if someone invited me to a "party" where I knew barely anyone, I likely wouldn't go as I'd rather spend my time doing something meaningful to me. Conversing with people I don't care about is actually quite draining for me whereas conversing with my favorite people gives me so much energy. 
3	I love parties. I see them as platforms on which I can socialize comfortably, as, on average, people at parties are more relaxed than those you encounter elsewhere, not least because many people at parties are often drunk or on drugs. \n\nAs the result of a troubled childhood, I have long had a tad bit of social anxiety, which has, in the past, slightly hindered me from fully reaching my extroverted potential. At parties or on a night out, I feel I can shed this social anxiety, which should have gone away a long time ago on its own anyway.
8	Sounds very INTJ, I love parties, too much sometimes lol I always make sure that if I am going to a party that I finish any work before the party and make time to party and recover the next day. I feed off the party and become more sociable as the night goes on.
1	dancing is a great way to express yourself - and if you haven't tried (or are just uncomfortable) then you should check it out.  it's like a form of meditation..and meditation, reflection, etc..is mad important too.\n\n  I hate parties but love live music and gatherings, generally because I can have some deeper non-intoxicated thoughtful conversations about life and the universe.\n\ni think making best use of our time is important here - but you should totally seek meaningful experience outside of being productive and juggling time.
1	Parties made a lot more sense once I got in college and knew that I had a base guarantee that those around me made it through the admissions process and freshman year lol.\n\nParties are great what good is an entj that doesn’t let loose with some rum and coke and show the entps that we truely are superior in all settings.
1	I like parties. What I don't like though is not being to really socialize while I am there because the music is too loud. 
1	It depends on the people. Younger, my social circle of "friends" was clearly not a fit for me so I felt an outcast and dumbing down everytime, wasn't pleasant at all.  \n\nBut if I am partying with people I know and like, can meet interesting people, chill with my family, then I can be up all night drinking and dancing. I just need a few "real talk" interludes, that's the most interesting part of it, how people open up (me included) when joyful and alcoholized.
1	Love partying, meeting new people, dancing letting loose what’s not to like.
7	They say you're a mix of the five people closest to you	Let's say this is true,  who are these people? How do they influence you? How different are they from each others? What makes them unique to you? 
11	Every time I catch myself not liking myself much i check in on this. It's a hard thing to acknowledge that someone you love is making you a worse person.
6	1. Girlfriend (INFJ) - She loves the ENTJ way of thinking and adopted it, so we are self-reinforcing our wills. Also, consciously or not, I am paying more attention to my inner state (physical, emotional, energetic) on a daily basis. Has a killer body, which is an incentive for exercising more and eating better.\n2. Mom (ESFP) - Strong character and authority but still a loveable and loved person, and a good listener. Reinforce my stubborness. Also a lot into questioning politics and economy. Though she isn't so much knowledgeable about it in my opinion, she raises interesting questions that makes me think, and debate with her is enriching anyway.\n3. Brother (ISTP) - Curious and prone to leisure time. Gets me to ask more questions, to question how stuff works, but also he encourages me in entertaining more (mostly table and video games).\n4. Best friend (INTJ) - My partner in crime. Constant questioning about ourselves and society.\n5. Boss (ESTJ) - Overly strong character, friendly but very aggressive in communication. She hates people that asks the same thing twice, or worse, do the same mistake twice, which brings me to reinforce my listening, information assimilation and work processes overall. "Not the boss I wanted but the one I needed for now".\n\nThis is the current five. Though the four first are pretty always there, the fifth often varies and can be my mentor (undetermined, might be ENTJ) or close friends (ENFP, INFJ, INTJ).\n\nSo, the current five is influencing me in these ways:\n\n\- improves self consciousness (girlfriend, brother, best friend)\n\n\- reinforce ambition and will to stand out (mother, best friend)\n\n\- strengthen discipline (girlfriend, boss, sometimes best friend)\n\n\- questioning how the world around me is and works (mother, best friend)
1	Fuck. I’m my grumpy, soon to be moving out baby-mama, her sweet and sensitive 5 year old, our happy and hungry 4 month old, my smart although a bit whitebread office manager, and my quiet and dorky associate doc. I’m nothing like any of those people.\n\nNow, I’m a good mixture of my mom and dad, b cause I spent a ton of time around them growing up.
1	Who is this ‘they’ you speak of.. 🙃
1	I'm having a bit of a hard time determining the person whom I would rank as  fifth on my list, mostly because so many of my greatest friends now live in other parts of the country, so it is hard to rank them. That said, here is my list:\n\n*Format*: #Rank. Relationship: Type: Contribution to Me\n\n1. Dad: INTP: Rationalism, Seriousness\n2. Best Friend Since Elementary School (I'm 26): ISFJ (surprisingly. we have an unusual relationship that involves a lot of parallel play): Conscientiousness\n3. Brother: ENFP: Enthusiasm, some degree of Friendliness, some degree of Adventurousness\n4. Mother: INTJ (but certainly not an archetypal INTJ): Determination, Industriousness\n5. The Contenders are (in no particular order):\n\n* Going-Out Friend: ESTJ (?): Extroversion, Thrill-Seeking\n* College Friend: INTP: Rationalism, Seriousness (same as Dad)\n* College Friend: ISTJ: Easy-Goingness, though I'm not super easy going\n* College Friend: ENTJ: Everything ENTJs have in common\n* Middle-Aged Going-Out Friend: ENTP: Fun-Loving, Humorousness\n* Long-Time Partner of the Above: ESTJ: Humorousness, etc.\n* High-School Friend: ESTJ: Directness, Dark Sense of Humor\n\nI suspect many of these friends and family members would say my contribution(s) to them are: indomitable determination, sauciness, combativeness, ambition, honesty, hot-headedness, etc.
4	Any entj biomedical engineering students? How do you find it?	
5	Meeeeeee! Well technically I graduated but hopefully I still count. My department had us do Myers-Briggs tests for a group project junior year. There were a good bit of extroverts. At least compared to other disciplines 
19	I just wanted to say thanks for letting me know I’m not crazy.	The world has gone all wonky.  I’m told that truth is subjective and logic isn’t always right.  I see intelligence acting without compassion and compassion acting without intelligence.  Everyone seems to be drawing a line in the sand between us and them.. looking for an enemy.\n\nI’m doing my best to keep up with it all, and doing my best to truly understand what’s happening around us.  And I’m trying to maintain an unwavering sense of rational optimism.  I wanted to let y’all know that this sub doesn’t just contribute to that optimism.. it contributes to my sanity as well lol. ✌️ 
13	We're all mad here. The difference between us and them is there's a method to our madness.
2	If you want to understand radical optimism, go and read Abundance by Peter Diamandis, or hit up some of his videos, or his tedx talk.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BltRufe5kkI\n\nor his YT channel, peter h diamandis.
-1	You are not crazy, but you are an asshole ;)\n\n\nWhat you call "logic" is an illusion. Just electrical signals in our brain (assuming that brains and electricity are real). I could be just a cockroach tripping on powerful drugs and thinking that I am human.\n\nSome of us are more rationalish than others thanks to evolution, but nobody is rational.\n\nI do not even know if evolution is real. Have we evolved or just created in a simulation? Or evolved in a simulation? Was it natural or artificial selection? Is anything truly artificial? How do you define it? Everything comes from nature, right? How do you define nature though? Does artificial mean "synthetic"? Well, who synthesized it? Other beings? Were they themselves natural or were they also synthetic? If they were synthetic, then who synthesized them? Does this recursion ever stop, or is it turtles all the way down? By the way, were they natural turtles or synthetic ones?\n\nSo yeah, I hope this clears things up and you are no longer confused. I think I contributed to your sanity.\n\n
7	ENTJs and Justice (Fi?)	I was wondering if any other ENTJs have a strong sense of justice, and wanting it no matter the cost. How does our Fi play into this? Is it more prominent in times of personal stress? \n\nI feel an "itch" when I see people getting away with things that are wrong. Sometimes it's surprising how hard I focus on that, considering it's our weakest function. Any insight is appreciated, as I'm going through some interesting times. 
13	Ethics and Morals, less so justice, drive me.\n\nThe Fi fires off in me as a "gut feeling" that this "isn't right". I can pinpoint times when my Fi has flagged me as making an incorrect decision, and when I let my logic override it I always regret my decision later.
6	Depends. "Justice" is actually a nebulous word. Are you thinking of (1) justice as defined by your set of ethics, (2) justice as defined by the laws of society, (3) justice as a means to proper cooperative function of a group, or (4) something else entirely?\n\nIf you're talking about situation 1 then it absolutely makes sense that Fi would be involved in some capacity, and times of stress could very plausibly influence exactly how your cognitions form. Also, I would really hesitate to call the inferior function the "weakest", that ignores a lot of the nuance involved. The inferior function doesn't mesh well with the approach given by the first three functions - it sticks out like a sore thumb. Depending on the exact circumstances it can be strongly repressed, a source of self-doubt and conflict, or (usually temporarily) distort someone's behavior or attitude in very uncharacteristic ways.\n\nOn the other hand, I frequently experience a nagging sense of justice that seems to be more rooted in 3, and I think it comes more from Te and Ni than Fi. Specifically, I'm bothered by rule breaking activity because that demonstrates a failure in the system. My Te identifies the infraction and my Ni suggests that the system will not function if a critical mass of rule breakers is reached, which makes me want to implement a replacement system that doesn't have the vulnerability so I don't have to think about it anymore.\n\nReally, though, I think it more likely that this is wrapped up in your Fi.
3	Absolutely. I’ve noticed that I have an almost inflexible sense of morality/fairness/justice compared to my non-ENTJ friends. I’m a stickler for the rules and what’s “right” haha. 
1	ENTJs value meritocracy but are pragmatic. Julian Assange's type is an INTJ. Are you sure you are an E?\n
5	How would ENTJs cope in a communist society?	ENTJs thrive in capitalist economies, are natural leaders in the corporate world and do their best when they have a lot of freedom to do new things to make money and are responsible for telling other people what to do.\n\nWhat would happen to the ENTJs in a theoretically perfect communist society, free of the usual famines, corruptions, government scandal and inevitable inequality that arises from the usual federal government employees and military personnel exploitation? I mean in a **real** communist society where everyone was **equal**--an ESTJ's dictatorship utopia where everything runs the same all the time, even when it's clearly obviously not the best way, and there's no way for anyone to get ahead by any quantifiable measurement?\n\nHow do you think that'd shake out for you guys? 
13	They would thrive as politicians 
7	Stalin coped very well and he was an ENTJ.\n\nI think ENTJs and ESTJs actually do worse in democracies, that's why they pursue autocratic power in the private industry. 
10	Communism is a theoretical society where advanced technology means work is largely automated and people are free to pursue scientific and artistic interests. \n\nAs far as a socialist society goes an ENTJ would do fine. You can't get rich in a socialist society but its not as if everyone is identical or there are no hierarchies. An ENTJ would do fine in government or a leadership role in a scientific field. \n
1	I'm chinese and an ENTJ. Actually, socialism is not the same as Nazi dictatorship. You must listen to the advice of other ENTJ and get the best tactic unless you can deal with all troubles by yourself.
1	You would just apply dictator like attributes to which career or position would have the most use for it. If everyone truly was equal, there would be no sense in rejecting a job offer that essentially lined up all of you're skills with a position that exists in real life. The problem there would simply lie in the fact that if you let idealism take more hold in your mind than realism, no job would be perfect for anyone since our preferences, ENTJ or not could be boiled down to feeling like one should be paid simply to breathe instead of actually get work done, which is an idealism that easily spreads from person to person. At the end of the day the worst fear of communism is in how likely it would be that people's tendency to be lazy and entitled would make cause for mild to severe amounts of social unrest.
13	THIS GOES ON IN THE MIND OF AN ENTJ	
7	Am I the only ENTJ who doesn't completely relate to this? I mean, time's important but I'm not constantly thinking about it.
5	This hits a bit too close to home. You live now and only now. Today will be gone forever in just a few hours. What am I going to do with those hours? How will I make sure I go to sleep thinking 'today wasn't wasted'? \n\nExcellence is not an outcome. It's not status, or money, or fame. Excellence is the sheer determination to make most out of each and every single day. 
3	Good to see another ENTJ on The Path.
2	Kinda seems like a sensor to me...
1	Nah, This guy just adopted the attitude. For us going and getting what we want and succeeding is an event that happens on any given day. We also don't make melodramatic videos about it. 
4	Help ENTJs!	Hello ENTJs. INTJs. Need some advice from the Te Masters. I won't give my story, but I find myself in an unusual time in my life. My question is: if you were starting over in your career right now, where would you begin? 
10	I went to college, and I would ***definitely*** still go to college, but I would do some more research into what jobs are in demand, and I would seek out more information about the ones I didn't know much about, rather than just gravitate to the ones whose titles I recognized. I would also get more realistic about my monetary expectations. And I'd pick my major accordingly.\n\nTo maybe illustrate a bit: I obviously don't know your story, but I'm American, and here in the U.S., we're basically taught that if you're good at science, become a doctor; if you're good at math, become an engineer; and if you're good at English become a lawyer. All the kids who don't like the idea of any of that stuff go into business. (I'm simplifying, but the point of the story is: we only teach kids about a few different professions.) I was great at all my school subjects but disliked math and enjoyed English and the social sciences the most, so since the fourth grade, I wanted to become a lawyer. I graduated from a prestigious university in 2014 with a major in international relations and a pre-law distinction. I worked in a super dysfunctional law firm for just two months, hated it, studied for the LSAT for a bit but then learned more and more about how competitive that profession has become and about how there are very few jobs there, so I decided it would be wise to switch paths. I settled on going into academia, so I went back to school to get my master's in political science. I ended up graduating with a master's in social science from a great school, but while I was there I learned more and more about how academia is even more competitive than law. For a while I flirted with the idea of going into teaching, but then I got a temporary job as an analyst (good job actually but unfortunately it was temporary), and my starting salary as an analyst was the average salary of a high school teacher in California. And I felt like I had ***no money ever.*** I'm very fortunate to have grown up in a well-to-do family. But I was never really a big spender, and at the time I was choosing a career path, I didn't want a family, so I figured I'd be totally fine on a teacher's salary.\*\* No. Wrong. Very wrong. I wish I had realized sooner that the standard of living I aspire to have requires a salary higher than what I'd expected. Anyway: Right now: I am unemployed, which as a typical ENTJ, is ***very*** difficult for me, but I have two degrees from two very prestigious schools and work experience as an analyst. So I'm going to get a good job. In fact, it looks like one is kind of in the works as we speak. However, the process has been much more difficult than it could have been. For instance, right now I could have been on my way to becoming a psychiatrist, a profession I probably would have liked just as much as a lawyer, but I'd blinded myself to such a career because I just thought so simplistically to myself: "Science is boring." Another example: right now I'm working on a graduate certificate from Stanford on cybersecurity, which will definitely make me more competitive. However, I don't have a BS in computer science (or a BS in anything for that matter), so getting any sort of run-of-the-mill cybersecurity-professional job will still be difficult. Rather, it will more likely help me get a job for which cybersecurity is an important but secondary or even tertiary component, which will probably be a great job but is harder to find...and might not really pay any more.\n\n\*\*(I will acknowledge that many teachers actually make great money, especially ones that teach at good public schools and have been teaching there for many years. I wouldn't count on ending up as one of those teachers though. It's risky to plan on that.)\n\nI hope my story illustrates how I would do things differently. Though, I predict things will turn out well and that I won't have very many, if any, true regrets. But still....\n\nI really hate to sound like an asshole, but it's  true: if you're unsure, major in business or finance.\n\nIf you're already through school, sorry; I hope my post wasn't a total waste of time for you.
5	1. Identify my natural strengths\n2. Identify my interests, passions, hobbies \n3. Figure out if there is anything I'm good at that many others aren't, even if it isnt my favorite \n\nFind common ground from those three elements. Seek flexible training/accreditation/apprenticeship as appropriate to let me keep providing/working to pay the bills.\n\nWherever you are in life, hard work, organization,  politeness (not timidity!) and timeliness will take you surprisingly far. 
2	I would Make sure it’s meaningful to me. 
2	Coder here. I would not pay for a brick and mortar education. I would also major in statistics. I would be better at selling myself. I would have an impressive GitHub and web presence. I would be picky about who I work for (I have my own criteria) I would spend a lot less time being an employee. I would cut ties with more people sooner. I do not regret the choices that I made. For one, some choices were not available. However, knowing what I know now, I would not make the same choices again if I were starting over (hypothetically).
1	I would start with the basics, work on the foundations of my life, start eating well, working out, do self development work, maybe see a psychologist. Then build out, research research research on what I want to do, create a life plan A, B and C. Then the easy part, work your ass off lol
1	80000 hours.com is a good place. \n\nAlso Tim urbans essay on it. 
1	Haven't started my career but I plan to be organized (lol typical entj stereotype), like, keep everything in folders, take your post its, and summarize in gorgeous bullet points, with arrows. Do exercise, three times a week, maybe running for half an hour? Eating healthy, you are what you eat, your body will thank you for that, and it will take care of everything else (defense against pathogens, keeping you in shape, unclogging your arteries). Yes, I will study biomedical engineering, I'm quite obsessed with health. If you are like me, type 3 ENTJ, Stop.Trying.To.Please.People. It leaves you tired, and stressed, and you lose yourself. Be easy on you, work hard but take your time. \n\nYou'll do well!
1	1. Get skills and credentials to get employment.\n\n2. Get employment to get achievements.\n\n3. Get achievements to get better employment.\n\nRepeat 2 and 3 until you die.\n\nYour story isn’t very detailed, so I can’t give you a better strategy than this.
6	ENFP Friend Getting Too Upset Over Politics...	DISCLAIMER: I won't state my views here, and I don't plan on it. \n\nI may have just lost a friend, y'all. She was talking about who my parents voted for (I'm 17) and who I would have voted for. She's ENFP and her Te shows a lot when she's blunt. She started explaining how we need to care more about who we vote for, as it's our life. Now, I plan on leaving the USA after uni so I care a bit less than others but still. I walked away, saying that she could leave when she wanted to, and left her stuff outside of my bedroom door. \n\nNow, I may sound immature but I tried so, so, many times to defuse the situation and she kept blowing up at me and insulting my parents, whom she frequently calls her own. Should I stop being friends? I don't want to but this isn't the first time it's happened and I'm getting upset. \n\nAdvice? Sorry for the long post, I'm ranting. \n\nEDIT: She's fine now. Her mother is big on politics so it hit close to home, but we're back to normal. I do have a question though - why do all of my ENFP friends do this? She's not the only one. Thanks!
7	Just let her blow up, some people are unreasonable with certain topics and unfortunately we cannot control others' reactions to things. If you try to control her reaction or take responsibility for it you'll just make yourself miserable,
5	Politics in high school is always an ongoing trainwreck. The harsh truth is, from my observation and experience, you better keep these people out of your life (the overemotionalizing suckers for political stuff). Even 10 years later, some of them are still being overly irrational about it.
2	[deleted]
2	Some people are so attached to social issues it’s hard for them to act level, especially if they have a handful of personal stories connected to such issues. When they blurt out like that, she may not be trying to convince anyone, but simply taking out her own frustrations on people she thinks perpetuates similar experiences to what she might have seen or been through. Talk to her if there are any personal connections between her and those issues, and try to reveal the nuances if you can.
2	This is fucking hilarious.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5cfw6c/bigoted_ana_kasparian_quote/\n
2	Feelers are easily ideologically possessed
1	As an ENFP, I can say that what's happening is essentially you're stinging her Fi and she's lashing out to defend her worldview.
1	You hit a nerve~\n\nThe way I see it, political choices are somewhat of a reflection of what a person stands for; so, if it goes against my values, it's probably going to cause me to heavily question things.\n\nPerhaps I'm more grounded in that I think about questioning "what led to such belief systems" in a validating way before jumping to conclusions, but some will just let it fly if prejudiced.
1	Get rid of her, she sounds pretty worthless to me, especially if she is insulting you and your family. No one insults me or my family. And definitely not something that friends do.
0	seeking help as an infp.	iv been trying to tighten up some areas of my life,i have ben reading general psychology,but i think some mbti knowlege on infp can also add to it.as an infp,how can i tap into more willpower,like following routines more,overcomming some anxieties about certain situations,just boost that drive??what does myers briggs knowlege give on this,and just your general ideaologies and opinions?
8	Four things:\n\n1) Moral obligation\n\nDo the thing you know will feel awful if you don’t.\n\n2) Tame your search\n\nGet yourself to stop coming up with alternate ideas, or sourcing ideas from the outside world.  Your best ideas are going to come from meditation, shower thoughts, or just writing. You’ll execute on those ideas because you’ll feel more sure that they’re yours and didn’t come from somewhere fake.\n\nYou’re going to be inclined to share ideas you care about. It’s better to do them. The test for how good an idea is how well it works, not how excited you or others get about them.\n\n3) Forgive people\n\nFind a way to get past offenses. Forgive people over and over. INFPs waste so much time and energy getting over how people hurt them. INFPs get hurt pretty easily and take a long time to recover.  Get better at recovering faster so that you can get back to work.  You can take much more than you think you can. \n\n4) Organize yourself, and don’t overdo organization\n\nYou’re going to say that you’re not organized, and that’s fine.

3	Yo, people on this sub struggle with willpower and routine from time to time as well. It’s a habit issue, not a secret of our mbti type.\n\nThe answer is the same you’ll find anywhere. Get active, wake up early, set goals, etc.
4	I don't think MBTI can help you.  Time to move on.
0	Unlimited Power!!!	Are all ENTJs power hungry or is that just a me thing?
16	[deleted]
10	Depends on what you mean by power. I like being listened to and able to influence things but using established institutions always felt a little bit like cheating. I didn't like the notion that if I was being stupid there would be something stopping me from getting called out for it. So I think the answer is yes, but I want to make sure I always deserve it.
5	I think ENTJs care more about making an impact on their environment. Sometimes it's easier to do so with an established position, sometimes it's not.
4	I like control - a mechanism of power. But, I also have a remarkable ability to not give a fig.\nI think it's important to develop not giving a fig.
1	While I tend to run things in my personal life, in my day job I am more of a consigliere. Of course, as an attorney, I don't really expect to run the business (not a law firm). My last four bosses have described me, respectively, as Machiavellian, diabolical, cutthroat, and evil.
1	I like the booty, power over that commodity is what i want .
7	My Name is Somethingpretty88....and I am an ENTJ	Hi Everyone, \n\nSo as part of my masters in leadershupip we've been doing myers briggs over two days and after a group of 45 of us, I am the only ENTJ so decided to google and discover a communtity of more of us. I am the only one...and a female aswell, which our facilitator said was quite rare? \n\nI've always been called bossy at school, like to speak my mind and get frustrated easily when people dont do thing my way and its been so useful to conceptualise that and put a name on it- to then work on my strengths AND weaknesses at work. \n\nIs anyone else here a high achiever? I have progressed at work quite rapidly and often feel I have to prove myself and can be rather agressive in my style due to this. 
11	I've never been particularly committed to work as the means of proving myself, but I definitely do have a strong desire to show that I'm capable, and become so in areas where I'm not. I tend to be more blunt than aggressive though, with a sort of "I'm not holding it against you but this is not good" kind of approach.
1	Medical school hopeful, you could call me a high achiever. Hopefully it works out 😅
1	Nice name, wanna bang?
1	I wouldn’t characterize myself as “blunt”, I see a lot of ENTJ’s do so.  I would say I have an element of candor but tend to try to maintain smooth social relationships so I temper it as needed.\n\nAs far as achievement I seem to have a masochistic tendency to choose “hard mode” at every path divergence, I think it comes down to a desire to prove myself as you mentioned.  I’ve found these efforts are highly favored in hierarchical organizations so I’ve been pleased with my career thus far.  Though some of the BS the ESTJ’s pepper such organizations with is hard to take.
1	This is a definite side note but when you say “achiever” I think enneagram 3.

7	Pride and Praise	Does anyone else in here have issues with ego or needing praise? My long term thinking is flawed in moments where I subconsciously feel I should get praise for something. I'm working on getting my ego in check, but I sometimes make decisions in order to receive positive feedback that are harmful in the long run even if refraining would receive more. \n\nI'm not sure I'm making sense, but the basic question is does anyone else struggle with pride or low self esteem?
7	In short, no. \n\nLet me explain.\n\nI always work to put myself at the feet of people who know more than me, and in front of whom I look like a rank amateur. This way I always have a "mentor" to learn, grasp, and grapple with concepts and ideas.\n\nIn that kind of situation, my pride and ego come from showing that person I've learnt something from them and that I am executing on that knowledge. That I can and do value their time by growing and improving as fast as possible. If I get things wrong, then I do feel shame, but I also turn that around ASAP and it becomes another learning experience.\n\nI believe, when you are not the "master" then you cannot have the ego that someone of that rank can (but still shouldn't) have.\n\nSo as a tip to try and temper the ego. If you read non-fiction, then pick up "Ego is the Enemy" by Ryan Holiday. Covers the topic pretty well.\n\nIf not, say this, on loop, in your brain and out loud, for like a month - "I am the dumbest person in the room until proven different. Everyone here knows something I don't, and it's my job to find out what they know that I don't and learn each and every tidbit of knowledge". \n\nYou must also, quietly in the back of your mind remember "I am NEVER the dumbest person in the room. I an ENTJ and think around corners". \n\nI work in a school. When I, as the top-level IT guy in the school can walk into a class of year 3's with this attitude AND ACTUALLY LEARN SOMETHING FROM A STUDENT (obviously not IT related, but some knowledge regardless), that's when I feel pride in myself. I could have walked in with an air or arrogance, stupid kids, breaking my computers \*grumble grumble grumble\*, then that would have gotten me nowhere.\n\nMy co-worker is an ex-mechanic. So while my IT knowledge outstrips his by years, when it comes to machinery I cannot even spell "oil" let alone tell you where to put it. \n\nFeeling pride needs to be from intrinsic praise, not extrinsic praise.\n\nTom Bilyeu, from Impact Theory (look it up on YT) says this:   \n"The only thing that really matters is how you feel about yourself when you are sitting alone in a dark room."\n\nSo if you are relying on others for your validation then you are setting yourself up for a rough time. \n\n</sermon> (sorry!)
2	Somewhat, though I've found it's only really an issue when it's someone who I feel like is "on my level" so to speak, and whose praise would really mean I'd earned it. People who are generally complimentary don't scratch the same itch even if they're being specific.
1	Hey. Nice job on that thing you did. \n\nBut seriously, learn how to praise yourself. If you do something cool, acknowledge it. 
1	My issue is with people that I don't feel are on my level. If I'm around people that I see as smarter than me or better in any way I see it as deserved humility, but with people not quite on my level I feel like they should look up to me the way I look up to those smarter than I am.
1	As much as it makes me uncomfortable; when someone tells me I am smart; it goes straight to my ego. My problem solving abilities are tied directly to my self esteem. The behavior that comes from this put me on /r/iamverysmart and /r/iamberybadass. Even that I will wear like a badge of honor.
8	ENTJs and personal philosophy	Sorry if this has been discussed at volume before, but I met another ENTJ for the first time and we both talked about our fondness for utilitarianism, namely JS Mill. It made me wonder if our personalities aligned with that school of thought more. \n\nI’d love to hear what kind of philosophy other entjs are interested in!

1	I have just started studying philosophy and haven't found my niche yet, but most of these I've never heard of and I'll have to look into them more.
1	Nietzsche's "Ubermensch" is described as not being constricted by one ideology.\n\nI favor parts of Stoicism and Hindu Ashtanga, and see Psychology as extremely useful.
1	The rules do not apply to me.
1	Stoicism always
3	ENTJ Fiction Books	I know we get caught up on learning new skills or bettering the ones we have, but I get most of my E from characters in books, games, and movies. (by environment, not by choice) Does anyone have book suggestions that have characters that are or are similar to ENTJ? \nI personally liked the Star Wars book, Thrawn. Although he isn't very social he seems to fit everything else and I feel he gets his social interactions from art the way I have to get them from stories.
9	Enders game
5	What do you mean by getting your E from characters? You’re extroverted toward fictional persons? Lol 
3	I have a HUGE problem letting myself sit still and watch any old movie. I get antsy, it feels like that 2-3 hours is wasted, and I just want to get to the punch line and move on. I feel the same about TV shows - why am I assigning 150 hours of my life to this "thing"...\n\nI do go out of my way to watch the franchise movies, LOTR, Star Wars, Potter, and a few superhero ones (a few) but that's once, maybe twice a year. In fact, if I watched 5 movies in a YEAR that would be a big year for me. This is mostly as bonding time with my wife (ISFJ).\n\nSo in short, no. I don't really experience much fiction any more. I used to watch and read a HEAP, but now I do less of that. As soon as I "put my tools down" at the end of the day and watch some YT or TV, I fall asleep in under 30 minutes, whether I want to or not. \n\nI'm curious if other ENTJs have this experience as well?
1	Only when friends are perhaps going to watch a movie and I join in.  I always feel like I only have so much time in the day to accomplish my goals so I very rarely read or watch something non-fiction. Hopefully someone else will comment with some ideas.  It would certainly be nice to get out of my head for a bit. :)

1	I wouldn't know about ENTJ characters, but as far as characters that ENTJs would enjoy, I'd say The Mentalist is a very good show where things almost never go wrong because of stupidity or miscommunication (personal pet peeve). All the characters are intelligent and self-possessed.\n\nAnother favourite is The Name of the Wind (book). Excellent writing and storybuilding, and just about the only book I can read over and over, slowly, and still enjoy. I have the ENTJ problem of wanting to get to the highlights immediately but every bit of that book is a highlight. \n\nAlso The Lies of Locke Lamora. The first book is very good, but I find that the quality goes down for the subsequent books. :(

12	Have you guys ever gotten back with an ex who you broke up with? If yes, why?	ENTJs are thoughtful decision maker. Sometimes you left your loved one because it was necessary. If you have gotten back with an ex... why? Or you will never go back, even if they(your exes) have obviously changed.
18	Yes, there was a reason I was interested originally.  When I catch feelings for someone, it is hard to put that genie back in the bottle.  I don't like to cut ties with people in general...never know when having a good relationship with someone will be adventitious down the road.  But that philosophy gets WAY murkier when it comes to romance.  \nAdmittedly my weakness in life is romance.  I struggle with high standards and personal image, coupled with a desire for intimacy and companionship, leads to complicated relationships with romantic partners.  So when you have an Ex that you still have feelings for making positive changes in their lives...it is difficult to not want to give it a try again.
15	Dating your ex is like putting on your dirty clothes after a shower.
5	When I was younger (around 18-20) two of my relationships were on-and-off because I was figuring this dating thing out (and the girls were brats). But once a breakup was definitive, I never went back. Part of it was pride, but the other part was that as a person, the things I wanted changed and just didn’t align with what they wanted.
5	Never got back together/kept in contact with an ex. If a relationship fails I’ll typically cut them out completely. 
3	Never got back with my exes, we did break up for good reasons. Wouldn’t bring up the option of breaking up if we could solve the issues or work to compromise. Getting back would just mean getting stuck with the same problems. 
2	Never gotten back with an ex. There’s a reason we broke up.
2	No way. I'm friends with some, but I don't believe in rehashing unsuccessful ventures. 
1	Yes. I couldn't imagine a better future if she wasn't in it. 
1	The short answer is yes, I have.\n\nThe detailed answer is that every situation is different. Certain things inevitably change over time (age, financial stability, physical & mental health, etc.), for better or worse. I wouldn't cut someone out of my life "on principle" that I dated when I was 18 if many years later we're living totally different lives. Obviously learn from your mistakes and recognize when someone refuses to change, but it's pretty clear to me when people deserve a second chance and when it's time to close the door. 
1	There may be good, logical, and pragmatic reasons to stay with someone you don’t like much or go back to an ex.  There may be children involved, social or family pressures, career considerations, or you may just have a hope or gut feeling that while things may have been bad in the past, they won’t always be that way.  I can see where an ENTJ’s mindset could come to terms with this decision.
1	I did it once and the reason was because i didnt find anyone who has a heart as pure as her and a brain as brilliant as her
1	No. When I go through a breakup I see it as a point in my life where I have to raise my bar as a person. I become more focussed, and more determined on my goals which in turn raises my attraction to other women. \n\nOnce I’m done and my heart isn’t in it anymore... I’m done. \n\nI may have causal sex with an ex but there is no way I’m getting back with her lol. 
1	Absolutely not. Never repeat the same mistake twice. Cut off all contact, and make that individual bear the pain of their breakup.
1	Hangin' with Bigfoot	Thank you so much to the people who answered my last question. Here's another one, in case anyone is willing to help out.\n\nSay you're a 10 or 12-year-old boy on a three or so day hike through the woods with Bigfoot. What would you want to do?\n\nOh, shoot. Adding information here: In the late eighties, early nineties. You don't have a cell phone. In fact, all you have is some food, a Game Boy, a Walkman, a backpack and a clean shirt. 
2	Take lots of pictures and video footage of Bigfoot and then offer to give up its location for millions of dollars.
2	We'd explore things together, climbing trees and entering caves. Then maybe we'd try to teach each other things. I can also imagine swimming together, or racing each other on foot. Maybe enjoy a campfire together. Or try to build something like a hut. 
2	As long as big foot acts right I can chill all day.
1	How am I on a 3 day hike at age 10-12? Is my dad a Bigfoot hunting hobbyist, and he’s having me tag along for the experience? 
1	What do you mean *with* Bigfoot? Anyways I'd probably trap it. Try and tame it. Then teach him tricks, like helping me build a fort, fishing/hunting and stuff. Hang on his shoulders, fight a bear, that sort of things...
1	". . . through the woods with Bigfoot."\n\nThe woods has Bigfoot in them or the child is in the company of Bigfoot? \nEither way the answer is be productive in some way that benefits the long term.
1	bigfoot's my dad now and i live in the woods. he's going to raise me. 
1	Well i did grew up close to south american jungles, you learn fast some animals / insects are cool, some need to be killed (mainly snakes, scorpions, "weird" looking spiders, etc) and some need to be run away from, woods or jungle does not matter for this one tough, if bigfoot suddenly is with me and he has never been caught it means only one thing, no person that got this close survived, i could maybe give him all the food slowly to avoid being eaten for those 3 days then at some point be killed by it, maybe while trying to escape.
4	Intp female infiltrating this sub	Ello! \n\nGoing to keep this short. I do not know of any entj’s irl, in-fact I am a female hermit that is random as... fuck... \n\nPM me if your bored. I want to understand you. I guess what drew me to this, is someone posting how this is the perfect match for my type and I want to understand why. I’ve already read on why but want to understand it on another level. 
7	Eh, You could just ask questions here publicly. :)\n\nI've always been into xNFPs but somehow the quiet, reliable and competent nature of INTPs makes me very interested. I work in programming, so I get to meet some.
3	Unless there are personal reasons to keep it private, this is probably the sort of thing that readers of this thread could learn from. In any case, what I've found is that ENTJs and INTPs tend to arrive at similar conclusions about things via completely different means of figuring them out, which means that we get along well but still provide a significantly different perspective to learn from and work with.
2	What exactly do you want to understand? \n\nI've had a lot of success with intps in my life so happy to shed insight if you are just curious! 
2	I'm not sure if this is the level of understanding you seek but enjoy:\n\nThe theoretical explanation would be that every type can obtain all the functions (either in their personality or their shadow) but it's the order in which they're stacked that makes the difference between the types. INTP and ENTJ functions are in such order that the combination of these types works really well because the motivations are comparable but both use different methods.\n\nIn reality I would expect to see something like this: INTP comes up with new idea, ENTJ executes idea, INTP corrects certain mistakes, ENTJ improves the concept. \n\nBy creating something both types hope to get a valuable place in society. The INTP, because they want to understand how they as an individual fit into the tribe. The ENTJ because they value the tribe above themselves and therefore wants to help the tribe improve.\n\nOther good combinations for INTP would therefore be ENFJ or ESTJ. The perfect combination would depend on which functions the INTP and the other person have integrated and trained.
2	We should have an ENTJ group chat
1	I'm an entj young woman, basically i look like an esfp when happy, an intj when sad, and an entp when I'm alone

14	How much do you make? Does it matter?	How much you guys make, and at what point does the money stop mattering? 
14	Notice how many people here say they would be happy with just a little more than they make currently. Don’t be one of those people, or you will always be unsatisfied no matter how much you make. It’s not a good life to live like that. 
8	I make about £800-1000 a month between my salary and gigs. It's enough to live comfortably and I have the freedom to work on music and chill out a bit. It's a good arrangement - money is nice but ultimately I just need enough.
7	Salary will stop mattering to me when my money starts making money. Right now I am 24 and I make about $90,000 on a salary + commission job.\n\nI thought making this much at a young age would make me happy, but it doesn’t. Although I’m sure I would be more *un*happy without financial security. 
6	Base salary is $109,000 with a 15% bonus that can be more or less depending on my performance and whether my company hits AIP targets.  I would be happy with 130K base salary.  I can live comfortable in my lifestyle at that salary.  The reason I say this is that I feel that I am under-compensated compared to other positions at my company and believe I should be making more due to the amount of time I put in and skill set required. 
4	It never mattered beyond the ability to provide for myself and enjoy life. I'd rather take a huge pay cut than make a lot of money and not feel fulfilled in my work. And I have. I make $30K a year but used to make closer to $50K. That job was miserable and I hated it so I quit and am happy at my lower rate because I'm doing something I enjoy.
4	I make about $35k a year. Considering I'm currently in my 5th year of college and am so far 100% debt free, I'd say it's enough.\n\nI absolutely love my job, and it's a great stepping stone to the field I'm studying right now.\n\nHopefully when I graduate I'll be making 6 figures, but that won't be for several more years.\n\nFor me personally, I could probably live off $35-50k a year just fine for the rest of my life. I'm not continuing my education because I want a higher paying job necessarily. I'm doing it because I just really want to do that job, and it happens to have a nice salary.
5	I use to make 60k, it was nice and comfortable. Ended up in a huge car accident. Took me about a year to recover.. and now I’m getting back on my feet. Credit score dropped, no more savings, it’s been a hell of a year. Decided to go back to college so this hell won’t happen again. I can only go forward right? Was also homeless last year due to losing my job, than bf dumped me on my birthday( said I’m getting old).had to live out of my car during last summer. I am 30 years old now. Getting associates in engineering hopefully this coming spring 
3	40k.\n\nEnough to pay my bills and debt and allow me to get some things. In 1.8 years I'll be debt free.\n\nI need 75k to chill
3	I live a relatively simple life.  To be happy, you need a roof over your head that is sized appropriately to your needs.   After this and necessities, a few luxuries are nice, and after that money doesn't really matter in my opinion.  I save and invest most of my money.\n\nI make $345K a year + stocks.
2	I believe I made ~84k last year (I get a lot of OT with a base pay of 36.4). I'm 26F and now at 37.4. I am hopefully up for a proper review and raise as well. If I wasn't paying for student loans, car financing plus extra insurance because it's a financed car, I would def feel more comfortable with my wage. \nCurrently I'm not happy at work because of the poor air quality and I keep suffering because of it, and so I am questioning whether having the stable job is worth it. On the other hand it is now pushing me to seek other things I'm interested in so that I can start building some sort of side project and make some income and get out of a desk job forever. \nMy ideal salary right now would be 130k (due to loans, and california taxes).
2	The amount you make or have saved stops mattering when the amount of money you have has no control on your actions in any form.  If you have an insatiable desire for consumption you'll probably never have enough and always spend your time and thoughts trying to get more money. If you are happy in the small things and find ways to remove yourself from the grind you might find, like me, that money wasn't really ever the source of my happiness.\n\nAnd if you're making your money doing sales or marketing, follow [Bill Hicks advice](https://genius.com/Bill-hicks-on-advertisers-and-marketing-annotated).  For real tho, those jobs are terrible for humanity.
1	The only reason I’m unhappy with what I make is because I know I can make more. I have never been content because I will work on being better. Of course I know I’ll plateau and recede one day, but that doesn’t stop me from trying. I was an engineer and was working on rising through the ranks. Then left to become an optometrist. Big investment in liarliarplants4hire Inc. Wasn’t happy as an employed doc. Searched around and found a practice to buy. Have owned it for a year. Already eyeing a second location and a tax offsetting investment. I’ve been comfortable ever since I’ve been able to make house payments,car payments, small vacations, and going out to eat whenever I felt like, yet I’m frugal-ish. I’m happy with a smaller house payment than many of my employees. I live in a low cost state. I bought a used car. I like to cook. I buy quality products that last. I quit paying for cable...\n\nYour question is silly (kinda). ENTJ’s are known to be driven and successful. But it’s not a golden ticket. It’s like someone saying they have a free gym membership... now do something with your decreased barrier of entry.
1	No just wondering how the salary demand correlates to age and maybe family size? 
1	Yea so many of my friends are defining success  as a number
1	About 750 EUR per month (9,000 yearly). Intern contract (6 months). In the business center of one of the main European financial place...\n\nShould kickstart me. The other answers makes me sad. I am literally paying for my indecisiveness on career path. Gonna strive now (already actually, but the pay won't rise if you overdeliver on an internship).\n\nThe good thing is I discover I wouldn't need much more money to do whatever I'd like (travelling, attend some events - I can afford that, just too rarely enough).
1	60k p/a + an expense account. It's not heaps but it's comparable to what other people starting out make, and it is in the industry I want to work in, being mentored by some of the true doyennes of that industry. I have a little bit of debt but it's within 1/6th of my salary and mostly has to do with paying for my travel/conferences for the year along with some moving expenses. Will be debt free by December.  It's worth taking the lower pay packet for the experience and networks I'm building in the role, and within a year I will be making at least $120k.   \n\n\nMoney isn't important the moment you have enough of it to live the life you want to lead. I don't have a great relationship with my family so it is important to me to have an additional level of financial security. 60k at this stage in my life (25) is enough to have a social life, save a little bit, get plenty of credit to increase my liquidity/remove the stress of having to scrimp if its getting toward the end of the month and I have a bill or an unexpected expense, and to eat decently and pay for gym memberships etc.   \n
1	35y/o with a wage of around 85k. Frankly I'd love more, but that wouldn't make me any happier or sadder, just more able to do ... stuff.\n\nMoney isn't a score keeper, nor a sign of happiness, it's a facilitator. You can use money to acheive goals easier. That's what it's for.\n\nIn all simplicity, I'd just like to have my house paid off. After that, I need roughly $200/wk more than my living expenses to be super happy (which I have now when we don't buy stupid shit), and getting the house out of the road would open up a world of investment opportunities.\n\nMoney stopped mattering when my wife went back to work after kids. That was when I stopped being the sole financial provider and we seemed to cross a line between struggle street and comfort (financially). We still pretend to be on struggle street, but with 3 kids in private education we aren't exactly going to default on our loans any time soon.

6	What do you like about nature?	Hiya, working on a story with an ENTJ child as a character. I need him to be in the woods. Let's say you're ten or twelve. Do you like playing in the woods? Why or why not? If yes, what do you like to do in the woods? Though I don't want to make him an introvert, I really don't want to bring in any other characters for this part of the story. He's alone. I don't want him even thinking about (human) friends.\n\nThanks a million if you're willing to answer this question. (This character is not a villain. :) )
8	My immediate reaction and best suggestion is that your ENTJ boy could be building a secret fort. Alternatively he could be gathering something like herbs that contributes to the rest of his life. He could also be playing pretend (the lone champion of the realm stalks the evil army through the trees, slowing down their march into his home through a series of traps and confrontations).
4	When I was a kid exploring the woods I collected bugs in a big bucket imagining that I would see a whole bug society develop if I collected enough bugs of different species and left them alone for a few days with random food scraps. Inevitably it would just be cobwebs and dead insects when I checked up on my “colony.” 
3	A 10 year old - he's not a villain. LMAO! Glad you cleared that up.   \n\n>Do you like playing in the woods?   \n\nHell yes. Here's what 10 year old me would have done: Break a branch off a tree/bush (has to be the right kind, thick but still rather young so it's somewhat flexible), remove the leaves, now I have a sword. Then forge a path through a densely overgrown part of the forest. The younger I was the more I would imagine context, make up reasons for my play. At age 10 I would already feel somewhat self-conscious about still playing "like a child", although I would continue for several years. There could be an aspect of "guilty pleasure" to it, if you want to hint at growing up.   \n\nOther stuff a 10 year old boy would do in the woods: Climb trees and rocks. Throw things (try to hit something high up in a tree or on the other side of a river). Running and jumping. 10 year old boys are full of energy, almost regardless of type. When I was 10 even fat peers would still enjoy running, wrestling and whatnot. It's not until later in the teens that some boys become completely sedentary. On one hand you can't wait to "be a man", on the other you know that life will get serious and you enjoy being a kid with few responsibilities. So play is all about a childish imitation of what men do. Men, the kind of men you look up to, go on adventures, so you turn being in a forest into an adventure with challenges to overcome.

2	I don't know how old this child is, but if it's within his mental maturity he could take notice of how mechanistic nature is; everything has it's place, the old and broken is replaced with newer and better, everything serves a purpose even if it's just as food or bedding for another creature or plant.

16	Why are there so few subscribers to r/entj compared to other types?	At first I thought it's because the &#37; of ENTJ's in the population is low in the first place, but then again r/infj has 31.7k subscribers as of now and r/entj only has 5.9k. (Both ENTJ's and INFJ's are supposedly less than 2&#37; of the population according to [this source](https://www.careerplanner.com/MB2/TypeInPopulation.cfm))\n\n* INFJ's are more interested in MBTI than ENTJ's? \n* INFJ's are more interested in reddit than ENTJ's?\n* ENTJ's are usually too busy to lurk communities?\n* Etc etc etc... \n\nEdit: just thought about it again and realized that not all subscribers to an mbti type subreddit will be that type. So the disparity in population rates and subscriber rates could also mean that other types are less likely to subscribe to the entj subreddit, and maybe entj's tend to subscribe to other subreddits like INTP's and INFP's (which I did). Not sure if it's possible to find the % of  types subscribing to types other than their own... 
9	I would say ENTJ is fairly proportionate. There's a lot more of us here than ESFJ for instance. It's INTJ and INFJ that is highly overrepresented. These types are a lot more self-introspective (and behind the privacy of their screen) so it's only natural they would be more likely to gravitate to Reddit.
18	Well... The observation for the number of subscribers on each MBTI subreddit can be simplified to this: the closer you are to INTP, the more likely it is to subscribe to your personality subreddit. N/S comparison seems to influence the sub count rather dramatically. According to this [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/79jp88/abnormal_number_of_subscribers_for_subreddit_types/), ESTJs can't even hit 1k subscribers. Compare that to 5.9k r/entj subscribers. It is even more dramatic when you compare intp and istp subs (37k vs 5k). Perhaps N types are more drawn to information and knowledge, therefore, they dwell in forums like reddit for that said knowledge. \n\nAnother factor that drives subscriber count will be J/P comparison. Compare entp vs entj counts and you can see that it is 11k vs 4.9k. Perhaps Fe and Te types are simply less likely to procrastinate and they simply have more things to commit to, hence taking their time away from browsing reddit. \n\n
6	Maybe ENTJ's are too busy getting things done that only a small fraction of us have the time to post on reddit. Some of us are off being presidents, running hollywood or fortune 500 companies. \n\nJust the thought of that diminishes all my life achievements and I'll be awake all night thinking about them. 
7	ENTJs and ENFPs are actually perfectly represented. Other types are a mess. There were stats.
5	\n>* ENTJ's are usually too busy to lurk communities?\n\nThis is essentially my first thought when I read your question lmao. \n\nBut in all seriousness, I view your types to be scary in a good & bad way. Like..._really_...why would the majority of ENTJ's out in the world, spend most of their time browsing reddit, watching mindless videos, playing videogames, and overall doing something that may be unproductive? Sure they may put aside some time to check up on subreddits, but in reality, they're in charge of how they spend their own time.\n\nCompare that to introverts who recharge spending time alone. Of course they're going to gravitate towards the internet more.\n\nBut look at it this way...I'd like to think the ENTJ sub is a small organized, loyal YouTube channel. Sure, it may be small but it just shows the quality of the content and its fan base.  Compared to say the INTP sub, the posts are wild as fook. There really is no deep connection compared to the ENTJ sub and for that, you should be proud to be a part of the minority.\n\nI can always count on an ENTJ to whip my ass and actually be thankful for it 😂.
2	People are much more likely to mistype as INFJ or INTJ. INTPs, ISTJs and ENTPs all mistype as INTJs, INFPs, ISFJs, and ENFPs all mistype as INFJs.\n\nESTJs, ENTPs and INxJs mistype as ENTJ, and the first doesn't use Reddit much, the second is only if they are hyper industrious, and the third group isn't a common typing.
1	Considering we make up 3% of the population, pretty sure those numbers in some way correlate to the population distribution on subs. Following this thread to see other potential answers!
1	I am an intp female and came here because they said an entj is a perfect match, so I wanted to see why. 
1	Because Reddit is a waste of time.
44	Logic and Love	As an ENTJ I realise that when I like someone I love them with my mind and not my heart.\n\nIts sad to say this but when I really love someone I treat them the same way I would treat a business venture in the initial stages. "Ive seen an opportunity im interested in and im not going to waste any time in closing this deal". Time is of the essence!!\n\nAs much as this approach works in business I don't think it can work for a long term relationship, because most people require a bond to be created before moving forward.\n\nMy approach works very well for short term relationships because the intensity I show creates the illusion of a deep bond which doesn't really exist and this allows my to be able to cut off the relationship at any time without a second thought.\n\nDoes any other ENTJ act this way and if so how can we change our approach ?
19	It sounds like you are using Te to conduct and examine your love life, and you're realizing the weakness of your Fi.\n\nWhat I've found is that the best long-term relationships exist simultaneously on a level of mental and emotional love -- not just one or the other. For example, you can have a relationship like the kind you're describing where you're attracted to the other person and having fun, but there's no emotional bond for whatever reason. You can also have a relationship where you are totally head-over-heels in love with each other, but you know it's a bad idea. Both of these don't work long-term.\n\nInstead, you need to engage both your mind and your heart to land on a truly successful relationship. Both individuals have to want the other person as someone to run errands with and someone to trust as a shoulder to cry on. The most successful couples will be equally happy in intimate settings and in public. You can share your deepest thoughts with that person -- but you can also balance your household finances with them.\n\nAchieving this is not easy. Even when you find the right person, it requires work and commitment from both parties, in addition to a willingness to compromise and forgive. However, it's also not impossible.\n\nOP, what you need to do to change your approach is to look at your feelings and get better at expressing them. Try looking inside of yourself and writing down what you *feel* in a journal. An important distinction: don't worry about why you're feeling those things, and don't analyze your feelings -- it's our default mode to use Te to do that. Instead, try to use Fi and write down what you're feeling on its face, without any interpretation. You might be surprised what comes of it. Once you are comfortable writing this down, being *honest with yourself,* and confronting your feelings on your own, consider opening up to someone you really trust, whether it's a best friend or a romantic partner. This will probably feel uncomfortable because feelings are not logical and you can't really control them. However, to deny them is to lie to yourself. You need to be honest with yourself if you want to be honest with others, and being honest with others is how you form a true emotional bond.\n\nTL;DR: There is a truth of the mind and a truth of the heart. ENTJs are good at examining the truth of the mind, but we suck at examining the truth of the heart -- and we often repress its existence altogether. In order to love someone with our heart, we need to acknowledge our heart, and be willing to show it to the people we love.
6	I absolutely do this. I didn’t realize it until you just wrote it out. 
4	Have you read the 5 Languages of Love? I found that book very interesting because it showed that the things I want to make me feel "loved" are different to what my wife wants.\n\nShe wants "words of affirmation" and physical touch and I want "acts of service", i.e. when she does things for me that are beyond whats normal. So when I do those things for her, because that's how I show my affection (and that's wrong for her), it doesnt mean as much as when I tell her lovey dovey things - which don't have much effect on me.\n\nI need to re-read that book I think. Need a refresher course myself.
3	Let's clarify the definition of "love" vs. "attraction."\n\nIf you substitute "when I'm really attracted to someone" in the sentence where you say, "when I really love someone," I think you'll see what I mean.\n\nLove means wanting what's best for the other person. Does that fit with treating them like a business venture? Would you want to be treated that way if the shoe were on the other foot? Think about it.
2	The part of the brain that handles logic is separate than the part that handles emotions.  For those of us who embrace logic and suppress emotions, relationships can be.. interesting.\n\nThis is me trying to navigate that if you think it might help :)\n\n http://mymentalmodel.com/2017/12/14/an-entj-love-story-2/
2	I've had relationships like that too. I struggled with emotional engagement in some beyond "friendly" feelings if you know what I mean. \n\nIt's hard to accept and go with emotions and I could only do it when the relationship made logical sense (I would never fall in love without someone I didn't think was reasonable). I think it's just hard for us to find someone mentally stimulating enough, logic based, and can make emotional bonds with all of that. 
2	You touch on a very important point. I am the same, I prefer acts of service because in my opinion that requires the most effort. Words are just words..\n\nMy girlfriend prefers words of affirmation but I’m not quick to give compliments and I could say the most sweet things but be disingenuous about it all. Maybe I’ll have to make more of an effort..
1	[deleted]
1	Absolutely feel the same way. 
1	I am INTJ and I absolutely do that too. I actually would like to meet someone who thinks the same way. I feel we could be a power couple
1	I agree, ENTJ's are smitten by the mind. They also want share in the pride of their partners accomplishments equally as theirs so they chase ultra ambitious types. 
1	(ENTJ Male)\n\nI think you’re trying to approach relationships from a position of equality. \n\n“If you love me this much in this way, I must love you that much in the same way.”\n\nThat’s an inaccurate assessment of how relationships work. I tell my girlfriend that she can say “I love you” as much as she wants, she can love me as hard as she wants. I don’t need to reciprocate exactly the way she gives her love, because my love, and the reason she loves me, is different in every way.\n\nSo I find it just fine to approach the relationship from a business standpoint. I give her an emotional rock and basepoint, she gives me sex and admiration. It’s a transaction based more-so on emotional currency, but not entirely, than on actual currency. 
1	I remember this became a problem to my ex-gf for my inability to do romance... I rarely say sweet things, stuff that should be in a romantic relationship... I loved her with my mind, and heart back in time, but maybe it was that uncomfortable feeling of mine to say love profoundly and straightforwardly... thus she saw the relationship like a trade  "I love you so you should love me" heartless kind of relationship
3	As your opposite, how can I handle people that go against me?	As an ISFP, I normally default to passiveness or, when under stress, aggression. I had the opportunity to lead/co-organize some events for charity. I'll skip the details - but basically I had people at work e-mailing me their two cents and disagreeing with my decisions. I consulted with a few colleagues who told me to disregard them and just thank them for the information, but I have been ruminating ever since.\n\nI understand I will never be able to please everyone. I can't accommodate everyone. People will always have something to complain about. I've always hoped to reach consensus and collaborate with others which is why I've always been weak as a leader. I tie my ideas and actions to my values and when people disagree with it, I take it personally. However, professionally, I need to develop these skills to advance in my career.\n\nI've learned my lesson and in future will include policy/rules with the events I implement so that there aren't people telling me I can't do this or that, but how do I move forward? How can I be assertive without seeming like a bitch and ruining my reputation at work? How can I be fair without letting people walk all over me? Is this something that comes naturally to those strong in leadership? How are ENTJs so capable and how do you handle people that go against you?
7	I don’t know if this will help but here goes... I’m an ENTJ female. People tend to not go against me because I’ve worked hard to establish a certain persona that makes them scared of me. I remember back to even on my first day of work at my current company... I started planting the seed so that people trusted my work and knew I was a reliable person. After establishing that trust, I made sure that people noticed the quality of my work. I kept my mouth shut and worked hard and got to know the higher ups at work and made them trust me. Once I got them to see all of that, it was time to show them that I’m not someone to mess with or stomp all over.  For example, if anyone were to be mean to me, I would call them out on it and tell them that that is not cool. Anything anyone has to say to me would need tons and tons of explanation and reasoning if they wanted me to change my mind (it probably helps that I’m already in a power position as a video producer). Anyway, I’m never passive about anything and I don’t take things personally. If someone has messed up, I’ll point it out. If someone’s suggestion is dumb, I’ll give them tons and tons and tons of reasons why my idea is better (always facts, never opinions because that’s a waste of everyone’s time)... and I’m relentless at it until I win. I established this persona at work and all of my videos are well-received at work so people trust what I say and do. I think it also helps that I’m on the attractive side and so the men usually say yes to me, and they’re the ones at work that hold the higher positions.\n\nIf I were you, I would just reply back and obviously be tactful about it but stand your ground and say that you’re going with your plan and list reasons (facts) as to why it’s more effective/advantageous for all. \n\nWho cares if you come off as a “bitch”? It just shows that you’re firm in your convictions and you’re a badass who knows what you want. 
3	How I would approach this situation:\n\n>I understand I will never be able to please everyone. I can't accommodate everyone. People will always have something to complain about.\n\nSo don't. What's the point of pleasing everyone? If it's to be liked, that's not going to help you organize the best charity event.\n\n>but basically I had people at work e-mailing me their two cents and disagreeing with my decisions.\n\nI would consider their ideas and if they make sense, implement them. If not, do as your colleagues advised - thank them for the information and proceed with the best plan. Keep the goal in mind - organizing the charity event. You are working to make the charity succeed, not to succumb to the whims and fancies of your colleagues.\n\n>I've learned my lesson and in future will include policy/rules with the events I implement so that there aren't people telling me I can't do this or that\n\nReally? I'm not sure writing a dictatorship policy is the best way forward. You just gotta show people that you can make hard decisions and make your plans work despite the whining, and in the future people will respect you for it. Writing rules to block people from speaking out will not be in your best interest. You will also want to hear genuine concerns that you might not have considered before.\n\n>How can I be assertive without seeming like a bitch and ruining my reputation at work? How can I be fair without letting people walk all over me?\n\nFor me, I acknowledge other people when their ideas are good. I also say sorry when I have messed up and strive to correct my mistakes in as little time as possible. \n\nI am in very good terms with all my colleagues and they are usually happy to help me out when I delegate tasks (even if they are not subordinates). Whenever I delegate, I always show them how their task fits in the big picture and how much of a great help their job is to help us achieve our vision of succeeding as a team. Works really well for me so far. 
3	Thank you for some perspective on the inner workings of the ISFP in my life!\n\nIf I may, I notice that you look at yourself and everyone else with a huge amount of negativity. How can you find a positive outcome if you are focused on the negative? I think it is important to find a balance. \n\nPeople get under my skin, but I always look for the value in what they say. If someone disagrees with me, I view that as an opportunity to strengthen my views. Disagreement shows they are looking at the situation from a different point of view. You can ONLY look at things from your point of view. Because they are looking at it from a different point of view, this allows you to take a bigger look at the situation. Maybe you find value in what they say and change your opinion, or maybe you don't change your opinion but learn to clarify some details so that others don't misinterpret what you mean like they did.\n\nAlso, a tip. If someone is being rude to you, respond with humbleness, professionalism, and utmost respect. It sometimes takes me awhile to be able to do this, but it is a skill you must work on. You don't have to roll people over to get respect. If you treat others and yourself in a professional way, that is what you will get in return. Always be the bigger person. You will make mistakes as you learn this skill, but don't give up. It is a skill like any other, and you will get better at it over time.
2	You are right. They are wrong. 
1	entjs how....?	ok so according to psychology a person can addapt certain thoughts from successful people that can help them.so my question to you entjs is,when you feel tired,honestly what do you think of to force yourself to complet that task?
7	\n\nWhen I’m in a position where I don’t want to work what I do is take a short break and then get right back to it because if I do not get what I need to get done, I will fall behind. Also I might just learn something which can help me in the future. \n\nIt’s all about resistance for me, the more you fight back when your body tells you to relax and not work the stronger you become and the easier you will find it.  \n\nIt’s a constant internal battle and sometimes you WILL fail but we have to keep moving forward! 
3	Ask yourself - What is my goal? Why did i start? What will happen if i fail?

3	I actually have a leadership journal I keep, that keeps me motivated and active.\n\n* I jot down key traits, ideas or lessons I've observed in my managers in hopes to embody their best traits.\n* I also watch youtube channels like [10 rules of success ](https://www.youtube.com/user/ModelingTheMasters)  and take notes from those videos.\n* I study bibliographies of my favorite leaders and note down key moments of their lives they developed a skill or worked on themselves.\n* I have many role models in the media and practice their traits, whether its holding yourself together during times of pressure like Harvey Spectre, dedication to ones craft like James Hetfield, Speaking like Anderson Cooper and Matt Lauer, etc\n* I practice projecting my voice and seaking clearer, by writing out speechs off youtube and then repeating them with the youtube video, noting inflections, pauses and raised voices for dramatic effect.\n* Finally I review it once a week, scrolling through lessons I can't remember or lost track of.
2	I'm constantly surrounded by mentors and I make an effort to keep learning. 
14	The Inner Critic - are you a perfectionist?	This post is both for advice and sharing personal stories. Thanks in advance for all the answers! \n\nDoes anyone else suffer from TOO high standards? \n\nSometimes I feel like I’m overdoing self-improvement and over-dosing self-criticism. \nI’ve noticed that I’m hardly pleased with results of my work, but on the other hand, setting goals is so addictive! I can feel all this dopamine coming from new plans. \n\nDo you sometimes feel like you are stuck in the future? An overachiever who is never content with results, so dreams about more and more successes. \n\nDisclaimer - I don’t feel that my is miserable (rather the opposite) but sometimes I’m causing myself unnecessary discomfort by ruminating about my flaws.\n\nI was thinking about meditation and mindfulness to learn how to be grounded and present. It helped once but I stopped practicing... \nAnyone else tried it?\nOr did you try something else to become more laid-back?\n
10	“....yes” ***it whispers***
5	I know where you're coming from.\nLike Harvey says, "I don't have dreams; I have goals. And now, I'm onto the next one".
6	I am a recovering perfectionist. I do find yoga and meditation very helpful, but the biggest thing for me is just realizing that just because I *can* doesn’t mean I *should* do something. Forcing myself to chill, building in down time, congratulating myself on *not* accomplishing something because I was instead spending time with people I love...those are all steps in the right direction for me.
4	Yeah. In middle school I took 5 different high school courses and in high school all I could think about were APs and taking a full course load at the community college. \n\nAfter all of this work however, I left the country and opened up a store in France. Crazy, I know. It grounded me though and made a truly independent spirit. I think ENTJs need to live their own way to access their full potential!
4	As long as I'm meeting my goals and achieving fulfillment, my standards have a lot of wiggle room. There is such a thing as good enough, and it's the only way I can find peace.
4	I struggle with perfectionism in dumb scenarios to the point where it's borderline OCD. Like replaying the same 10 seconds in a YouTube video for several minutes because I missed one word or something. 
2	It sounds like you could be too focused on the ending of your goals.\n\nI don't experience this, but I also focus on the tasks that lead to my goal. So I feel really accomplished when I accomplish a task - there is no judgment of how well I accomplished it, but I do sometimes (if appropriate) reflect on it.\n\nI revisit BIG life goals once a year or so. I revisit small yearly goals when appropriate, but typically about twice a year. I also identify ways to connect these goals to my weekly to do lists.\n\nFinally, I am flexible. My goals change sometimes. If you aren't flexible, you are just going to be stressed. The only variable you can control in life is yourself, so why expect every goal to be a step by step plan that you MUST follow in that order IN ENTIRETY? Give yourself room for creativity. Don't overplan, and don't underplan. I think you could be overplanning at the moment.
1	Yep
1	Agreed. Goals help keep my mind at ease and they give me a sense of purpose. There’s no worse feeling than knowing I can’t do anything. \n\nAnd, personally, I don’t like feeling too laid back. I tend to enjoy the conflict within my mind and body—but that’s just me.
1	I'm my own worst critic

5	Dude, speak for yourself. I've managed to harness the remaining 90&#37; ;)
7	Some people say we only use 10% of our brains.  I think we only use 10% of our hearts.
1	As others have mentioned the 10% thing is a myth.  However there is a popular notion right now that isn’t 100% scientifically proven but some research suggests it: and that is that you use more of your brain on unconscious activities versus things you are actively stewing over.  See the book “Autopilot” by Andrew Smart, it should point you to related material as well.  \n\nThey attribute this this phenomenon to common life experiences such as when trying to get past a tricky spot in playing a song on an instrument or playing a video game, when you set it down and come back and it goes down like water.  Also claim it’s where “sleep on it” derives it’s decision making power
1	Idk about you but Ni-dom tap all our brain area!\n\n
0	Help I’ve been classified as an ESTJ and an ENTJ	I have textbook traits of an entj \nBut I like attention and power yet I’m good with emotions.what does this mean \n\nBackground information: I am a 13 year old female who is interested in law,business and politics who wants to go to either Harvard or Oxford 
11	Your describtion is ridiculous. If you want someone to seriously type you, we'll need more information. Every human wants power. Every extrovert likes attention. That leaves 8 types.\n\nStart asking yourself questions first.\n\nWhy do you want to go to law school?\n\nWhy/how are you good with emotions?\n\nWhat do you want to do with your power?\n\nWhich textbook traits of ENTJ do you have and why do you think that is accurate?
7	Do not concern yourself with the rude people in the comment section, they arent doing you any good at all. \n\nPersonally, I think you should wait until you are a bit older to really be able to accurately type yourself. I had the same interest and ambitions as you did as a kid, but typing yourself tends to be inaccurate when you are younger. 
4	ENFJ?
5	Jeez, what some people are preoccupied by...
3	I am in between the same things. Well, I'm textbook Te and inferior Fi. I'm also textbook Ni but I definitly have Si. So I don't know. \n\nHave you thought about INTJ? I know that's not what you wanted to hear, but being good with emotions sounds more teritary Fi than inferior. If not, I'd go with ENTJ since you said you act more like one. ESTJ doesn't have any higher feeling position so you shouldn't be in between these two for that reason. 
1	This interesting as I had similar ambitions to you when I was a little older(14) and even a similar issue with the grades. I'm not sure whether you are in the USA or UK,  but if you are in the uk you might want to start paying attention to them as they influence which set you are placed in, and if you really want to go to the schools you have named, you should try to get into the highest sets if you are in the uk.  \n\nI also did the test when I was around your age and got INTJ, which I'm not really convinced about. You should understand the "cognitive functions" of the mbti first before the traits/stereotypes anyone can become power hungry and attracted to attention. What ENTJs and ESTJs are good at is being able to gather relevant facts to tackle the issue they are facing in the best possible way, they try to understand the many different logical and social reasons in order to make the most informed decisions. \n\nAsk yourself, do you spend more time organising abstract thoughts (Ni)( what could be in the future,how one event could lead to the next event,) or organising real world details ( How do these details right infront of me ,fit in with the catalogue of details that I have seen before). If the former(1st description) you should consider ENTJ is its the latter(2nd description) you should consider the ESTJ personality type.\n\nAs for the school work, you should try starting with about 30 minutes of school work (not including homework) outside of school per day when you are off exam week. Then slowly increase it as you move to the next school year. If its too easy you should tell teachers about it and ask for more challenging work or read beyond the syllabus. 
1	With regards to determining your type, I suggest looking up and understanding cognitive functions & stacks. Generally, Sensors and iNtuitives are really quite distinctly different, so... Consider the traits of each possible personality type applicable to yourself that are both desirable AND undesirable to you. You may also wish to explore other typing methods (enneagram, socionics, etc) to help add perspective and depth to your MBTI results. Google is also your best friend.\n\nAt this stage of your life, you’re still experiencing - and prone to experience a lot of growth - which means eventual changes to mindsets/beliefs and methods of processing information/reacting to situations. This is why at this stage of your life, personality typing is said to be “inaccurate”, purely because you’re doing a test under a condition that is not sufficiently consistent and is subject to a lot of changes (for better or for worse). \n\nYou’re still young; keep an open mind. There’s no rush to put yourself into a box, you have several dozen years left to do that. Don’t live your life based on a theorem - I personally believe that MBTI and other types of personality testing methods are merely means to increase self-awareness so that I can improve on my weaknesses, which in turn brings overall better benefits for whatever I wish/need to accomplish in the real world, in the long run.

9	Be the best version of you	I am very aware that I am not working to my best potential. I know that if I was working to my full potential I would be unstoppable. \n\nAny advice on how to unlock that drive to work at my full potential?\n\nI’d say I work on 60% capacity. However an ENTJ’s capacity of 60% is probably equivalent of 80% capacity of all other types. I just want to be better because I know I can.. maybe it’s laziness 
3	I'm a nomad in tech, but in sales and marketing.\n\nIt's a great career choice, especially for an introvert!\n\nFor finding *purpose*, what worked for me was being alone and thinking very long about what I was good at and what I was passionate about. I thought about my past and how I am now for talent/passion.\n\nFinancial security was also important to me. I read that athlete would visualize their performance in competition prior to the day they had to compete. This apparently helped them to perform better.* \n\n- I did just that with visualization by mapping out first what I needed to do for a plan to get from present to my future goal.\n\n- then I would envision myself achieving that goal and what it would be like. I would literally create a movie everyday in my head of myself acting out how life would be once I reach my goal.\n\nI saw myself working at Starbucks on my MacBook pro, ordering a coffee and working. (My goal was money related, so I had to factor in working more to obtain the goal).\n\nI would see myself waking up, driving in a newer Mercedes and even picking up chicks lol.\n\nThe point Is, I made it so real and did this daily that I was basically so pump about reaching this fantasy future that it motives me to take more action.\n\nThis helped me because:\n\n- I didn't have to do anything but lay in bed/sit down, and visualize the perfect life once my goal was reached\n\n- it allow me to really adjust the goal to see what I value most (I.e. I realize I didn't care about the money, but rather the prestige that the lifestyle would give me. Fancy car, nicer condo, etc and how other viewed me. This is just me and my ego though).\n\n- once I did enough of this daily, I felt and believe that this was my new standard. I was no longer comfortable with my present condition and **needed** to obtain the goal to live out this fantasy.\n\nI made my first $3000 sale either 1-2 week after doing this. (I already had skill though in sales* disclaimer. I just needed motive to take action).\n\nIt's been pretty sweet ever since I discover **visualization**.\n\nMaybe you can try it to. I'll get the link for you of what I read.\n\n**link**\nhttps://www.entrepreneur.com/amphtml/242373
2	Mental mastery leads to more efficiency. I would do this: Take the Clifton StrengthsFinder test (the paid version). It will help you to understand your natural inclinations and talents (understand that it's not perfect but it will give you a good, general idea of what your natural abilities are and what can be improved). Read the included strengths training and insight guide that comes with it. This will give you objective exercises and advice that you can can carry out to hone in on your strengths and really polish them. Map out how your strengths play into your life goals. What do you want? When do you want it? How do you want to get it? The results from this test will give you a great starting point to self improvement but it HAS to be tied to action, especially since you're an ENTJ and you're all about it. And without meaning, your action has no purpose so it has to tie into what you want.
2	1. Surround yourself by mentors\n2. Find ways to better yourself. I.e. don't compare yourself to others but just who you were yesterday. \n3. Keep fit and active\n4. Create a routine and stick to it\n5. Read books in an area that interests, i.e. emotional intelligence, business mastery, entrepreneurship, biographies of leaders in their fields or great minds.\n6. Find an area of yourself you want to work on. If you hate public speaking, join toastmasters, If you enjoy special interests, join a meetup, want to learn a new skill? check out coursera or edx.
1	Needed this today.  Thank you.
6	What's your music taste ENTJs?	I'm wondering if we have a type or a listening pattern that's specific to us. \n\nI am quite eclectic and will listen to almost anything, if it's a good piece of music it's good regardless of whether it's classical, or rap, or 80s, but I can imagine other types would probably see us as listening exclusively to Mozart or string quartets. However, I tend to favour quite soothing music like Bon Iver, Tracy Chapman, Coldplay etc. or stuff with really good guitar riffs.\n\nSo what do you like in terms of genre/artists/sounds?
7	Progressive rock, jazz, punk, metal, orchestral.... Most often I like music that sounds like it was made by real people who know how to play their instruments. ProTools, pre-programmed beats and autotune take the life out of music for me.
5	Alternative rock 110&#37; 
3	Classical music, swing jazz, gypsy jazz and other kinds of old jazz music, rock and roll, some classic rock, soul, funk and sometimes disco.
3	Bluegrass, Americana, Alternative country
3	Classical, metal, prog rock/metal, chorale music. Anything that requires lots of skill to create I can appreciate.
3	Anything from Rock to Metal.\nAnything in that range.\nBlues rock, folk rock, Glam rock, alternative, Prog rock, melodic death, heavy metal, thrash metal.\nMassive love for rock from the 80s.\nWhy do people even bother making other genres of music at all?
3	Hard core gangster rap If I need pump up motivation.\n\n
2	All kinds, but mostly rap. Eminem, Tech N9ne.
1	I listen to a ton of different kinds of music, but nothing gets me going like some funk, or anything dance related like that.
1	Sufi music for yoga. Jazz, liquid funk. Trance for running and working out. Disco, funk, both from the good ol' times and new issues with modern tones.  \n\nUsed to be a lover of alternative rock but it seems I enjoy it much less by now. Still a sucker for Cold and Papa Roach.
1	i've gone through a lot of musical genre phases but i mostly listen to pop and like weird indie music. [the music on my phone for reference](https://i.imgur.com/xLGIioy.jpg).
1	Changes often. Generally a hip-hop/rap guy. Been into indiRock lately 
1	R&B, foreign language, rap, indie, psych rock
1	classical (esp. opera), rock, pop, experimental
1	I tend to binge on music in phases. After a long period of only really listening to podcasts (Comedy Bang Bang, Savage Love, and This American Life are my favorites), audiobooks, and occasionally my Stevie Wonder Pandora station, I finally downloaded Spotify for the first time a few weeks ago and am catching up on the last couple years of rap. Been listening to a lot of Kanye, Kendrick, Drake, Odd Future, and Joey Badass as usual, and discovering new artists like XXXTentacion. \n\nLike a lot of you, I grew up listening to alternative. Favorite bands of all time are Red Hot Chili Peppers and Radiohead. As a teenager I loved Rage Against the Machine, which still holds a special place in my heart, but their music hasn’t aged as well for me as the other two. My first concert was Weird Al at age 12; my older brother brought me and my friend to see him at Six Flags. 
1	Bluegrass, classic rock, 90-00 rap/r&b and 90's country.
1	I don’t care about genre as long as it’s unconventional. Weird time signature, chord progression, key, or tempo is interesting to me no matter what style it’s in.
0	SoMo. That should wrap up this discussion.
13	Did you ENTJs struggled getting on top in highschool?	I only pass without effort that’s all\n\nAlso I am ENTJ or INTJ. 
21	I didn't have to work hard to be wildly successful in high school.  Things came naturally to me.  I was smart and intuitive... and very very organized.  If for some reason there was a subject I had a bit of trouble with, I hyper focused on it until it became a strength.  \n\nWent to a top college and that's when I started to have to work harder.  My sliding-by habits in high school set me up for some tough times.  But college then re-taught me better habits and I finally excelled there and after as well.
27	As an ENTJ, I only did the minimum to pass. I didn't really do well in school because I just didn't care. In business and psychology classes I did incredibly good, you wouldn't expect me to fail one bit. I saw academics as a waste of time, so I instead pursued other things. 
6	If you mean marks, I was fine. For a moment I thought you meant social. I sucked at social back then.
4	Only socially but I was more introverted back in school. Gotten more extroverted as I’ve grown up \n\nEdit: changed phrasing 
5	[deleted]
3	When I was in school I didn't give two world of care in the world.\n\nIt was bad, I got As and Bs only because I needed to so my parent wouldn't killed me.\n\nI was very not.motivated to do well academically. I would always do my studying last minute - literally reading everything 1-2 days up before the test, and thinking back now that was actually interesting what happen:\n\n- I find that I could remember the words of the textbook if I read it enough time to have a visualize picture of each page in my head. Literally recalling a certain page if I need it during the test; however this ability to see the textbook page visually goes away after 2 days of not being used lol. Which was fine cause I just always needed it for a day to do the test.\n\n- I found that visualizing works really well but that require active thinking to recreate the textbook information into my own understanding. That was too much investment so I just route learn each word of the textbook within a day or two lol. Every word, word by word of 20 pages.\n\n*what I do now for work*\n\nI work at a marketing and sale agency now, and I'm more motivated to do this as I choose it VA force to do it like school.\n\nHere how I learn for work:\n\n- I would read EVERTHING and watch all the videos online about a marketing topic.\n\n- I then would ignore bias or thinking too much about the main ideas until I've taken it a shitload of information.\n\n- I will start to see patterns of what all the article and videos have mention; using what the experts have repeated time again and again as "best practice".\n\nIt's more active learning now because my Fi is tingling for learning about stuff for work to make $, vs learning about how a starfish survive in school.\n\n- in school I couldn't see how most subject would help or appy in real life (low motivation)\n\n- at work, I saw the connection (high motovation)\n\n
3	I was an academic machine in high school, and I managed to have a lot of friends too, although I did spend a lot of time studying. It was in college that I started experiencing problems: experimenting with drugs and alcohol, partying all the time, missing class, having sex with strangers. Unsurprisingly, staying on top was a little more difficult in college, but I just got an adderall prescription, and things turned out fine.
2	I set my goal on a particular scholarship when I was in the 8th grade, so working for that kept me at the top for the next five years until I got it. Maybe you need to find something you care about that requires you putting in the effort?
2	In high school I was a trouble maker. I had modified forms so I could leave school whenever I felt, spent most of my days stoned, rarely went to class, when I did it was for tests, presentations, or exams.   \nHowever I still got high 90s so the teachers never cared, and got two scholarships when university rolled around so I think I had it pretty easy. To note I did grow up in the country where academics were a little watered down compared to the cities 
2	Academically, I murdered high school. Socially..ehhhh. college was much better. 
1	I went to a top 100 highschool in our nation and took a full AP load. Our classes were stacked with nerds so I had to work hard. It paid off though cuz I got into the top b-school in the country for my undergrad to get my BBA.\n\nI do know what you mean though about effort - I'd rather put in 20% effort for an easy A- but due to Asian parents had to put in more effort to get straight As.
1	I think I've always had this innate intelligence of being curious, easily remembering things and seeing interconnections.\n\nIn high school, I never really worked hard - I just turned up to all my classes and did all my homework. I mainly got A's and B's. Maybe one A+ here and a C there.\n\nFor some reason, whilst I am very self motivated and thus disciplined when it comes practical things like the gym, socialising/networking, doing things in my part time job at a startup, playing the guitar and starting my own business, the same didn't apply when it came to my academics. \n\nI guess I could've done much better if I really applied myself in academics but I just don't have it in me. It's not laziness or anything, I have plenty of "let's-do-this" energy that I draw from, but I just can't sit still and absorb information from reading a book and consistently practicing questions. I'm more of a lateral than linear thinker.\n\nThat's also why I do much better in business/humanities than math. I managed to get into a top college and did a business degree, but I didn't do very well - I had the equivalent of a 2.5 GPA. Nevertheless, I just happened to be in the right place at the right time and met a few people that led me to a top job at a prestigious multinational firm solely because they liked my personality and attitude.
1	I cruised through school not really trying on most subjects and passing quite easily, didn't get great grades on them though. \n\nOn the subjects I liked I was top of the class and was on par with some of the teachers. 
1	ENTJ - not that I knew it at the time.  \n\n\nI found that I had the learning skills to just absorb information. I could daydream and stare off into space in class and just soak in the classwork. I remember watching people study like mad and still fail, and I literally never completed homework after grade 8 (Australian High school was grades 8-12). I never ranked highly in my classes, except for the one I really was interested in (that ended up my university major), but I also never applied myself.  \nI do wish that I could go back to my former self and show myself that I was setting myself up for a future of laziness, because the habits you learn now will pass onto yourself later in life.\n\n  \nIn saying all of this, as I got older, I really have been able to deep dive and apply myself when the situation warrants - but only for short (6-9month) bursts. At this point I hit that first plateau of skill that puts me on-par or ahead of all my co-workers and the will to keep "catching up" goes away. I guess losing the "measuring stick" and competition sucks the life out of me.  \n\n\nNot sure if that helps, but yes, the innate mental horsepower that seems to come with the ENTJ types does seem to make passing easy, and even sailing through in the mid-B's a trivial exercise.
1	I’m not your typical ENTJ in that I’m not super competitive or driven for the most part. I’m only driven enough to get what I want, I guess. I was top 25ish in a high school class of 450.\n\n\nThen in university I was likely no where near the top. I graduated with a 3.14 in engineering, so not awful, but not great. I worked for couple of my professors doing impressive projects though, and I got a job right out of college that pays well and is an excellent stepping stone to new opportunities, if I can say so myself.\n\n\nDo well enough (i.e. above average) in the things you need to do, but do *well* (top of the class) in the things you like to do. Put yourself in the right places at the right times, and someone will recognize that strength and give you a path to the type of the work you like to do, especially if you know how to advertise yourself appropriately. Be a likable person with killer skills, and you win.\n\nWhoops, didn’t answer your question: high school was easy as fuck, even if I didn’t have the easiest time socially.  In college I cranked everything up to 10.
-1	My teeth are too white, I am too rich and I get too much sex. Help !!!??? ;)\n\n\nUm, is there an actual question?\n
3	Things you wish you knew when you were younger?	I'm 17 years old and an entj, I would like some advice, thanks.
15	Try not to force your way on people too much. They will bulge much faster if you flank them. Always flank, never go full frontal.\n\nStill learning this.\n\nEdit: I typed this up as some great insight... But honestly I've ruined so many good relationships only in the past year - just from making this mistake again and again. :(
13	Don't bother with opinion of people who don't know you nor your situation. \n\nKeep your surroundings clean.\n\nAppreciate people who want best for you. 
9	I second the comment of **kngtr2** about money. I have the tendency to autopilot my current life to fit into my retirement plan, I become way too frugal in other words.  This is no way to live your youthful days. Watch out for that if you're into personal finances as an ENTJ.     \n\nRead: How to Win Friends and Influence people (Google it). After reading the ultimate "how to BS" book my world of how people work was finally opened up and the social setting "fun" really began.  \n\nUse the MBTI to understand why the "S" types do what they do. Otherwise you'll feel as if you're the problem in social settings, family expectations, and life milestones that they are adamant about. I can speak for myself in saying i'm much less aligned with the marriage, house, baby timeline than my southern "S" type peers. I stand out, but love how I've built my life thus-far. \n\nDrive yourself in the workplace and use your natural talents for advancement and security. Its a gift, and people will look at you as if you're otherworldly when you're achieving almost effortlessly. \n\nRead about psychology. Its better than many college degrees. 
3	Better skin care routines, and how my skin and body would change over the years and how to best accommodate that. I think that the physical self is inaccurately spoken for in western civilization, meaning that there’s an emphasis on “beauty” and not health, and the two are rarely synonymous in terms of what types of products or routines are required for every decade.
3	Your best and worse times will come from conflict—learn how to have a fight but learn how to forgive and more on. \n\nNothing really matters in the end. Let it go—always.
3	Read Dale Carnegie's "How to win friends and influence people". That will get you started on interacting with people, and seeing how different some people are.
3	Be unforgivingly yourself.\n\nDon’t compromise who you are for others because you feel different than others. Other people are lazy and deceptive and few care about anyone but themselves. Your relationships with people will always be difficult, it is a part of who you are, embrace it. \n\nYou can be charming, you can be entertaining, you can be fun, but you are not those things, and it’s ok. \n\nBut what you are is driven. Driven to be better, and that’s the best thing you have going for you. Everyone else can only become mediocre at a single thing, you can become great at everything you touch, so do it. \n\nFocus on yourself the most, believe in yourself first, never give in to pressure from others.\n\nDon’t go to school, it’s for the lemmings who want to be in debt and safe for the rest of their lives. \n\nPick a lifestyle, not a career. Make a decision about what you want from life, and chase that. \n\nAnd always follow your heart, be honest with yourself, and always trust you know best for you before anyone else. 
2	Don't make the mistake of having expectations from people unless bound by love or money.\n\nNot something I "learnt" as such. It was indoctrinated into me & it's a principle that explains my observations.
2	two minds think better than one\n\nsave money, get a good education \n\nwhile that, start making your own projects\n\ndon't be too afraid to show off what you can do, it's the best way for people to know you can do things & maybe hire you / contact you\n\nlove wise, no one is ever gonna live up fully to your expectations, love is about going around what's imperfect and learn to accept it and love the other person in their whole (also if you feel like going polyamorous whatever, try things! life is short and no one is out to get you about what you do or not)\n\neveryone is different in experiences so try to understand them before offending them \n\ni guess those r some things.
1	What I wish I knew when I was younger (teenage to young adult years) - that haters are gonna hate and that I am 100&#37; completely right to remain true to myself because it will all pay off in the future. 
1	Money isnt everything, living in the moment is important, everything is possible as long as you believe.
13	ENTJ love?	As an ENTJ I realise that with my goals I like to strike them with full force. \n\nIn love I realise that I can’t have the same approach. My approach seems to work really well for short term love but in my experience it never works for long term love. \n\nDoes anyone else feel the same way?\n\nShould we just leave love to chance ? 
9	If it happens, it happens. Maximize chances of finding somebody compatible with you, but in the meantime, focus on goals that don't depend on other people's feelings.
5	I'm with my INTP guy. He's amazing. We're amazing. But it is hard work, and the reasons why we are doing so well is because we realize it's hard and difficult to build a strong relationship.\n\nWe have a philosophy in our relationship: give 60% and only take 40%. That way there is no resentment and there will always be enough for everyone to go around. Each living to make the other happy (without fully sacrificing yourself in the proces, because you need to keep taking that what you need) results in a higher level of total, shared happiness from the perspective of the two of us as a unit, together. \n\nThis has been hard for me, because I - and I believe, ENTJs in general - are inherently selfish in how we think and see the world. So I had to learn and grow. It was worth it though. Going through life as a unit, opposed to alone, made me stronger and more able to reach my goals. Most importantly: it makes me happy and provides me with joy, every single day.
6	I am INTJ but I feel the same way. Seems like everyone I meet is to damn sensitive about everything. I am looking for someone strong who will make us grow as a couple, not here to whine about feelings. Carry on and you will find someone who appreciates your strength. There is nothing wrong with you. I wish I met someone who thinks like you! Hard to come by in this world.
2	you need an INTJ, find one. INTJ+ENTJ is a very strong team combination, while ENTJ can provide the energy for the team, INTJ's vision is very important in terms of planning.\n\nAs an INTJ, I know I need a lot of NT friends to run my ideas. I have research about ENTJs so much, I can spot every Te person in just a few actions of them(the way they approach problems is so intriguing).\n\nThe problem I still can not figure out is he/she an ESTJ or ENTJ, I still need a few more research tho. I do not need an ESTJ because they are everywhere and they can't understand me.
1	ENTP here, I feel like your need for crushing goals in the realm of personal relationships is hard to satisfy here because other people are so unpredictable and feelings-based. \n\nWork hard and you shouldn’t worry about being alone.
32	Bye social media	Let’s be honest guys, social media is big dump and gives us the illusion of being close to people when in actuality we’re quite distant. \n\nIs it only me who thinks it’s strange to say to someone “ah I saw your pics on Facebook, how was your holiday” rather than letting them naturally tell you in a face to face conversation??\n\nSomething we ENTJ’s struggle with is forming close connections with people and even people we know well. Deleting social media may force us to make more of an effort with people. \n\nWhat do you think?
30	It’s psychically and emotionally distracting.  It’s distracting to the point where you embrace your apathy and are stuck in a continuous cycle of unproductive, depressive longing for validation and accomplishment.  \n\nAs a society and a people we must move away from having this pattern of behavior consume us.  
12	As I've deleted more and more social media apps (and apps in general which weren't serving me), I noticed I became much happier. I started going out more, became more positive, learned more about myself.
8	Haven’t had social media for 5 years, best decision of my life. It’s such a waste of time, time that I could be using to do something productive or actually meaningful. 
9	Social media enslaves most people without them even knowing it. They become prisoners to that short dopamine spike when someone random likes their virtue-signaling bullshit. Deleted my FB, IG, and Twitter profiles months ago and have been channeling that extra time into more books, weightlifting, hobbies etc. 
7	Isn't Reddit a type of social media in some ways? 
8	I think it's boring to jump on the social media hatred bandwagon. If you can control yourself, how is it bad? If you can't control yourself, maybe it's time to learn control instead of blaming social media. 
5	Reddit is social media
4	I'v got lazy to contact with people, meeting people so i was thrilled to have the social media thing, as a kinda compensation, but lately I got lazier to even update anything on my fb and twitter.
2	I get what you mean. Reddit is obviously social media, but we are aware that the connections made on here are "weak". I don't come on Reddit to see how people are doing, I come here to consume the content/ideas placed on threads and subreddits that I am interested in. Obviously, the other users who also frequent on the threads "make" the content, and so without them, Reddit would be nothing. But I don't post things in the hope people with validate me, I post stuff to continue the content and discussion. Social media like Reddit has a different function compared to Facebook.\n\nFacebook, as you said, keeps social connections with people you know...and people you used to know. I move around the country every couple of years, and when I had Facebook (got rid of it a month ago), I would keep the friends I had made from these different places. As geographic distance, time, and other factors made these friendships weaker and weaker, I found myself viewing posts and thinking "I kind of don't care about the fact you went to the beach today". \n\nDon't get me wrong, I am still friends with a couple of people from previous locations, but Facebook wasn't the reason I kept up these friendships. We call each other, and message. Not viewing their posts on Facebook allows me to be genuinely interested in what they have gotten up to, I don't have to feign ignorance and act like I haven't been aware of their post by post documentation of some event they were at.
3	In my opinion you have narrow perspective. You use facebook in order to scroll the feed or to expand your social influence? \n\nI wonder when people will finally realize it's just a tool to connect people. As well as alcohol, drugs and games. If you are using it wrong, you suffer.  That's what i think. 
1	I was off of social media for 3 years, it didn’t bring me closer, it drove me further away from people.\n\nReal human connection is difficult for most people in the traditional sense, social media has replaced that desire.\n\nAs an ENTJ I have to rally the will to post on social media. I know it’s the only way to connect with people around me. \n\nI feel I used not being on social media as an absolute excuse for distancing myself even further from people around me. I realized I have to be a part of the problem to become the solution. \n\nI post very personal details about my life now, I try at least. I don’t post anything controversial or political. I comment on at least 5 posts a day of friends with witty or insightful content, I try to care as much as I can. And the effect is profound, people are really reaching out and connecting with me. 
0	After this thread im freezing my social accounts 😁 have done it once long time ago then i regretted cuz i lost my contacts, that's why will only freeze
5	Managing Conflict	Was hoping to get some advice from all the ENTJ’s out here. I’m not one of you (I am a textbook ENFJ) and am recently dating an ENTJ. My ENTJ manages conflict incredibly differently to me in that he will avoid it entirely/completely remove himself from said source of conflict. As an F type, I find this difficult. Any advice on trying to get him to meet me in the middle? Or is our incompatibility, as repeatedly outlined in most things I read, destined to catch up with us? 
2	If you want to engage an entj, make it about the goals that you or your SO feel are not being meet or applying logic to a situation. We think of goals/logic first, then our feelings come into play.
1	Hmm this may be a personal thing rather than ENTJ thing because we tend to be like “this is the problem. This is my solution. Okay.” to a fault, like a bull in a china shop. \n\nMaybe try to delicately establish whether this is just how their family deals with conflict? \n\nI understand your frustration cos my T/F almost completely balance and I’m attracted to NTs but it can feel like they’re unwilling to ever explode and let out unmitigated feelings when as an F that’s all you want! Good luck with this situation though :)
8	I'd like to survey you guys. Do these questions describe your parents?	The following questions help identify narcissistic parenting \n\n* Do you feel safe to disagree with them on something?\n* Do you find yourself waiting for the right time to ask something?\n* Can you tell them anything or would you prefer to not share most things with them?\n* What do they do with info you give them? Spread it? Keep it to themselves? Judge you for it?\n* Do you often tell white lies or omit information to avoid an argument or anger?\n* Can you give them constructive criticism?\n* Do they tell you when you do something wrong or do they wait for you to figure it out/give you silent treatment/slam doors/generally kick up a fuss?\n* Do you notice other parents go by similar rules or that none of your friends seem to have to live the way you do?\n* Do you wish you lived elsewhere? Have they made you feel unsafe?\n* Do they say things like "I'm the one who feeds you/takes care of you" as if you owe them something for that?
7	Send help... :(
7	oh i already know my parent's a narcissist. this is oddly well timed lmfao. 
7	Good list of questions. \nTheir narcissistic behavior has made me inadequate in social settings as an adult. I resent them for it. Still trying to work towards being more normal now. \nAny advice on how to overcome the damage caused by narcissist parents are welcome
1	When I was a child/young adult: yes, absolutely. 
1	 mother:INFP father:ISFJ both religious... I'm a self-accepting transgender atheist \^\^ , authentic AF, I live to inspire others to do get shit done.\n\n1. Yup, I'll say what is on my mind and be a bitch about it if the point is very important.\n2. Nope, now is as good as any time; I used to never bring anything up when I was younger.\n3. Told them I'm trans... don't share much anymore and they ask even less in like a mind blown type of way.\n4. Info really goes over their heads when it doesn't fit into their bible bubble which really leaves me feeling impatient and dismissive when they won't ground any details with facts and such.\n5. They ask I'll tell, they don't ask much anymore and I won't sugar coat it.\n6. Yup and they don't like it\n7. So I fucked up!? but failure is a “learning opportunity"... if there's a problem? mk let's solve it, anything else isn't an effective use of time or worse, if the issue isn't resolved it may repeat itself. Total opposite of getting things done.\n8. Lived under a damn religious rock...  they really had no one they could relate me too \n9. I feel safe at home, or anywhere I'm like a “chameleon” able to change my persona and adapt to the expected behaviour somewhat; to suit the audience I'm am working to impress and inspire because life is great!\n10. Ohh yeah they do that,
1	I can endorse 3-5 out of 10, maybe 7 of 10 if I really stretch the definitions. So, probably not?\n\n(But I could endorse 10 out of 10 for the larger society. It gets lonely out there; I've never really met people who feel like part of my tribe, or who I felt I could benefit from maintaining friendship with. Just ask r/starterpacks: quite a few people are interchangeable, at least as far as I can tell.)
1	Background, ESTJ Dad, INFJ Mom\n\nDo you feel safe to disagree with them on something?\nDepending on what the topic is. Most of the time, I have no problem at least discussing things with them. Although younger in life, things would've been a bit more touchy.\n\n\nDo you find yourself waiting for the right time to ask something?\nDepending again on what the question is. Big questions I always wait for the right time. (for everyone, not just parents)\n\nIf I'm asking about lunch... ...\n\n\nCan you tell them anything or would you prefer to not share most things with them?\nI hate hiding things. I would rather we know where everyone stands and discuss things reasonably.\n\nCertain things my Dad can be pretty picky on (Si 2nd I guess), so I'm just cautious to not stir up things that don't need to be.\n\n\nWhat do they do with info you give them? Spread it? Keep it to themselves? Judge you for it?\nThe info you have one people will affect how you act around people, but I don't see that in a big way for either of my parents.\n\n\nDo you often tell white lies or omit information to avoid an argument or anger?\nNope. I try really hard to not hide or broadcast many things in my life.\n\nWhen I was younger I would've had a tendency to omit info. If I went to do something that my Dad wasn't a fan of, I wouldn't come home and say where I was, but if I was asked, I wouldn't normally hold back.\n\n\nCan you give them constructive criticism?\nSome, but I get some push back if it's more then a suggestion or pointing something out. Having a good attitude and not being arrogant helps a lot.\n\n\nDo they tell you when you do something wrong or do they wait for you to figure it out/give you silent treatment/slam doors/generally kick up a fuss?\nThey tell me lol.\n\n\nDo you notice other parents go by similar rules or that none of your friends seem to have to live the way you do?\nThere are some similarities, but especially when I was younger, my parents were more strict than other parents.\n\n\nDo you wish you lived elsewhere? Have they made you feel unsafe?\nNope, I love where I live and feel really safe and loved. Sure I've gotten upset at things, but am extremely grateful for the upbringing I've had!\n\n\nDo they say things like "I'm the one who feeds you/takes care of you" as if you owe them something for that?\nThere was definitively that feeling in my upbringing, but wasn't stated all the time (some).\n
1	1. No\n\n2. Yes\n\n3. No\n\n4. I don’t tell my parents anything personal about myself because I feel like it’s not safe so I wouldn’t know. However if I did my mom would most likely tell everyone even though she swears she won’t and would probably judge me. I’m not even close with my dad like that so I wouldn’t really know. However both my parents and I live in the same house.\n\n5. Haha, yes.\n\n6. Definitely not. With my mother she sees it as an attack onto her character so she would reply with someone insulting on my appearance. Once again not close with my dad like that so I wouldn’t know.\n\n7. My parents both give silent treatments. My mom tells me to leave her alone. However they would rarely ever tell me if something is wrong.\n\n8. No. Only difference between my friends and I when it comes to rules is that I don’t have a bed time, I can stay up whenever I want, and I can do basically whatever I want in the house except leave it without them (excluding when I leave the house permanently to go to college of course) \n\n9. Definitely. When I was smaller I used to fantasize running away from my home to go somewhere else. It was so bad that I used to search up blogs and videos of people who ran away and actively read wiki articles on how to run away effectively. However I never ran away. Feel unsafe? Eh...not in terms of them physically abusing me but it’s mentally draining waking up every day to them. On top of the treatment I was receiving at home, I was being bullied relentlessly at school so I always wanted to run to a different state and such.\n\n10. No but they do say things like “I woke every night to support you. I go to work even if I’m feeling sick just for you” and things of that nature.\n\n\nReading my responses almost has me teary-eyed. I need a drink. Well, atleast I’ll be graduating high school soon so there’s that.
1	I guess if I were to have answered this when I was a teenager a decade ago and was living at home with my dad, then yup.
4	Hello more hyper and outgoing twin!	What do u hate about intj?
9	Not hate but do dislike:\n\nIn any disagreement and on the losing end, many INTJs just shut down and stop participating. I mean, sure, I sometimes end up on the losing end in disagreements, but I've never just stopped the conversation dead. \n\nNot really sure what the coping mechanism is working towards. 
3	I wish my INTJs would be more forward with what they want instead of being all, "ahhh but what about if it does x to someone else" when the chances are that person won't even care. Y'all need to stop making yourselves miserable and go get what you want. If you don't watch out for yourself, who will? \n\nAlso, I don't know if "more hyper" is true... 
3	INTJ's know that they are smart and assumes everybody around them are stupid. \n\nThat does not bode well with my ego. 
1	Lack of social awareness tbh. Like, I get where you’re coming from, but goddamn. Learn who your audience is. \n\nI’m thinking of three INTJs I knew in college specifically, and they would say shit that made people around them uncomfortable *constantly*.
1	Some INTJ are well-meaning, but they got these ideals that are sometimes completely out-of-touch with reality.  Same with INFJs.  
17	Fellow ENTJs: What are your major hobbies and/or passions outside of your career?	Last night my SO sat me down to have a frank discussion about how I divide my time and attention between all my activities at this point in my life. He mentioned how he's worried about my mental health with regard to my social circle being fully tied to the degree programme I'm pursuing, and how I currently do not have any focus or priority outside of my studies/job. \n\nHe has asked me to think about pursuing a new hobby or project outside of the house and outside of my regular social circles (frankly; the university in general) to expand my mind and social circles a bit a more, as he thinks it will help me mentally and emotionally at this point in my life.\n\nI actually agree. \n\nI've been thinking about the question: if we'd live in a post-scarcity world in which I wouldn't have a career, what would I be doing with my life? What would be my 'thing', my passion?\n\nI haven't come up with an answer yet. So, the open question to all of you: what are your passion and hobbies? What about them satisfies you? 
6	In terms of hobbies, I guess my work in politics, programming and volunteering would sort of be hobbies, but they're not exactly activities where they switch off. In a post-scarcity world I would probably travel around my country a bit more and might delve deeper into the programming.\n\nAs for why I like what I like, it's either the social aspects or, in the case of programming, the satisfaction of producing something that does something you want.
4	I understand the feeling, people are always telling me to slow down, but other types might not know why we are necessarily in our ways. It's just the way we are. I constantly find myself trying to progress and reach the next milestone in my life that I do forget about family and friends. Of course not entirely, but I do wish I would see and interact with them more often. Not to mention that it is somewhat hard because being a rare ENTJ in my social/family circle (they've taken the test), my mentality is a lot different. I think a lot, I analyze, and I like to plan ahead or do completely new things, many of my friends don't have those same interests (these are long time friends, from grade school, I'm 23) so at times it's hard to discuss certain topics with them, I'm also the only one with a college degree at the moment with only one other close friend pursuing that path. I'm already preparing for my Master's degree this Fall so I'm hoping to expand my social circle if possible. It's harder as you get older though, at least for close friends. As for hobbies, this is something I do share with friends and family. I like to workout on a regular routine, with friends and my brother as well. Working out is like making progress too but you can do it with others, like I said about the constant urge to progress lol. I like baseball which my family likes, and some of my friends do too. Baseball has become even more of an interest because of the level of patience and thinking players need, not to mention the statistics and data science which is what my Master's is going to be in. I also play video games which I play with mostly one friend. Video games are legit a relaxing waste of time for me, I still try to figure out why I still enjoy playing them so much, but I find myself playing more often online against people to compete. I also have been a long time musician, I'm self taught in guitar and piano and more recently electronic music. So whenever I have the time (almost never, only weekends) I do or try to do all these things, besides the gym throughout the week which HAS to be done. I also squeeze in time to spend with my SO here and there, we're both on super busy and different schedules but its worked out for us. ENTJ dating an ESTF (last time I checked, but most likely she needs to be tested again).\n\nAlso, great job on finding a SO who cares you about enough to want you to socialize with friends and family more! If they help build you up and want to push you to improve, that's great!
7	Camping is fun activity that has profound area to learn eg. gears, survival technic, cooking, socializing or meditation alone in nature etc.
3	FinancialIndependenceRetireEarly
3	My career is my hobby (I work in rodeo so my job isn’t really normal)\n\nAside from that, lots of running - half because being fast is helpful at work, and also because music and running in the mountains is awesome for relaxing and staying fit while still enjoying tacos and whatnot 
2	Until I had a baby, my biggest hobbies were playing music (on instruments, not on iTunes) and skiing.  Now, in my spare time, I reminisce about what it used to be like to have spare time.  
2	I'm an accountant by trade. But in free time I camp, paddle board, climb, and bike. And with kids much of my time is with them. We are lucky to live in a place with many outdoor options. \n\nYou could also think about volunteering for a cause you believe in. It's a great way to meet people outside of work.
2	3D printing, Drone racing. 🤓
2	I love reading and learning. The Atlantic is incredibly thought-provoking and provides a lot of mental stimulation. The WSJ is my favorite daily newspaper, and it’s similarly thought-provoking. I don’t make the time to read books unfortunately, and there’s a list of probably 200 books I’d love to read if I lived in a world where I wasn’t preoccupied by my job.\n\nI also love to play golf :). It represents a lifetime saga of trying to triumph against myself.
2	I’ve noticed having hobbies really helps me in my mental well-being. There was a time I was in the same situation, spending all my energy at work or thinking about work. Now I rock climb / exercise to keep myself physically fit and run a small side business in floristry (started off purely as interest but now monetising it). I will also take at least 3 overseas trips to different countries a year (some may only be for a few days) to prevent burnout and to expand my horizons. Oh and volunteering, I am a strong advocate for returning to the community. 
2	Passions *outside* of my career? I don't know that that is a thing for me. I'm in school for engineering and I am very passionate about it. There is passion in my hobbies outside of my studies, but the levels are very different from how they used to be. \n\nHobbies in general though, I'd say my biggest ones are: listening to/making music, drawing, playing video games, and playing board games. Board games are where my personality really comes out, I think. All of that aside, I also enjoy cosplaying. It's something I would love to do more because I love to make things and it is also a very social activity to me.
1	I kiteboard! But that has become my main life focus, I pretty much don’t socialize or do anything outside of work unless it’s for that. My job/school was my passion for a long time but is mostly just a job now. \n\nI’ve had people say similar things to me, “You should branch out” etc or criticize me for being so obsessed with one particular thing. Or for a recent example, not understand why I didn’t want to go to the aquarium when I could be doing something related to kiteboarding - when I’ve been kiteboarding all week. It’s sort of in our nature to hone in on our most desired goal and give it all we have. If you want to change - pick a sport or art or activity that you wish you could do and try it, see if you enjoy it. But for me there’s not really anything that can pull my interest enough away from my main goal *to go out of my way* to spend time on it. I personally don’t intend to or want to change that.\n\nEdit: I forgot to include what about kiteboarding satisfies me! \n1. It’s CHALLENGE, not anyone can pick up a power kite and properly control it. I still am not even able to stay on my board. There’s so much room for growth!\n2. Every kite community I’ve stepped in has such a welcoming, caring, and positive atmosphere. It’s like home when I’m with other kiters.\n3. Ohhhh the physics/technical aspects and how majestic the kites are 😍
1	Making beats. I be always had a passion for it since I was a kid. I started playing piano at the age of 6 and my teacher told my parents that I was a natural and that it was like I've been here before. \n\nI also love working out. My goal is to reach a solid 160 ( yes I'm short btw). I guess I'm just an ENTJ very intuned with my Se
1	I enjoyed breakdancing. Lessons are over at the moment and I need to do less intense exercise for health reasons.\n\nAlso I enjoy 3d sculpting and 2D animation. Anything to do with digital art is my thing.\n\nAlso when I visit my mum I go shooting - both clay pigeon and rifle shooting. \n\nIn general, expensive hobbies 😂
1	Going to Operas, playing very highly competitive sports, corporate happy hours LOLZ
1	You may have hobbies that you don't realize are hobbies. I always thought I needed a hobby, but then I realized that I have some.\n\nCooking is a great hobby because you get to do it every day, it's a great way to socialize with people by inviting everyone over for a cookout or even visiting new restaurants to try something new. Groupon or the YMCA often have cooking classes where you can meet other foodies or do one as a group with some friends. If pastries are your thing, some craft stores have classes on decorating cookies/cakes/etc.
1	I act within an Am-dram group. I'm a final year PhD student who loves lecturing, so weirdly, I feel like acting isn't any different. I'm really excited for next week, we're doing a "Whose Line is it Anyway?" evening and I can't wait to just think of random shit off the cuff.\n\nAnyway, the group, is nothing to do with uni, everyone there have no connection to that area of my life. It's great to decompress and mess around. The other members will occasionally ask how things are going with the PhD, but that's just a general well-being thing. 
1	Hobbies: Martial arts, gym, cooking, sports, reading horror novels, financial investments, cryptocurrency, psychology, and I like volunteering! 
1	Music and art.\n\nI learned to play guitar off the internet.\n\nIf you want to start painting, try spray paint art. Very little cost, and very quick, so your Te won't go crazy :P
1	My biggest hobby right now is juggling.  I am very mathematically inclined and I have found that juggling is a fun way to enjoy my love of mathematics in a more recreational setting.  As well as it allows me to find other "nerds" who enjoy doing the same thing, for very similar reasons.  It also is a hobby that can travel easily with me (just keep three balls in my purse at all times, guys keep them in their pockets), so I always have something that I can be working on.  Have a free hour at work?  Get better at juggling! Waiting for your tires to be rotated? Practice juggling 5 balls! It allows me to have fun and feel like I am always making progress with something.  
6	Being managed	Hey! Fellow ENTJ-T (F22) here. I was wondering how others have coped with their managers/being managed. 
8	Set expectations. Be clear about what you want from the relationship. Don’t be afraid to upwards manage and say “I need this from you” or “please give me direction on this”. \n\nTell them how you want to be managed. If you want ownership of tasks or other responsibilities etc. speak up and challenge them when you think they’re wrong.\n\nIt’s difficult being the managee as someone who wants to manage and lead. But use that to drive the dynamic to work for you. 
4	Communication is key to any good relationship, especially with a manager. Letting them know what your goals are and understanding theirs will help you figure out a game plan for your career. Most good managers will help you achieve your ends, and others will see your drive as a threat and work to make you eat humble pie. \n\nAs for the day-to-day, sometimes I like to make sure I understand tasks by repeating orders back to supervisors in my own words. \n"Okay, to make sure I get this right, what I think you are asking me to do is _______."\nThis gives them a chance to correct anything or add detail. \n\nAs far as soft skills, Dale Carnegie's "How to Win Friends and Influence People" is a great starter-pack in understanding people. Good delivery is essential in maximizing your chance for success in asking for opportunities.
3	“Cope”\n\nThis word really stood out to me because it tells me you’re not ready to not be managed. \n\nAs an ENTJ you should have no problem being managed because the team aspect should be an important value for the goal: efficiency and effectiveness. \n\nThink about it this way—you will not be director, owner, CEO, or even your own boss over night. Those positions, or any manager position, has learned to follow and has no problem being managed because they understand it’s all an intricate machine. \n\nSo how do you get better? \nYou learn. Don’t see you boss or manager as your boss or manager. It’s a person who makes decisions to deliver a project or result. \n\nGet the power dynamic out of your head—that is the key to changing the perspective and suddenly not feeling, believing, or thinking your contained or...managed. \n\nEveryone answers to someone. You’re 22, you need to focus on learning as much as you can if you want to lead one day or even get out of “coping” for the rest of your life.\n\nHope this helped. \n\n-Some manager position at a  Consulting Firm 
1	Maybe save $ and work toward being self-employed.
1	I like to suffer in silence while I work towards management myself or self\-employment.
3	What are the personality types of your significant other(s) and/or best friend(s)?	ENTJ Type 8 here. Two of my best friends (one of them being my fiancée) are ISTJ Type 1s. The third ~~has not submitted to my squabbling about personality types, but I suspect he is an INFJ~~ is an INFP and maybe a Type 6? We butt heads because he is a pessimistic person and likes to complain a lot, and I... well, yeah. I feel that it is because of this that, while he is still one of my best friends, I am nowhere near as close to him as I am to my second-best friend (i.e. the one that I am not engaged to).\n\nI am pretty close to my four siblings as well, so I thought to include them: both of my older brothers are INFPs, younger sister is an INFJ, and ~~none of us know what our youngest brother is because he just hasn't gotten around to it. I suspect that he is an ExxP~~ youngest brother is an ESFP.\n\nI am curious to see how everyone else's inner circles are.\n\n\nEDIT: Updated info.
3	i'm an entj type 7. my tritype is 7w8, 8w7, 4w3.\n\n\ni'm not 100% sure about all these types (especially the enneagram) but let's try. \n\n**mom** - enfj type 9 (962 - not sure if 9 or 6 is first.)\n\n**dad** - esfp type 8 (837)\n\n**brother** - intj type 5 (513)\n\n\npeople i'm actually close to:\n\n**grandpa** - entj type 9w8 (935 maybe?)\n\n**grandma** - isfj type 9 (927)\n\n**best friend 1** - infp type 9w8 (974 maybe) \n\n**best friend 2** - infp type 4w5 (451?)\n\n**best friend 3** - istj type 4w5 (who knows)\n\n**childhood best friend** - infj \n\n\ni'm really close to my little brother, as well, but he's only 8 so there's no telling. seems to be an introvert, though.
3	Sister (deceased)\- ISTJ. Absolutely brilliant and very studious. Went to college at 16 and graduated from one of the best electrical engineering programs in the US. One of the sweetest and most caring people I have ever met. RIP sis.\n\nYounger brother\- INFP. Much better at empathizing with people than I am. Easy\-going. I admire his conviction. Don't think I know his enneagram. He's changed a lot over the past few years and I haven't been around him enough to really analyze him.\n\nMe\- ENTJ type 1w9. Slowly recovering from complex PTSD. Fuck you, anxiety and depression!\n\nMom\- ISFJ. Always was on my case for not being very socially acceptable. "What will other people think?" "You look unfriendly all the time" "You think you're smarter than everyone else". It took me many years of not living with her to appreciate her good qualities like her devotion to family.\n\nDad\- ISTP. Likes to fish and go boating a lot. He likes my brother a lot more than he likes me. Used to be jealous because he would teach my brother about technical stuff and ignore me completely. Like, WTF. I'm more logical than most men I meet.\n\nBest female friends\- ISTJ 2w3 and ENFJ. My ENFJ friend lives in another state, unfortunately :( She's very active on facebook, however. Always rallying behind one cause or another. I adore her.\n\nBest male friends\- INFP, ENFJ. ENFJs are some of my favorite people to hang out with. Great deal of depth but they're not afraid to keep things light and fun, either.\n\nCrush\- INFJ, though I get pissed off at him sometimes. Mysterious and frustrating because he rarely talks about himself. Also, that Fe/Ti vs Te/Fi clash gets magnified when one of the people involved is introverted. Me trying to get him to open up: "So, what do you want?" His reply: "What is your perspective?" OMGGG.\n\nSo I would say my favorite MBTI types are: ISTJ, INFP, xNFJs.
3	S/O: INFJ. So far I love the relationship. She's so mysterious and intriguing but at the same time very cute and bubbly, especially when we're together hahaha. She helps me in terms of figuring out my feelings and understanding others as well as giving me incredibly insightful point of views that I never would have thought of on my own, while I give her more structure and try to push her towards becoming a better person, as well as giving her logical point of views. (We also rein each other in respectively :v). And we do sometimes have our Fe/Ti and Te/Fi clashes, but it's so much more than that. We learn to compromise and just be happy together. Would recommend an INFJ 100% of the time~\n\nIn regards to the rest of my family, \n\nMother: ESFJ, very strong and goal oriented. But also incredibly loving and caring, can be very flamboyant at times.\nFather: ExTx. Not quite sure since I've never typed him and since I'm not very good at guessing I'll just leave it at that.\nBest friend: Tested ESTJ, and ENTP, so I'm not quite sure which he is. I thought he was mega "I" but I guess I was wrong...
2	I'm an ENTJ\n\n•Mom - ENFJ (likes to keep everything positive and happy about my life)\n\n•Dad - INTJ (smart person that I go to for advice)\n\n•Girlfriend INFJ (perfect opposites in personality. She keeps the moral up and is very faithful)\n\n•Friends\nENTP ( most hilarious person I know)\nESTP (most fun friend to get lit with)\nENFJ (like the mentor friend)\nESTJ (stuck his ways but cool person to be around with outside of work)\nISTP ( laid back deep thinking convos)\nINTP ( the weird friend that wants to be like me)
2	Mom: istj \n\n- mom is super reliable and gear down on me for procrasinatting her task a lot.\n\nDad: intj\n\n- hes smart but like to think a lot on effective action. \n\nI feel that my mom is the working horse while my dad is the THINKER that leads.\n\nIf they were in the jungle with a bunch of bushes covering their vision - my dad would be one climbing the tree to guide and mom would be cutting the bushes to clear a path.\n\n\nNo friends :) lol
2	Me: ENTJ \n\nBoyfriend: ENTJ \nMom: ISTJ (my role model, strong independent successful woman who cares for the family and my dad, idk how she does it) \nDad: ENXX\nBrother: ENTJ (but a turbulent one) \n2 aunts that I look up to: ENTJ / ENFP (or J I’m not sure) \n\nClosest guy friend from high school: ENTJ (challenges me to push my boundaries since he is such a high achiever) \nClosest guy friend from university: INTJ  (one of the most academically intelligent people I know, superb memory and graduated top of my course) \nTwo closest girl friends from high school: INFJs (taught me a lot in my formative years, both highly intelligent, excelled at sports, one is very creative) \nClosest girl friend from university: ENFP (kind and hilarious person)\n\nBasically I’m surrounded by ENTJs given that we make up quite a small % of the population. Generally I get along well with feelers but I’ve notice a communication “distance” with sensing types (apart from my Mom). Ps are okay unless they are chronically late which annoys the crap out of me if I have to wait all the time. 
2	What do you think of an ENTJ plastic surgeon?	I've already chosen plastic surgery as a career and I'm halfway there.\nHowever, any insight will be appreaciated, as it will make me handle and dominate the circunstance better.\n\nThanks in advance 
12	I’ve been trying really hard to understand how one is indicative of the other and vise versa. \n\nWhat do I think of an ENTJ plastic surgeon? I think if an ENTJ wants to be a plastic surgeon they shall be a plastic surgeon. I also think there are plenty of plastic surgeons who are ENTJ’s. \n\nI think this answer matches the quality of the question. 
4	It depends if your end goal is cosmetics or more trauma. I think the former would not be satisfying for you, but I’m not sure. Either way you’ll probably end up taking on a more administrative role in your department eventually which will be your bread and butter.
3	Surgeons are rather different than other kinds of doctors. Their practice tends to revolve more around short term interventions as opposed to long term management of conditions.\n\nI think, given my characteristics, I'd make a better surgeon than a physician. I prefer to solve a problem and then never deal with it again. Chronically revisiting an issue makes me feel like I'm missing a better solution.\n\nMany plastic surgeons mostly deal with reconstruction as opposed to aesthetic concerns, so I expect they'd get a variety interesting cases on a continual basis. From the plastic surgeons I've known, the field seems to be pretty innovative. I enjoy being in a field where I can continuously upgrade myself (software engineering) so I think I'd like that side of the field too.\n\nGood luck. The plastic surgeons I know also show up at the hospital at 6 AM to scrub in for eight hour procedures. If I did that I'd need to drink so much coffee I'd pretty much have wear a Foley in the OR.
1	I'm not a plastic surgeon, but just like anything just be the best at it and don't be close minded. Learn from the criticism of other people and move forward.
1	Why did you lead there? Why this choice?
1	I feel like you might end up talking people into getting more done than they want or having them change their minds about what they should get done.
1	On one hand make a killing off of vain motherfuckers and on the other be able to improve the lives of people who faced catastrophe; get it.
1	I don't know how will your personality type effect your surgery outcomes. Good luck on your career choice.
1	Sounds right
1	Advice on group work?	Hi fellow ENTJs! I'm in the final term of my MSc and it's a group dissertation. I won't bore people with the full details but it's me and two other girls and I'm getting really wound up. I'm friends with both of these girls outside of the work but recently I don't want to spend time with them because I'm getting so frustrated at their work ethic.\n\nWe agreed at the beginning of the project to split roles between us rather than equally breaking up each aspect of the workload. However, the first chunk of work falls predominantly to one girl, let's call her Annie. She's an international student and our course massages their grades so she's on a very high first and would have to monumentally screw up this diss to knock herself off that. Annie's English isn't very good and she was in charge of quantitative stuff which included writing out a questionnaire, which only she had access to through the university software so all updates had to go through her which also meant every time we sent a correction (and there were plenty because of English being her second language) we had to fill out the entire questionnaire again to proof it, versus her looking through it and finding the right question. The other night she threw a fit and said she was sick of putting in corrections on the questionnaire that were suggested to us by pre\-testers (the literal purpose of pre\-testing) and refused to do any more with it even though it's her area and parts of the questionnaire literally don't make sense. Annie is also the first to start whining about how long we've been in a meeting and often misses meetings or turns up halfway through and then undoes all the work we did in her absence. Once I actually did snap at her and she started crying, but it was very much feeling sorry for yourself crying rather than an actual awareness at how much stress she's caused me and the other girl.\n\nThe other girl, let's call her Tara, is having relationship problems currently and she's taking lots of extra work shifts. All she'll talk about is the boyfriend and she's taken to messaging me drunk about it and cos I'm quite nocturnal and I count her as a close friend I always take the time to listen and be supportive, but now I'm finding if I message about anything other than her failing relationship she just leaves me on read. She sent an apology the other night, but the gist of it was "sorry I've been shit and keep leaving you on read, can't promise it won't happen again, the break up is blah blah blah", I humoured her and accepted the apology and listened to her break up schtick and GOT LEFT ON READ AGAIN. Tara is on a low 2:1 and I'm right at the bottom of the first category, so it's in both our interests to do well in this. She also always leaves me to call Annie out when she's causing issues because she doesn't like confrontation, even though I know she has a problem with it too because she's sending me messages about what Annie's doing wrong as it's happening.\n\nWe're all relatively last minute people but it seems like I'm the one having to organise meetings, contact clients and supervisors, triple check stuff Annie has written, write up huge chunks of the final piece on my own, and actually make actionable progressive plans and ensure we stick to them. And when I message with queries or issues Annie is always super keen to cut corners at every possible opportunity and Tara just reads it and doesn't respond.\n\nI'm at a loss. The friendship stuff is frustrating, I can't be around Annie socially anymore because I'm so repulsed by how lazy she's being on the project and for a time I could separate that from spending time with her as a friend, but they've melded now, and she prioritises a social life over work anyway. Tara is probably my best friend on the course but I'm feeling kind of abandoned by her, and even though I'm not naturally an F (though my T and F often come out pretty similarly high) I'm really really trying to be as supportive as possible with her about the break up but I'm feeling like a doormat because the second she gets bored we stop talking. More importantly than that though is that the group is no longer functional and this is worth a huge chunk of our final grade. These girls are definitely ExFx (I think Tara may have taken a test and come out as an ENFx but idk for certain, I would guess Annie is an ESFP but that's pure conjecture) and idk what to do anymore. I know ENTJs are meant to rally people up but the two of them just don't seem to care. What do I do to get them to take an interest and stop leaving it all to me?\n\ntldr; how do I get ExFx to actually buck up and do their share of the work before my brain melts?
2	Are you good in persuading? Because that is the only way to make them work. Or remind them the end goal or the finish line. Tell them, what will happen if you don’t work now. 
1	Lazy people will stay lazy whatever you do. Pushing them to work might even get them to underdo their tasks.\n\nDo their share, don't complain about it, reap benefits. Not the best solution, but in school it pushed me forward in terms of results and social interactions.
1	Ugh group projects. UGH. \n\nI’m sorry you’re going through this. It truly sucks. \n\nAnnie may be a lost cause, so you might have to approach Tara about finishing Annie’s part yourselves. Before you do that, maybe try to chop up her work into smaller tasks and feed them to her one by one? Or invite her to study together, like “oh let’s study at Starbucks and then go for lunch”. Disguise studying with something social (which she’ll likely attend) but make sure she brings her laptop. I know you’re socially repulsed by her, but it might be a necessary sacrifice to get her to finish her part. You could get her to do it by holding her hand along the way and babysitting her. \n\nFor Tara, invite her to coffee or lunch—just the two of you. Disguise it as a catching up thing, or like “oh girl we need to go for brunch” next time you talk. She’ll think you’re being nice bc of her relationship problems. Yeah ok. Sure. You can chat a bit about that in the beginning, and then go into your stuff. \n\nTell her you’re stressed because of Annie. The work isn’t getting done, etc. Basically, you want to deliver two messages to her: (1) we have problems. What are we going to do about Annie? and (2) please don’t add to my stress and do your own work. Be tactful. If she’s still in our world, she’ll shape up and avoid becoming a burden on you. If she’s still in our world and a thoughtful person, she’ll offer to help you with Annie’s bit. If she’s in her own world, you might have to break it down for her so at the very least, she’ll do her own work and you’ll deal with Annie’s part yourself.\n\nScrew these people. Be sneaky and get what needs to be done, done.

5	I don't think that all of these traits necessarily go with the ENTJ personality type. Out of all of these, finding yourself in leadership positions you didn't fight tooth and nail for and need for efficiency are the most directly correlated with ENTJs. Charisma imo has very little to do with being an ENTJ specifically. 
3	Why is this video just lots of shots of attractive women, alost none of whom demonstrate any ENTJ traits. \n\nI want stock photos of business people in confident poses, damnit.\n\n\nAnd apex predators.
2	As an ENTJ 3w4, how can I prevent falling into connection 9?	Not sure if you guys follow Enneagrams, but if you do I'm a 3w4, and have a tendency to fall into 9 territory. I believe 6 is the positive one for me. I was wondering if you guys have any tips on how to try and prevent myself from falling into 9 territory, and if you guys have any tips on just staying healthy in general as an ENTJ. Thanks in advance!
3	You're correct, the direction of disintegration is 3 to 9. It speaks to an abandonment of one's desires and identity to flee from suffering. Speaking to the MBTI cognitive functions I think of it as a deadening of Fi, and since that's the inferior function for ENTJ's it's an area of particular vulnerability.\n\nThere's a principle in psychology called [learned helplessness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness) that I think often applies in this kind of situation. Our type fundamentally seeks to exert a high level of control over our circumstances and that's often extremely difficult to do. If you think that it's possible that you're disintegrating to 9 because you're struggling with big problems in your life then my best recommendation is to rebuild from the bottom up. Take a look at everything you do, every detail of your daily life, and identify how you prefer to arrange things. Assert your control to improve things, or literally just to prove that you can - especially when it comes to your time and attention. Small wins *matter.* Peace of mind is built on myriad routine tasks completed well, so order your life such that those successes happen naturally. Presumably you're not in the middle of a life-or-death crisis that demands that you solve all the big problems immediately, and it pays to make sure you have solid footing before wrestling with the hard stuff.\n\nAlternatively, there's a potential for disintegration to 9 due to boredom, stagnation, ennui. ENTJ's frequently need some significant challenge to grapple with to feel alive or noticeable movement in some direction. If that's the case then pick something that's even vaguely interesting to you and set an ambitious goal related to it, then go after it. You want to learn how to cook? Your objective is serving your friends a fancy five-course meal that you made by yourself. Interested in martial arts? Go earn a black belt in Tae Kwon Do. That sort of thing. Don't second-guess yourself, just pick something arbitrarily and go for it.\n\nHowever, if neither of those general situations applies to you, then it might be something to take up with a therapist. Could be something in your relationships, could be patterns of behaviors that you could use some help fixing - whatever it is, you might benefit from having a professional give you some advice. From the other side of our screens I can only tell you something between "Jack" and "shit" about your life and what's really going on.
2	I'm an INTJ 3w4, and I make sure I'm a little productive every day.  I only do things that advance goals of mine or causes/people I'm involved in. I curate goals ruthlessly to avoid burnout. Progress feels really good and is a little slice for me. \n\nHow I avoid going to 9: Pace myself. Take time out for exercise, driving, travel. Concern myself with the people close to me, listening and enjoying them.  Untangle from performing as much as possible, especially in relationships, and be honest about how I feel, which is hard because we want to be perfect. Also, humility really helps.  Accept what I can't change about me, and look at the positives of it to embrace.  \n\nIf something causes me to disintegrate, figure out why.  Too much exposure?  Don't trust others? SO under stress? Not there for my friends? Then I implement a solution.  Sometimes it's by building my inner worth to be less affected by environment. 
1	An Interesting ENTJ Who Has Recently Come To My Attention	Glenn Rushton, trainer of Australian welterweight boxer Jeff Horn, who is set to take on ISTP superstar and overwhelming favorite Terence "Bud" Crawford at the MGM Grand Garden Arena on Saturday.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/QljlNVM2Br0\n\nhttps://youtu.be/5FJ0Gne8CSE\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/peterkahn/2018/06/04/jeff-horn-trainer-glenn-rushton-on-terence-crawford-hes-just-a-man-hes-not-a-god-video/#6c9bf0103889\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Hi2Aufjf5ag\n
1	How do we know the trainer is ENTJ? I skimmed the article, saw no reference.
9	ADD meds making me feel more ENTJ	Hi, I'm an ENTJ with ADD. Every test I've ever taken I've scored ENTJ without fail (though my E is relatively low) and while I have always felt like an ENTJ, I have never had the work ethic/drive that all the other ENTJs in my life or on the internet talk about. I've been taking meds for a while, but just now noticed that the meds don't seem to really force me to do anything, but rather facilitate my ENTJness. I feel like my ability to do things meets up with my ambition and drive to succeed. Does anyone else have a similar experience?\n\nedit: typos
10	I'm an ENTJ diagnosed with ADHD. I know EXACTLY what you mean. When I take ritalin, it's like putting NoS into my cylinders. I can brute force my way through life and be successful with willpower but it's draining. Ritalin turns me into robot mode and it makes me much more efficient.
8	Hey man, I've been meaning to reply to this all day but keep getting distracted (surprise, surprise). I recently got officially diagnosed as ADHD and have been on medication for nearly a month. So far I've found that it's increased my focus and made me more present. My working memory seems better, so I don't need constant lists and reminders, and my energy levels are more consistent.  I'm definitely presenting more as a typical ENTJ now, especially as the meds mitigate my introspection and daydreaming. Oh,  and my perception of time is different, slower, more manageable.\n\n\nThere are some drawbacks, like it's reined in my lateral thinking, but I can't come up with the quick creative solutions on the fly like I did before. And I can't hyperfocus to get work done, so it feels a lot more laborious but the execution is better. \n\n\nPeople do not get that this is a legitimate neurological disorder. Nothing pisses me off more than being considered lazy. If anything, I have to work twice as hard just to stay in the same place. There are so many misconceptions about it that it's also really hard for us to be taken seriously, and if you're a high achiever despite it people just think you're trying to be prescribed Adderall to get an advantage. It's like idiots who think autism is caused by vaccines.\n\nYou should check out ENTJDuke on YouTube,  he's also ADHD and has some good videos. \n\nHope your medication helps you achieve your goals stranger.
2	ENTJ with diagnosed mental illnesses checking in (one of them is ADHD).\n\nI was diagnosed with depression, an anxiety disorder, and ADHD just under a decade ago as a teen. I was medicated for all three and it went horribly, so I stopped taking all of them after I ended up in a hospital. A few years after all of that, I started therapy and I am closing in on FIVE whole years with this therapist in September. I actually used to test as INFJ up until a few years ago and I absolutely think therapy was the thing that changed me. I disliked being around people and going out to do things so much that you'd think I was allergic to them. I had zero self-confidence, few goals, procrastinated all of the time, let my emotions rule me, had a hard time saying "no" to people or with any form of confrontation honestly, and wasted a lot of time letting my self-worth live and die on what other people thought of me. I feel like a big part of that was not understanding how to manage my mental illnesses and emotions in a healthy and productive way; therapy taught me how to do that. I learned how to better understand people, and to not take everything so personally. I slowly began to build self-confidence, short- and long-term goals, and even changed my college major because I figured out that I wasn't happy with what I was doing. I have always had the desire to succeed and to do many things, but I often felt like the "me" on the inside that wanted those things was constantly smacked down by the "me" that was basically a shadow of my mental illnesses. I had finally started winning some of the battles, but I was still losing the war.\n\nThis past January, I decided that I wanted to try medication again; it was an idea that rattled around in my head most of last year and my therapist said that it was my decision. While learning to manage myself had drastically changed my life, there were still things here and there that I knew were wrong/off. One of the bigger things was trying to focus at/for school. So, I saw someone in February and... I was diagnosed with BPD. It came as a complete shock to me, but anyway, I was prescribed a mood stabilizer and it has done wonders for me. After that, when the other symptoms were still there, I was prescribed a stimulant (different from the one I was on in high school). Have you ever had a feeling in your gut that there was a person deep down inside you and you just *knew* it was who you actually are, but they were trapped and couldn't come out? I have felt that way for most of my life; now that person is finally in control for me. My drive and ability feel matched, and I truly feel like I am my own person.\n\n\ntl;dr, Yes, I have had a very similar experience; mine just had a lot of finagling.
0	Sounds like you have depression which could mean you're unable to execute tasks, rather than ADHD.\n\nNot all ENTJs are one monolithic personality. You'll have some super productive ENTJs and some lazy ENTJs. All my life, way before I started reading into MBTI, my natural personality was super-driven and ENTJ-like. But for about 2 years I had depression (though that was due to situational factors) and I was more like an ISFP, I just didn't do anything, took things one day at a time and did a lot of self introspection. Now, through having a girlfriend and a good social network (developing my Fi) I gradually got out of my depression and now I'm completely back to my old self - but with additional insight/wisdom and even more resilience than before.\n\nOn average, ENTJs are pretty driven than most other MBTIs. And whilst it is a defining characteristic, it is by no means a prerequisite. But it seems like you're taken by the romantic idea that if you act as an ENTJ stereotype, you'll achieve your ambitions or whatever self-image you would like to hold of yourself. And you seem terrified that you're not an ENTJ, to the point which you're taking ADHD meds! That's absolutely insane - it's not a smart idea to be playing around with your brain chemistry. \n\nYour drive and motivation has to come from within. It seems like you're not truly comfortable with yourself. I have to say that the one common quality I've seen in nearly all ENTJs I've ever known, is that they are very comfortable and realistic about who they are - and that's how they have such a great foundation for the energy and confidence needed to do what most ENTJs are stereotypically thought to do, which sets them apart from other MBTIs. Only INFJs come close. Maybe INTJ and ESTJ too - but they tend to be more narcissistic than anything else, which is the opposite.
0	entj is the elite, end point of evolution )  \n\ni mean, in our current context. try to get there without meds though  
-10	Absolutely, meds are never the solution.  Ambition and the drive to succeed come from within - that burning fire. 
8	Offline/ Single player games	I havn't been playing videogames for some time now, this is because I know it won't help me in any way accept for wasting my time. This has been a progression where I slowly stopped playing video games more and more. At first I stopped playing single player/ offline games just to play online games. At first I thought this was due to me being bored playing solo but now that I've learned about MBTI I think this has to do with my primary Te function. Is this because my offline stats/ achievements won't be displayied into the external world? Or something similar?
7	1 you are wrong, they do help you, gotta understand how  \n\n2 yes , status is a basic human need, \n\nanother is challenge / stimulation  \n\nanother is belonging  \n\nso it ticks more boxes for the .. basic needs.    \nPS. i disagree that online is better than offline though. but maybe i have those needs met, and prioritize the benefits of SP
3	A lifetime of video games is the reason I'm so computer savvy, and why my typing speed is well above average. Also, my ability to strategize and problem solve in high stress situations is much greater than most people. Aaaaaand my ability to work as a team comes from that too. Video games are not a waste of time. 
2	hey, in the interest of being productive, I can see why it would seem like a good idea to stop playing video games. But I'd be wary of falling down that rabbit hole because life can be fun _and_ productive and rest is a necessary part of work life balance
1	I switched to online games as well.  I prefer the challenge and interacting with others.  I think this is my inferior Fe but I also like playing Player vs. Player as humans are more interesting and complex.  Though I hardly play video games anymore as I don't see it progressing me financially.
1	Tangent but: Do you think reading is a waste of time? Depending on the game of course, I think video games can be just as helpful and eye opening as reading a phenomenal fiction book. I like to make time in my life for video games, and as an added plus, it gives me an additional thing to look forward to, which helps in warding off depression/anxiety. It's only when gaming is taking over your life\- which as long as you have proper structure and scheduling, shouldn't happen! I think scheduled downtime/relaxing time is so important in modern times, where you could always be doing 'more'.
1	Whether video games are a time-waster or not is relative to the person, in my opinion. Gaming is one of my main hobbies and even *I* feel that way about it sometimes. Despite that, I would have to disagree. I might feel overwhelmed and want to stop playing certain things because I am a bit of a completionist, but gaming is a form of escapism. You can immerse yourself into some other world and it doesn't matter if it's because you need a break, are running from a real-life issue, or just need a little inspiration. They can also be really great ways to bond with people. Learn teamwork or strategizing and all that. I have also made good friends via playing games online.\n\nSome people like getting the achievements/trophies, or breaking high scores, or setting new records. It might not "mean" anything IRL but if it means something to that person, I think that is the thing that counts the most.
7	entjs seem like the happiest?	i dont know,entjs have this child like spirit to them,they can enjoy pranks even in there 50s,they seem to always enjoy themselfs.iv never seen a depressed entj.even my dad would still shoot marbles like a kid in his 50s lool.while i cant even play videos games because i loose interest so fast???whats your secret?
23	[deleted]
7	I don't think it's an ENTJ-specific thing, rather more than a lifestyle thing. Only spend your time on what you will enjoy. ENTJs are notorious for pouring their time and dedication in what they believe in. So I guess it makes sense that if you believe in getting the most enjoyment of your time, you'd spend your time pretty well.\n\nSpeaking for myself, I never waste time doing things I don't want to. At least, that's how I think of it in my mind. If I'm helping someone with errands, I'll consider myself being productive and helpful (which I like). If I'm hitting the gym (I hate the gym), I'm getting some health/body results that I want. On and on it goes.
5	As an ENTJ, I can say it's true to some extent, but if you keep on going throughout the weeks without doing anything accomplishing or goal oriented, you start getting a depressed type feeling. I believe this is probably everyone, some probably not? lol. I personally need to achieve new goals whether it's learn more coding, hit new PRs at the gym, or find new information that is useful, so that I get that success feeling. I graduated with my Bachelor's degree about a year ago, and I start my Master's in the fall...and jeez I can't wait to get started on a new routine with tests, work, etc.
4	When I'm progressing towards my goals I'm the outwardly happy guy cracking jokes around the office.  If I am stuck in rut with my long term goals, I can only act happy so much and when I get home I feel like crud.
3	My boyfriend is an ENTJ. I would not describe him as happy/carefree/childlike at all. If anything, he carries himself like he is much older than he currently is, and when I first met him, he was pretty depressed. His sense of humor is rather crude and hinges on randomness and shock value, so I guess I can see that being “childish”. But that’s a pretty big stretch when I take the rest of his personality into account.
3	I have bipolar disorder, so naturally I get depressed a lot. \n\nMy sense of humor could be described more as energetic, clever, provocative, etc. I love crude humor. \n\n In terms of temperament, I'm definitely a serious person - I'm not tomfoolish or ditzy or anything like that. But I like to have a good time. 
3	Personally... I wonder if other people just like being miserable? I was utterly depressed once, almost killed myself. Decided that I didn't like that so I just never let stuff get me down any more. Other people in my life whine about a lot of goddamn things and I'm like?? Do something about it or just stop letting it bother you so much. 
3	As someone who has long highs and long (albeit shortening) lows, the secret is not paying attention to your mood when its low, and go against that inertia. If the mood becomes too consuming or youre sick of going through a long rough patch alone, then talk to a professional.  \n\n\nI think a lot of us ENTJs understand the value of therapy, even the comments here prove it. Im 25, but I have 3 years of therapy behind me. So far, no significant diagnosis or disorders, just life difficulties. Thanks to that I managed to if not get ahead in some areas then keep up with people who, otherwise, had far better chances at succeeding.
3	I’m an ENTJ and I’m severely depressed. But if you were to see me around work, you would never know because I’m very good at hiding it. For me, if being depressed isn’t going to benefit the greater good or those around me, then I’ll hide it and will be depressed when I’m alone by myself. 
2	Most of my time is spent feeling somewhat down and a bit robotic. :( Being absorbed in a task does deliver some excitement though! And you gotta put on a good demeanour when in social situations - spread the good vibes and it makes everyone more efficient when working in a team.
2	Yeah depression and stuff but many wouldnt know off appearance and demeanor. We hide it well 
2	I am only depressed when I am stuck in an uninspiring spot, feeling like I am wasting my time not doing what I want or pursuing my goals. I get incredibly energised once back on track and preferably surrounded by inspiring people. The depression is more an  intense lack of motivation than sadness or even self harm. \n\nI take happiness from being content with myself and life, knowing that I act in accordance with my values and pursue meaningful and adventurous goals. Apart from achieving my goals I also value freedom. As an entrepreneur I work to be free and not for the sake of working, as some ENTJ's make it seem. \n\nPeople generally say I am more mature than my age but I adapt to whom I am with. I am intensely independent and people who don't inspire me might see me as unfriendly or weird. \n\nSince I like comedy and watch it a lot for inspiration, my humour is pretty varied. h3h3 is one important influence. 
2	Being happy is something you work on, and I am dead serious about it.
2	I might look cheerful on surface, yet my heart is deeply wounded and fragile under the armour.\n\nOtherwise people say I´m assertive, tough and sociable.

7	Opinions on Art and Music?	So, my fellow ENTJs. I live my life surrounded by music and art(career field) and I rarely find another obvious ENTJ around me, unless they are older and upper level management types, but those are few and far between.\n\nAre there any other music lovers out there, or even people who spend a lot of time thinking about the cinematography of movies, or is this an endeavor that is not worth the time or effort to partake in?
5	Creating something where there would have been nothing burns at the core of most ENTJs. \n\nI truly stand in awe of people who dedicate years of their life to a single piece of great art.  \n\nI've definitely met ENTJ musicians.  I'm having a harder time coming up with ENTJ visual artists and I've never been involved in film but I have to believe that a good portion of directors are ENTJs just by the nature of their art. As Orson Wells put it “A writer needs a pen, an artist needs a brush, but a filmmaker needs an army.”\n\n
3	Oh yeah, we are out here. I love what’s going on with modern rock these days. Also into movies and always notice cinematography. I love the current resurgence of hard sci-fi with big cinematic look and feel that is currently going on such as with Bladerunner 2049. There’s something really satisfying about movies like that. \n\nYou’re thinking most ENTJs don’t care about these things?  Hmm I hadn’t really thought about it. I have a large group of I and E NTJ friends and I think you’re right, the majority don’t care about movies or music. But a few of them do. \n\n
2	I grew up playing piano and guitar. I went to college for music composition. I've been a music teacher for 6 years now and hoping to take that to full time and build a large business out of it (at the moment I'm the manager of a cleaning business). I'm not as much into visual arts as I am into music. Music is possibly the single thing that can bring me to tears.
2	I'm an engineer by profession but I've always had love for art and music. Since there's a lot of talk of music, I'll speak for art. I feel that I can appreciate all forms of art, with perhaps a growing interest in modern art. Personally living fairly close to the National Gallery (UK), I find myself drawn to the depth of renaissance art and I'm currently in the process of reading the Bible as to understand the pieces better and draw conclusions from them myself.\n\nAs for a quick note on music, I taught myself piano and guitar at a fairly young age and I would have loved to make a career out of it but for financial and practical reasons, I went down the path of science and engineering. I am interested and actively listen to a diverse array of music genres, although I don't enjoy metal/screamo very much at all - about as far as I'll go in that sector is something like Linkin Park (which I know many metal fans will scoff at, but it's a good measure for that representation!) 
1	Hi, there! Growing up, I wrote music and would perform at festivals. Then I got way too critical of myself and decided it wasn’t practical and wouldn’t make me any money, so I stopped. I studied sociology in college but picked up a minor in film and theater. Now I’m a full time video producer and director for a corporate publishing company. I brought my keyboard into the office and started writing music for our videos so that’s how I’ve been able to incorporate music into my work. At home, I use music (I play piano, violin, guitar, and I sing) to relax. I’m also finishing up a master’s degree in film studies which I’m hoping will help bump my pay grade and will make me a more enticing candidate for future jobs I plan to apply for. My master’s thesis project will be a music video that I produce and direct, and hopefully that will open up a few doors for me to continue to produce and direct more music videos (my dream job). 
1	Made my money from a Facebook page and now that Zuckerberg has shut me down, i am now focused on creating Fine Art.  The thrill of creating art that people seem to enjoy without the need of Internet and without the need of assistance from other people is indescribable. I don't have to tell anyone what to do because I only need to depend on myself in order to create which is so freeing
1	ENTJ rapper here. I find myself in a better position than most because of my organizational and leadership skills. Most musicians are shoddy when it comes to running their business.
1	Been playing guitar for 20 years now. Business analyst by profession. 
1	IT Guy here that at the ripe old age of 35 is picking up the brush and embarking on an art journey as a hobby to keep me from going insane outside work hours.\nIf nothing else its super difficult to wade through all the Fe in art circles - "just put your emotions into it!", "you can really feel what the artist was feeling!". <Spanish Accent>"Art is about passion!" </Spanish accent>\n\nBut I do kind of look at the artists I'm trying to learn from and think the same thing, the, I don't know, mechanics of the craft seem to be understated in lieu of emotional attachment to a colour.
1	Just rather recently I realised I might have synesthesia and associate different key signatures with colours. (c minor as greyish ice blue and c sharp minor as burgundy etc...) While hungry for something epic, classical and metal (esp Viking and Ethnic subtypes, also listening to death metal spitting out all my angst, and ironically it calms me down like the Nocturnes from Chopin) are definitely my fave genres.
1	I’m an ENTJ theater artist! Going into directing though, got to be type A somehow 😂
1	Yes Music is been one of the biggest things in my life. From engineering to finding out how the acoustics work in a room to and fixing my guitars when they break soldering pick ups and petals.

16	Giving up on work satisfaction?	As a kid I was driven and got my dream job at 22 -- Air Force pilot. It was a huge let down compared to what I expected and I was devastated. I left as fast as I could and spent the next decade trying financial services consulting then aerospace work. Still unsatisfied, I finally just gave up and became a government contractor for work-life balance and set a new goal of early retirement by 40, 7 more years. My company offered me a management position (so easy for ENTJs, no?) but I turned it down because mediocrity. Have any ENTJs been successful but also just consistently disappointed with work? Any ideas/guidance for me or do I just need to suck it up try to be satisfied with my "success?"
8	I don't think satisfaction is something ENTJs have much capacity to feel. As soon as you achieve anything it's immediately onto The Next Thing. I wonder sometimes if that's why the ENTJ type is often successful - it's because we can never seem to be fulfilled with what we do, so we push harder.\n\nThis is a long way of saying that perhaps it's just down to the way you are! But you're using that feeling to do great things.
6	That sounds terrible. Everytime I had that level of dissatisfaction, it was at a job that wasn't my end goal.\n\nIt sounds like your field is unsatisfying. What do you want to do? I think that's what you have to figure out because I would say you haven't found it yet. 
2	Oh, constantly. Like I achieve what I want and then I suddenly don't know what to do with it. Like I feel empty, "now what?" \n\nI've more of less just given up on it. I try to find satisfaction in other parts of my life that's not endgoal-oriented, like spending time with friends. 
2	I'm beginning to wonder whether us ENTJs can be truly satisfied with anything other than running our own business/organization.
2	Man, you want to retire at 40. This is your goal. So it requires really hard work. It unfortunately doesn't go well with work-life balance and work satisfaction. 
2	Hey, at least you were able to get your dream job! I wanted to be a fighter pilot growing up but I grew to be a few inches too tall so I couldn’t. As far as I know my height was my only disqualifying factor. \n\nIn context of retirement, 7 years isn’t that long if you could still do it. Maybe stick it out and then grow a new hobby afterwards. That or change careers and work longer than 7 years. If you have a pension riding on it I wouldn’t though. 
2	> I finally just gave up and became a government contractor for work-life balance and set a new goal of early retirement by 40\n\nI have a hard time seeing how you could have a worse work-life balance.
2	Thanks everyone for taking the time to respond! It's given me a lot to chew on and a few initial conclusions. First, I need to digest a permanent state of being dissatisfied with the status quo. I also need to figure out how to dial-up the risk posture in my life. A slow-and-steady path to retirement in seven years just isn't going to work since it's so f*ing boring. I have a few things in mind...
1	Although I’m certainly not at the stage in life that you are — I’m just a senior in high school — I think I may have a piece of advice that might guide you on the right path to figuring out the solution to this issue for yourself. \n\nAs an ENTJ, I can completely relate to feeling dissatisfied with your work. I myself have a bit of an entrepreneurial spirit (a trait of a lot of ENTJs I’ve noticed). I’ve started a statewide organization and grown it to over 300 members across the state with 15 chapters in local communities (it may not be a fortune 500 business, but, for a high schooler, I think it’s pretty effective) and have started multiple clubs within my high school geared towards community outreach that have been immensely impactful. In doing so, I’ve had experience with people, institutions, and life that’s not very common for people my age. Up until recently, I felt pretty satisfied with the work that I was doing. I felt like I brought my natural talents of leadership, vision, and organizational skills and applied it to solving important problems that needed to be addressed. But I’ve recently hit a brick wall in terms of progress — everything feels meaningless, I feel like my work is no longer important, I’ve been faced with institutional barriers, and I fail to see any long term application to my future goals (becoming a politician, getting into an ivy league institution, making progress in the world, and much more). I think that may be a bit of what you’re feeling right now: the jobs you’ve had and the experiences you’ve had haven’t fulfilled you with whatever is it that you deem important to you in the future, while also being mediocre and providing nothing in terms of advancement. \n\nUltimately, the solution lies in developing your introverted intuition and introverted feeling. You need to craft a vision of the future so strong and meaningful to yourself that no matter what it is that comes in your way in your job, career, etc that you can stick to it. But it also has to be deeply meaningful and reflective of your diverse experiences as a person (Fi). I think so often us ENTJs become so dead-set on pursuing goals that, at face value, seem to bring us everything we think want: whether that be money, power, stability, etc. And we work viciously toward pursuing them, disregarding the experiences and feelings of life that go along with them. This is essentially ignoring Se and Fi within yourself in pursuit of Te and Ni vision. While a meaningful life for an ENTJ MUST derive from setting Te goals and progressing toward an Ni vision of the future, you have to ensure that that life is rich in meaningful experiences and is important to what you value (Se and Fi). \n\nLong story short: no you shouldn’t suck it up and be satisfied with your successes. Yes, you’ve probably been immensely successful in life. But what does that matter if those successes aren’t meaningful to you? If they don’t offer you with diverse experiences and insight into life itself? Choose a career that you’re competent in and you feel that offers you with significant advancement and opportunity to surround yourself with competent and capable people. Make sure that career is also forward focused: that you have an ability to climb the social ladder (if you think doing so will be meaningful to you) and make an impact. And be sure that you’ll have some rich experiences with people and ideas that matter to yourself. I’m not sure what that will look like concretely in your life, since I only know as much as is written in your reddit post (and by your username, soulsieking, which is so obvious of the need for development of your Fi) but hopefully this helps you! 
1	Shit dude, I'm 18 and in the process of joining the Aussie Airforce as a pilot, what was so disappointing about it? You did damn well making it in though, did You think about transitioning into another role in the forces? 
8	Lack of coping skills for rejection	Hey, fellow ENTJs. Just wondering if any of you have any coping mechanisms for rejection or maybe even a strategy or philosophy for thinking about it?\n\nOver the past couple of months, I’ve come to the realization that I lack the coping skills needed to help me overcome rejection. I usually never put myself in situations that will cause me to get rejected, so my HSV2 (genital herps) diagnosis earlier this year has made me completely suicidal when I have to think about dating people and getting rejected because of something the CDC doesn’t tell your providers to screen for in the standard STD panel. \n\nDon’t really want to be told that it’s my own fault for getting it, as I already know this. Would just really like to hear anything to help me out of this dark (and emotional—ugh) place. \n\nThanks in advance. 
5	Hey. As someone who has what you have - received it from a cheating bf years ago- I understand the feeling of devastation - I have always told my partners up front as I know first hand what it feels like to have that hidden from me as well as the person taking away my option to protect myself. \n\nIt’s important to know the facts of what you have so you can explain clearly that it is very common. In fact, 1 in 4 people have it. Which, logically, most people do not bother to inform their partners. \n\nMost of my partners also have not had any STDs themselves. You’d be surprised at how open people are when you show respect towards their choices. Only one person has “rejected” me. I prefer to tell them when the time is right. You will learn when that is. \n\nMeaning, build a little. Make sure you have some connection but do not engage in sexual relations. You have to make sure they see enough of you as a person and not a diagnosis. It’s harder to reject something when you like it and see the person as a human being. \n\nI always tell them whatever they are comfortable with is ok with me and that my truthfulness also indicates my willingness to keep them safe from contracting it. I also make it known that whatever choice they make is totally understandable and I ask them to keep my confidence regardless of their choice.\n\n\nAlso, it will change and slow you down a bit and help you build more trust first than a sexual relationship. Although, there are dating sites exclusively for others so you can avoid the conversation altogether. \n\nPlease PM me for more information. Good luck. \n\n
3	My method of handling rejection in a general sense, is essentially having a plan ready in my mind for either outcome, and I try to ensure either outcome can be positive. So if the less favourable outcome is the one that happens, I am already in a positive place because I now know which plan to put into action.\n\nWhat you are asking however, in dealing with rejection seems less general than that and specific to relationships. But it also seems like your current problems are less to do with rejection and relationships and more to do with your emotional well-being and maybe self-confidence at the moment?\n\nMy suggestion would be to forget relationships for now, as it sounds like that is a potential additional stress that you should put on hold until your head is straight. Write a list of all your problems and write a plan of how you address each one and solve it. Then start with either the easiest or most difficult (personal preference, but I tend to go with the hardest first, as it tends to give the biggest confidence boost to tackling all the rest)\nGiven that you have commented on HSV2, I am guessing this is your biggest stress right now? herpes is not all that serious, as far as STD's go, it is annoying for sure, but it is not always a shedding virus, and it is only contagious when it is shedding (that is my understanding), so when you do get into relationships, I would recommend taking a while to get to the sexual stage, as getting to know someone quite well before bringing up the herpes is probably a good idea, and springing it on them 'prior' to having sex is likewise the best course.\n\nConfidence building has a lot of resources online, even if you consider yourself a confident person normally, just reading some of the material might help get you out of the dark place you describe. \nAs for emotional advice, others would probably be better for that than I am, as I am not a particularly emotionally expressive person, so what works for me, may well not work for you.
3	It's all about keeping perspective and viewing every setback and rejection as either a challenge to be overcome or a burden to toughen you up.\n\nGary Vaynerchuk puts it best : https://youtu.be/c0Tba2eV2FQ
0	What would you say this character's function levels are at?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6yZlGoD5rA\n\nI'm detecting strong Se playfulness, dominant Te cruelty and difficulty with inferior Fi, Te-dominant, Fi-inferior cold-heartedness on the outside but puppy-like at the core, and I'm not sure about Ni (still confused as to what it is exactly).
1	If looking at INTJ ENTJ having vurnerable Fi, Ni goes with Te. \n\nSe or Ne gathers information from the world, *not as much as Ne personals like me INTP and ENTP so curioused about everything, have to ask Why to everything, love to spend time having 100+ internet browser tabs that we just like to gather information more and more, but* Ni oriented tends to organizes the pattern, to find what path is appearing that would works. Te tends to organize thinking with reasoning that appears well to the tribe. (While Ti is reasoning for herself and stays inside more than making appearing presentation for others...) In this way the person appear the leadership, driven and assertive personality.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/wkJmw8zw3d0\n\nhttps://youtu.be/MY1sBJYdc6M
10	How do y'all deal with roommates	Feel like my personality type has been an important factor in my irritations lately, so I figured I'd give it a go here.\n\nI'm soon to be entering my last year of college. I transferred to school here, and am finally coming into my own with regards to developing professional skills and managing my time effectively. I work through the school, and because my hours are capped, it only partially offsets my rent for the semester, but my boss is a professor who gives solid career/academic advice and is really understanding when I get busy. Everything is great on that front.\n\nHowever, at home I have 4 roommates. We each have our own rooms. Three of them are doing unskilled labor in retail and one is a professional software developer. I get along with all of them on a friendship basis \(two of them were my friends before I moved in.\) However, I do the lion's share of the cleaning and do all of the DIY fixing around the house. After me, the software developer does the most. Other than him and I, nobody cleans the kitchen/does the dishes/takes the trash and recycling out. And he helps fund any DIY fixing that I do \(supplies for holes in the wall, tears in the screen door/windows, etc.\) Two of them also disproportionately create more trash and recycling with the amount of takeout and beer that they consume. The last one likes to cook because he is following a specific diet, but always leaves the kitchen in complete disarray when he does. There is still a pot with burnt meat on the bottom on the side of the kitchen sink \(I tried cleaning it by boiling vinegar in it and was only able to lift half of it, told him to do the rest\) and a pan with bits of stir\-fry that have become moldy in it. They've been there for months now. I've had to do deep cleanings every couple of weeks because of how filthy the space becomes. We have two full bathrooms. 4 of us use one, and the other guy uses the other. The sink will not drain in his bathroom, it is revoltingly filthy, and it has a horrible odor. I also clean our bathroom.\n\nI spend well over 40 hours a week studying and working. I get to do the majority of it from home, which is nice, but perhaps it makes me more sensitive to things being filthy in the common areas. I've been overlooking all of this and making time to clean up after them, but now one of my roommates is championing the idea of having a sixth person move in with us. \n\nThis sixth person lived with us before and moved out a month after I moved in to move to a cheaper cost of living area. He is also a filthy individual and has been known to eat peoples' food without asking, a behavior that really amps me up because I meticulously plan everything that I want to cook for the week in an effort to spend less time on it and simultaneously be healthy. The software developer and I were vehemently against this, as nobody is performing their household duties and we would not like to deal with the burden of yet another, and made it clear enough, but the other roommate still felt it was okay to go through with telling him yes anyway because we have a spare room and a majority \(note: the people who don't give a shit about the condition of anything in this house\) was okay with it. He even wanted to make a concession for this guy on the rent, and clear out a space that we use for storage so that he could work there \(I've tried getting people on board with helping clear out that space so that we could all use it, but to no avail\) even though we've been doing an even split for nearly a year now.\n\nThis whole thing really rubs me the wrong way and I probably should have made that even clearer. I thought just saying no to the whole thing was enough for it to be called off. I have a friend in the area who is in the same year as me and has the same major \(it's really nice to bond over this!\) and she's looking to live off campus. She asked me if I wanted to leave a few months ago, but I felt just happy enough with how things were, but now that things are being shaken up, I've reached out to her again and we're looking for places. She's currently doing an internship overseas, so it's up to me to find a place that works for both of us, but at least I know that she needs a place even more than I do and is very clean and reasonable.\n\nTL;DR: As ENTJs, do you guys think it'd be worth it for the peace of mind to spend more on rent for a year to live with less people / whose interests align? I'm trying to graduate with the highest grades possible so that I could be an eligible candidate for top grad programs, and am doing pretty damn well at it as it stands now. But it could be done with less stress and I feel that I'd have a good portion of excess time, especially as I take graduate\-level courses this year, if I didn't deal with this nonsense. My rent is dirt cheap right now and my commute is great for the price I pay, but I have an electric bike that gets me around easily to areas that are not as easily accessible, so I feel like the whole area is open to me. And most of the furniture and kitchen appliances here are mine, so it's not like I'd even need to buy anything to make up for what is currently shared.
13	Dude your house needs to be a place to relax and feel at home. Shouldn't feel like another job to come home to. Move out if you dont like it. Messy people tend to stay messy or perhaps even get messier. You'll be spending more money to move out of there but for sure in your best interests. \n\nI had my sister, nephew and her baby dad at my house thankfully they left and I kept the house. Totally transformed the house once they left to my liking and couldn't be any more pleased. You'll definitely benefit just from not having to clean after them. That alone is worth it imo
3	I'd have a talk with the whole house... if everyone can agree on a goal of keeping things clean (you'd have to have a collective definition to what level of cleanliness so there are no miscommunications), then you ask the collective what is a reasonable way to divvy up the work to accomplish this (if you enforce your ideas on them, they may be defensive and they won't buy in).  If you have consensus on how clean the place should be and who does what to keep it clean ("clean your own dishes", "John you clean bathroom #1 every week, I'll clean bathroom #2", etc.) then you setup repercussions for when things are not done.  I would use a ramp-up of repercussions leading up to putting dirty dishes in someone's bed.  Everyone can have a bad day or forget to clean something once in awhile so to jump to the harshest punishment would be unproductive.  Again, if everyone agrees to the same rules, then they should have no problem when dishes end up in their bed.\n\nWith all this said, if the meeting does not go well, then you weigh the cost savings on rent and potentially, slightly lower grades now vs. potential income loss for the rest of your life but slightly higher rent now and you make the call.  You're in charge of reaching your goals.
2	I've had roommates thrice in different places. Has never, ever worked out for me. If your roommates suck, get the hell out of there. People affecting your way of \*being\* extends much more injuriously than simply cost and stress.
2	I feeel for you. I do. I'm going through the *same thing* Why are grown ass adults so freaking *filthy*?!?! I've got a trashcan in the bathroom right now with trash crawling up the wall. What? Why don't I do something about it you ask? *because I've been the one to clean it!* I just moved into this situation in March, so we're just comin' around to 3 months, and I've been the only one cleaning! But... I'm one who buries shit down until it explodes (not sure if that's an ENTJ thing, a Capricorn thing, or just a me thing lol). Thankfully this time, my INTJ bf pointed out that me being passive aggressive and petty won't help the situation. So my solution? Told the landlord/roomie so it's on their radar that I'm buying $50 of stuff to organize the bathroom, there will be an itemized receipt, people are to pay me back, if they don't they have a right not to! But understand I have a right to take extreme offense to it, and deal with them how I see fit moving forward. \n\n\nWoke up to an email addressing all of us. *Everyone* was on board by mid afternoon, people have said they'd get me payment by a specific date.. For any of 'em who think I'll forget? They may find the bathroom now has a lock on it... Mwaaha.. MwaaahahahahaAAAHAHAHAHAHAAHA ok.. Ok.. Calming down! \n\nHonestly, if you have a chance to love into a better situation? Do it! 
2	This is sort of like an ENTJ cycle for me. You're an E so on a friendship level you click in with these people with relative ease, but because you're also a T you recognise the inequality happening here and it really irks you. You bite your tongue because these people are your friends, but you also hold off on cleaning because they should be doing their share. They don't. You get angrier and eventually end up doing even more work because you let it get even worse than you normally do. Because you're an N you're mulling this over and thinking is it always going to be like this? This is a pattern that you just keep seeing happening again and you kind of use the one other reasonable person as an anchor, with your affinity to him and the fact he understands your "big idea" and why a nice environment matters bonding you two and distancing you from the slobs. And the food thing is a final straw because you're a J and you like to have all your ducks in a row, because food is something that punctuates every day and you want it to be simple/affordable and above all THERE.\n\nI can't tell you how much I relate to this story, I've lived in 4 shared accommodations over my academic life and it's been deja vu every time. Mess, being the maid, finding an ally, losing my shit and alienating people I got along with. I really don't think you're in the wrong wanting a clean, organised and enjoyable home environment (though I am biased), but I look at this as it basically boiling down to respect. They don't respect you enough to not be their lackey, and they don't respect themselves enough to take care of their home. I think a big part of being ENTJ is that you just can't comprehend how people can live like this. Another comment said something about how you should rally them up, but when people are this comfortable with being lazy you can't change the tides. This is a personality trait and it will plague them for the rest of their lives and have a negative impact on all their domestic relationships. Get out if you have a chance because they can't take care of themselves and they're dragging you down!\n\nIf you want some actual advice, I'm sure you've already tried it but I had success with either formal or informal rotas. Either something tacked to the wall saying it's this person's turn to do this next or directly targeting one individual and saying "I took the last bin bag out and it's full again/wiped the sides down and they're filthy again, your turn". That creates a pattern that lazy people stomach rather than enjoy, but it mentally takes some of the weight off you.
1	It would seem you have 2 options, stay or leave. I think the current place sounds horrific and It may be beyond repair, so my inclination would be to move.\n\nEven if you move however, the other tenants may change and you might end up with a slob again, it is the nature of renting I am afraid. If you manage to find a nice clean place with other students who are going to be there as long as you, that would probably be ideal.\n\nThe option to stay is what I did when I was in a situation similar to you, I do not think the 4 I lived with sounded as bad as your lot, because people did 'eventually' clean up after themselves I guess. I contacted my landlord and stated "The kitchen was too filthy whenever I went to cook my own meals, and I am not the other tenants parents, it is not my job to clean up after their filth, is it ok if I get my own slow-cooker in my bedroom and just let the others wallow in their own filth in the kitchen?"... \n\nLandlord did not really give a shit about the mess, but said I was fine to keep my own slow cooker in the bedroom, and since I had my own en-suite bathroom with that room, It basically became my own little flat, I ignored the communal areas and only left my room if I was leaving the house :) It was not an ideal situation, but it was one that I regained control with. \n\n(I am also a software developer which made me smile about your other tenant, I wonder if he does the same as I used to do and hermits himself?)
1	My advice would be to do an estimate on the time you spend cleaning + other bullshit that you have to do. Once you've got that number compare it to if you moved and spent more money on rent etc. \n\nWould that be more or less then how much you value your time? \n\nI live in a similar household (3 girls, of which 2 are kinda disgusting) Everytime I want to cook, I've got to clean up the mess from a previous person. Every saturday I do a clean and sweep of the house. \n\nIn all honesty though I've given up on some sections of the house i.e bathroom + living room. Pick your battles. I agree with the sentiment of this thread though. Your home is where you relax and get work done. It's not a place for you to come back to and then do more work (especially other peoples)
0	There is nothing ENTJ about the way you describe how you acted here. You are supposed to lead and get people to act according to your vision. For me personally filthiness in a household is an absolute no-go and I would have full on confronted the individual at the first sight of anything unacceptable. The conversation would have been clear, direct and uncompromising. Get your messagd across, man, this all sounds a bit passive aggressive and you even turn into their bitch by doing all the plumbing. It might already be too late to properly address this, set your boundaries right away so people don't fuck with you. 
6	Which MBTI type scares you the most?	Usually users on MBTI forums consider "ENTJ" "scary" type. But what type is ENTJ afraid of? Is that type the true "scary" type.\n\nEDIT: Scary as in you see the type as a threat to your safety 
28	Any and all feelers. Their world is so different, so simple and impulsive I never know what they’re going to do or how they’ll react. I have to tread so lightly around them. 
12	ENTPs can make formidable lawyers, politicians and journalists. They come out of nowhere with their Ne, can pick the logic apart from an argument in an instant (Ti), and find your emotional weak points with their Fe. They're the one type I have difficulty debating, because they get energised by it, while I get frustrated if it get someone too nitty-gritty or too existential. Luckily I get along with most of them pretty easily. 
17	I don’t fear anything, however I avoid ESFJ/ISFJ at all costs. They are so emotionally triggered 150% of the time if they are unhealthy. It is a waste of my time.
6	>EDIT: Scary as in you see the type as a threat to your safety\n\nNone; people are just people. I only fear actual psychopaths.
8	All the feelers. It's like I can't get through to them because they're so fundamentally different, which makes them alien level of scary. 
2	INTJ's. They're like ENTJ's but usually colder and more calculated. (No offense INTJ peeps) 
2	ISFJ and INFJ, when triggered and under threat they'll go berserk or even go yandere like in anime.
1	What would make an ENTJ Scary? As an ENTJ myself, apperently it's when I lash out and lose my temper when things dont go my way, could it be that?\n\nAs an ENTJ I would fear someone similar to me, basically they'd have just as much capability of screwing me over as I do.
1	None, they're all pussies LOL ;D
6	Hey ENTJs, how do you get through with people slowing you down?	Hi ENTJs! Pnssy Destroyer here \(I think I'm ESTP/ENFP\)\n\nI'm extremely frustrated with my parents who don't want to listen to my needs. They both work so they have little time for me. I'm a college student who wants to improve himself, but is heavily reliant on my parent's money and transportation to get things I want done. I do not have a driver's license, a job, a phone, and I find this severely limiting my potential, esp. since my summer vacation is almost over I am getting frustrated with the wasted time spent doing nothing at home. I also get frustrated when they blame me for doing nothing in the house when I clearly am not allowed to go outside on my own \(they are overprotective\). Additionally, it's as if they use the control they have over me to try and make me do things only they agree with, such as my major which I had to defend over taking. I feel neglected as if they don't believe in me, and I'm asking for your help ENTJs. I know you guys are levelheaded and know how to figure out problems like these. I almost ran away from home because I was frustrated with them controlling/slowing down my life. I don't know what to do ENTJ, please help!\n\nStuff I really want to get done before my summer vacation ends.\n\n1. My driving license\n2. A job\n3. A new phone \(I don't have a phone\)\n4. Get my business running\n\nI got my business set up, the domain running, but I want a job to finance the monthly fee associated and in case it doesn't work out. I've tried sending my resume online, but most jobs require a driver's license which I don't have. I've called the driving school to set up an appointment on the weekends and told my mom to take me there, but I just feel angry at how much I could have gotten this over with earlier if I had full support from them. \n\nPlease help, thanks.
8	With your drive, I'm sure you'll do much in your life, and you also have to take a step back and realise you have to work within your current circumstances as much as you would like them to be different.\n\nYou want to be independent and treated like an adult, so I'm going to give it to you straight:\n\nSounds like a reasonable family situation. And while it's frustrating if you can't work with your parents for what is simple management, good luck trying to work with other people and dealing with much greater stresses as you become more independent.\n\nIf you thought about running away from the frustrations you mentioned then I think you should focus on working on improving yourself, rather than running away from your problems. If you're in an abusive family, sure by all means leave, but sounds like a pretty normal family situation until you're older.\n\nStop wasting your time and making excuses and spend your free time learning something and becoming great at it. You obviously have the Internet, and there's plenty of online courses, or heck, go be the best skater if that's your thing. Do what's WITHIN your control instead of complaining about what's not.\n\nJust because you want to be independent doesn't mean you've EARNED your right to be independent in your parents eyes. Understand their perspective: they most likely worked their ass off to raise you and sacrificed their life decisions, sleep and lifestyle to pay for shit you take for granted. They're probably trying to give you a great upbringing and they likely don't want you to make their mistakes. \n\nI'm not saying you should take their word verbatim but consider they have experience which may valuable and they're likely doing the best that they know how to so you can have a comfortable life.\n\nThere are going to be a lot more things in your life that you don't want to do, but sometimes you have to suck it up and deal with your current situation.\n\nBe patient, do everything you can that's in your control and learn to communicate your frustrations openly while considering the other persons perspective. What is it that you can do to help give them more confidence in you? Can you help give them more free time so they can do things for you? Talk to them, it's the first step in growing up and being independent. Negotiate.\n\nHaving an adult conversation with them about what your frustrations are, what their concerns are and how you can work together will get you a lot further.
3	Some jobs will accept a passport as an alternative to a driver's license, should you happen to have one.\n\nWhile a phone is a near necessity in today's world, it is clear you have a computer or some web access device, you can setup almost any function your phone can do using your web device.\n\nFor other jobs, since you are in University, check for jobs there as well, or job fairs, or anything relevant.\n\n\nGoing through your post history I'm able to confirm most of what I already said. You do have a passport, and your SS card, that is sufficient. \n\nIt appears you have necessary (bare) budgeting skills as well. \n\nFurther analysis indicates mental imbalance and immaturity, so buckle up mother-fucker.\n\nYou've posted on /r/personalfinance and supposedly have a business, so you have a modicum of planning ability - $1k doesn't go far. Frugal may help you as well. \n\nAs far as the phone goes, even smartphones can be had for cheap af now a days, you can get a budget one with a budget plan, easy as fuck. 
8	Excuses.  You’re in college?!  Ride a bike to the DMV and take the test to get your license.  Hire an uber/cab.  Don’t have money, cut your neighbors grass.\n\nI’m hearing a lot of excuses and very little you’re actually doing to remedy the situation.
3	If I were in your position, most likely I would openly and freely express my grievances with my parents ***to my parents***. That is, I would let them know unequivocally that they were hindering my growth. And I would repeatedly and incessantly remind them of their poor parenting skills until they reformed their practices. \n\nTo answer your question on a broader, more primitive level (if you will), when I feel like someone is slowing me down, I most often assume as much responsibility as possible vis-à-vis whatever project is at hand, while simultaneously taking credit for as much of the work I've done as possible and making it as clear as possible to whomever may be paying attention that the other person(s) involved neglected their responsibilities. \n\nI'll let you interpret what I've just written and apply it to your current circumstances as you see fit. I will say, though, that the theme of this attitude is to aggressively do whatever you can to reach your goals. Perhaps that involves taking out loans from your friends or sleeping at their houses when necessary or carrying out plans to get your driver's license behind your parents' back or cutting them out for long periods of time, *etc. etc. etc.* until they fully grasp that you're an enterprising person who is going to reach for your goals with or without them. At that point, most likely they will realize the only way to keep you close to them is to support your endeavors, and consequently they will begin to support your endeavors. When this precipitates, you should celebrate your victory. 
2	If your question is how to deal with people being in your way in terms of the trajectory of your life, that’s easy. Just keep pushing towards your goal. That’s it. The truth is that it’s far more likely that it’s you standing in your own way than it is someone else. \n\nNow, if it is someone else, or the situation you described above, that’s a call for concern. If you’re an adult, which i suspect you are considering you’re in college, and your parents “won’t let you go outside alone”, that’s an extremely toxic situation. Under no circumstance should you allow anyone to take away your agency like that. Dependency or not, if your parents “won’t let you leave the house”, you need to step up, put your foot down, and get the fuck outta the house. \n\nUnless this is some kind of hostage situation, I call bullshit. I think you’re using your dependency on your parents and their protection as an excuse to not become an adult. The statement “they won’t let me” is the tell. You’re not taking control of your life and that’s why you’re so down and out. 
2	I been there. It is nearly impossible to understand the freedom and what you are capable of while you are stuck in such a life. I'll bet you do not get into trouble, do what you are told, do things the way others think they should be done etc.\n\nYou can not have what you want out of life when you are sacrificing exactly that to appease your parents. You are squandering your youth and I promise you that you will regret it sooner than you can imagine.\n\nYou need to stop waiting on your parents support and go get it on your own. Throw your weight around, step on a few toes; don't let anyone get in the way of you getting what you want.\n\nWhat you really want before summer vacation ends (and stop calling it summer vacation. That insinuates someone else is telling you what to do with your time) is\n1. Freedom\n2. Resources to use that freedom and just be out of the house\n3. Networking, making friends and being able to readily communicate with them on your own terms. Can you imagine being on the phone talking about how you are gonna wax dat ass tonight with your parents in the room? Fuck that. Although given the situation it could be really amusing.\n4. Independence where you stand on your own two feet and don't ask permission or take shit from anybody.\n\nIf you want to be a boss you have to make boss moves doing boss shit. Have faith in yourself, trust yourself, allow yourself to fuck some shit up. Make an example of shit to show everyone exactly how you are gonna fuck their shit up if they don't come correct around you. Believe it or not; not listening will take your farther than listening and obeying and shit.\n\nClear your own path through life and let people follow in your foot steps.
1	Have you told them how you feel? Tell them at dinner or something how much this is all impacting you and make them know how much you want to get this shit done. \n\nAsk if they can help with getting you a job or driving lessons, ask if you can work around thr house for pocket money or something, if they don't know how you feel then they aren't gonna do anything. \n\nIf that doesn't work out then maybe pull your business and allow yourself to save up money before you go spending money you don't have.\n\nYou might have to tough it out until you can get a job and pay for your own lessons to get a license.
1	I'm actually amazed that you don't have a phone. That's crazy, how do you contact people? And if you can't keep in contact with people, how do you ever get anything done, much less get a business running?!\n\nGet a damn phone. And I haven't seen much of people slowing you down, just you and your parents being terrible at communication.
5	My guide on making action plans for goals	[See my original comment here](https://www.reddit.com/r/entj/comments/8mzb2d/how_do_you_plan_your_goals_and_put_yourself_first/dzsbc22/?context=3)\n\nCredit for this method goes to Bryan Tracy. If you want to learn more about the method, I highly recommend his book:\n\n[GOALS!: How to Get Everything You Want: Faster Than You Ever Though Possible ](https://smile.amazon.com/Goals-Everything-Faster-Thought-Possible-ebook/dp/B00F9FLDAC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1527696219&sr=8-1&keywords=bryan+tracy+goals)\n\nFirst, realize that you need to build your goals around what drives you, not the other way around. Everyone *would like* to be a successful millionaire, fewer actually *want to be.* You need motivation to achieve your goals and it is almost impossible to create motivation artificially.\n\nOnce you have chosen the right goal, the planning process is fairly straightforward. First, get a pen and paper and write out 20 steps you can take to accomplish your goal. Next, categorize these items by importance \(A\-C\).\n\nFor example, let's say my goal is to find a girlfriend. Relationships are complicated, so we can probably find 20 steps fairly easily:\n\n1. Reach a goal weight\n2. Improve personal hygiene\n3. Improve wardrobe\n4. Read a book on relationships\n5. Sign up for a dating site\n6. Expose myself to more women on a more frequent basis\n7. Boost my confidence\n8. Pick up an interesting skill\n9. Improve my communication skills\n10. Go on a date\n11. Figure out what I want in a relationship\n12. Take a quality photo for online dating\n13. Get a job \(or a better one than I have now\)\n14. Reduce my social anxiety\n15. Approach a woman for her number\n16. Build a good sense of humor\n17. Improve Emotional Intelligence\n18. Smile more\n19. Address everyone by first name\n20. Hold eye contact with everyone\n\nOn this list, your first 10 items will come easier than the second 10. Regardless of the goal you set for yourself, writing out 20 possible steps is a valuable mental exercise and can yield creative results.\n\nNext, let's categorize these items by importance. This doesn't have to be exact, but use this exercise to determine which of these steps would have the largest impact on your goal.\n\n1. **A:** Reach a goal weight\n2. **A:** Improve personal hygiene\n3. **A:** Improve wardrobe\n4. **C:** Read a book on relationships\n5. **A:** Sign up for a dating site\n6. **A:** Expose myself to more women on a more frequent basis\n7. **A:** Boost my confidence\n8. **C:** Pick up an interesting skill\n9. **B:** Improve my communication skills\n10. **A:** Go on a date\n11. **B:** Figure out what I want in a relationship\n12. **B:** Take a quality photo for online dating\n13. **B:** Get a job \(or a better one than I have now\)\n14. **B:** Reduce my social anxiety\n15. **B:** Approach a woman for her number\n16. **C:** Build a good sense of humor\n17. **C:** Improve Emotional Intelligence\n18. **B:** Smile more\n19. **C:** Address everyone by first name\n20. **C:** Hold eye contact with everyone\n\nYou now need to focus solely on the items that have the biggest impact on your goal. \(You might disagree with the above, but that's besides the point\). Number these starting at 1 to however many A items you have marked.\n\n1. **A2:** Reach a goal weight\n2. **A1:** Improve personal hygiene\n3. **A3:** Improve wardrobe\n4. **A6:** Sign up for a dating site\n5. **A7:** Expose myself to more women on a more frequent basis\n6. **A4:** Boost my confidence\n7. **A5:** Go on a date\n\nAnd reorganize:\n\n1. **A1:** Improve personal hygiene\n2. **A2:** Reach a goal weight\n3. **A3:** Improve wardrobe\n4. **A4:** Boost my confidence\n5. **A5:** Go on a date\n6. **A6:** Sign up for a dating site\n7. **A7:** Expose myself to more women on a more frequent basis\n\nThe current A1 is now either a "ToDo" or a "Goal". If it's a ToDo, put that item on your calendar IMMEDIATELY. If it's a goal, repeat the above steps again and think of as many actions you can take to accomplish it. Repeat the process until you've arrived at a series of ToDo items you can mark on your calendar and get busy. \n\n\(To clarify: "Improve personal hygiene" is too vague to be a ToDo. Like I said, repeat the above process for this A1 to find action steps to accomplish.\)
3	Just cried uncle at 2.
1	Good for you, buddy
1	What is your algorithm for cleaning a bathroom?\n\nThis is why ENTPs are more fun to date. They don't have a plan for the most part. They are just living life. They fuck up along the way, but they are alive, not robots.\n\n> C: Build a good sense of humor\n\nI hope you can. Imagine you score a date, you go on a date.\n\nNow you need to talk with the said girl about something. About what? About your 20-point plan on how to get better at getting better at life?\n\nJesus Christ!\n\nBrowny points for picking up an interesting skill and improving sense of humor, but why force it? Why not watch comics because you enjoy comedy, not because you gave yourself a C- in this area and you are trying to score a chick fast. Because you read a book 0 to 1 chicks in less than 21 days.\n\nWhat kind of chick will you end up with? Someone who does not mind dating a tractor or an elevator.\n
1	problems with ym entj dad	my dad is realy narcissistic.any problem he has he projects it onto me.and when ever i hit a crisses then its becauise i wasnt listening to my dad.even if my dad does wrong to me.its always backed up by a valid reason,no matter how wrong he wrongs me....anyways entjs i know are not narccisistic.but percentage wise they contain the most narccisists by survey.......anyways i just dont understand how to get to him..as an entj...hes always working telling me to get up and do things arounf the house.clean the yard.ect....
5	First: There is no real pleasing a narcissist.\nYou can try to put your head down and get along, however, until you leave home, which I highly recommend.\n\nTraits he likely values: hard work, structure, attention to detail, productivity, visible progress. \nI would advise doing those things to avoid conflict, put on a happy face, make your own way.\n\nThen: do some reading on narcissism and some therapy to make sure you don’t end up in a relationship with one. It’s easier than you realize, as they won’t present at first the way you remember your narcissistic parent. You’ve been groomed to deal with their traits, so don’t let yourself fall into that trap.
5	Have you checked out r/raisedbynarcissists? 
2	Same problem. My dad was also quite emotionally abusive while I was growing up because of his PTSD and own depression. I think a few things to realize is that your dad is who he is— and as one gets older, it’s usually harder to change, so he might not want to change at all. There’s a possibility that he never will... \n\nSo if I were you, I would not expect a full 180, but maybe more like a 30-45 degree change? Lol. Anyway, if he’s an ENTJ and also a narcissist, then he’ll ALWAYS think he’s right, and because he’s got age, experience and the title of “Dad” over you, everything he says (to him) will be right.  \n\nSo if he comes down on you next time, you have to be prepared to stand your ground. Do not cry or get emotional. He sees that as weak, and won’t bother to hear you out. Stand your ground as you explain in short but concise details why you chose to do what you did that went against his wishes. This can go one of two ways: he will respect you and try to understand you if he thinks your reasoning is good enough, or he will see this as blatant disrespect and hate you. This has nothing to do with you, of course. This is just how his brain is wired to receive criticism.\n\nAll I can say is, we don’t have to get along with our family members just because they are our family. However, we can tolerate them until we move out of their homes and never have to deal with them again on the daily (except at the occasional holiday gathering) lol.

8	ENTJ x INFJ	I'm a male ENTJ in a relationship with an female INFJ. I was just wondering if anyone here can share any experience or knowledge regarding this pairing. Thanks.
6	I've been with my INFJ lady for over 2.5 years now. The insight into peoples' emotions is incredible. She seems like a psychic at times because she reads my thoughts like an article headline. \n\nYou cant win in the feelings dept with them, they will uncover your feelings effortlessly and then expose them to you before you're ever even aware you felt that way. This may sound like manipulation, but in my case its pure intuition. \n\nThey care for you deeply, but when their own feelings burst though uncontrolled they need you to be there in a supportive and empathetic way, not to solve the problem. Thats the hardest thing for me. To stay focused on feeeeellingssss instead of fixing her (trying to fix only makes things worse). \n\nLove her, don't manage your INFJ. Read a few books on how to do so if that doesn't make sense. It didnt to me at first. 
5	You could start, I always get "INFJ is your perfect partner" on those stupid small mbti quizzes. :D
5	My wife of 6 years who’s also my kid’s mother is an INFJ ;-)
5	I’m happy to read all the positive comments about the pairing. I’m an INFJ female and unfortunately my ENTJ boyfriend at the time was the most controlling, manipulative, and emotionally toxic relationship I was ever a part of. It seems that the ENTJ’s in this thread are putting in the time and energy to understand and notice qualities of each type ENTJ and INFJ (and there are so many!). Seeing this makes me so happy. I’m certain the the right balance of each type coupled with respect can lead to a beautiful and powerful partnership. My fundamental advice, end the relationship if you are not willing to put in the energy.
3	In a pretty early relationship with an infj as well, looking for feedback on your experience!
3	I dated an INFJ for a little over two years. It obviously depends on the person and this doesn't go for everyone, but the T/F balance was bittersweet and the crux of the relationship; I was there to be rational for her when she needed it and she was more emotionally in-tune to help me embrace certain things instead of being so binary. That's my biggest takeaway from the personality aspect of it; the rest is not worth divulging into.
1	I don't think it's a great match "naturally"  \nINFJs are caring and sensitive, whilst ENTJs are controlling and insensitive, you may try to be more caring in a relationship due to your upsurging hormones, but eventually if the principles are different, you two will not stick too much, and as they say: "**Opposites attract, but never stick too long**"  \n
1	I’ve been with my wife for over 5 years now, it’s been amazing. We fill each other’s weaknesses, for example I try to fix everything and she gets the feelings department. You can’t fix everything and by being there for your lady it’ll work wonders, we unfortunately do not see feelings the same way, but it’s useful and beneficial having someone with a big heart, they also have some intuitive feelings about people and their intentions (crazy but accurate).
7	ENTJ's and Parenthood	ENTJ parents: what have been your experiences with parenting, did you know you wanted kids for a long time before you had them or were you a fencesitter? How has being an ENTJ effected your parenting style? If you have a SO how have they helped with parental duties that maybe you are lacking in?\n\nI often go between wanting kids and not wanting them and wanted to get some perspective from other ENTJs on their experiences.
24	I never wanted kids, but every instance of sex is a roll of the dice and as man the trip to parenthood is something that leaves my hands after a certain point. That said, regardless of my intentions (or lack thereof) to become a parent I have a responsibility to my son so I stepped up to the plate. I love my son and wouldn't take it back, but I've since gotten a vasectomy to ensure that's the end of that. Frankly I wouldn't recommend parenthood to anyone unless it's something they very specifically want - if you're a fence-sitter I assure you that parenthood is harder and more costly than you think it will be. It will stunt your social life, your educational progress, and your career trajectory. Childcare is on par with rent in terms of price. On the upside you get a lifetime project of building a little human, teaching them all the lessons you've learned, and hopefully setting them up to surpass you.\n\nMy parenting style is best described as "first among equals" in that I don't talk down to my son. I'm the authority figure in the house and what I say goes, but if he's got thoughts to express on things around the house I'm always willing to listen. If he wants to know why things are the way they are, I'll gladly tell him. If I can't explain my decisions they must be not be very solid ones, or at least that's the approach I've taken. A key thing on this topic is that I'll explain my thought process to him but I won't dumb it down so a lot of the time (especially when he was younger) he wouldn't understand my answer but he'd understand that I had one - there was never any "because I'm your dad and I say so" bullshit with me. Now he's turning 10 in about a month and, whether by genetic luck or my parenting style, he's a brilliant young man who's been included in the gifted program for his school district. He's inquisitive, interested in science and politics, and an avid reader. Children are smarter and more capable than anyone gives them credit for - set the bar a bit higher than you think they can manage and they'll surprise you by hitting it 9 times out of 10. \n\nMy biggest failure is probably in empathy. I've always tried to express to him that emotions are a healthy part of humanity, and I've never bought into the "boys don't cry" repressive crap, but I know that empathy doesn't come naturally to me and my general instinct is to tell people to quit complaining and toughen up because blubbering isn't going to solve your problems. In the past year or two I've been putting concerted effort into balancing the firmness required to mold him into a strong man with the compassion I'll need to show him to ensure he'll feel safe coming to me with his difficulties of teenage years once he gets there.

3	I knew I wanted children in an *abstract* manner, until I met my (now)exhusband, and the desire to become a mother became basically primal. It’s odd to even think about it that way now... I approached parenthood in the way I approach most things: doing it the way I see as best and always with a solid rationale for each choice. From the outset, I created structure in order to have everyone’s needs met in a balanced fashion and I encourage my children just to be the best “them” they can be. My standards are high, but I try to make it abundantly clear that nothing can ever change my love for them, and that the most important things in life are love and respect. I let them know that I make mistakes too, I have weaknesses, and I ask for forgiveness when I am wrong. I want them to see that perfection and people pleasing are not desirable traits. I welcome questions, I always explain my reasoning, and I make sure they get solid experiences for fun and learning. I make it a priority to give them my attention when we are together, and I love them even when they are acting like little aholes, because everyone acts like an ahole at times ;) 
3	I've always expected to have children, but it's never been the right time. When I was younger I wanted to live my life, now I want to focus on my career and my partner probably doesn't want children. I can see myself as an older mother, or foster parent if I don't have my own kids. I love children, but with a delinquent brother 14 years my junior and six nieces and nephews I can see that it would be truly challenging. 
2	Childfree by choice here.  To me it's all about goals... if you have a goal to have a child great, reaching goals is something ENTJ's excel at and defines us. If it's not part of your long term goals, but something you're willing to compromise to achieve another goal (perhaps a long term relationship), be very careful as that's a lifelong trade off and I'd never want to resent a child I brought into this world.  I went through many GFs who wanted kids and I sat on the fence.  Ultimately I passed and had a vasectomy and it was the best decision for ~me~.  Strange how things work out, but like-minded people (childfree by choice) eventually come out of the woodwork, it just make take time and it's hard to keep up your spirits in the short term.  Anyway, children are not bad, they just didn't fit into my goals and after a pros/cons eval, it just seemed like a whole lot to give up to reach other long term goals.
5	Working while people is around	Anyone else with the same problem? It's impossible to work and concentrate while friends are aroud. For me it's because it's both distracting and social interaction can take place. When I don't work I start feeling bad even if I enjoy talking instead.
3	Yes, which is why I work alone, and after midnight. Those are my most productive hours. 
1	How do you work?
1	No, I'm able to work with a lot of people around. If they're talking and it's distracting, I will directly tell them I need to focus on what I'm working on. I tend to do my best work when I'm working with friends.

9	ExFJs suck	What type\(s\) can you not stand?
12	[deleted]
13	How is everyone so confident about knowing other people’s types?
9	Lovely, but manipulative
3	Just saying, there's nothing that I find out about them that surprises me... They spend more energy being upset about a problem than solving it... And the problem is something which they brought down on themselves. They're just exhausting to be with. (Obviously, this is about ESFJs)
3	There isn’t a MBTI type/group I do not like. In my private life I think about MBTI only to understand my strengths/weaknesses, and to better understand others.\n\nIn real life, I don’t use MBTI to filter people. I prefer to see them as they are, revealing themselves in their own timing.\n\nThere’s are only three people in my life that I specifically don’t like, but I don’t hate them. I figured if I tried numerous times (let’s just say more than 50 times) in trying to meet them on their terms, approach or communicate by their preference, and accommodate more than usual what is comfortable for me— then I’ve done my best in trying to keep this person happy. I probably waste too much time and energy than what it’s worth because that person still says and feels the same way about you after all that. Just proves to myself, sometimes it’s hard to be friends or get along with others. I can still recognize their value and skills, treating them with common decency. I don’t have to be disrespectful, talk shit about them behind their back, and I don’t need to respond back in the same measure of their aggression. \n\nThe people I struggle to get along are people who never can openly admit their faults, gossip about people, give others hell for those people’s weaknesses in things they have tremendous strengths in, people who believe their superior to others, self-entitled, compulsive liars, and those who do not respect boundaries. I can be tolerating of people when they are not on the extreme end and they try to be self-controlled when they remember. Any others I could have potentially disliked, I didn’t know well enough or have the opportunity to, so I just accept as a neutral memories in passing.  Maybe it was a bad time in their life or they did not have the frame of mind to see how they could have handled some things. \n\nPeople are not perfect. No one is at their 100% best all the time. No one can mold themselves to being compatible or loved by someone. Flaws are part of the package deal.

4	Help! Major career decision	I have to decide whether to stay in a beurocratic slow paced defense industry job or a job at space X. The problem is that the space x job is in the middle of  nowhere Texas and I am a city man.\n\nNote: I would not want to settle in the Texas area, but I can use the experience as a stepping stone. Just not sure if the relocation is outweighed by the experience value. I am already in a fortune 500 company, just wondering if the space x job will make me stand out in job openings and applications. 
8	I struggle with an ENTJ asking this question. 
3	Life's too short, and ENTJs love a challenge. I would take the Space X job - worst case scenario you decide to move on and you still getting bragging rights that you worked there! Just my two cents. I understand it might be a big upheaval for you though.
3	Fuck bureaucratic nothingness. Take the leap. Go to Space X.  Cmon man. Next slide. 
2	Do it! Challenges and adventures are what make us ENTJs feel alive. \n\nPlus there’s very little downside. You’ll likely learn a lot, and you can always go back to some slow pace job afterwards.\n\nLife begins outside your comfort zone.
2	It's spaceX man, who cares where it's based? Your CV will be unlike any other. Btw can you get me in?
2	Go for it. 
1	From your previous posts it sounds like you are underappreciated in your current role. I say jump ship.

1	That’s a lousy excuse. There are interesting people no matter where you go. And if not, you’ll be able to focus more on work. \n\nNo in terms of things to do.. you might be shit out of luck there
1	Take the Space X job. It's Space X man, smash it! I'm sure there are loads of people at Space X used to city living. My guess is that it's almost like a little Campus.
1	Jump to SpaceX and commit to staying at least two years. The location doesn't really matter because you'll be working all the time.
0	Are you sure you can handle working for space X? They only take the best of the best. 
0	entjs and ni	hey im always curious about ni and the subconsious i have a question.when ever i wake up in the monring i always have the solution to a problem.when i drink or smoke weed,sometimes my consious mind takes a break and i see things from new angles that i never saw before could this be a bit of ni?..note im an infp and ni is my 6th function............
5	Sounds like alcohol caused you some quick, impulsive thinking. Ni doesn't require alcohol. Alcohol doesn't necessarily catalyze the use of Ni. You could describe further
6	At what point in a relationship do you know you love your partner?	For years I convinced myself that you know you love your SO after you make it through your biggest first fight and allow that to make the relationship stronger rather than tear it apart. \n\nI'm 4 weeks into my current relationship. I'm not the type to fight or argue in a romantic relationship because if I'm genuinely hurt I become silent instead. We've had "fights" (meaning he became sensitive and emotional and shouted at me and I retreated into my mind) from the first week of being together. I didn't expect that. Now I don't know how/when it'll be appropriate to know or admit to myself that I love him. Because now I feel very, very strongly for him but I think it's too early to name this feeling love.

4	I think this sub is going to be full of people who have a difficult time deciphering their emotions unless they’ve put effort into learning how.\n\nNot that you won’t get some confident answers.\n\nI also think that love is too abstract and gray to decide “bam, that’s when it’s love.”  Maybe you’re trying too hard to define it. Maybe you should try being comfortable with lack of absolutes.\n\nThen again, I’m not you; I’m a dude on the internet.\n\nFood for thought. Good luck.
2	When you start being both excited about doing stuff from the shadiest part of your adult internet history.
1	When I am willing to put my needs aside for his, not out of fear or otherwise losing the relationship, but because his needs matter that much to me.

0	Dating advice needed for an ENTJ Male. When, How, Who?	Who I am : \n22 years old, 1 minor in international politic, did a stage at the united nation, another in haiti, realised how corrupted international institution were, decided to change study for financial statistic.\n\nCurrently completed 1 session in, and going toward my next session.\nI study about 40 hours a week (class included), I work 8h/week during my session and 40h/week during the summer.\n\nMy main hobby is writting (currently writting a 400 pages novel). I write 2-3h every days for an average of 18h a week.\n\nI also do martial art (black belt Karaty, green belt tek wondo, recently started kendo). (about 2 hours a week).\n\nSo in my weeks, I've got an average of 60h already schedule every weeks.\n\nI don't have much time for dating (I barely see my friends once every month).\n\nLIST OF QUESTION :\n\nWhen should I start consecrating time to dating? I know women like social status a lot (based from statistical study), so I'm thinking I should wait until I'm like 25 and have at least a book published + a job in a bank. (is it wrong and if it is, why?)\n\nHow am I suppose to date effectivaly? Encounter website seems like cash grab, I don't like to go to party without a purpose (feels like a waste of my time).\n\nWhos should I date?\nThis will sound confused, but here it goes : I know I want to have sexe with girls only, BUT to me sexe is not a casual thing. I want to do it with the girl I'll love and only her. (I'd rather jirk off from porn than have one night with girl I find attractive, but don't like).\nI know I would like to have intelligent discussion with girl, but I happen to have an IQ of 141 and up to this day, every single encounter I've had with girl, I am a fucking teacher and I don't want that for my partner.\nI want a meaningfull relationship, but I really don't know what I would want from a girl aside from sexe which annoys me since I don't want to have sexe with more than one girl. I want it to be a special thing. \nWhich kind of girl could match with an ENTJ like me and why?

3	Your post is sweet. It made me smile. :)\n\nI’m getting the impression the relationship you get in anytime soon, you want to be real and hopefully find a life long partner. It sounds like this surrounds your desire for a “special” woman in your life and you would like to have time outside of your passions and work to build the chemistry. \n\nThe man I first dated, I accidentally fell in love with a man who was younger simply because he was sweet, gentle, respectful, worked hard, and I loved our intellectual conversations. I fell in love with him when both of us had no money and had student loans. The truth is, I almost moved on to the next man after a few months of dating. I thought he didn’t have the deep feelings and connection I desired. He left me a voicemail professing how much he loved me and couldn’t stand another man touching me.  He was crying on the phone, knowing I was seeing another man. I left the other guy, and came back to him. I realized his love was deep, even though it was hard for me to tell. \n\nI would wait on dating until you have time to be physically available for face to face dating. \nDating apps work well for the most part. More so for men than women. Women have to put up with guys who just want hook-ups. I think dating apps work well because it expands your reach, and even if it feels superficial initially it has high potential to find women you have a connection with.\n\nWomen do consider men’s career especially the in consideration of settling down, but I would say it’s a smaller part of the larger whole for most. You can be the most prepared man for a wife and children, but women still care about the love and value in the relationship. \n\nYou seem like a man many women would be happy to be with because you’re so thoughtful and considerate. And not interested in just hooking up. \n\n
1	Richard Feynman's IQ was measured to be at about 121.\n\nHoly fn shit what a genius you are!\n\nOr maybe not; maybe you are just good at taking tests.\n\nA friend of mine worked with a Mensa member once. Dude was an insufferable prick and the worst part is that he did not contribute almost anything. He would have been better off not joining that club; I seriously mean that.\n
4	Best MBTI book?	I'm pretty confident that I'm an ENTJ.  But I would like to self-educate on the other types.  What book(s) would you recommend to learn about all the types?  Something relatively quick, efficient and informative.  
1	Not a book, but this will jump you from cursory understanding to enthusiast real quick:\nhttp://www.wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=Wikisocion_home
2	PLEASE UNDERSTAND ME is a great first read. Primarily the product of an INTP, with an INTJ co-author making the contents less opaque and more concise.\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Please-Understand-Me-Character-Temperament/dp/0960695400 \n\n
0	Finding drive	When I look at famous people like Gary Vaynerchuk, Warren Buffet, Avicii, Steve Jobs and other people I allways admire how they can work so much and keep going consistently, mostly when I've watched a video about any of them I get motivated to work for a short period of time and then go back to being lazy (maybe not lazy but I do not work as much as I want) . This feels really bad when it happends because I want to be able to have the same ability being able to work without procrastinating (and not depending on motivation videos on youtube).\n\nAny of you guys that have managed to develop a habit to keep going and never stop? In that case do you have any tips? How did you manage to reach that state?
3	I figured that out very recently. The idea is to connect everything to you and your goals, find out how a single step you can do today gets into the big picture.\n\nFound myself at a job I didn't like and that wasn't offering any perspectives. After a few days of pessimism, I figured out that I could use this span to improve technical skills (programming mostly), overdeliver on my position (basically, automate some tasks and make my manager's life easier) and get a dithyrambic recommandation letter at the end. Now I am driven to go to a job I absolutely don't enjoy!
3	I’ve been like a racehorse that breaks late. A bit listless early on, I’ve been piling it up later in life. Trick is, much like off-roading, you can’t get stuck if you don’t stop moving.\n\nThat being said, there’s a time to rest and “sharpen the saw” a bit. It’s as important as the always on the go. The hard part is to learn which is need and which you’re doing...
2	I think sleeping is a waste of time. I wish I had more hours in a day. You have to be invested in what you're doing, so much so that surfing the net, youtube, tv, movies, sports is all secondary. I'm either listening to audiobooks in the gym, learning something new on udemy, or working on myself. Exercise is like brushing my teeth. It hurts, it's freaking cold in the morning, but how much do I enjoy not hating my body. I don't want to go back to be being overweight. Never again. 
1	Indeed, I have.\n\nThe secret is to never leave the couch.
0	How do I trigger active Se?	I try to just jump into something, but my Si kicks in like an emergency break, stopping me from jumping into it. It seems any time I try to "just do it", my Si kicks into gear. I'll become conservative, easing myself into it or never doing it at all.\n\nI can use passive Se just fine, but when it comes to active Se, what trick is there to triggering it? How do I enter a state of active Se without my Si getting in the way?\n\nI'm an INTP by the way.
2	Why are you posting on ENTJ sub? They are not Se oriented were they?. Si and Fe is what you've got as an INTP. In my case, working out or trekking/climbing in nature worked. But not in sloppy way, i put at least 3~5 hours when I do it. When I had time for that I worked out everyday. After 2~3 months of training, I felt strong of myself. I couldnt bare to stay feet on the ground. I needed clean every mess in house, had to go out, read at the library, meet people to thraw out my theories, learn other activities and cook healthy etc. INTP third traid is Si and to enhance this, i think weve gotta earn servival extinct by somewhat hard training and maybe some fast / diet. Truely it changes a life. It was too hard core so i needed to stop at some point though, yould get what im saying when you made it.
9	Anyone else ever had worries about an INFJ (F) friend?	She is beginning to annoy me. I don't have patience with her emotional volatility and constantly misperceptions about what I am thinking.  \n\nAny advice?
17	Sometimes I feel like people think identifying as entj is an excuse to be a dick. \n\nYeah so she's beginning to annoy you. Handle it like an adult - either talk to her, support her, or try to understand her. Ideally at least 2 of the 3.\n\nThis problem really has nothing to do with you being entj. Yes, she may annoy you because you are entj. But everyone has interpersonal problems and everyone is responsible for handling them maturely. 
9	INFJ’s are extremely good at detecting insincerity and ENTJ’s are known to use different styles to fit in with different groups - which can come off as insincere to said INFJ.  If you communicate honestly with them (as in really honest, displaying your feelings) then eventually they’ll get past the chameleon abilities and may even come around to admiring the ability to fit in with a myriad of social groups.\n\nI’m strictly speaking from experience, the books might have different solutions for you.  \n\nSource:  married an INFJ
8	Talk less, more precise. \n\nAvoid jugdement and opinions. Talk about facts. Listen more.\n\n\n\n
2	[Worth a read](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/content.php/78-Supervision-relations)
1	I have two INFJ friends, both are female. I don't know your situation but ironically this is actually the reason why I find their company so valuable. I can say exactly what I want and how I want to, and I don't run into the -SFJ brick wall of "yes but it's *so weird* not to be doing it *this* way", or whatever. I'll concede that the dynamic is very prone to misperception on their end, but I'll take that trade 99/100 times. Way easier for me to just be more direct, more honest and leave less up for interpretation than putting up with being blatantly misunderstood. 
6	How to comfort those around you?	I am a high school student and, recently, my teacher found himself in a rough spot. He has always wanted to be a school admin but has been rejected for the third time this year. I want to tell him to not give up and to keep trying, but I’m not sure how to do so. \n\nThis leads into a bigger problem that I feel I face: Whenever my friends are suffering from some sort of setback, I don’t know how to comfort them. Believe me, I care, but I’m just unable to express those feelings in ways that a normal person would..? \n\nI once saw one of my friends crying because she was struggling to understand a math concept before school, and I remember being like a deer in headlights and almost running away from her (horrible, I know...but at least my math teacher was there!). \n\n\nHow do I counsel someone without feeling super weird and uncomfortable inside? 
5	Above everything, if you manage to make them confortable around you, let them speak for as long as they can do that they are able to get all of their feelings out with someone. This is not to say that you should shut up, simply let them speak and give them a bit of advice now and then. It'll help.
6	How do I regain productivity after a night out?	Say you went out and had fun until 4:00 AM.\n\nYou slept until 2:00 PM next day.\n\nAt night, you cannot sleep because you slept during the day.\n\nYou need sleep to be productive next day.\n\nWhat is the best way to get out of this situation and regain productivity?\n\nI know it is best to not get in this situation in the first place but you know sometimes it happens.
15	You stop staying out so late\- and if it does happen, you do not sleep during the day, you get up at your normal time, like normal.
7	I abused caffeine to get through the day, then worked out until I was exhausted so that I could go to bed early. I also sometimes take a sleep aid to reset my biological clock.
3	Melatonin.
3	Getting to wake up earlier is a difficult process, requires patience and discipline, and a bit of sacrifice as you're going to be tired a few days straight.  \n\nNo miracles, go to bed earlier and set an alarm each day a bit earlier than the day before, commit to wake up even if you haven't got enough sleep (though you shouldn't sleep less than 5-6 hours).  \nOn daytime, get at least 15 minutes of daylight (direct exposition, not behind a window), preferably in the morning. Walking is perfect.  \n\nThe daylight/exercise combo will better your mood and lucidity, the productivity gain it generates will make up for the productivity you lost by sleeping less for these few days.\n\nIf on a tight schedule (today for tomorrow), definitely go walk for at least 30 minutes, avoid every source of caffeine, and cut every light source one hour before your desired time to go to sleep.
2	You tire yourself out. Or if that doesn’t work, I would aim on sleeping an hour early every night, and eventually you would be able to sleep at the time you originally wanted. 
1	Listening to this song will help you get in the proper mindset [https://streamable.com/fvo5q](https://streamable.com/fvo5q)
1	Sleep dude. You can push yourself and focus, but you can't just go trade some magic beans for productivity. You can train yourself to focus, but only so much.\n\n
1	I suck it up if I need to. I worked a whole day without sleep after a night out once.

6	ENTJ's, how important is power for you?	and do you feel any relationship to notions like authenticity, personal expression or solidarity?\n\nreason: I'm ENFP, went to architecture school which is completely ENTJ dominated and I noticed that literally EVERYTHING was made into a battle of power (or knowledge, essentialy the same) and that you guys actually seemed to thrive on it\ne.g. bragging about the ridiculous amount of workload/deadlines/all-nighters that you would have in the coming half year without a single day off.
27	Power is a means to an end. It’s useful when it is and isn’t when it isn’t.
15	Power allows me to reach my goals uninhibited. I'm not really interested in power for it's own sake, or as an ego boost.\n\nI prefer the term genuine, everyone is entitled to personal expression, but I am not obliged to value it. I don't generally extend solidarity to people that I'm in direct competition with for grades/jobs/favour. I feel solidarity for broader groups, like people who have been marginalised, or faced overwhelming adversity. \n\nPersonally, I'm all about the struggle. Things that are easy to obtain without sacrifice and hard work are rarely worth much, and I like feeling like I'm at the edge of my human capacity. Whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger.\n\n
7	If power means control, efficency then yes, its important for me. \n\nI like being in control of everything. Knowing and having impact on every little thing in process. Including delegating duties. 
6	I would've thought architecture school would be more like ISTJ types?\n\nI personally don't care about power. Sure, it's nicer to have power/status as in it gives you more options and freedom to achieve your goals, but I'm not obsessed with the pursuit of it, for the sake of dominating other people like so many other guys my age. I don't believe that I'm so special that naturally other people are beneath me and should listen to me. But having said that, I do think I have better sense than most people as in seeing the big picture, contextually and relationally so I can implement steps. I prefer to work together and empower others, so that everyone can become the best version of themselves. We all have differing strengths and relative advantages.\n\nTo me, I look for the rare personality combination of complete authenticity, calmness and non-judmentality so that we can have full personal expression and solidarity. But I've only ever met 5-10 people like myself and I do a very competitive course at a top university.
3	I’m an ENTJ in architecture school and can confirm that it’s definitely a competitive environment. It’s all kind of a game tbh, or at least that’s how it feels to me. Architecture may not be the best gauge of psychic inclinations in general; it’s kind of a weird bubble. There is definitely utility value in being the best in architecture, because ultimately only the best go on to be in positions where they are significant decision makers in practice. The portfolio of work you develop in school is what you use to get a job out of school, and you’re competing for that job with all the other recent arch grads, so winning at school has real life implications. But yes I thrive on stress and competition. 
3	Very.
3	It's not power in and of itself that drives us; at least for me, it's the abject fear of being in a position of no power. \n\nI've been in multiple situations where, because of legal/structural reasons, I have had to take instructions from stupendously stupid, weak-minded bureaucrats and there's nothing worse than listening to and doing something you know is either wrong, inefficient or just flat out stupid, because the counterparty has more power than you do.
2	I don't love power or even like it. But which damn person likes having NO power? What are you going to do with no power? How are you supposed to push people around, achieve mac efficiency, etc, if you don't have any power? It's just a necessity.
1	Not at all, but then it is automatically given thus have to make "good use" of it. 
1	Leadership, striving to be the best and achieving your goals. Those are qualities that make an ENTJ, sure others aim for that but others do not aim for the top and consider strategic thinking to their long term plans, you can lose a battle but you end up winning the war type of attitude is required. 
2	ENTJ and DISC at conflict?	I resonate highly as an ENTJ and every test I've done has validated this... but when I look at my DISC assessment I'm higher in S and C, which seems at conflict with ENTJ to an extent.\n\nAm I missing something? Are these comparable tests? 
1	DISC has less scientific merit than mbti. Don't set much stock by it. If you want to find a more verified and reasonable approach to cross-referencing your type with other models, take the Big Five.
6	How to develop my Te	I am a teen, struggling achieving goals and I need to learn how to motivate myself fully until the end of the race. Help me please. This world created me and so I know I have a purpose which is to achieve something. I want to atleast achieve the best stuff around the world. My goal right now is to be top in school. Any advices?
9	Excel Spreadhseets.
11	Cut goal into smaller goals. Measure progress. Celebrate success. 
3	You should try push yourself but not to far. As Te dominant I set realistic improvements so if I get a C I’ll try improve not to an A+ but a B for the next exam then work to a A. Another thing I use even though it’s probably not healthy is to when an exam comes compare the result to past results. So If i get an A then next exam I get a B I generally punish myself but I don’t think it’s healthy. Sorry for the bad advice but it’s the best I have.
3	Omg its you again :) I answered another one of your post ~5 days ago. \n\nIt seems like you're in the middle of burning out. 'Struggling' and having no motivation. Now that you roughly know how a burnout feels like, why don't you start thinking of *ways that you can take care of yourself* and *burnout prevention*? I don't know you so well so my suggestions are pretty generic. You can start planning for your breaks, exercise, find a hobby, do sonething you enjoy once in a while, forge relationships with your friends and family, yadda yadda yadda.\n\nOne more thing, I second all the suggestions posted here so far.\n\nedit: grammar 
2	Going to good schools and learning to make good connections wherever you are, is more important at this point than being the top in school.
3	Ni	I'm 17 years old, I am sure that I've got the Te function, everything I do I have to know the reasons for it\n-Go make your bed!\n-Why?\n-Because I told you so\n\nThe bed wasn't made that day.\n\nAnyways, I was just wondering when you started developing your introverted intuition, was it in your twenties or earlier? I feel like i have the Ni function and therefore being an entj but I could be an estj also. The Ni function as I have percieved it as is seeing patterns. I do this with some things but it is not a strong feeling or anything extra. Did you guys notice when your Ni function started developing?\n
5	Fe doesn't have much to do with ENTJ's for one thing. It's Fi. 
3	Growth depends on the individual and his/her surroundings, some are early bloomers and some are pretty late. I got myself into an environment full of thinkers in my teenage years so my Ti is decent for a 21 year old guy like me.\n\nAnyway, see a problem you cannot solve no matter how many times you attempt it? Take it slow, go do something else, sleep on it, the solution may be in your dream.
3	I don't think I developed any of my functions in the "proper" order. Put simply, my life experiences do not support Te-Ni-Se-Fi; Ti-Ne-Si-Fe, in exactly that order, with precisely and appropriately balanced usages, etc. I think it is a very reasonable variable to ask about your caregivers' types (and the quality of your relationship to each) along with other traumatic or formative experiences, both acute and longitudinal. I spent a lot of time alone when I was younger, out of necessity rather than choice, and to a lesser extent that is still true. My Ni is very developed as a result, and I'd also consider myself a social ambivert. But that's for another time.\n\nNi is hard to directly "use" and practice using given the nature of that type of pattern recognition. If you want to develop Ni, maybe try a speaking exercise where you're forced to give an answer when you don't have one already prepared. Maybe throw a handful of "Se" at yourself in like, 45-60 seconds, and then synthesize from that what you can and explain it all to someone. Sounds goofy and maybe it is, but similar exercises tend to be good for people who can't "get into flow" when they publicly speak, and that's about a similar a feeling for Ni as I think you can re-create. 
2	If you ever feel slightly clever, or that some joke you made about facts had an underlying theme... something implied. You might be using you're Ni, my dear. Enjoy it. Ni might be your hidden funny bone. Play
-2	You are ESTJ. 
3	Handling political games	Not looking for guidance, as I more or less know the odds of me succeeding in the story and think I'll manage.  \n\nBriefly put, I am engaging in political games with my university tutor. I want to make a move that is perfectly correct and rightful if done in proper sequence, but that he perceives as threatening his reputation because he refused other students to do the same move (though it's perfectly legal and administratively ok).  \nI am getting to the point of finding law points to support my plea, trying to find the right strategy and sequence to put which arguments to whom, when, who to treat as a friend or not, evaluating the risk of saying so much information to such or such, and so on.  \n\nCan't say I enjoy that, but we ENTJs are naturally talented for this. Still, it's emotionally draining, hitting a barrier because of the ego of someone that is just above you for a few months left.
2	As long as you can reach a satisfactory conclusion, I don't see the point of any games tbh.
5	Handling the lack of challenge?	Hello everyone!\n\nLong and short, young professional working in the IT industry. Like ENTJ’s very ambitious and success driven and have progressed exponentially. \n\nReached the point I don’t find IT interesting as it’s not challenging, normally like to learn everything and become a walking-talking encyclopaedia spending hours researching. Not getting that buzz anymore.\n\nRecently got involved with Forex trading (investing was a long on/off interest) have spent countless hours researching and practicing find it challenging and deeply rewarding.\n\nMy question is how get that drive and motivation and apply that to IT again? Find that challenge.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this.
9	The learning curve for anything new is going to be enjoyable but it dies off and satisfaction drops. Everything will hit a plateau but if you can stick it out, significant rewards come from it.\n\nComing from someone who's changed hobbies, jobs and careers way too much I have learnt the value of deep learning as well as broad. Im not saying you necessarily are, but be mindful not to be arrogant of your knowledge in your field. Try finding better mentors or changing jobs to somewhere more challenging. It might not be directly technical challenges, but perhaps solving people problems in IT, or strategic problems.
3	> Recently got involved with Forex trading (investing was a long on/off interest) **have spent countless hours researching and practicing find it challenging and deeply rewarding.**\n\nGreat. What's the problem then?\n\n> My question is how get that drive and motivation and apply that to IT again? Find that challenge.\n\nMaybe you should not? It gets repetitive after awhile. Lots of new hardware and languages and tools spring up, and you have to learn the minutia, but are they really different? It becomes a perishable skill.\n\nIf you are passionate about Forex trading, why not pursue that? You could lose your pants doing it of course, but why force yourself liking something that is of the second priority?\n\nMany ENTJs eventually like to build their own businesses and boss other people around. Find out what you really like and want to do and go for it (unless it won't be profitable).\n\nThere are a lot of cheap coders to be found in Eastern Europe.\n
3	It’s hard! I’m on my 10th job in 15 years (all at the same company) and have crossed engineering, marketing, finance, and TS.  I’m bored after about a year.  So if I reach that point I try to find challenges I can take on outside my required duties.  Can I mentor younger employees or start some kind of mentoring circle?  Teach a class at my work about something I know about or find an expert and bring them in?  Find a process and lay out a recommended redesign or go ahead and automate it with the resources I have?  I even convinced them to let me go back to school again to get a PhD (industrial engineering) (which turned out to be a much bigger undertaking than I originally thought).  \n\n Point being, if you’re not excited about work, you’ve got to figure out what it is that excites you and then take the initiative to add that component.  I love mentoring and doing process redesigns, so I just do it (albeit respectfully and while keeping up with my required duties).  The effect is I make my team better and my leadership is able to see me in my element.\n\n
2	If your circumstances aren't right then change the circumstances:\n\n1) Talk to those above you and inform them that you don't feel challenged and that you want something more. Make sure you know what you want. If you're an ENTJ then you probably want more responsibility and control so ask to be able to take point on some projects (idk where in IT that you are).\n\n2) If they can't help you, it may be time to move on. Find an IT job elsewhere or maybe pursue a new occupation.\n\n3) If you don't want another IT job, but are still attracted to the profession, identify a common problem you'be encountered, solve it, and start your own business selling your solution. It will be extremely rewarding.\n\n4) None of the above work for you. Obtain a brokers license, keep going with Forex trading, and find your way into being a stock broker.\n\nDon't feel like developing a whole in depth plan for you so that's what you get.\n\nTell me a little about Forex trading. What is it and how do you get started?\n\nEdit: Learning about and applying AI or machine learning is cutting edge right now. ENTJ enjoy the cutting edge. VR is also the way of the future. Get into learning about that and how you could apply it.
2	Forex is a nice hobby for ENTJs overall, as long as you don't start pouring your money into it hoping for the big deal.  \nThough, Forex suffer a strong informational asymmetry and this is problematic if you get risk averse. Forex broker fees also make most hedging strategies fall flat.\n\nAnybody interested should check /r/forex, a lot of good content and interesting contributors despite a few edge kids.
2	Look into Quantitative Trading. It's a good mix of markets (like FX) and technology (data analytics, quantitative modeling), and most importantly, never ceases to be intellectually challenging.
2	Was very much in your position, the 9-5 I went into didn't challenge me (previously started, ran and sold a business so loved the hustle and hard work).\n\nFor me, kept up the job, but done things to improve my life and wellbeing. Now i read a book a week, swim every day and changed to a plant-based diet. Simple things which give us the challenge we crave.
8	Value of sleep	How long do you sleep? Is it important habit for you?
12	I am terrible for not sleeping enough.  I used to be more disciplined when I was younger, but now with work and study I'm up late every night. I ideally aim for seven hours, but typically end up with 6. \n\nThere's a really good Joe Rogan podcast with a sleep specialist, it stopped me drinking in the evening, and I'm gonna start aiming for 8-9 hours sleep. 
5	Go listen to the Joe Rogan Experience Podcast #1109 with Matthew Walker. The man is a sleep scientist and is explains a ton of information on sleep. A few fun facts: anything less than 7 hours of sleep is bullshit, sleeping less has a higher risk of mortality and correlation with Alzheimer's (see Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher who both claimed 4 hours of sleep a night), when we gain an hour of sleep when changing the clocks we have around 20% less heart attacks the day after, when we lose an hour of sleep when changing the clocks we have about 20% more heart attacks.\n\n  This may not be for everyone, and science and studies find new things all the time. For a group of ENTJ people, I would have assumed more focus on science and reason than most of the answers are showing so far. Maybe the guy Joe Rogan had on was complete bullshit but it was a great podcast in my opinion and bases on the citing of studies I felt like this guy really new his shit.\n\n  TL,DR: YMMV
2	r/polyphasic
2	sleep is valuable  \nbut there is no rule to it. u can just measure its quality by how you feel, nothing else  \nfor example ketosis will bring it down to a few hours. and ur still doing great.  \ni love poliphasic also
2	Made myself a priority to sleep at least 7 hours a night. Makes a big difference in productivity, mood and relationships.
2	it depends, some days I do not fall asleep for hours so I do not sleep more than 5 or 6 hours those days, but some days I can get as much as 7or 8. My body usually does not let me sleep past 8 hours and I would say I feel good on 6 or 7. If I just lay their and try to sleep, at times, my mind will wonder to trying to figure things out and problems. same with waking up, my mind will make it feel like im wasting time laying in be and that their are more important things to do
2	I heard a saying one time that said something along the lines of 'successful people wake up early'\nI usually get 6-7 try to wake up by 6 unless I stayed out late or had too many drinks
1	I value it at $300/hr
6	Tips on Networking?	Hey guys, ENFP here. Stereotypically ENTJs do very well in the industry so I thought I'd ask for some help here.\n\nI'm seeking for tips on establishing great professional connections. How do you approach a recruiter to express your interest in the firm? How do you maintain the connection with a professional? What are the dos and don't for networking?\n\nI'm interested in going towards data science myself. Any tips would be appreciated!
8	2 powerful tools for you:\n\n1. Know exactly what you can give - go where they need it.\n2. Know exactly what you want - say it.\n\nDon't gossip, be prepared, NEVER be late. 
6	I'm an ENTP but I network a lot with recruiters and am quite involved professionally. First thing I would do is get a LinkedIn account and start adding everyone you meet. That way when you post on LinkedIn that you are looking for new opportunities, recruiters can reach out directly. I also check LinkedIn once a day, in case anything interesting comes up, even if it doesn't seem like there will be anytime soon. I'd recommend you do this as well for at least 3-5 mins daily. \n\nWhen approaching a recruiter, make sure to show expressive body language but keep the conversation directed towards the company rather than you. Maintain eye contact, don't speak too fast and ask lots of questions. That would show them that you are genuinely interested in the company. Also, always ask the recruiter themselves about their experience in the company. My often go to line is "On a scale of 1-10, how would you rate your experience working here?" and then just build off that. I've followed this technique and actually had many recruiters willingly contact me afterwards \n\nHope that helps. 
2	1) Be authentic. Whether it's a potential employer, interviewer or colleague, people want to know the real you. If they like you, they'll want to tolerate seeing you every day of their working lives. If you're not a good fit, best to know it early. This is more important than grades or prior experience, and it's not even close.\n\nE.g. if you have certain hobbies, (mature) opinions or anecdotes, really try and take control of a conversation to get those out. I had three conversations at a public meet and greet with very large law firms. In one of them I was busting the guy's chops about his poor dead-lifting form (he brought it up), and in another they mentioned they liked tennis and so for a couple minutes we bonded over being Djokovic fans. Makes you sound human, and memorable. \n\n2) Do NOT kiss ass. By extension, do not walk into an interview as a historian of everything that person, or that company has ever done. Shit's weird and does not go over well. Don't lie about what your interests or personal goals are either. I almost spit out my drink laughing at some spineless guy ahead of me for how poorly his conversation went. \n\nRecruiter: "So what are you interested in? Trusts and estates? Small business law? Defense work?" (She enthusiastically says all three for different reasons).\n\nRecruiter: "okay well we don't do any of that here, can I see who's next?"\n\n3) DON'T work for free. Unless the opportunity is once in a lifetime and you think it'll legitimately open doors for you in the future, your labor is worth something. Don't settle for less than you think you're worth either, and don't be intimidated by bringing it up (professionally) as leverage in the interview process. Big companies will eat your spine if they see you'll sign off on less than what they should be paying you in salary + benefits. Know your stuff coming in, be confident, and you'll be happy you came prepared. \n\nI typically interview very well so take this fwiw to you. 
1	Ask an ENTJ in your industry for advice, or even to mentor you. Some of the people who asked me for advise and job leads have very good jobs now as a result of me sharing my connections with them. I also take an active interest in the careers of those who interned for me as students, even 10 years down the line.
19	ENTJs that are into fitness, how do you stay motivated?	Hi folks, I'm an ENTJ coming out of a lengthy depressive phase and eager to get back into optimal shape in all parts of my life. \n\nFitness is especially challenging as I tend to get 'bored', and there seems to be lot of variance in terms of what the "best" approach is/might be. I'm curious as to have you done to maintain motivation, develop fitness goals, and just your general insights if you've gone through something similar. \n\n\n\nIf relevant to your ability to help/answer - I'm 5'8, overweight, and not looking to get ripped, simply lean and toned.\n\nEdit: Thank you to everyone who took the time to respond.  
17	Being lean and toned is not really a goal. I would recommend picking measurable goals like a body fat percent goal or a certain weight you want to lift. 
6	ENTJ here and have been in the gym for over 3 years. I'm 18 and was pretty fat and unfit when I began, I've come a long way but it's been a fun journey and I've learnt a lot from it. \n\nI started out with a couple buddies who knew their shit, we went after school each day. Having people to go with you and teach you makes it a lot easier, you all push eachother to show up and get shit done. \n\nAfter my friends stopped going I found new people who hadn't had much experience in the gym before and talked them into coming with me. I love teaching them and showing them what it's all about and it's pretty rewarding seeing them improve over time. And again, we all keep eachother motivated. \n\nI've gone by myself before and it is quite a bit more difficult and less fun. Definitely get a gym buddy or a trainer, it makes it much better. \n\nIf you want a plan or anything feel free to hit me up. Set achievable goals and work towards them, stay focused and determined and you'll be amazed how much you can achieve.
5	I'm not ENTJ, but I think my experience is relevant.\n\nTip 1: pick exercise that you enjoy. I hate the gym, so I can go for a bit, but it's easy to lose motivation if it's not easy to get to as part of my daily routine. I find it boring too. I always end up giving it up. There are many different ways you can raise your heart rate. Vigorously vacuum or mop your house and tell me you didn't get a puff going! Lol. Walk more places, increase your pace, take the stairs, play badminton, etc.\n\nTip 2: Do these tings while listening to something you find valuable. For me, this means downloading music mixes (upbeat dance music keeps me motivated to move at a faster pace), or educational/news/fan podcasts or audiobooks. Two birds, one stone.\n\nTip 3: Join classes. I am completely unmotivated if I have to rely on myself. Social pressure works for me. I find attending classes much easier because all I have to do is turn up (Ie tricking myself). I can almost mentally switch off and just focus on my body when someone else tells me what to do. It's also motivating being around others who are also pushing themselves.\n\nTip 4: Start small. Like you, I have big dreams and goals, so I throw myself in head first, and end up either burning out of motivation quickly or get an injury and have to stop anyway. I'm impatient with progress, but get that out of your head. It doesn't work like that. I have to remind myself that fitness is like a video game. If you stop playing for a bit, you rewind on levels attained. Then you have to play each level again. You can't skip level 3 to get to level 10, even if it feels like you're always stuck at 3 and it's boring because you've done it before. Your mind may be ready, but your body is not. Be kind to it. You have to earn it.\n\nTip 5: Set a goal that is skill based. Not just, I want to lift x amount, or run x distance. Put the goal in context. Ie, participate in a fun run, bench press my friend for lols, join an indoor sport team woth my friends. For me, I want to do aerial hoop classes so I can perform and look magical. This means I need to work on strength and flexibility. So I have broken that goal into steps. I've started at no fitness btw. Yoga first, then dance classes, then pole, then aerial.\n\nI am a highly unmotivated person who has (is?) Battled depression. Although im motivated at the moment, this is how I've done it. I trick myself into it. My broken down steps include just getting changed into sports clothes, and knowing it's ok to still bail. Usually once I'm dressed I'll follow through but I give myself an out option. One step at a time is more axhievable. Make the steps smaller if you cant reach them. \n\nI enjoy stretching so yoga is good for me. It's a class I sign up to. I get dressed and go. I work hard in class, but only because I'm following instructions. I look forward to when the class finishes. The more I go, the better I get, and the more that motivates me to go. I book classes without over thinking the consequences. It's all about tricking yourself. Just do. I climb stairs instead of taking the escalator. Little things add up. The more you practice the mindset, you'll end up incorporating fitness into your everyday life naturally. Keep the long term goal in mind. Repeat it like a mantra. If you need days off, rest days are good sometimes. Don't beat yourself up over it. Think about it as a strategic break that you will change when you can.\n\nGood luck!
2	In terms of motivation it's important to not expect too much or to set very difficult goals if you're feeling that way. As an ENTJ you will want to see progress and you'll lose motivation for what you're doing if you don't see results.\n\nIt sounds like you've answered your own question though. The reason behind keeping active is it's conducive to overall well-being and in turn, productivity as a result of an optimal physical state. If you want to be at your best then you need to do this. Keep that in mind and that will be all the motivation you need.
2	If I was in your shoes, I would listen to my body as a starting point. Work in some long stretch sessions where you can just breathe and think about what feels good. The meditation will help too. And work in more daily physical activity to get energy up to a point where you want to move more. (think walking/bike to work if possible, brisk walk on a break, vaccuum the house, secret dancing..) Think about what way you want to work out routinely carefully before jumping into something you might not stick with (leading to discouragement.) Ramp slow. Listen to your organs and what they want to eat. Starting fresh is a good time to clean out your organs, maybe thoughtfully fast or cut calories for a few days as like a symbollic thing of regaining control on your body. 
1	Been going to the gym 2-3 days a week minimum for over 10 years.  The secret for me is simple.  It helps keep my mind sharp, my stress down, my energy levels up, and having a decent beach bod never hurts.
1	In my experience I would say to go for a hitt workout with an alternation between a free weight work out of high reps and low weight there is no need to Max in less you're trying to make it on to some kind of bored or something at what ever fitness facility you attend or at home but being in the military I would say those 2 things Are bread-and-butter to be in good shape with out being specially title consuming or strenuous
1	The only motivation you need is that it's Healthy for you. Why slack on your health? 
1	Finding time, not motivation is my issue.  So I sign up for competitions and therefore need to find the time to train...
1	ENTJ here. Motivation wasn't really my problem, having better things to do with my time was. Now I get up at 430 and work out for an hour to an hour and a half everyday and I'm loving the system. It sucks getting up but cardio and lifting is a great way to start the day. Plus now I'm at work by 7 and get more done in a normal day without being there late. (Not that I mind working late but my wife does haha) Also if you are having trouble actually being active at the gym try taking pre workout like C4 before you go. 
1	I first saw exercise as an avenue to feeling better and having a sharper mind. It really helps me be effective in other parts of my life. I have issues with depression/anxiety too, and, after a few weeks of staying with it, I actually saw a reduction in symptoms (thank you endorphins). \n\nAlso, I go to the gym so that I can rock climb, bike, and kayak better. I view lifting as a means to feel better and to be able to do everything else better. Still, I get bored sometimes! Once it becomes a habit, it's easier to fight the boredom. Good luck!! 
1	I just started working out more, trying to loose some weight. Start with a goal in mind then work towards it. You know how we love meeting our targets,well use that your advantage. \n\nAs for motivation, once I started loosing weight and getting stronger it became easier to stay motivated. 
1	Structure. Make it so your lifestyle can't help but make you into a fit person. For me, I went plant based no processed \(hard to overeat when everything you can eat is low calorie\). And as a self employed person, one of my businesses is woodworking, which is a daily workout.\n\nWith both of those down flat, I don't need to motivate myself to do anything, go to the gym? nah. I just live. I've not been over 115 pounds since I was a teenager.
1	Just making it routine worked for me. If you make a plan, stick to the plan  :)
1	1) Find a reliable workout partner and go on a regular schedule. You'll keep each other accountable\n\n2) Read 4 hour body - use it. Or hire an expensive personal trainer. Your choice.\n\n3) Every time you feel like quitting? Think of the following things:\na) For an ENTJ to function properly, we need to be living our lives efficiently. You can't make good decisions or do your best work when your health is shit. Going to the gym still sucks for me, but I enjoy the feeling afterwards\nb) Winners win, quitters quit. ENTJs are winners as long as they don't quit or make excuses. Every loser always has an excuse. Be an ENTJ paradigm. You are what you choose.\nc) Remember, we can work harder than any other MBTI type. Apply that to your health as well.\n\n****LOG YOUR PROGRESS IN A BOOK**** Always be improving. Don't stagnate. Progress is motivating as an ENTJ.
1	Consider doing a 30 day water fast (meaning zero calories). The weather is kind of appropriate for this.\n
1	I recommend practicing 40 minutes of yoga everyday for a week. The difference in how your body feels after a week is so clear that it'll convince you to stay on track.  \nUsually you get driven by results that you see or feel. That's why you aim for small victories, as biggest improvements are slow cooking. If you're on a diet, taking a picture of you naked every Monday morning for comparison can help. Did that from March to June in 2015 and lost all my fat.
1	1) Not an ENTJ.\n\n2) Would be very happy to help you if you want help (message me if you do).\n\n3) WRT boredom--on the one hand it is far easier to do activities you like than activities you dislike. On the other hand, how much one likes something is not necessarily a constant, immutable variable; I would hope that you could use the productivity and efficiency of a given otherwise-unpleasant activity as a means of motivation. Drew Baye makes some excellent points here:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/dbhit/videos/1855481717849372/
1	I like to bike, eat lean and work out with friends. also for motivation to stay in shape I will play on various adult sports teams, after-all, no ENTJ wants to look bad in front of a team. I am also 5'8 and i will say the best thing to do is get down to around 180, put on muscle and wear slim fit clothing to exaggerate your physique and make you look Skinner. Once your family and friends start to notice differences that makes motivation even easier. I guess the last thing you should be motivated by is all the health risks of obesity. 
0	I like pussy.

-2	If you are an ENTJ do you really have problems with motivation?

7	This seems more fitting for /r/politics or /r/debatecommunism since it doesn't really have anything to do with MBTI or ENTJs
1	Here's his [Love letter to America](https://www.economicsvoodoo.com/wp-content/uploads/Yuri-Bezmenov-Love-Letter-To-America.pdf) if anyone's interested in reading it.
7	How do you stay happy/positive when you are not doing anything and just enjoying leisure?	I believe I'm a conscientious person (ENTJ, lul) and I've noticed that I don't seem to be able to enjoy leisurely activities like playing video games or "taking it chill" for too long, I get restless and then subconsciously guilty for not doing anything and wasting a day. \n\nIs this is a problem for you? How do you deal with it? Actually think this sub might have some good answers.
8	I get MORE stressed when “relaxing” than stress from working long hours/pushing myself. \n\nEfficiency is the #1 operating system for ENTJs thus the return value of “relaxing” is not valuable because it yields NO RESULTS. \n\nHow do I relax? \n\nAnswer: By doing things slower. Taking longer than usual. Like walking instead of speed running or running instead of sprinting. \n\nENTJs can slow down but they can never stop.
5	I am the same exact way.. the only leisure time I can enjoy is when hanging out with friends and I can only enjoy it if I don’t have stuff to do. If I have free time available I feel guilty if I don’t use it productively. I fill my free time with working out or learning. I have expanded into picking up golf which has been fun, another outlet I use to learn as much as I can and practice something that I suck at. And I have picked up gardening/landscaping for the same reason. Ultimately I understand myself enough that I know I can never truly “turn it off.” I think that it’s my duty to use this ambition/drive since it comes so easily to me and other have such difficulty with it. I think it will be awesome collecting all this skill and knowledge, so when I have a family I can teach my kids so many of these life skills.
4	I have the same exact “issue.” I have gotten a grip on slowing my mind down, but haven’t grasped the shutting off my mind part. I need to be engaged in something stimulating or I need to be plotting about goals etc. Hard to just chill.
2	It is alright if you have a distaste for mindless leisure. Why don't you try having a more productive leisure instead? Learning and practising art(music, visual, whatevet) is great for the soul IMO. How about playing sports to maintain your health? 
2	Welcome to your personality\n\nNow, get back to work!
1	Ugh, this. I hate being unproductive! But what pisses me off even more are the people that assume it is because I can’t concentrate. That is just so degrading, for some reason. Like NO, the issue is quite the opposite.
1	Same here, I have played videogames before, I do not do it anymore, I just feel like im wasting my time. If I do it then it isnt often and only when playing with friends.
1	Same here! It's ok to enjoy active downtime. Everyone relaxes in a different way. I prefer going to museums, or doing outdoors activities, or learning something new. It really satisfies me. I only do more passive stuff like games with my husband and I view it as a bonding thing and even then prefer a problem solving component in the game. It's ok to be like that! \n\nHowever, I am bad about allowing myself some time off and rarely take a day off.
1	I used to loves and play videogames a lot, but I just can't play more than 20m now, I feel guilty after\n\nI try to force me to Netflix or play at least 1h/day but it's hard, I need to be focused on work.\nIf you have specific objectives that's not a bad thing tho
1	I can totally empathize. Hence I’ve developed interests in leisurely activities that are either mildly productive or further my growth in some aspect of life. \n\nSome of these activities include yoga/meditation, reading (mostly non-fiction works) and writing.\n\nWriting in particular has become one of my favourite down-time activities. Anywhere from journaling personal thoughts to writing my first novel have all proven to be extremely satisfying and productive without making me feel as though I never take time for myself. 
7	Am I a lazy ass ENTJ, or something else?	Hi guys PnssyDestroyer here,\n\n\nI used to take MBTI seriously until I kept getting mistyped. I was wondering if I was ENTJ because the tests kept giving me xNTJ tendencies. I know tests aren't that accurate and if I don't know myself blah blah anyways let me try and describe myself best I can and you guys use your psychic NTJ senses and tell me what's up:\n\n\n**"Sociability"**- Little bit of both. I do enjoy talking with people IRL but I get annoyed by small talk or if these people don't align with my current interests. Usually I have a sense of purpose behind talking. If I'm going to talk to people I have something in mind that is important (knowing someone I find interesting, learning knowledge from them, getting this approved, etc.) and I have no problems talking with said people. But if it's anything besides my own goals/interests I get anxiety trying to fill in the gaps to continue the conversation. I can make up any conversation but eventually my list of things to talk about goes short or I get annoyed and try to find a way to dismiss the person.\n\n\n**Feeling/Thinking?:** I do care about people and I refrain myself from cursing/yelling/etc. I generally treat people like my friends unless they cross me, why I treat people as friends so easily gets me favorable results (people tend to trust me more as I do in them) . When I give advice to a problem I take it from the logical perspective. I usually break big problems down to the core/essence of itself and suggest ways to remove it and leave it from there. I get annoyed if people don't take action with the suggestions I do and keep complaining. I try as much as I can to change their perspective but if they refuse to change themselves i can get annoyed. I believe any problem can be solved if people remove their ego from it and break it down one by one. I understand that you can rationalize everything but if you don't take action to solve it, then you will not solve it. In the end I do care about people but I place my own convictions over them. If they end up being in the way of what I have in store for myself, I will leave them if they don't respect my ideas or provide good evidence on why I should change my mind.\n\n\n**S/N:** I do enjoy going outside and exploring places. I also enjoy exploring new ideas and seeing potential in them, specifically real world application. I get annoyed by pure theory unless it interests me, but in the end I usually want to apply it to something useful. I can go on tangents sometimes if the person I'm talking to knows a lot more than me, I like exploring what they could offer. I do enjoy physical activity every once in a while to release some pent up energy I have and to make me feel better, also the heat of the sun makes me feel happy for some reason LOL. I also have some kind of subconscious that tells me if I'm feeling good or not. (ex: it tells me that I'm dirty and need to show today, so I do it and I feel better). My desk is a little bit messy but I know where things are. I love doing new and interesting activities. If a friend tells me if I want to go out camping in the forest this weekend I will definitely say yes. I dislike monotonous routine and use these to make me feel less bored (I get bored easily). Although I understand routine is part of life sometimes you need to break it to make yourself feel better and take on the next set of routine LOL\n\n\n**Other things I couldn't pinpoint:** I do like to keep my thoughts and goals organized. I have my schedule set up in Google Calendar and business margins on Excel. Yes I do run a business. When I was a kid I used to take a lot of things to the next level. I was good at designing at one time, so I made my own graphics business, then I decided the company took more profits from me and decided to run my very own and handle the shipping/sourcing and what not. I'd say I'm still immature. If I see a potential in a project I throw a lot of my effort into it. In the end, I end up in multiple projects that I try to accomplish in my spare time and I get stressed. I tend to overestimate my time and ability to finish these projects because I oversimplify the process. This is why I said "lazy ass ENTJ" because I can get overwhelmed by the amount I have dedicated to and desire to be left alone and take a break because of the stress I put myself to.\n\n\n**fun facts:**\nI was named #1 meme lord in school\n\nI sold some kid a virtual item for around 400 dollars\n\nI signed into a competitive water polo team without knowing how to swim and now im still alive and can chuck a ball at your face \n\nI planned a trip the night before (parents couldnt plan) and ran away with 100$, came back seeing everything I wanted and bought what my parents wanted in 1 day w no phone.\n\nI made more than 500$ selling to dumbass kids some fidget spinners outside of Walmart because I was bored\n\nI can catch a dragonfly with only two fingers\n\nI'll be happy to answer any typing questions!
8	ESTP\n
6	ISTJ, maybe? Or ISFJ.
2	See if any of [these](https://funkymbtifiction.tumblr.com/post/94074329147/how-se-acts-in-all-4-positions) descriptions fit you. The gist of it is that you should distinguish between tertiary and inferior Se first to get a better idea of what your test results are telling you. \n\nFwiw I would type you as an ENTJ. 
1	The wolf of wall street a) reference and b) character seems to suggest ENTP \nBut I’ll have to review everything again. \n\nHow old are you?
1	Finally, if you won 1 million dollars, what would you do with it?
1	I’m definitely going to go with ENTJ then :). 
1	Haha, :) SOo, \n- the nature of that question in demanding a rationale, \n- your focus on the degree you express particular functions rather than the interplay between functions (which more accurately determines your information processing, perspective, and behaviour, \n- and the use of “accusation” in the context of your question all explicate my point. \n\nThere is no doubt that you are a full-fledged ENTJ. \nI think once you read up on it a bit more, you will come to the same conclusion :). \n\nAlso, I don’t believe ENTJ’s are lazy. I think that may be a misperception! \n\n
1	No worries. Better to come to the conclusion yourself ~
3	am i not talented?	Hi everyone,\n      I am one year out of college and my peers seem to be moving past me at work. I am in the defense industry and I have been working my ass off (same with my peers). So far, I think we all have contributed equally give or take a few assignments that were given based on schedule. Recently, I found out that some colleagues received awards for their effort and I didn't, even though I am putting in a lot of hours and contributing a lot in my direct assignment which has high priority.\n         I think it may have to do with the fact that I am very straightforward with my ambitions and would tell even my manager and task lead that I am going to become a program manager as soon as possible. I don't know if I was being too blunt or appeared to have an ego.\n         In general, I feel I a bit un-liked. I think it's because people think I am always plotting to make it to the top of the corporate ladder or am too concerned with my appearance to upper management. I don't know what to say since 'who doesn't want to make it to the top?' why would I waste my time not being direct with my intentions. Is it wrong to display this ambition? \n\n         Anyways, the only other reason I think could be possible for why I haven't received and award is the type of work that I am responsible for. I am doing a majority analysis work at the moment which doesn't have much visibility to management but is very important to the project. \n\n        Have any of you felt the same way? Were you ever awarded less and an ENTJ compared to your colleagues who were not as ambitious? \n

1	XD Inferior Fi is everywhere in this subreddit. It's cute. These sources should help tremendously. https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7845157-bounce https://80000hours.org https://personalityjunkie.com/entj-careers-jobs-majors-holland-code/
2	My mom is an entj 6w5 and while she fits the effective and bold leader stereotype, she is a very sensitive entj due to the enneagram 6 being dominant.	Which enneagram types can entjs be?
1	I'm a 3w7 or 7w3, can't really remember. I honestly have no idea if that's a frequent type for ENTJs tbh.
1	ENTJs are usually 3's or 8's, but they can also be other numbers.  It's one aspect of enneagram that I find fascinating, there are so many different variations when you factor in wings and tritypes.
1	6w7 here\n\nENTJs can be any enneagram and the same for any other MBTI type to any enneagram type, it's just some or more prevalent than others (and some just don't make sense doesn't mean they can't happen)\n\n8w7 is the most common (and aggressive uwu) enneagram for ENTJs\n\nIn my exposure, 6s and 8s can tend to mistype as each other and I can go into that if necessary
2	Meeting/dating ENTJ women?	Hi, I'm a male INTP. From past experience, I've found I click most with ENTJs romance-wise. \n\nHow can I meet more ENTJ women? Where do you all tend to gather? \n\nThe ones I dated in the past, I just happened to meet by happenstance.\n\nEdit: Typo
12	1. Corporate events. \n\n2. Any hobby that is competitive and on a team. We don’t relax so it’s probably not going to be something idle.\n\n
10	The gym, at night. 
4	My husband is an INTP! My best friend is an INTP! These are the most wholesome relationships I have ever had, and I think you are right in pursuing this type of relationship. However, MBTI type isn't everything, and if a letter is off, that doesn't mean the relationship isn't worth pursuing. I have a friend who is an ISFP, and even though we are opposite in nearly every way and lifestyle choice; her and I just work. I understand where you are coming from though.\n\nAs for where we hang out\- ENTJs are so diverse, I have no idea. The most I've met \(and then later found out that they are ENTJs\) are cosplayers at conventions. I'm more a video game/stay at home/occasional convention kind of person\- but I meet a ton of wonderful people at video game/anime/cosplay type cons, if that is an interest of yours, absolutely get out there, bring a party board game, and as you meet interesting people during the day, invite them to board game at night around 8\-9 in a public space \(lobby, empty con room, whatever\), and exchange #'s if it is natural. The people that show up self select \(if people aren't into it, those aren't the people that you want to hang out with anyway\). 2 Rooms and a Boom is a great game for this. I have met dozens of interesting people this way, and we now have a little clan that meets up each con to play board games at night. I think the takeaway even if you aren't into this is: Other people are not going to reach out, plan things, and host for you. If you want to meet people, you have to do this.\n\nIf you aren't a nerd, I'm really not sure where ENTJs hang out. I'm down to PM if you want to have a conversation! Also as a side note\- many ENTJs start out thinking that they are INTJs, because many of us have very selective extroversion. Something to think about.
4	The League, Hinge, networking events, bars/restaurants in your city near major offices (MBB, Big4, etc.), some beer league sports like kickball, November Project/TMIRC, and so on. That's pretty vague, but it's a start. Don't be a wallflower either, it won't bode well for you.
2	I like going out to karaoke bars with friends. Being onstage is such a rush and singing lets me get the stress out.
2	Gay parties - that's where I (ENTJ woman) like to hang out and that's were I've met my INTP boyfriend.
2	date me.
1	Classes we take to better our careers and abilities. Maker Spaces. Networking and corporate events. A karaoke place with really good singers. Contests or sporting events that raise money for a worthy cause. Ask your friends to set you up. Speed dating. Grocery Store. Efficient dating sites such as bumble.
-4	Don't. You'll probably like FJ types better.
5	ENTJs, what are your Hogwarts houses?	I'm a Slytherin, which feels very ENTJ to me. I was wondering what some other ENTJs were.  \n\nEdit: Wow, who knew how many ENTJs loved the HP series as much as me! Thanks for answering, everybody!
18	Definitely Slytherin. 
7	Yeah, I'm Slytherin too.
6	slytherin aswell.
6	Slytherin based on Pottermore

4	SLYYYYYYTHERIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIN
8	Ravenclaw. 
3	Slytherin
3	I'm a Slytherin, according to Pottermore. 
3	Hiss hiss motherfucker! ;D
3	Probably Slytherin, but I'd do that thing that Harry did where I ask the sorting hat to rethink its decision; I'd much rather hang out with the Gryffindor homies.
2	Slytherin, definitely.\n\nAlthough my teacher alter-ego is a gryffindor. 
2	Solid Slytherin here.
2	Slytherin
2	[I even rep the colors](https://imgur.com/IUWBX25).
2	Slytherin. Always. 
3	I got Gryffindor when I tried the Pottermore test a few years back.
4	Ravenclaw. \n\nI saw some study somewhere (although no idea what the sample size was of people) that put the majority of ENTJs as Slytherin, then Ravenclaw. Gryffindor and Hufflepuff after. 
4	GRYFFINDOR! And that is because, despite my ENTJ qualities, at the end of the day, I still resort back to my core values. And don’t mind a fight to honor them. 
2	Hufflepuff, according to Pottermore.
2	Ravenclaw, and I'll have you know I have a "very unusual" patronus
2	Gryffindor.
1	I just took the test to see, and I got Gryffindor...
1	Ravenclaw 
1	Gryffindor
1	Did the pottermore test three times and always a Slytherin 
1	Slytherin 
1	Slytherin 
1	ENTJ here: Hufflepuff and Thunderbird.
1	Gryffindor. But Gryfferin if we're doing secondary houses. 
1	110% Slytherin, like there was even a question.
1	Solid Gryffindor 
1	Ravenclaw 
1	Gryffindor
0	Gryffindor! But that’s probably from my attitude on things. I can’t say I don’t see the Slytherin in me at times...
0	gryffindor! i've gotten a lot of answers on the tests, but tests suck and i'm definitely a gryffindor. 
2	How do you express love?	also with your inferior fi is it easy to know when you're in love?\n\nim curious \n\n
5	It's easy to know it, harder to feel it, and really hard to accept it.\n\nAs far as expressing it goes: if I say it, I mean it. I bring intensity to everything I do including my relationships, even if the other person is really struggling. But beyond that I have nothing to offer since I failed as a partner, and you should collect data from people who haven't failed. 
5	I tend to show love (platonic or romantic) most through my actions. I always pay attention and try to be there for them, go out of my way for them, I try to help them whenever possible, want to talk and hang out a lot, constantly try to organise things and find us fun stuff to do, etc.  \n\nI'm not the sort to be verbally affectionate (though I can be very physically affectionate!), for example I rarely give out compliments. Sometimes that can cause issues with people who are the opposite, since they'll feel underappreciated, say how I should express myself more, and it just makes me think, *uh, look at what I do and all the effort I put in!* and then it makes me feel underappreciated and like they haven't even noticed how much I do show I care.  \n\nAnd I do tend to have trouble with my emotions and how *I* feel in general, but I don't actually find it that hard to recognise how I feel (and what I think) about other people. That's a lot easier.
1	I am just a teen and sadly I just cant express love. I try to force myself and I get drained. I just think it’s not necessary to express. Well ugh, I just cant explain it. I know this comment is weird but seriously I think its not necessary. I flirt when in love. 
1	I mean it when I say it. If it comes to it, I can act and prove its sincerity too. All of my relations usually go well until I go ahead and drop the bomb. Us entjs always have this tendency to advance things and want from life. Nowadays I am content with simple dating and wouldnt initiate anything more on my own accord.
2	Help?	So I have this goal and it’s to be part of the honors list. Cognitively speaking, my dominant is Te and in the long run I just get no motivation between the middle of the finish line making me not do well. \n\nQuestions: \n1. Does it relate to you\n2. Any advices to help me please\n\n14, M, \nI identify myself as ENTJ 
2	Welcome to the red zone. An incredibly tricky area that determines the cream of the crop from the rest. It is merciless and competitve. You're in the zone where people usually give up. Are you going to be one of them? Or are you going to brave through the area gracefully? The red zone is tricky but so are you. Allow me to answer your question with more questions, how are you going to maintain your discipline to work hard in this area? How are you going to keep yourself motivated? How are you going to take care of yourself in times like these? 
2	You might enjoy the book 'Mastery' by Robert Greene. I recommend the audiobook version.
1	What is honors list? Above 3.5 GPA?\n\nIf so, Identify classes that you can get an A in easily. Do not neglect those, but concentrate more on the ones that you have difficulty with. Spend some extra time on Youtube watching videos on the topic. Post anonymously on Reddit asking specific questions.\n\n
3	Si PoLR?	I've been trying to type my bf since I've gotten into mbti and I've narrowed it down to ExTJ. I thought he was ESTJ for sure but he recently showed some extremely creative Ni tendencies that's totally changed my mind about him. So I thought getting to know how Si manifests in an ENTJ and maybe he's just trying to be the "ESTJ" standard American that's kind of been drilled into him.
6	I think coming up with creative ideas is most common in persons with a Ne function actually. Remember that ESTJs also have a Ne function. \n\nNi (probably the most misunderstood function) is most helpful in seeing how a creative idea will translates to reality. That is not to say that ENTJs can't be creative, it just manifests itself in a different way.\n\nI don't know your boyfriend personal so I'll leave the typing up to you.
1	It is just me or do others sometimes have difficultly getting close with strong S-types? I've found that in such cases we just think/see things completely differently. Not that we always disagree about everything, but the how's and the why's seem to bore them when they always fascinate me to no end...
9	entjs are you spiritual?	entjs are you spiritual?if so how?,do you enjoy art,nature,things like that ?
23	I think most ENTJs will stray from organized religion because it’s easy for us to see the flaws.  That said, I feel rather spiritual when studying the universe.  
11	Not ENTJ, but dating one, and daughter of an INTJ who is heavily E-leaning. \n\nBoth born in deeply Christian families. My dad became a pastor, boyfriend’s family is all elders and pastors. I found that both dove deeply into the intellectual side. \n\nWe’re all Reformed, which if you know squat about Christian theology means we’re earlobes deep in it. They could debate for hours about different sides of each thing. Both, however, have their spirituality and the rules for it deeply, deeply rooted in the Bible. \n\nThey basically built their framework of black and white around scripture, and every aspect of their lives is touched by it. Pretty unique to watch. 
8	I am very spiritual. When I find myself immersed in nature I find a very deep connection - especially in nature hikes, or stargazing. \n\nOrganized religion is like nails on a chalk board to me. 
15	No, I was raised religious but I left. I’m an atheist. Honestly, I think religion has served a useful purpose for our species but now holds us back a bit. 
6	Not really, but I'm a big believer in equilibrium.. it's present in nature, mathematics, chemistry, geopolitics, human relationships, almost anything you can think of. So, in a way, I can appreciate these things with the right context. 
4	Nope, there are too many flaws within religion, I do not want to start a debate or something but here are some of the reasons to why I quit believeing in religious things:\n\nI was born in a country where the largest religion happened to be christianity. What if I was born in another country where they have another religion like buddhism or hinduism, then I would be raised to believe in that religion instead. Then why should I believe in this religion? Maybe the buddhists are right? Eventually I would have to try out every religion to see wich one is the right one only realizing they are all wrong.\n\nThey all state that they are the ones that have got it right.\n-''Well, how can I trust that this religion is the right one?''\n-''Um, you gotta believe because that is when you show you are dedicated.'' \n\nThis is a typical argument that does not register with out primary extraverted thinking (Te)\n\nIf I'm not completely wrong the bible states that it's wrong to be black or homosexual, I disagree with this. I argued with my christian friend about that and he said: ''Well they update the bible, that is not right anymore.'' I'm pretty sure that they do not update the bible but if they do it wasn't god, and it seems to me that god is the only one that should be entitled to changing the bible.\n\nAll this racism and sexism was pretty normal back in the day so to me it's obvious that these are things that ''humans'' came up with.\n\nI'm done ranting now, you are welcome to believe in whatever you want, I just wanted to give insight from an ENTJ's perspective.
7	I’m pretty religious. I actually was raised atheist and became Christian. I really like theology and the logical-analytical aspects of religion which come to me more easily than mystical spirituality kind of stuff, but I do view most things as interconnected and containing deeper meaning. 
3	No. not really.\nClosest I come to is the living philosophy of Darren Shann vampires. \nI do find the "Weighting of the heart" by Anubis oddly fascinating too. 
3	Spirituality can be a great tool.
3	Not even remotely
3	Yes I have a very strong faith. I definitely see the many flaws of organized religion, and it does bother me but to me it is no more or less flawed than any other organization so I'm not going to let that destroy my faith. I chalk the flaws up to humanity and try to improve it how and where I can. I have a very logical and reason based approach to my faith so I tend to find churches and groups that focus on that rather than the more sensational side of Christianity. 
3	a lot of people are equating religion with spirituality which aren't the same thing. you don't have to be a part of a religion to be spiritual. \n\n\ni'm very spiritual, but i don't really believe in any gods. i used to identify as pagan for a long time, but i stopped. i'd say i'm pantheistic. i believe in the universe and fate and all that crap. it's nice. i enjoy nature, but art's kind of boring.
3	Yes. I highly doubt there is a God, and organised religion absolutely has it's flaws but the process of immersing yourself in what is (essentially) moral philosophy for an hour a week and reflecting on your values and how you are conducting your life is absolutely valuable. Theology is also a good touch point for the increasingly difficult decisions one has to make as one moves up in the world. Cynically, churches are also great community hubs and opportunities to network. \n\nFor what its worth, both Margaret Thatcher and Hillary Clinton, widely included in lists of ENTJs, were/are highly religious and spiritual. 
2	I try to be. But I find it difficult. 
2	I am. 
2	[crom](https://media2.giphy.com/media/fZFRuR46TuKt2/giphy.gif) 
2	I am not desperate times call for desperate measure. I and can still enjoy art and nature without it. Especially music I love music 
2	Yes, Catholic
2	no
2	I was raised Christian but the logical inconsistency drove me crazy,  even as a child. \n\nAs an adult I identify as spiritual agnostic, meaning that I don't claim to know about the universe but think there could be more than we currently understand.
2	I'm Agnostic, but I think the idea of practicing magick is intriguing. 
2	I am during Superbowls
4	Absolutely not. I'd hope that most ENTJs have enough sense to pick reality from folklore. 
1	I'm a Hermetic Alchemist, but not spiritual. Not even sure what spiritual means honestly...I guess I am Jewish so there's that, and I'm a Satanist. \n\nPretty much a bundle of contradictions...
2	Are all ENTJ's inconsiderate of people's need?	My dad is an ENTJ and he wouldn't negotiate his own needs but rather make other's negotiate to make people adjust to his comfort. \nIs this just an unhealthy aspect or is this a normal ENTJ trait? \nWhat do you suggest I should do?
12	Short answer : No.\n\nLong answer : Every ENTJ is different, I have been cold to many people but always put family above everything. For others, it depends where I'm at, what value I see in it for me (not necessarily materialistic) and above all it shouldn't mess with my plans.
8	Nope, not at all. In fact, ENTJs should be [significantly more attuned to others' needs](https://www.reddit.com/r/entj/comments/3g0rar/entj_and_estj_highest_in_emotional_intelligence/) than many other personality types.
6	We’re pretty caring. \n\nChances are, we see your potential and want you to reach it. This likely means less assistance form us than most types. We’re the tough love type.
6	In every thread I've read about this topic or one similar, it always comes down to maturity and life experiences. I don't view it as a sign of strength, power, "being alpha" or whatever you want to call it to constantly subjugate other peoples' needs to your own. If you want to be literal about it, ENTJs have inferior Fi because they *don't* value their own moral or emotional needs above what rationally fits a situation. Forcing everyone to validate my needs and beliefs is extremely foreign to me, since I don't even demand that of myself most of the time. \n\nI don't know if it's "unhealthy" but I woudn't model your own behavior in that way. Assess every situation for its own sake and try to do right by others who mean something to you. Fitting some perceived ENTJ stereotype is less important than your own authenticity. 
6	Your dad is just an ass, regardless of whether he's an ENTJ or not.\n\nHow to deal with it? Live your own life, decide on your own personal boundaries with regard to your dad, and stick to them, regardless of the outcome or outfall. 
3	Unhealthy ENTJ's? Most likely.\n\nBut I would like to point out that oblivious would be a better word for types that aren't unhealthy. in my own case, i'm pretty selfish, but i am fully capable of taking other people's needs into account and I do that for some part, but i do need to be reminded every now and then, and when i have gotten reminded, It's likely that i would rewise or at least edit my plans to meet their needs.I and i'm sure many other ENTJ's see that it's our weakness and would work on it since it can effect us greatly in team works.

6	INTP or ENTJ? (both are shadows of each other)	[tl;dr]: INTP and ENTJs are shadows of each other. (LOOK UP SHADOW TYPES, WHICH HAPPENS TO BE YOU WHENEVER YOU'RE IN GREAT STRESS) I tested as an INTP during my stressful anxiety days and ENTJ post-anxiety, when I've never been more calm and level-headed. All of my fears have been lifted and an unknown personality emerges.\n\nWhich is my true type?\n\npre-anxiety "treatment" I thought for years that I'm an INTP, which surprisingly happens to be the shadow type of ENTJ. I thought for years that the crippling feeling that anxiety gave me is equal to introversion. That previous conclusion is supported by my behaviours (which I still do, fortunately - except for procrastination) that actually aligns with the typical INTP (being knowledgeable in diff. things, almost never relies on feelings, spends too much time alone, attracted to the unknown,  gives a giant effort at the last minute when i could have done it way earlier, etc.) --- all of those while suffering from severe anxiety. How severe? Like I would stutter and be covered in cold sweats whenever someone goes all the way to approach me or I would have visible tremors in my hands and obvious shaking in my voice whenever I would speak in front of a group. I also blink rapidly, in a manner that almost the rest of my face moves whenever I would blink. The weird thing though is that peers and acquaintances would almost always comment or talk behind my back about how my face is always angry or grumpy almost all of the time. Some even said that I am actually 100x times less intimidating than my angry face would express which I almost took as an insult. "thought he was a tough guy, turned out to be a clumsy nerd".\n\nThen, I finally did something about it, with very little help from substances and mostly from lifestyle changes (tried to get to lean levels of body fat and physically strong as much as possible, embraced my "discomfort zone", thus effectively killing procrastination, stopped watching porn, masturbating, and most importantly, meditation. I went from barely tolerating 10 minutes of meditation to meditating 9 hours straight [which I only do now in that length whenever my time is free] All of that I tried to do in the timeframe of 9-10 years)\n\nOf course, it worked and that's why I'm here. What I had in mind when I did meditation was merely to remove my social anxiety and calm myself down. Cutting all of the bad habits and doing meditation did calm me down, sure, but it have also made me slightly to moderately temperamental but not in an uncontrolled manner. I would describe it as "cold" instead of "hot", the latter being subjected to whims and irrationality. I could even say that it's already 1 step behind of being "evil" and the increased sense of pragmatism further aggravated it. My love for innovations and the concept of inventing things obviously remained and my disgust towards emotions and emotional people have been amplified more than ever (although I don't visibly show it) Almost nothing gets worked me up right now emotionally speaking, yet I work harder than before with the reasoning that "this might not the most comfortable thing, but it has to be done."\n\nSocial skills, eloquentness and tact came out of nowhere. I could now easily talk my way put to get things from people. From rapidly blinking eyes to having a stare of a snake. Ostensibly, I became sociable and less introverted and whenever I socialize it is never without a purpose, let alone an end in itself. It would always remain a means just to get what I want. I have beliefs or opinions I'm willing to hide in plain sight because blatantly showing them won't get things done. I stopped ranting about our government on facebook and arguing in the internet because again, they would serve no purpose to my end. I am conforming not because I want to, but because I have to, at least for now. I believe that creative ideas move better from "top to bottom" instead of vice versa, hence if I wanted to effect change then I should be on the top. It's lonely at the top but I don't care. This is unfortunate but the weak gets despised more than the wicked. In my deepest of fantasies, I wish I could just steamroll my way to the top without the conforming and politics bullshit.\n\nSometimes without being aware of it, I do things which would make sure that my presence would be known right after I step inside a room, a gym, you name it.\n\nI don't like weaknesses at all of any kind. I also fail to see now how someone who perceives himself to be better than most people refuse to take control over others whom he perceive as inferiors. (what MBTI type would do this again?) "Because it's too much work? And I'm lazy" ...then imo these people are just overestimating their worth.\n\nIt's horrifying what excessive feelings of fear and anxiety could do to a person. Thinking about it or how much I suffered from it makes me infuriated. I believe that those things should be thrown away so that's what I did.\n\n\nSo, am I still an INTP?
2	How long was the gap between testing as INTP and ENTJ? Maybe wait a few months and see what you get again. You'll probably get one of those scores again.
3	ENTJ's: Who's your favorite character from Lord of the Rings?	Also, please note if you're referring to the book character or the movie character, since they differ somewhat.
3	Aragorn in the books, definitely not movie Aragorn, tied with book Gandalf. I suppose the concept of a leader who is not recognized and must prove himself resonates with ENTJ as we learn quickly that respect is earned whether that's fair or not. I like Ardwen a lot too, due to her willingness to sacrifice the promise of the West for the dream of a future that would likely end with sorrow \(as it did\) but was worth it despite its temporal nature. 
1	I really can't pick a favorite character out of the bunch, they're just so, woven together. But i guess my favorites were the two Hobbits, Merry and Pippin, the book version. and i loved the Nine in the first book, the shadow they cast was long and dark, and i loved the sheer terror they inspired. \n\nLOTR isn't really character oriented, character development is weak IF it even exists, no real stakes, no tragedies. i much prefer work of George R.R.Martin in that particular department. the characters in his books are so well written and developed, you can easily become fascinated with almost each and every main character.
1	Galadriel was always the most intriguing to me, but I identified with Eowyn the most. I love Sam, too! 
1	Galadriel from the movies...
1	I don’t do Lord of the Rings.
1	The one that I masturbated to the most. Don't remember the details that well. Remind me - what was the movie about?\n
12	I have a theory of optimum growth	I believe that if someone wants to achieve greater of him/herself, they need to be socially(family,friends,hobbies) and mentally (education,work) and physically (sports, nutrition) active. If any of them is missing, the other parts will be affected, what do you guys think about that? :)
19	You're only touching the surface of a complex matter, but yes you're right.
9	Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. \n\nNot even sure if it is still valid or if it has been updated but it’s basically what you’re discussing. 
3	I’ve noticed that when I am physically active, my mood lightens and my thoughts are clearer. 
3	Depends on how you define optimum growth.  If you’re referring to being well rounded, sure.  If you’re trying to grow into being the person that finds the cure to cancer, maybe the socializing isn’t quite as important.
1	This is a basic understanding, but, yes I agree.
1	You can be exceptional in one area, but you will miss something in other areas.\nYou can't be exceptional in all areas, just mediocre.
1	What is for one is not for the other. 
3	entjs the most powerful	entjs were do you get your willpower from.......iv seen entjs and non other can compete with them!
23	Personally, I'd put it down to my superpowers.\n\nAnd drugs.
23	Personally it comes from my desire to crush my enemies, see them driven before me, and to hear the lamentations of their women.
19	I like to get shit done
14	Addiction to achievement
25	Cuz if I don't do it, no one else will. And even if someone else does, I'd probably do it better, so I do.
8	Spinach.
8	Ambition? Desire to succeed? The sheer stubbornness of not letting yourself fail? \n\nIts hard to pinpoint exactly as everyone's motivation and drive differs between each person but it comes from within yourself, no doubt about that. \n\nFor me, I just say "Fuck that, I'll find a way to do it" whenever I think I'm going to fail and that usually snaps me out of it and gets me back on track, not sure if it helps but it gets me by 😂
3	ENTJ's and ENTP's complement each other in a crucial manner. If the entire human population would consist of ENTJ's or ENTP's society would end in a couple of weeks: ENTJ's would not reach consensus. ENTP's provide the crucial open-minded link.
3	If I really **will** something, then I do not want to live with the knowledge that I gave up. At that point, ego takes over.
3	Start your question with Where. Stupid
2	Shitloads of Te, especially in combination with Fi :)\n\n“We have a strategic plan. It’s called doing things.” – Herb Kelleher\n\n[Meme with that quote](https://ibb.co/mkzHwJ)
2	Willpower?\n\nHere,s how I see it :\nOne day you'll die. Accept that this day is yesterday.\nNow that you are already dead. Why not push yourself over your own limits until you colaps. Then you'll be admired by everyone.\n\nI love to be admire by everyone and when I'm not, I feel like trash. Kind of super narcisistic, but still, I'd rather die trying than not be the center of attention of everyone.\n\nYou ask where we find our will power.\nI personally don't understand how anyone is able to not kill themself and hate themself when they are not at the top. I know, it sound awefull, but I really mean it. I dont, get it. If I'm not at the top, I feel borderline suicidal every single time. When I'm at the top, I can sleep peacefully. I like to sleep. So I work to get at the top.
2	D E T E R M I N A T I O N
7	No, they are not.\nENTJs are most powerful when the plans are working right.\nIf Plans gets failed, they will give up.\n\nWhile  Perceiving types like ENTPs and INTPs thrive on improvision and they would not give up even in the worst situations, and able to find creative ways to tackle the problem.\n\n\nDownvote me but this is the truth.
2	For the results, sometimes it feels like chasing your beloved.
13	Is The Redesign Of Reddit Going To Be Problematic?	Is it just me or when you try the redesign of the new Reddit, information is missing in the sidebar for certain subreddits?
8	Unfortunately, unlike Digg 2.0, there is not a clear competitor that everyone can flee to en-masse.\n\nIf it is not obvious, I am not a fan of the new design. The stealth placement of advertising strikes me as too digg try-hard. 
2	I hate the redesign.\n\nIt's much harder to see all the content. There's a lot more transition animations and layout formatting. It's like I have to dig for more information through 2 or 3 clicks, whereas the old design had everything preloaded on one page.\n\nIt looks pretty but it's hard to use and I find myself having enough of Reddit after 20 minutes. Which is probably a good thing anyways...
2	I really dislike it, but as long as I can continue using the old layout I don't care. I don't get why website redesigns are almost *always* terrible and less functional. I honestly can't think of a time I liked one off of the top of my head, but I can think of plenty I hated. It feels like website redesigns are almost always designed by people completely out of touch with their userbases.
8	ENTJ [M/23] in need of some help with Time Managment skills.	Hey everyone. So I'm a 23-year-old college student who fits the ENTJ mold in all but one way. I'm terrible at time management. I've always been good at procrastinating and then finishing everything thing at the last minute, but nowadays it's gotten to the point where I'm just missing work and not getting it in on time repeatedly.\n\nWith finals coming up, I'm curious what tips and tricks my fellow ENTJs on this subreddit can give with regards to improving my time management skills. I’m just looking to see what suggestions you may have about the matter and I'm curious to see what advice you all could give to help improve my (nonexistent) skills.
10	My trick is fairly simple: think of a place that will be "work only", make a note on a piece of paper of something small that can be done in one go, pack your stuff and go there everyday. In my case, library trips with my laptop work wonders. And it doesn't even matter if I end up doing 2 hours or 8 hours a day; in a daily system, week by week, the grand task just gets done no matter how daunting it seemed at first. This is basically how I got through 5 years at a university, and I'm still using this method whenever I feel like I'm getting lost in terms of work productivity.\n\nBy the way, don't worry about not fitting the mold, time management skills are definitely acquired not inborn.
9	Getting things done - David Allen. Buy it, read it, use it. 
6	The tip is to persuade yourself to do just a little at first, just the very beginning. Then usually it comes.
3	I use lists in times of crunch. If I use them all the time they eventually get ignored, but if I use lists of things and give myself hard deadlines it works pretty well. I also always use a calendar but don't really put my to-do's on the calendar. The calendar helps me see when I have time to do things like meet up with groups and plan ahead when possible. It's simple but it works pretty well.
3	Do the thing with the furthest away deadline first. There's less pressure so it will be easy to start. Then with each next task, the deadline will be closer, forcing you to do it out of necessity.
3	Download the app Todoist. Get shit done. Feel good.
2	Do parts of your work, break it down into small pieces and have breaks in between. Even doing 10minutes of something is better than nothing. 
1	Get tested for ADHD just in case, but don't abuse Adderall if you get prescribed it. To get back on track, for the next 30 days, schedule your day in 15 minute increments, leaving time for fun, exercise, eating, and relaxation. Make Wednesday your "hate you but have to do you" day to do the tasks you hate the most. Eliminate distractions. If you can't do something, do one piece of it. Hate doing invoices? Open the software you use for invoices and leave it open on your computer. Vow to spend 5 minutes on it a day to get you over the hump of avoiding doing it, whatever it is.
6	Anyone Else Attract A Lot of xNFJs?	I always find out much later that they've been harboring little crushes on me for a while. No matter how many insensitive comments I accidentally throw their way, they stick around and act like I'm the best thing since sliced bread. \n\nINFPs and ENTPs, too.
3	I (female, ENTJ} am currently in a relationship with a male ENFJ. This is by far one of the most emotionally fulfilling relationships I have ever had. We balance each others' intensities and compliment each others' opposites. My spikes turn into marshmallows around him.
2	Yeah I attract INFjs a lot, kinda annoying cus we’re just not compatible 
2	I don't know if I attract them or not, but I certainly go out of my way to try. ENFJs are hit or miss for me, but I have the absolute best conversations with INFJs. I'm usually on a very similar wavelength, which is good because I love unspoken communication, and I don't have to worry about hurt feelings because ~~they don't have any, and~~ underneath the surface they really do value logic and reason. Once I show my hand first it's generally uphill from there. 
2	Ha!!! I'm an INFP who is with an ENTJ.
2	I don’t know why I’m attracted to ENTJs.  Maybe it’s your passion to always do more/better and your straightforward nature.  \n\nYeah... actually, that’ll do it.  
1	im an isfp with an entj. it's so intense. when someone is sad it's like 10x sad. but when both moods are good we can conquer anything. 
1	If I attract them I don't know it. I attract a lot of people. I'm a little scared of ENFJ's atm...
4	Academic Survey on Personality	Hello I am a student at University and I am collecting data on Big-5, type indicator, and cluster B personality characteristics. The IRB and the Human consent pages are in included in the link. At the end of data collection I will be giving away amazon gift cards. The information is on the last page. I appreciate anyone willing to take the time. The average response time is around 15 minutes. Thank you again.\n\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/r/T2DWFXG
1	Did you get a continuation review to allow this data to be collected after 25 April 2018? \n\nAlso how do you know anyone here are introductory psychology students? Wouldn’t be be diluting data as the stated purpose of the research study is to assess 500 introductory psych students? 
1	Let us know what you find! 
1	I am curious - are you trying to correlate MBTI type to the BIg-5 space? That is interesting.\n\nDoes your survey include questions necessary to determine the Big-5 score, or do you need to take a separate test?\n\nAlso, are you familiar with the work of Jordan B Peterson where he split out each of the Big 5 into 2 sub-components? What he did seems to make sense at a quick glance, because, according to his system, it is possible to score pretty much the same on the Big-5 but be rather different. That is because his 2 sub-components are allegedly pretty orthogonal.\n\nHe published papers on this topic and has a test online but it costs like 20 bucks and it is proprietary and you cannot take it multiple times, so you better be thinking straight as you are taking it.\n
5	[ISFJ/F/30] wondering if I should reach out to ex [ENTJ/M/31] for friendship?	Hi all! I'm a female ISFJ who was in a relationship with a male ENTJ for a few months. Things started out great. I could tell that even though he was very logical and not much of a feeler, he'd show his emotions in other ways \(planning date nights seeing fancy plays, taking me out to beer festivals, introducing me to all of his friends, scheduling our next hangout at the end of the current hangout\).\n\nEverything changed just as quickly as it started. Things picked up at his work and he was pulling 55\+/hour work weeks and I had a medical scare and had to go in for some tests and exams that were pretty painful, so I wasn't as upbeat, etc. The instant these changes happened, he said he felt like the "butterflies" had gone away. He was pretty set on the fact that it was too early for that to happen, and was adamant that we end things \- even though he went silent when I asked him what he wanted from a relationship \(which is weird because he has opinions about everything\) and said he wasn't sure if ending things was the right thing to do. He expressed that this was unusual, as he usually feels pretty strongly on things.\n\nWe did end it, but he told me he wanted to be friends. I was pretty confused by his decision\-making process behind the breakup and said no. His reply was something along the lines of "yeah, that makes sense." We haven't contacted each other since then, but I've been debating reaching out to him again for a beer/to catch up. I don't like ending things on bad terms, and feel like reaching out would be okay since I've had time to process things and he indicated he wanted friendship. As an ISFJ, I'm aware the two of us are basically opposites, so I figured I'd reach out and see if other ENTJ's have insight on how reaching out might be perceived. The intent wouldn't be to rekindle the relationship, just to feel out friendship. Thanks in advance for your insight!
5	State it clearly and see what he answers. But beforehand, be honest with yourself, be sure that you are in for friendship and not consciously or unconsciouly willing for more.
3	I would definitely assume you still have feelings / want to get back together. That's what I thought immediately as I read   \n\n>The intent wouldn't be to rekindle the relationship, just to feel out friendship.   \n\nIt sounds like everything went well until external factors stressed both of you out, killing the passion. And you thought of it as a bump in the road at the time, whereas he maybe failed to connect the change in the relationship to temporary external factors and interpreted it as an inevitable, permanent change. He broke things up over this when you were certain it was a mistake. Unlucky sequence of events. So all in all, if I were you I'd have a hard time getting over that. He might think the same.   \n\nDo you believe your own words? Do you really just want to reconcile as friends? Or is there a part of you that frankly never stopped being in that relationship? Based on everything you've said here I don't see why you wouldn't still be in love with him. The only bad thing he did (in your story) was break up with you. Easy solution: Get back together.   \n\nI'd say, be ready to face this question. Why wouldn't you want to get back together? Why wouldn't that be your motive when contacting him again?
2	> I don't like ending things on bad terms, and feel like reaching out would be okay since I've had time to process things and he indicated he wanted friendship.\n\nI think this is commendable and a wonderful trait to have. Makes sense on your end to reach out.\n\n> I had a medical scare and [he lost the 'butterflies']\n\nThis doesn't sit right with me. 
1	Is he worth your investment? If it was not for long hours and medical scare, how do you rate him (as relationship potential I suppose - I assume you are into LTR). Are you looking for a husband?\n\nIf he does not score that high, then cut your losses.\n\nIf he scores high enough, I guess I would contact him with a short and positive message - the signal would be that you are happy and set with your life but would  also like to keep in touch.\n\nIf he moved on or is not receptive or some other red flags comes up, then move on while keeping him as a friend / acquaintance.\n\nThere is a possibility that he broke up for your benefit (as he saw it) because NTJs hate being dependent and not pulling their weight.\n
1	I am INFP ( male) and I am loving ENTJ. Does ENTJ female likes INFP male as their life partner.	
22	They like intact grammar for sure at least.
6	hey, to answer your question i can’t speak for all entj females out there but personally i see infp as one of the most ideal partners for me. why? because their first function is Fi and and our first function is Te so it really balances each other out in the function stack. Infps help entjs have more fun, be more comfortable with expressing their emotions and being affectionate. i have many close infp friends in my life and it such a great friendship to have, the conversation flows easily and naturally. i hope to find a infp female or male partner 
4	[deleted]
3	I find INFPs to be a good match. They are strong where we are weak and vice versa. Both INFPs and ENTJs have Te and Fi so communication is usually not an issue. But it depends on what kind of partner the ENTJ wants. 
3	Your type matters less than what you can bring to the table. I recommend feeding your ENTJ female.
7	This sorta describes us 🤔	
1	Hahahaha yes, probably less yelling \(i am a female ENTJ\), but definitely!
4	How likely are ENTJ's to stay friends with someone they dated briefly?	I dated an ENTJ male for 3-4 weeks, but then he ended it via txt. \n\nIs it likely that ENTJ's mean it when they say that kind of stuff - or was he just trying to let me down softly? 
13	Anecdotally, I don’t. I can’t speak for the group, but usually if there is a romantic leaning then once the relationship is over I find that it is best to cut all ties. I don’t really make it obvious, but I just “nothing“ them: no thoughts, no regrets, no anger, no missing, no nothing.  Of course, that’s with big relationships. Passing fancies, I usually just smile and nod, but don’t stay close.  Everyone situation is different. But if the goal is self-protection, then do what’s best for yourself and the group of friends that you may mutually share. Always take the high road.
9	I would say, for myself, unlikely. I compartmentalize people in my head into “people I am friends with” and “people I date / want to date” and the idea of people crossing from one box to another makes me feel really uncomfortable. 
5	For me it would depend on the relationship prior to dating most likely. But I would consider the relationship mostly reverting back to that state. If it was someone I met online and dated, it is unlikely I would stay in touch at all after ending the relationship. If it was someone from work, it would revert to being purely a work colleague etc.\n\nI have not kept in touch with any past relationship.
3	I have no problem staying friends and when I say it like that I usually mean it. The way I see it is that when you're dating you have to also get on well as friends. And true. You may break up for whatever reason, and lose out on all romantic intimacy but why should you give up on the friendship that was there aswell? \n\nIt really depends though who the person is and how well you get on together. 
3	Everyone on here that's an ENTJ loves to exaggerate that they have no feeling and are cold hearted etc. They like to think of themselves as these well oiled machines or military leaders.\n\nTo be honest some of us can be insecure and not know what we are doing. We get lonely sometimes, depressed or w.e just like everyone else. Meaning we need emotional support as well. \n\nMy advice is that you just have to be straightforward with your intentions and ask directly. If you liked the relationship say it. If you yourself are saying there was no deep connection, why bother posting this? \n
2	I'm friends with all but two of my ex's.  But I don't speak to them (the ones I'd consider friends) regularly, simply because I have stuff going on.  And usually, even if I haven't talked to them in a year, nothing in their life has changed (which is why we didn't work) so I don't feel like I need constant contact with them.  But we do hang out occasionally.
2	Did we date the same guy? :O \n\nHe (ENTJ) ended things with me over text.  Said we had fun and should stay friends.  I don't think he meant it.  This was 2 months ago.  We exchanged a few friendly words a week later.  Out of the blue, he said "Hey!" last week.  I asked "What's up?" and he hasn't responded.  I have a feeling he was hoping to pull off a booty call but couldn't go through with it.  I don't think I'll ever know.  \n\nFrom my experience, I'm inclined to say that he's just letting you down easy.  And not closing off his options.  Don't be his backup.  
2	Being an ENTJ I would say ...\n\nENTJ's are cold when it comes to break ups and usually don't stay friends. 
1	Damn it’s pretty hard to say 
1	Unlikely for me. I can't speak for ending things via text because I think people deserve something face-to-face, but I would just try to be as amicable as possible when doing it. \n\nGiven you only dated for a short period though (and your edit), he's probably thinking that he prefers you as a friend than as something more. Its happened with friends of mine - just depends if you are okay with that or not.
1	It depends on why it ended. If he feels betrayed it’s over for good. If he considers you’re interesting but also that you’re not romantically compatible, it could work. Just don’t imagine he will change his mind about romantic involvement 
1	[deleted]
1	The ENTJ you described in the OP was probably trying to be nice. Left the door open to talk and hang out but made his intentions clear. I personally would not end a relationship that way, I think it's wrong in most cases, but I think I'm in the minority there.\n\nI don't want to get off-track and philosophical but I strongly value change, both in myself and in others. I'm not the same person I was a month ago, let alone a year or more ago. Someone recently asked me a question about a post I'd written 5 months ago and I hardly recognized myself. So if circumstances change then obviously I'd talk to them. Grudges are unnecessarily emotional, and close-mindedness about people never leads to anything positive imo. 
1	I can,t speak for all, but this is how I see it.\n\nFriends means nothing.\nYou are either family or a tool.\nThose you would call friend, I call them cousins. When I call someone a friend. It mean I don't care at all. Now, they can evolve from friend to ''family'' or ''lovers'', but as long as your in friend category, you could die in a car crash, I wouldn't bat an eyes.\n\nWell, I'd probably feel bad if at one moment you were more than a friend in my eyes, but otherwise, I would just try to shut down the dialogue with passive text.\n\nWhen I don't intend to shut down the dialogue, there will be 900% of the time, a follow up.
6	What are some very Te things you do?	
15	I have way too many examples to go into them all, but let's go with my gym routine.\n\nI train primarily for strength & power 3-4 days per week, non-consecutive days when possible. I bring maximum intensity to everything I do, and I prefer training alone. If for some reason I don't meet the goal I walked in with, I force myself to do it. If I really can't, I go back home and research what I need to improve to meet the goal the next time. Every week I log increases in weight, speed and ease of performance for everything I go to improve. I have a very specific idea of what I want to look like, what capabilities I'm working towards, and what limitations I'm trying to surpass. I have other small goals, namely being a better fighter (MMA), tennis player, and my home gym has some bulletin boards w/ PRs and names listed. I like owning a few of those. \n\nAlso follow intermittent fasting almost unconsciously at this point, typically a 20/4 split, something like the Warrior Diet as popularized by Ori Hofmekler. Maximizes testosterone, HGH, LH and libido ;). But in all seriousness, constant improvement is as defining a trait of Te as you can find, and I hold true to this mindset. \n\nIf you'd like to know more about my morning routine, I made a video about it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjKNbfA64EE). 
11	Before I go grocery shopping I look up the most nutritious meals that I can find which support neurological function. I then search all of the ingredients online before I go shopping and write a strict grocery list of the cheapest brands before I go. This way I get the most nutritious food for the cheapest price, and the fastest shopping trip. \n\nMostly because I'm ADHD, got Al Gore post-election-loss fat and I'm trying to turn it around.
3	The way how my mind somehow can be totally taken over by my (obsessive) need for daily work efficiency and my ridiculously high academic and professional standards. Somehow, taking care of myself mentally and emotionally doesn't fit in that mind set and I often forget about taking care of *me*, next to taking care of work. I'm getting better at it, as I don't crash and burn that often anymore.. especially since I've found myself a SO who at times simply physically lifts me up from my office chair to carry me to the couch for some Netflix (and potential chill), while I'm loudly complaining to him 'but I just **can't**, I'm working!' and with him complaining loudly back at me 'I know, you're **always** working!'... yeah.. sadly he's right.. 
2	According to socionics, LIE with an enhanced Te have a bounce to how they walk, which is something everyone in my family has teased me about.
1	I literally think for my ENFP friend. Seriously. \nWe often talk, she usually says about something hard she's facing. I explain to her what does it logically mean and what she could do to change her situiation.\n\nIt works both ways, because i usually talk with her about my feelings and she tells me what i could feel about subject/event. It's opportunity for emotional developement. Also i can just unload all my feelings safely. \n\nFair trade. 
1	Developing Fi and showing intent	I'm really trying to learn how to clearly convey my innermost intentions, I'm not sure if my Fi is truly underdeveloped or if I just don't know how to express my intent effectively. I'm easily misunderstood and it annoys me to no end having to constantly explain myself to others and I'm getting to the point where I'm preemptively over explaining things to people and overwhelming them as a reaction to the constant misunderstandings.
3	I think having the ability to explain where you’re coming from is appreciated by those who are close to you. \n\nFor the majority of people though, you’re better off developing your skills to tease out where *they* are coming from.
3	I have the same issue. It's really frustrating. This especially is the case when you're carrying out a plan that doesn't really "make sense" till it's full completed and executed. It can look baffling or confusing to someone who is observing a half executed version. I think just keep doing what you're doing and let your track record of never letting people down be what convinces people of your intentions.
2	Actually, people don't care, so you don't need to explain yourself. \n\nOnly true friends and family do care, but they will ask you if they want to understand your intentions. 
11	What INTPs think about when we’re horny: Part Deux.	
6	i didn't watch that video because this is the entj sub and i didn't come here for intps
2	I see you're obsessed with ENTJs. Trying to be^in our sub? 
1	I detected some socialist undertones in that video clip.\n\n[Thomas Sowell - The Physical Fallacy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31QfLrCyBPE)\n\nAlso, the OP clip is like sooooo problematic.\n\nFat shaming, objectification of women ...\n
4	Is there anything better or more than striving to, and acheiving your goals?	What more is there to life? I told myself I was going to better those in my life even if it distanced them from me, the altruistic asshole that I am. And I'm just so good at it. What else is there than setting your mind to achieve? This seems to be the only function worth operating on. \n\nTell me ENTJs.
4	Have you tried sex?
3	Not an ENTJ, but here's what I think.\n\nI think everyone wants roughly the same thing from life, which is something like happiness. It's just that for everyone, what constitutes this happiness is different. It's possible that for you, happiness is being true to this ideal (bettering those in your life, even at the cost of having them in your life.)\n\nIt's possible, but it's not necessarily what's making you happy, or it's not necessarily what will make you happy in the future. It might be worth considering what else can make you happy--what other functions might be worth operating on.
3	Yeah, good spelling
3	Pizza.
4	Enjoying moments, sex, food. Creating art/business/music. Being heard by large audience. Actually changing someone's life. Sometimes road is better then destination.\n\nThat's for me. 
2	There's a lot more to life than goals. Maybe your question was phrased badly, because I'm sure you understand things like love , positive memories , family, philosophy, friendship, etc. If not, you need to seek these. Really no point in even asking the question if the answer is this simple.  I'm going to assume you've just gotten life down to a science. You feel like even the most basic positivities are still a system of goal achievement. To that I would say it's a matter of perspective. Everything can be simplofied and complexitied infinitely. Doesn't mean there's not intricate meaning at every twist and turn . 
3	Yes.\n\nTo crush your enemies, see them driven before you and hear the lamentations of their women.\n\nAlso, sex.
1	Until recently I probably wouldn't have responded to this, because 99% of me already agrees with you. I feel some "contractual" obligation to do most of what I do anyway, and the slippery slope that would ensue if I let that go of that notion probably wouldn't go well. \n\nThe only new insight I've accepted is that many successful people have been able to look back on a life with lasting accomplishments as well as fulfilling memories of their own. I might only be interested in the former but if it's possible to have at least some of both, why not go for both? I'd be lying to myself to say I don't keep goals that are ultimately meaningless but that I still care about anyway (e.g. improving in the gym, winning tennis tournaments, owning and investing in a business, etc.) Whatever those "meaningless yet personally fulfilling" goals are, really focus on those and I think it'll help you balance out the aggressive altruism you mentioned. You're still in improvement-mode, but at least it's for yourself sometimes. \n\n
1	Nope.
13	How do you folks shut off 'work mode'?	I'm sure a lot of us ENTJs have had this problem - our minds are spinning all the time. Even when socialising, my mind is on business.\n\nUnfortunately, at high-stress times this constant state of being 'on' has caused me to get sick - pretty much every weekend for the past four weeks, most recently. I really need a day of not thinking about my projects. Have any of you managed to 'chill' successfully and if so, what are your tips?
24	LOL if you figure it out lmk
10	I don’t think I ever shut this off, but I do try and adjust my field of focus. So work gets work hours mainly, and during relaxation time, i scheme about home improvement, personal finances, vacations, weekend plans, errands, etc. 
9	Distraction, distraction, distraction.  We can't shut our minds off, so we need to give them something else to chew on.  Computer games and audiobooks/podcasts work for me.
6	I have this problem too. After work my mind is still buzzing for hrs. \n\nMy solution is to hit the gym after work. It focuses all that energy into something completely different and I find afterwords that I’m still energised but the focus is off work and more on myself 
6	Just work towards something that you wouldn't consider work. Don't abandon your work mode; you can't; refocus it
7	Youtube and mindless carbohydrates 
3	I honestly don’t. :(
2	Do I?
2	I worked a few jobs that I hated—quit every one.\n\nI found a career the that (almost) fulfills me. Now I enjoy thinking about work stuff more than my personal life.
2	No idea. I even act like I’m in work mode when I’m drunk sometimes. 
2	I've fixed this problem by being so busy with other things that work is not my only priority. When I'm not at work I'm studying, when I'm not studying I'm paying attention to my partner and running our household. Last on the list is "me time", which might be drinking and watching youtube, cooking, or going for a walk. If I start thinking about work or study in my downtime I remind myself that I've scheduled time to worry about that on Tuesday or whenever, and go back to focusing on what I'm doing. Have a little of each every day, and you'll be more effective for it. 
2	Treat yourself like a child and create calmness through rituals. Imagine your evening starting with a nice dinner (cooking is very relaxing), then a shower or bath, where you really take time for yourself and your body, then some leisure time until you go to bed. Relaxing is a conscious decision, nothing that just naturally occurs for ENTJs, but it's not out of reach by any means. As an ENTJ you can plan the whole thing and then execute it flawlessly ;D
2	Can't stop. Won't stop.
2	Two things work for me: reading a good book and taking very long, slow walks. Your thoughts are more interesting when you don't command your mind what to do.
2	Same as I've said in a previous post, these are things that have worked for me:\n\n1. If I have the energy: I do engaging sports I.e. Rock climbing, mountain biking, kiteboarding. At least 2-3 times a week.\n\n2. If I have low energy: Gaming. Spa/sauna. Swim. Walk somewhere new.\n\n3. If I really need to break the mould and can get away: I get out of my routine and environment and go somewhere new. It forces my brain to focus on my surroundings etc. Preferably I go somewhere with nature. If I can (and have the weekend free) I seep out in nature. Make a fire. Cook a meal. Watch the stars. Hike up a mountain.\n\nI don't always manage to do all this, but they've certainly helped.
2	I bought a business <1 year ago. I have a 2month old baby. I have side projects a’plenty. I read some. I get no control over the TV. I’m mostly in charge of housework and the litter box. \n\nI don’t shut off. My rest is doing activities that I do for myself. A feeing of want and not need. I hike; doing 10 miles Sunday and 50 miles in May. I woodwork. I fish. Podcasts. Social time. I play Legos with stepson. I go to bed completely spent. 
2	I cook, exercise, and clean up after my roommates when I'm trying to calm down or take a break. Sometimes I create a very minor new project to complete, something that can benefit everyone around the house. It's a way to make me feel good and productive or creative and absolve the fact that I'm actually procrastinating/being lazy with the tasks that are more urgent.
2	I have never considered this a problem. I generally am always working on some project, and I generally look forward to spending as much time on them as I can.\nMine however have not caused me stress to the same extent (in fact I would say having things keeping me from my projects would cause me more stress)\n\nBut if I suffered as you do with stress, I think taking time away with a nice hotel and pool and such might be the ticket. When I do this I tend to take work stuff to make sure I can do a bit here and there, and try do it at a more relaxed pace. But you may want to not take anything with you at all in your case.
1	First get a hobby, it doesn't have to be anything crazy but just something else you can focus on. Then if you can't switch your focus to that go on a walk like I've seen other people recommend or even better go on a hike. If you don't like the sounds of nature take some head phones and listen to music or an audio book but actually getting away from everything else really helps me relax. When I'm around other people and technogy even if I do manage to quit thinking about work often times something will happen that will cause me to start thinking about it again. So I go on about a 4 mile hike near my apartment and for the first half it's always a little hard to get my mind off work (but I actually have some of my best brainstorming then). By the end of it though I'm thinking about my hobby (like backpacking, golf, or wood working for me) or faith or something else and feel great by the time I'm back to the car.\n\nTLDR: Find something else you enjoy and can think over, then get away from things that will trigger you back to thinking of work for a couple hours and enjoy. 
1	One or two beers should incapacitate your brain enough. Also start training for a marathon or pick some other goal that is physical.\n\n
1	Engage Se and hide in it. In a healthy way.\n\nI do acroyoga. I ignore Te and lead with active listening. I think I behave like an INFJ during these times, and some friends familiar with MBTI agree.
1	Roy Baumeister and Kathleen Vohs did some interesting research here where they talk about self control being similar to a muscle. That if you wear it out, it won’t work very well when you actually need it. So for me, “work mode” requires a lot of self-control that I have to employ. If I’m constantly using it even outside of work hours, I won’t have it for when I really need it. Anyway, I shut it off by telling myself that if I don’t shut off “work mode” then I’m wasting my resources on something that doesn’t need my energy. For example, if it’s after hours and I want to go out and party or play sports or go to the gym, I try not to think about work because thinking about it won’t really benefit me in partying or playing sports or exercising at the gym. I guess you have to be “present” and practice “mindfulness” here which I think is bologna/baloney since we are all about planning for the future. So idk, just look at it as an investment? By not overexerting yourself, you’re actually saving up “work” energy for the more important things that come up at work that actually require that energy.\n\nThat ended up being a weird slippery slope rant but hopefully you get where I’m coming from.

13	Overrepresentation Among Behavioral Psychologists For ENTJs	• Ambitious forceful, optimistic, aggressive egotistical.\n\n• **Overrepresented among behavioral psychologists**.\n\n• Among top 4 types in college GPA scores.\n\n• Among highest in college retention.\n\n• Highest grades among persisters in college.\n\nSource: [Research Statistics About Each MBTI Personality - ENTJ](https://astroligion.com/research-statistics-about-each-mbti-personality/4/)\n\n[What is Behavioral Psychology?](https://www.psychologyschoolguide.net/psychology-careers/behavioral-psychologist/)\n\nYep, I knew there was something special/magical about you ENTJs. It’s interesting that when you Google “highest gpa entj” or “entj fun facts,” most (if not all) of the sources don’t include “overrepresented among behavioral psychologists.” Believe it or not, I didn’t know about that until just now. So apparently, I wasn’t in a crazy mental state when I suddenly believed I loved you guys (especially your chicks) a while ago.
11	That may seem a little odd, but I actually think it makes sense. ENTJs are pretty driven to understand how things work, right? And ENTJs are intuitive without getting emotional.
6	Wow.  I'm a psychologist, and an ENTJ.  Interesting!
3	Not a psychologist but a sucker for psychology and neurosciences books.

4	ENTJ Women, I Could Use Some Advice	Hi, thanks for taking the time to read my post, I’m looking to get in the dating pool and could use some advice. I’ve reached a juncture in my life where the next step I take will decide who I am going to be for the rest of my life. I believe my choice of partner could determine whether I am a success or failure in that regard.\n\nI would never date someone based on their MBTI type. However, I AM looking for someone who is intelligent, hardworking, and ambitious, and I figured that this subreddit would be a good place to solicit opinions from women who fit that profile. I recognize this may not be the best place to post this, so if you feel that this is an inappropriate venue, I would be grateful for any suggestions of a better place to do so.\n\nMy strategy is to create an honest “warts-and-all” profile. My thought process is that, while it may cost me in terms of volume of responses, the chances of a successful relationship will increase, as potential partners will be able to get a more realistic picture of whether I am someone they might be interested in, and whether they feel I might be interested in them. I thought I would post a draft of my profile and incorporate any feedback on ways I could improve it. \n\n“I am a 28YO male, who is smart, hardworking, and ambitious. My goal is to have a million dollars by the time that I am 38, and 10 million by the time I am 48, and I have an actionable plan to achieve that goal. I want to make the world a better place,  but I recognize that the best way to do that is by accruing influence. I love to travel, and want to see as much of the world as possible before I die.\n\nI enjoy reading (mostly nonfiction), hiking, and watching movies. I am a dog-lover, but I haven’t have a lot of success with cats. \n\nI try to be kind, empathetic and considerate. I can be socially awkward, and I am brutally honest. I often seem serious and reserved at first, but once you get to know me, I can be warm and goofy. I’d like to think I’m funny (although many people would disagree.) I may want kids in the future, but not in the next few years.\n\nI am looking for a partner, in every context of the word. I want to have a relationship with someone I can grow with and trust implicitly. I value honesty, kindness, intelligence, and work ethic in others.”\n\n\n\n
15	[deleted]
9	I love the opportunity to be brutally honest.\n\nMy first criticism is you want to show the qualities you believe you possess, not list them out. You can say that you are smart, hardworking, and ambitious, but until I meet you in person, I would just have to take your word for it. You come across as shallow (you want $$) and a guy who's trying his best to be somebody he thinks will get the ladies. The first few sentences will only be a turn-on to a gold digger and won't mean much to a good-quality woman (at best). Since I fully intend to have a good career and make some big bucks on my own, I'm not going to care for a guy who can only bring money to the table. Being with someone who makes a decent amount of money and cares about his career is a bare-minimum expectation, not the deciding factor. As long as you met it, I would check that item off my list. It wouldn't matter how much you beat the expectation, because being rich by itself doesn't make you a good partner.\n\nHow do you want to make the world a better place? It is such a cliche line. Do you volunteer at a shelter? Why do you do it? So you can say you do it or because you actually have a passion for helping others? Be honest and sincere. I used to volunteer at a hospital just so I could get enough volunteer hours logged at my school. I'm willing to admit that I didn't decide to volunteer for altruistic reasons, but the experience also opened my eyes to the loneliness that many older folk have. It also made me realize that some older people can be assholes. However, I learned that it was important to treat even the people I didn't like with compassion. Also, do you really think the only way to make a difference is through money? That seems shallow as fuck. Just because you decide to throw money at a good cause doesn't make you a good person or even invested in that cause. Are you expecting to be the next Elon Musk and be the savior of mankind? Be realistic. \n\n"I love to travel."\nWho fucking doesn't. It's good that you'll have enough money to do it. \nWhere do you want to go? Why? Have you invested in learning about a certain culture? Do you know another language? People like to use loving to travel as a sign of their openmindedness, but you can stay in one place and be even more openminded than a world traveler if you are an avid reader.\n\nWhat do you like to read about? What kinds of movies do you like? Where have you hiked? Where do you want to hike? \n\n"I am a dog-lover, but I haven't have (should be had) a lot of success with cats."\nThis sentence is the best part of your bio. Made me laugh a little.\n\nThird paragraph: You *try* to be kind, empathetic, and considerate? Kinda barebones. Plus, everybody likes to think that about themselves. Who in the world would put "I'm a dick" in a dating profile? For your next sentence, I get that you are trying to act more down-to-earth by mentioning that you are socially awkward. I don't mind a little social awkwardness (I can be awkward as fuck), but I wouldn't want to go on a date with somebody who advertises it. I don't like putting myself in awkward situations. I would also be concerned that this could be used as an excuse by the guy to string me along ("Hey, I told you in my dating profile that I'm socially awkward and I don't know how to go from dating to a real, committed relationship!") I'm not interested in holding somebody's hand while they try to figure out how to communicate properly to me. In addition, a lot of ladies with not so great intentions could see that as a sign that you're easily manipulated (because it suggests that you might not be very good with women). \n\nEverybody gets a little shy when they meet someone they like. Once again, I would be concerned that you would use the serious and reserved shtick as an excuse for leading me on. Girls can tell when a guy likes them, but is a little shy. If they like you, they'll be fine with it. No need to put that in a profile. Next sentence is more self-deprecating humor. Being humble is fine, but you're starting to act more and more like a tragic character. Next sentence: don't mention kids. That's only something you should let somebody know if you are thinking of starting a serious relationship. I get that you're a little older and your target demographic will probably include women with ticking biological clocks, but you're getting a little ahead of yourself. If a woman is interested and thinking about having kids in the near future, she will probably be the one to bring it up. You might think you're doing women who want to have kids asap a favor by including that line, but I find it weird. Plus, it only limits the pool of available women. You want to get as many dates as possible to increase chances of success.\n\nLast paragraph: seems alright. But I find it odd that you go from trying really hard to frame yourself as an ideal partner to listing out your expectations for a partner. Going from bragging at the beginning of your profile to a bit of self-deprecation (which only exists because you felt you had to compensate for your bragging) to demanding at the end of your profile is a little overwhelming for me. I don't know a single person (even the ones who would meet your expectations) who wants to feel like they're being compared to some sort of checklist. If you go on a date with somebody and they don't meet the standards you list in the last paragraph, just don't call them again. \n\nFinal thoughts:\nAs a woman, when it comes to deciding whether to go on a first date with somebody, I would just ask myself the following question: "Does it seem like I'll have a good time if I go on a date with this person?" I don't need to know exactly what kind of person you are in the beginning. The fun of a date is getting to figure that out. In person. If you're serious and reserved but have a great sense of humor, I will notice on the date. The problem with building yourself up so much in the profile is because in the end, you aren't the judge of whether you are funny, serious, or reserved- the lady is. Also, even if you're the funniest person in the world, that is no guarantee that the lady will like your sense of humor or even care whether you're funny or not. You are spitting out a list of qualities that you think will be appealing, without giving me any indicators of who you are as a person. It shows a lack of consideration for the audience and because of that, I wouldn't go on a date with you.

5	Your bio is way too long. Please shorten it. Once I started reading about how much money you’d like to make, I lost interest. It seems a bit arrogant in a sense and as others have mentioned, you will attract the wrong women. Maybe you can mention you’re looking for an ambitious women if that’s the kind of women you want to attract. \n\n\nAnother thing is your bio is really boring. I’m sorry but add some humor in there because I know most or almost all women enjoy some kind of humor. \n\n\nLastly, your descriptions are basic. There are a thousand men out there who love dogs. Try to be creative yet funny with your bio. You can possibly say something like “I love dogs because they remind me of myself: loyal, reliable, eats anything and loves to cuddle!! Not a cat person; I‘m  always afraid that they’re plotting my death.” Something along the lines of that. Not sure if you eat everything and love to cuddle but you can totally change it to something else! haha\n\n\nGood luck!!
1	not attractive. first understand your attributes, and work on improving yourself. nobody wants a mediocre partner, someone who just wants to float around  
1	Your bio sounds really needy, no decent woman is going to want to talk to you after reading this.\n\n>"Ambitious, intellectual, and dedicated. I'm looking for a woman who can match my intensity. Message me if you think you're up to it."\n\nThis right here is all you really need. I don't know why you felt the need to throw in the "I'm gonna be a millionaire after I work hard".\n\nContrary to popular belief, women couldn't care less about money. They care about power, which entails money. And what this bio does is tell everyone that you lack power, and at the very least, a dominant/powerful stature.\n\nIt really sounds like you're saying this "I think you like money and powerful guys. I am not that kind of guy yet, but I will be! Just you wait!"
0	I would binge-watch comedy and start hitting on women in real life.
10	ENTJ’s, in your own words, is INTP actually a good match?	It says that it is, but I am not getting vibes that this is accurate. At all. 
12	For what it's worth, Im married to an INTP and we have been together for 7 years. We are very compatible as we have different strengths but both deal with stress/issues by problem solving and thinking. Honestly, I love the way his brain works.  It's the easiest and best relationship I've ever been in. I think people are different, and not every relationship is going  to work right, but this combo can be pretty enjoyable. 
22	No. They have no social instinct, and are not mobilizing at all. They like to just do their own thing, and it’s really hard to get them to work towards a goal that we think is important. \n\nINTJ is the best match I would say. INFP is great too, however this relationship match, which is based on helping each other grow from their MBTI weaknesses isn’t the best IMHO. \n\nThe INFP helps the ENTJ learn to be more emotional and is one of the few rare types that can do that. \n\nHowever, the INTJ makes the ENTJ feel more invigorated and like the two of us together can go full Te-Ni and Ni-Te. Like anything is possible. However, it does leave both lacking in the emotional realm. 
9	My girlfriend is an INTP. I agree she isn't the most socially aware. There are times when I have to overlook or cover up her social faux pas, and it's especially annoying when they affect me. \nIt is hard to get her to concentrate on a goal and how to tackle it. We are both finishing up graduate school and getting her to focus on her thesis without stressing too much was a hopeless endeavor. \n\nHowever she has helped me with connecting and understanding feelings, especially other people's.  Even though I think it's futile, people do like someone to listen to just to vent, and I've learned to do that for at least for the ones I care about.\n\nI think people who are real into this stuff, like us, forget that it's more than personality that plays a role in a relationship. We both have similar likes, interests, and hobbies. We both kind of gravitated towards each other, and if things don't work out I know I'll be just fine because I am focused on my goals
10	I've been with my INTP hubby for almost 6 years now (I'm 8w7, he's 5w6) and I love INTPs in general, so here's my two cents:\n\nThere is no other type that is *that* smart (walking wikipedias for real) and *that* kind and sweet at the same time. I mean really, what more could you want? INTPs can be objective to a fault, like they can't even help it (cue the robot jokes) - in a world full of egocentric irrational assholes hanging with INTPs is more than just refreshing, it's a lifesaver. And they're funny as hell on top of everything - fucking around with them is so much fun (their dark side is infamously fabulous).\n\nA romantic relationship with someone that has your shadow functions will be very challenging, of course. It takes a great deal of maturity and self-awareness to make that work. But the growth potential is enormous for both sides.\n\nExcept for other ENTJs there is no other type I feel closer to. And regarding INTJs: I've never felt sexually or romantically attracted to one. There are some that I admire, especially Hildegard Knef, who to me is *the* greatest diva of all time, I love her deeply. But the thing is, INTJs often seem so guarded and hung up on their egos. I personally am a sucker for sweetness and warmth, and INTPs (leading with Thinking like me) are just the perfect match. I am a rare type of ENTJ though - so/sp, so that might have something to do with it. The other type I love are ENFPs, but then again, who doesn't? :)\n\nTLTR: To me INTPs are comrades in thinking and feeling and I admire them more than any other type, because nothing, and I mean nothing, beats the allure of innocently and helplessly objective sweethearts (who also happen to be smart as fuck).
15	Absolutely not. Very strange creatures. Become elusive and live in a fantasy world of fiction. Formulate all their thoughts and reasonings on their fluffy daydreams of how the world maybe is. Barricade themselves in their fantasies and expect to not be laughed at when only frivolous waste spills out of their mouth. I went on a date with an INFP who couldn’t tell me where Germany was on a map, but could tell me all about his fluffy dog’s personality. Unuseful!
4	To offer a counterpoint to the other post in this thread, one of my favorite people in the world is an INTP. He's not very much like me, but I find he has insight into situations I would never think of. Plus, he's a great guitar player, and he exudes "cool." I view him as a "foil" to me, since he often provides insight into a completely different, yet equally adequate, way of thinking.
3	👍 So informative, appreciate it!!
5	I am a gay xNTJ, and my best friend in college was a good-looking, straight, female INTP, and  we naturally gravitated to each other to the point where a lot of our other friends kind of took it offensively. \n\nShe said she'd been sexually/romantically interested in me before she found out I was gay, and whenever we'd be rolling on MDMA at raves, she'd always want to make out and we usually did. \n\nI'm pretty sure we would have ended up together if I were straight, and she wouldn't have ever gotten with this guy she's dating now, whom I think she's going to marry even though he's super sensitive and totally not right for her. 
5	I have never had a positive relationship of any kind with an INTP, despite a pretty large sample size. They are among my least favorite people to be around, and it's a shame because I know it's been a good match for other ENTJs I know.\n\nTheir social incompetence irritates me more than anything else. Forget misreading social cues -- I will literally be looking away, walking away, or have said "goodbye" and the conversation just doesn't fucking end. After every encounter I feel like I've just finished another episode of [Salad Fingers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpVTORX_ifk&t=1239s). \n\nAlso every discussion I have with an INTP is a complete waste of my time. If they disagree, it's almost always "but here's another little factoid I know", or "but here are all these hypothetical scenarios you didn't think of!", neither of which ever directly address my point. And when I force them to address my point, or present them with objective proof that undermines the perfect conclusion they have in their head, they just shut down completely. So much for the reservoir of knowledge that's supposed to complement my way of thinking. \n\nBest matches (for me) have been INxJs, and I get along great with INFPs. Don't know where this one fell apart for me but I hope I meet someone who will change my impression. 
2	I have an INTP friend of 7 years. For results-based things, it's great. I reason it out to her, she lets me take the lead, and she does the back end. No one is worried about power imbalances. We get the job done. Zero emotion, maximum efficiency. \n\nFor perspective? Whole different story. We almost never agree on the small things. Generally we're of the same opinion, but once you get down to the nitty gritty, it's irreconcilable. We basically ignore the small things and agree to disagree. \n\nIt's a perfectly amicable, long-lasting, and steady friendship. But dating an INTP? I don't know, it probably would drive me up the wall. 
2	Our orientations don't match.\nFor anyone recommending INFPs, sure if you're suicidal.\n\nISTJs if you want home life maintenance.\n\nTo be considered is INTJs, ENTPs and ENTJs.\n\nINTPs and ENTJs love is too...distant.
1	Best relationship matches for an ENTJ are listed here - [**Types for ENTJ relationships**](http://personalitycafe.com/intp-articles/282-love-types-intp-20.html#post10020018). Basically ENTJs find it easier to emotionally connect with types who have strong Fi, ENTJ's inferior feeling function, and who can read and support them emotionally. These types are dominant Fi ones: ISFPs and INFPs, and auxiliary Fi ones: ESFPs and ENFPs. Other types that ENTJs intersect with are types with strong Se like ISTPs and ESTPs, however emotionally there might be a gap here.            \n    \nWhen it comes to INTPs they don't have any Fi (nor Se, nor Te) and so they view the world very differently from ENTJs. At first this difference might be attractive, but it can also be bewildering. INTP-ENTJ relationship is called "contrary" in socionics and it's described at that link above. Contrary relationships are really medium comfort level relationships. I know at least one long term ENFJ-female INTP-male marriage (20+ years together) that is successful in their careers and loving in raising their two kids, so this pairing of types certainly can work out.

1	Mindfullness	So how do I practice mindfulness? How do I become immersed in the moment?\n\nI've been told to not focus on the destination but to instead focus on the journey. I've been told to stop thinking to empty my mind.\n\nThese quotes seem to have some relevance:\n\nhttps://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fchi-nese.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2015%2F06%2Fbruce-lee-quotes-2.jpg&f=1\n\nhttps://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse4.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.1OUrK0n2lVOfExZ94XBkRAHaE6%26pid%3D15.1&f=1\n\nhttps://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwordstowisdom.files.wordpress.com%2F2012%2F07%2Fbruce_lee_quo.jpg&f=1\n\nhttps://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fchi-nese.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2014%2F10%2Fbruce-lee-quotes1.jpg&f=1\n\nhttps://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2F4.bp.blogspot.com%2F-1CrXu2fjp1M%2FU_sjNVE4SUI%2FAAAAAAAAY_s%2FhqvDijwsSjc%2Fs1600%2F1270.jpg&f=1\n\nhttps://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fs-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com%2F736x%2F76%2F63%2F7f%2F76637f8d7b3fabba2c4208fc382033e4--quote-pictures-quotes-pics.jpg&f=1\n\nhttps://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fs-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com%2F736x%2F99%2F53%2Fda%2F9953da29dac7be32255ddcc3965bbf7f.jpg&f=1\n\nhttps://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse1.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP._6MHlbcM37Y_Yg5Zqm5wkgHaEL%26pid%3D15.1&f=1
1	Go find a mindfulness center near you and check it out.   I did and it was helpful. 
1	[deleted]
1	You say that you can look up resources for free but you're here asking the basics? You're better off in some other sub, maybe mindfulness subs... ENTJs aren't the best at mindfulness and also... people on this sub are hardly experts at that. I'm confused as to what you thought this post could do for you
1	You can go to a free meditation center that teaches Vipassana. It's pretty time consuming and a serious commitment though. Coming out of it you will understand meditation much better as a result.\n\nIt's about 100 hours of meditation over 10 days. You aren't allowed to bring any forms of entertainment and you can't talk with anyone. You are not supposed to look at anyone or interact with them in any way. It's strongly recommended that you stay until the end of the course. On the last day you are allowed to socialize again.
2	Developing Te & Ni	Hello everyone.\n\nI've been looking into improving some of my weaker functions, Ni and especially Te. I'm ISFJ and i understand that these two functions are my weaknesses. I would like to a have a better grasp of them and to be able to use them practically and with less strain. Any tips?\n\nThanks in advance.
5	You could get a gf or bf thats ENTJ, I have a girlfriend thats ISFJ and we really complete eachother. 
4	Te = “what needs to happen next, and what is the most effective way that I can make that happen?”\n\nTe doms naturally employ this as their primary cognitive function, which is why we have a reputation (if we are unhealthy, immature, or under high stress) for bulldozing others. This is our default thought process before we consider feelings or values, of ourselves or others, which heathy Te doms will also employ in the context of meeting the goal.\n\n\nNi = “what can I derive from my past observations that will be useful in imagining future outcomes based on what I know right now?”\n\nThis plays out for Te doms in terms of hunches and gut feelings that tend to focus on systems, concepts, things, and products.\n\nAmong those who favor feeling functions, the same tendency manifests as high understanding of people, relationships, etc.\n\nNi is very future oriented and is adept at gathering data and trends or patterns on an unconscious level that may be used for useful future predictions.\n\nIf this is a weak spot for you, I would advise taking a step back in observation and avoid hyperfocus on the immediate present and/or data from your 5 senses (which is your sensing preference). Avoid thinking of things or situations in terms of how they affect you personally or emotionally, and instead view people or situations from a strategic angle. This will help you from becoming emotionally engaged and clouding your judgment or causing distraction.\n\nI hope that helps!
9	Anyone else here have little trouble discussing their inner feelings, having rationalized that that its the most effective way to root out internal problems, especially when caught in the Fi grip?	I honestly dont know if its an emotional response for me or if my emotion and logic happen to align, but when under intense stress I am very quick to objectively conclude that disclosing my feelings is the quickest way to resolve the problem. Albeit, those feelings usually come out spewing like a garden hose.
5	Yeah\n\nIt's cause when you do spew like a garden hose, the problem becomes more part of objective reality and then you start to formulate plans [that you already had but now you're forced to spell them out]\n\nLet it all loose. It's therapeutic and it honestly doesn't matter who you talk to (for the most part) because you probably know what you're going to do, but it needs to become part of actuality
1	Not seeing this in my partner has been the cause of so mucb trouble. 
1	It depends. \n\nWhen I understand my feelings, I am able to let it all out in one big dose and usually hearing myself say them out loud makes me understand the feelings better. Having someone repeat my feelings back to me also helps. After a session of hearing the feelings said out loud, I usually am better able to move on and get back to being normal.\n\nHowever, there are also multiple occasions when I can't explain why I'm upset or feeling shitty - that's when I clam up and prefer not to talk about it and just ride out the negative emotions with sleep and time. 
10	How do you guys get into hyperdrive?	I am an entj but I find it hard for me to get into hyperdrive espescially at the end of the year. When I do I get so much stuff done with great quality while being happy. On the contrary when im not I get so distracted and kind of just half assing. So how do you guys get into hyperdrive and stay in it. Also how do yall motivate yourselves. 
13	Been struggling with this, too. However, I have found two things that help me get into hyperdrive:\n\nFeeling that the work itself is productive/useful, socially or personally.\n\n An experienced person gives me a general assurance that it can be done, but someone else says I can't do it. Nothing gets me focused more than being told I'm not good enough.\n\nMultiple Edits: Formatting
11	(e/I)ntj, if I am interested in something I am automatically in hyperdrive. You literally cannot shake me out of it. I have never had to try to be in that mode. 
8	For me I like to list what needs to be done; everything from schoolwork to housework. Then, I like to triage the work and start on the things that really need to be done NOW. That usually helps me to build momentum and I start doing the things that are due later. Usually, at this point I'm having so much fun(I'm a workaholic) that I finish most, if not all of my list.\n\nTLDR: JUST START
4	Commit to a regular, high-intensity exercise routine and keep eating - it will help keep your energy and capacity to go-go-go at maximum. I also like to take nootropics to maintain focus and amplify my brainpower.
1	I pretend I am late for the airport and that I need to finish everything right away. And lots of coffee.
1	For work projects or hobbies I'll focus on what the job will look like when it is completed well and then start to construct a mental narrative of my future satisfaction and success. Once I have a solid idea and vision I use that to sustain me through the work.\n\nE.G. I'm making a 15-minute mockumentary to entertain a couple friends and it is a ton of work but I keep visualizing the completed project, them enjoying it, and my satisfaction with having implemented my plan successfully. All of that makes the work fly by (for me at least).
1	Are you making your own art yet? Are you crafting the ultimate experience for others? Watch this vid to learn more: https://youtu.be/WracDPYfTww
1	Write your goals daily. Visualize success. Make plans to achieve them.\n\nIf you review your goals everyday and stay focused on what you want, you'll find the motivation to pull through the drudgery. Once I'm focused on a goal, nothing can stop me.
1	You have to admit that you need people's help. Think of what got you to your first hyperspace adventure. I work in a senior management team. The more you think of making a team of teams that can help you focus your work. Do not forget to take a vacation before Independence Day. 
1	Get up early and eat breakfast before work. If I don't do that, I can just about guarantee a shitty day. Also, as others have said, work out. There are innumerable benefits to hitting the gym, including more energy and stamina. A healthy diet is also very important.
3	How can I be a good leader as an INTP? I like being a leader, but I can't seem to push people to finish their work.	Title explains it all. I wanted to ask the type that tend to be the best leaders.
9	There are so many variations of leaders becoming a “good one” only means fitting the type of leadership for the situation or set of circumstances or people.\n\nLeaders are not destined to be leaders all the time or in every situation. A “good” leader knows when to lead and when to follow. If your definition of leadership is getting people to finish their work it’s a reflection of your investment and perspective. \n\nIt also has a lot to do with how people perceive you. \n\nYou want to be a good leader? It takes A LOT of personal development. It has NOTHING to do with getting people to do what you want them to do it’s about putting in the effort to understand the dynamic of each person, including yourself, and working with the influential factors around the goal.\n\nI’m not sure if I’m a leader but I always find myself in leadership positions but it’s probably because I’m very strategic about where I place my effort. I see a lot of people in management positions wanting people to do A and then people wanting to do B etc.\n\nThe best leaders leave you alone and give YOU the tools you need to succeed. The reverse investment means those same people will do things because they respect you and they are grateful you placed the effort in the first place. \n\nI hope this helped I wish I knew more details. 
5	I have a really good friend who is an ENTJ. Something I've noticed that contributes to his ability to naturally be a leader is his will to be a leader. He has this natural conviction in knowing that what he's doing is the right thing for the organization or group that he is leading. I think it really comes down to that conviction that other people notice. It also comes across as a very assured way of communication where he clearly has positioned himself to be the authority figure.
4	Be direct and firm, but treat people differently depending on their nature.  Some people need a fire lit under their ass, and others need to be reminded how great they are.  And lead by example before anything else.  Taking action yourself while also being direct to others will make people naturally drawn to you. 
3	As an ENTJ myself I don't think there's much to it to be honest. The same rules that apply to being likeable as a person apply to being likeable (and therefore respected) as a leader. Use your Fe - a lot. Always consider the other person's *possible* feelings before even opening your mouth. Be enganging, honest and accountable, and cut right through the bullshit if needed. If someone is giving you a headache (as in not finishing on time), explain to them the consequences of them not following through and make clear that a mess like that is not an option. End of fucking story. #ENTJStyle
2	Are you passionate about the work you're accomplishing? Do you have a desire for excellence in everything you do? Do you crave excellence to such a degree that it is felt by those around you?\n\nThe first step is to bring passion and fire to whatever you are trying to accomplish. Focus on yourself first. Read on your subject, experiment with different approaches and try every day to do the absolute best you can do. Don't do this because you want to be a leader, do it because you believe in what you are trying to achieve.\n\nWhen people see the fire and passion in your eyes, they'll start to believe in your vision as well. If they don't, and you have the authority to override them, you should be so passionate about your objective that you disregard the feelings of your underlings. This isn't to be cruel, but you should always keep the motto "Our objective comes first".\n\nWin them over with passion at first. If that doesn't work, you shouldn't give a shit about their feelings and push them to perform.
1	Why not? What is that gets in your way?
1	leadership is contextual 1  \n2 your problem with resolute communication comes from lacking information. and a purpose and overestimating emotional layers.  \nthink more , analyze more or rather efficiently, and you will understrand that there is only 1 best practice for each context )  \n
1	What a creative troll. Mademereply/10
1	It's 100% experience. Just take more leadership roles. \n\nYou gain the most experience in volunteer roles where your followers can leave you and have more time and money. In that setting, you're forced to learn how to polish carrots and let your stick gather dust.\n\nTry volunteering for something at church and/or the library. Find something to improve and then gather the forces required to get the job done. 
1	Do they know, what's THEIR work? Are they obligated to do so or they want to work because it's moving them to their goal? \n\nMan, I used to be shitty leader. Now, I am a little better then shitty leader. You should be concerned about their needs, challenges and obstacles. In group there's no YOU. "We" mentality that ought to be preserved.

5	Thoughts on Certain Types of Posts?	Does anybody else love clicking on those "ENTJ Appreciation" posts? I have trouble investing the time in longer posts if they don't immediately grab my attention, but I'll read those things top to bottom and wish there was more to read. 
3	A lot of young people dive in MBTI in search for meaning, hence these kind of behaviours. Be tolerant.
3	If someone has a genuine question and wants advice, I'll invest the time to respond. Doesn't matter how long the OP is, or how long my post ends up being. Honestly, a post about how "appreciated" I supposedly am is probably the last thing I'd want to respond to. Seems like a waste of time. \n\nObviously I would prefer not to read everyone's autobiography but I'd be expecting too much. I have no one to go for advice and never did, so alleviating that for somebody else seems worth the extra 2-4 minutes. Personally, if I'm not using this platform to create value then I'm not sure what I'm doing here anymore. 
4	I kind of cringe at those. Why not Irish appreciation day? What about Irish that suck?\n
2	Reading posts seems like a lot of work. And just picking out a few words is enough to realize a post pretty much fits one of the standard posts, no reason to read the same post over and over.\n\nGenerally I don't read posts.
1	Perhaps this video may help you: https://youtu.be/WracDPYfTww
26	All in or nothing	When I start doing something I often want to stick to it and not doing it halfway. For example if I would start meditating I would decide to do it every day, if I forget about it thus ruining the streak; I loose all motivation for it. Is this just me or is it a typical ENTJ way of thinking? Now that I am writing about it I feel like this is more of a introverted way of thinking. What are your thoughts on this?
14	I am the same. The cure's name is discipline and it is best practiced by journaling. Keep a journal of your meditations, which day how long. Keeping track helps to keep up. That's how I got the best results with meditation, food, sport, work, reading... almost anything that requires discipline to stick on.
9	It's a perfectionist thing. ENTJ might be more prone to perfectionism. 
6	I’m the same! With things I’m the most passionate about though, the slip ups or mistakes don’t take me away from being 500% in, I carry on when it’s really important to me.
3	Doesn't it have to do with ENTJ's wanting to get the most out of something and when they realize that they can't get the most of it anymore they feel like it does not matter anymore.
3	I'm the same, although I'm not sure it stems from a perfectionist tendency. I don't need to be perfect, I just want to get the most out of whatever it is I'm doing and I question the prurpose of it if I can't give it my all. Seems like a waste of my time and energy if I can't give it my all. \n\nAny time I'm forced to meander in between "all or nothing" I feel immense discomfort. For example, I know I'm leaving my current job in January, and I'm finding it VERY difficult to remain motivated because I know this job is coming to an end. So I just sort of dog it day in and day out and it's very uninspiring. \n\nMy relationship is also somewhere in this middle point. It's long distance and relatively new, so I'm somewhat forced into this awkward middle spot. I hate it. I will probably just end it as this middle ground is literally making me feel crazy.\n\nDoes anyone else sometimes wish they had enough patience to just "take it day by day" and to just "see what happens"? Sigh.
2	I relate to this. I think other personalities don't understand our perfectionist tendencies and our hated of being "bad" at something. They see it as really "intense" in a bad way. I'm 1000&#37; in or not at all! But the moment I realize I won't be good at something, or I lose patience, I lose all interest. 
2	Yeah sounds liek Si trickster. That is outlined in this video: https://youtu.be/WracDPYfTww
2	I'm the same, i'm an ENTP, but tested ENTJ a few times 🤷🏻‍♀️
2	I’m the same. Probably the ENTJ way of thinking. Like, why waste your time doing something if you’re not going to give it your all? Something worth it should receive all your devotion and attention. Half assing things is just lazy lol.
1	I’m an INTP and i can relate
1	I relate to this
1	Relatable. I once decided to eat every day, but then one day I forgot to eat, so I quit.\n
1	Yeah, I do this, too. I can be completely committed to something and then one slip up and getting back on track feels impossible. I'm also very impatient. When I decide something, I want it to happen immediately. And I really struggle with changing my mind when I've made a decision, even when I know my initial decision wasn't the right one. 
1	I'm ENFJ and I relate to you. 
3	INTJ - How to beat an ENTJ?	Hi guys and gals from /r/ENTJ, I'm an INTJ and friends/enemy with an ENTJ who does not consider me an equal, and sees me as a fool, even though I have shown that I am intellectually equal (if not better) than her. How do I prove my worth and beat her at her own game? Any weaknesses to exploit? Thank you.
31	The moment you want to beat this person, you already lost.
17	If you were to come up with a cure for cancer, that would really show her. Chop chop!\n\nP.S. If you really do, credit me for giving you the idea, please!
14	As an anonymous ENTJ bystander— \n\nIf I already thought you were a bit of a fool, this would surely deepen my belief. I would look down on your need to compete with me/prove something, and I’d instead be curious about what kind of acceptance you’re seeking. \n\nIt’s hard to really understand it being a friend/enemy, but the ENTJ you describe seems to have all the control over you right now. Are you seeking their approval? Their admiration? Their kinship? Their submission?\n\nOn the other hand... What would I respect? You being true to yourself and not playing funny games with exploits or intellectual nonsense. \n\nSounds like you’re a little pissed at this person. After that wears off, what do you really want?
13	What's the point? Are you trying to fuck her?
11	You just have to win the logical argument.\nAfter you win, show no interest in her
8	Establish your dominance. Make loud grunting noises while jumping up and down and pounding your fists on the ground.
7	Fool her into buying you coffee. Then, if you keep the receipt, there is tangible proof you beat her.
7	she's just trolling you. Entj likes to poke you to see your reactions. if you were considered inferior by her view, she propably would even talk with you.
6	Beat her in what exactly? \nYou want the respect or to actually beat the ENTJ at something? 
7	[My thoughts on this post](https://imgur.com/gallery/XsZe9)
4	How to beat an ENTJ? With a stick. Personally I prefer oaken ones. You're welcome. 
3	Like some have already pointed out, you have to be yourself. As an Entj, I really hate try-hards, but I don’t hate people who might be less intelligent. If you just act yourself and accept who you are and stop worrying so much about people liking you + seeking people’s approval, you will be happier and I (speaking as an ENRJ) will like you a lot more. There’s nothing better than authenticity in a person :) just remember that and you’ll be golden. It’s hard to get an upper hand with an ENTJ, we always want to be on top 
2	A troll post or...? INTJs know how to "beat" ENTJs and vice versa lmao 
2	Show her your penis and/or multiple peni if you have a spare. I always keep a few spares. \n\n
1	Sorry, you can't. Especially since you've already lost!
1	A bullet /s
1	tell her you think she's stupid ezpz\n\n
1	Produce more than she does. Don't let the hang ups in this video get you down: https://youtu.be/DPLzbSyQ10U
1	She's likely not playing a game so there's nothing you can beat her at. If you want her to respect her you need to understand why she doesn't. Are there other people she does respect? What's the difference between them and you? All of this sounds like a waste of time though. If someone acted like that towards me (assumed an attitude of superiority) I would disrespect that person right back, not get desperate for approval. She doesn't sound nice so why do you want her to like you? Is she hot?
1	Not sure if I would consider someone who holds me in such low regard a friend. Despite this, let us remain on topic. You intimated a desire to beat her at her own game -- despite giving little to no context -- so you will receive a certain degree of mixed answers. In essence, the only way to trump her would be to emulate her behavior or illustrate a competence far beyond her original assessment. The former would be seen as redundant, because I do not believe she cares either way. The latter, however, requires a fair amount of ingenuity, an effort far exceeding that I would be willing to put forth.\n\nAre you infatuated with this woman or is there something else that drives this peculiar disposition?
2	Intp and Entj	Hi guys,\n\nINTP woman here surrounded by ENTJs. (architects world) Fell in love for the first time. I didn't know what to do with my feelings and couldn't find solid reasons for him liking me. I felt I couldn't make him happy contrary to other women. So I started avoiding him although  I truly loved (and still) him. He wasn't indifferent to me, but somehow, was hurt by my aloofness, and already moved on. (find his dual ISFJ gentle girl) \n\nAny happy story between entj and intp to cheer me up?  :) (romance or not)
8	My best friend is an INTP, so I understand INTPs kinda well, you have to talk to him. We, ENTJs hate when people are not being honest and direct. Obviously talking to him for the first time telling him you're in love is not a good idea. You should start being friends and you should let him be a little dominant but it's important that you stand out for yourself when disagree so that he doesn't find you stupid. Something that could work is you creating a very impressive architectural project so that he values your talent, then he'll probably talk to you and you have to ask him to go out for a drink or something. Then have fun and again and again. You have to work on your appearance but the inside is very important, ENTJs are a bit sapiosexual so you have to prove that you're smart but don't brag. English is not my first language so this will be written in a child's language. Hope it goes well! And when you do this please tell me how it went hehe.
3	Oh dear, this is so similar to my story...I’m a female INTP in my late 20 and an ENTJ male in the same industry started liking me and pursuing me for 3 months. I couldn’t figure out why he liked me as I considered him way above my league in terms of his looks, success, charm etc. He’s been an entrepreneur since high school and owns few companies at 23 while studying for a masters. I started avoiding him as I didn’t feel good enough for him. He knew I was very much into him but dealing with some other pressing matters. After a long while he got tired of my aloofness and told me I could get in touch again when I feel ready.  Almost 2 months have passed now and I’m thinking he’s already moved on with a more happy go lucky confident girl.\n\nI’d suggest to try to get in touch with him and see what he’s been up to and if he’s still interested in you.  I’m also planning to do this very soon. \n\nIt’s a shame to let go someone you’re really into and the interest is reciprocated just because of some silly insecurities. You’ll never know how the story would have unfolded if you don’t try your luck. 
2	INTP + ENTJ is actually highest compatibility. I highly recommend it. Please check out these three videos to find out more:\n\nINTP/ENTJ compatibility: https://youtu.be/rAX6kEed_8U\nINTPs: https://youtu.be/WZBEuKPPEx0\nENTJs: https://youtu.be/WracDPYfTww
1	ENTJ girl here. Dated an INTP. He was a bit emotionally dead inside, but I think that had less to do with his INTP status and more to do with how emotionally dysfunction \(and the INTP personality made it worse\). He was aloof, cold hearted, selfish, and really insensitive. \n\nIf you like an ENTJ, avoiding him is NOT going to help your situation. You need to hit us over the head sometimes, we can't read your mind!
1	There are happy stories and you certainly should not avoid them. ENTJs have inferior Fi so if they don't find any response to their interest they decide very quickly that you're not interested and move on. I know of one 20+ year marriage between INTP man and ENTJ woman that is doing great so it's possible to find your love with this type or another. Socionics duality predicts compatibility in communication and behavior, but this doesn't always translate into love :) 
1	Young person, stop obsessing over some person that you do not even know that well.\n\nStop assuming things and take some risks; otherwise you will die of old age not knowing how the story could have ended.\n
4	How many ENTJ 1w2's are out there?	I've tested multiple times for both my MBTI and Enneagram types, I've always seemed to come out the same so I'm fairly certain I'm legitimately this type. Are there any others? I feel very different from a lot of other people and would love to know if anyone else is similar to myself, I'm highly empathic and tend to be misunderstood. I have also delved deep into understanding the cognitive functions and how they work in tandem and individually and after all of that study and research I still believe I'm an ENTJ especially after reading multiple in-depth analysis of the type and other similar types.

2	ENTJ, Extrovert but Introverted sometimes.	Hey, im 17 and have just found out about Carl Jungs 16 personality types, this stuff is really facinating. I did some tests and I turned out to be an ENTJ. I agree with a lot of the things that ENTJ's have but there are some things that does not fit into my personality and the ENTJ. The one that i've been thinking about is me being an extrovert around some people but not others, this really bugs me because I hate having different personalities around different people, I want to be the same person whether I am around my friends in school or if I am around people in my Jiu-Jitsu practice. Talking to people that are in my own age group I do not find any difficulty doing but when I am around adults i just get shy and scilent, I hate this because I feel like I need to socialize in order to feel good. So what do you think? Am I some kind of mix inbetween Extroverted and Introverted? How should I deal with this?
8	Being *socially* extro/intro\-verted is different from being *functionally* extro/intro\-verted.\n\nThe **ENTJ** functions are: **Te\-Ni\-Se\-Fi**. Our dominant function is Extroverted Thinking and it's one that first and foremost informs the functions that come after. Te can be thought of a function that seeks efficient, effective engagement with the world around them. It's a function that is inclined to quantify the world and be very systematic about it. This function can sometimes be overbearing and too domineering as it tries to maximize outcomes. Te is more likely to play with new information than examine new information. It can be useful to think of Te being concerned with the What instead of the Why.\n\n\(instead of INTJ, I'm going to contrast ENTJ with INTP\)\n\nThe **INTP** functions are: **Ti\-Ne\-Si\-Fe**. The dominant function is Introverted Thinking. Ti looks to confirm the world around them by analyzing its logicality \(or illogicality\).  It's a function that is inclined to be concerned with the underlying factors of how things work. This function can sometimes be over\-critical as it requires a lengthy amount of time to analyze methodologies and sometimes lacks the grammatical syntax \(or words\) to express its ideas. Ti is more likely to examine new information than play with new information. It can be useful to think of Ti being concerned with the Why instead of the What.\n\nIt would be more helpful *for you* to read about Extroverted Thinking and Introverted Intuition to determine which you are more inclined to.\n\nAs well as, u/11LeRichard11 is right, ENTJs can be the most reclusive of types \(it's cause of the Inferior Feeling imo\).\n\nEdit: WHAT MY POST LACKS is the depth of the functions because, generally, when I talk about the functions I sort of talk about them by themselves which is only the surface of the functions. Te doesn't act independently from the following functions and vice versa, but for this conversation it helps to compartmentalize \(muh Te\) them.
4	I’d say you’re an ambivert. More extrovert than introvert but an ambivert nonetheless\nEdit: Very few people are truly intoverted or truly extroverted, hence the majority is ambiverted
5	I am also an ambivert, but I think there's a better way to look at your question than comparing yourself to how your MBTI type should be, or any other arbitrary percentages of people that are like you. Generally, introversion and extroversion are on a spectrum. If you're someone like me who sits very closely to the middle of that spectrum, then in some situations you will be recharged by others, while in other cases you'll be recharged when left to yourself. \n\nI'd also take it a step further though, since leaving it there is too vague. Sometimes I want to be left alone because I know I am the best person in the room to complete a task, and the task needs to get done. In other words, I'd actually love to sit and work with someone else, but that person is unavailable. It's not "shyness", as much as having priorities that need to be met, even if I will meet them alone. \n\nAlternatively, sometimes I'm surrounded by people who are not making any stimulating conversation whatsoever. Individuals like that drain the hell out of me. Instead of constantly rephrasing, repackaging or just bearing the consequences for everything I say, I'd rather leave and be alone. I'd have more peace in my own thoughts than around these people.\n\nSo consider when you engage, when you withdraw, and what factors bring that about. Maybe you are an extrovert that's just shy around certain people/situations, or maybe you're really an introvert who needs that rapport to be able to open up. It's all about knowing yourself and your boundaries. 
3	Don't forget ENTJs are known to be more reserved than many other extroverted types too.\n\nI can relate. Some of my friends are a little surprised I score as an extrovert, but those who know more about Myers-Briggs, or even about personality more generally, are not surprised.
3	why do you hate the fact that you'll turn into a different person in different social environments?
3	My current understanding of myself is:\n\nPrimary ENTJ\nOverwhelmingly strong Empath\n9w? Enneagram. ? fluctuates. Social Instinct. Some one-on-one.\nMy strong empath tendencies have led me to periods of time where I seem to be INFJ because I will beat myself up for stepping on people's toes. I think this is useful and comfortable for short periods of time (short = a few hours at a time), but if I ignore my ENTJ drive to accomplish things my life becomes unbalanced and I'm not a fun person for others to be around.\n\nDepending on the person, I will talk a lot with them, or I'll listen a lot with them, or I'll do both. Some people I want nothing to do with. I'm actually really picky with who I'm open with.\n\nI think of myself as a social chameleon. I think it has more to do with social 9 tendencies than it does tendencies commonly spoken about under the realm of MBTI.\n\nHope this helps.
1	Yeah so if you are introverting then you are an ISFP or INTP. It's all about shifting into your subconcious or unconcious. Use this video for reference: https://youtu.be/WracDPYfTww

4	ISTJs. It's animal with them. I have pictures of my back slashed by the nails of an ISTJ girl with whom we had sex two days and nights.  \nINFPs for oral sex. Passionate/tender/romantic sex also.  \nINTJs & INFJs for anything fetish and unusual.  
7	INTJs
4	INTJ for sure. Nothing in comparison. 
2	ENFJ and ENTJ hands down have been the best for me. You can watch both of these to get an idea of how they are different:\n\nENTJ: https://youtu.be/WracDPYfTww\nENFJ: https://youtu.be/fmzYW_0mfJk\n\nI just really enjoy Se child in the bedroom. I also enjoy Se inferior.

1	Hmmm, never thought to ask their type. Didn't really seem relevant at the time.

14	How do you guys get out of hyperdrive?	Female ENTJ in college told me that she sometimes wishes she could just take a break from constantly getting involved in school orgs and projects, and take a step back from her life and just not do anything for once. Have any of you managed to achieve this state of “being” without constantly thinking about what’s next?
27	No, even in my down time whats next is always in the back of my head. I have to take a vacation somewhere far far away from everything in order to truly unplug from my life and plans. More than a week camping in the mountains will do it, also 10 days in the islands or a cruse ship have worked in the past.  
13	Weed
13	I use my body as a governor for my brain by exhausting myself physically. Swimming has been my favorite but I’ve started running and boxing recently. Nothing better than pushing myself physically until I can just drift off to sleep; like magic for me. I’ve been trying meditation too but sometimes it feels like I’m pulling the ebrake on the freeway and is frustrating to me so back to running!
11	By running out of fuel.
9	 Nope. In it to win it. \n\n\(Kidding \- yes, sometimes I feel manic and overwhelmed and I feel like everyone else is lazy or shallow in their inability to think about everything constantly...\)
5	I've found that getting out in nature and doing engaging sports helps to bring me in the moment and deal with stress. I used to go to the gym regularly (6 times a week), but I got bored as it wasn't stimulating mentally and i could still think about work.\nI've since taken up a lot of sports like rock climbing, kiteboarding, mountain bike riding and hiking. The different sports give me variety and more options depending on the weather. I like these sports in particular because you don't have the opportunity to think about anything else. If you're not focused on what you're doing you'll fuck up and it can be dangerous/scary. (Less so with hiking obviously, but it's nice to climb a mountain and feel the achievement, then appreciate the view). They're also far more mentally stimulating than repetitively pushing/pulling weights or doing exercises.
3	Those are the times for examining the risks involved in the next fifty moves.
3	Not sure if this will work but think of rest as a catalyst to productivity. So now it is a good priority, why don't they plan for rests as well? Since everything is planned out by them, they shouldn't worry much right?
3	I guess rather than "not doing anything", which makes me lethargic, I just make sure to do things I find enriching that I enjoy. Catch-up with friends, get out into nature, weekend away with my partner. 
6	Can't stop. Won't stop.
2	Honestly, I do yoga at home, and while I can't help but think the spiritual part is a load of crap, it actually quiets the voice in my head. 
1	Damn jealous of this personality lol
1	Training for a marathon should do it.
1	NO WAY. Be in it TO WIN IT. There’s no way I’m as successful as I am without the hyperdrive. It’s what sets us apart. Fucking embrace it. No one else has it. You’ll do great things. 
1	Whenever i fill, i am "burning out" my brain, i practice mindfulness. I focus on breath and observe myself. No judge, no comment, no care. I just watch myself and it decreases my hyperdrive. Srsly it works. 
1	little late to the party, but mediation. start small, do ten minutes a day. "if you can't find ten minutes a day to meditate. you should meditate for an hour. "
1	Why would you want to leave
1	Please give some of this drive to us INTPs and ENTPs 😂 We’re great with coming up with some great entrepreneurial ideas that could work but most of them are never pursued or they are half way abandoned. 
1	I’ve actually started seeing a therapist to try and address this.  Told him I just want to get out of my head - I’m tired of all the thinking.  He told me I need to “be free” and that I have worth even without my accomplishments.  I told him he sounded like a hippie and a Democrat.  We laughed...
5	Is it a good idea to copy ESTP or ESFP when it comes to improving social skills?	I ask more in theory than in practice here. One is a thinker that arguably has similar personality to ENTJ. The other shares the same cognitive functions and because of this can likely rouns out the weaker side of an already existing set of traits.\n\nMy guess would be that ENTJ should learn from ESTP.
4	In my life I have learned all my social skills by copying others. I think this is how animals learns these skills. We mimic. And yeah, I've even learned some social skills from other species. Dogs are loved pets in part because they don't talk. Great lesson there.\n\nI certainly wouldn't limit myself to a single MBTI type. For one thing if I tell you I'm ESTP it doesn't actually mean I'm ESTP. And for another there are plenty of people in prison who are ESTP along with every other type.\n\nMBTI is not about defining people as a different species.
3	There’s a cool book called The Like Switch about this
2	My cousin's boyfriend is an ESTP. He is a salesguy (you guessed it) fairly successful, a very fun guy, never too serious, very outgoing and at ease in most situations. We got good friends as we had common passions (motorsports, fine food and drinks) so we spent a few nice moments together, including an unforgettable weekend at the Le Mans Classic event ([Cognac hangover while looking at wheeled-cigarillos racing each other is something I wish to happen to all of you](https://imgur.com/a/n4e7UO3)). It's a delight to be with him because his social ease makes my life much easier. I learned a lot from his "no stress" and cocky attitude and wish I could be that relaxed more often. So, yes, I think a mature ESTP can be a good help for an ENTJ willing to learn about social dynamics.\n\nMy mom is an ESFP and we very often have conversations about society and people. Her point of view broadens mine, though I am often stubborn when we disagree. I think she made me more empathetic than the average ENTJ and led me to think I may be an ENFJ, a few years ago (but I am still more result-oriented than people-oriented, though both are absolutely synergic). So, yes as well.\n\nIn both case you can learn, but copying everything is of course as bad as it sounds. ESTPs sometimes feel they prefer to stay on the tip of debates and conversations, not dive in. ESFPs, as far as I experienced, get very biased about people, and once they start to hate one or the other, objectivity dies.
1	What do you need the social skills for? Working in sales is different from having to interact with engineers for example.
1	All an ENTJ needs to do to help improve social skills is work on delivering the best experience to others while going out of their way to help others get smarter and more intelligent. Review this video for more insight: https://youtu.be/WracDPYfTww
15	How do you guys deal with debates when people bring emotion into it instead of facts, or act like your facts are too offensive so they are wrong?	So what sparked this was I was having a discussion with a fellow peer (freshman in college) about taxes and how they are spent. Needless to say Because im a management student I am for lower taxes and less handouts and less spending in general to promote business growth as well as actually giving them more money to reinvest in employees in ways of salary and rewording the smartest/ hardest workers. Once i explained my side, the individuals rebuttal basically was some people are oppressed so therefore they need hand outs and business owners and other high payed people need to pay more because they dont need their money. They than just used emotion and Buzfeed talking points to bring down our intellectual discussion. I evently just stooped having the discussion because it was going no where and started to annoy me that a college student still is looking at feelings over facts and completely will dismiss ideas based on feelings. My question is for you ENTJ how do you guys deal with this type of situation? 
12	You need to calm them down first.\n\nCalm mind Thinks.\n\nChaotic mind Feels.\n\nThinking leads to more intelligent choices than Feeling.
9	The best thing you can do when debating with a person who is presenting highly emotionally driven points is to listen first (listening is always your best offensive move), and then get inside their positions with questions to make them prove their points with well-cited information (e.g. peer-reviewed studies). It's also worthwhile to try to learn what personal or professional experiences lead them to their conclusion(s). Personal experience motivates everyone.\n\nEmotion fuels every debate; for some people, the emotional content is more intense than it is for other people. People almost always mould facts around an emotional state of mind.\n\nAlways remember that being 100% correct is very rare, and thinking otherwise is arrogant and ignorant.\n\nAlso, don't dismiss someone because they're a college student or anything else. Generally speaking, you've already lost if you reject people outright because of how you perceive them.
4	First, you should try to understand what the other people is telling you and why, ie, how his mind works. \nSecond, you should read about John Rawls. He rationalizes what your friend was telling you.
3	Sounds like there was nothing you could have done to salvage the situation. You can't explain the whole world to someone in 5 minutes. You can't fix the way their brain is wired or, more importantly, cure them of the mind virus. If you're having an adult conversation and someone unironically uses the word "oppressed" (in the context of the developed world) the winning move is not to play. Gracefully but hastily bow out. Nothing good would come of it.   \n\nI have plenty of real world experience to back this up since this is definitely "do as I say, not as I do" - advice. To give the most severe example: Last summer I had a 15+ minute attempt at something resembling a conversation with a former classmate turned failed artist (not the good kind) who believed in "non-violent communication". If you don't know what that means, good for you. It's a strain of the SJW mind virus spread in the useless studies cluster that basically melted this poor woman's brain. She was barely audible and barely capable of getting whole sentences out and she looked paralyzed with a fearful fake smile the whole time. This was on a nice, sunny day at a music festival, surrounded by mutual friends. Everyone was having a good time.   \n\n"They" are suffering from mental infections which only ever seem to get worse. I have yet to see one recover, even partially. Another sufferer is someone I consider a friend. It's still possible to have conversations with him - given plenty of effort - but he seems mentally adrift and his decline has been steady over a decade. He doesn't have the same strain or the same severity of infection but his condition is clearly related and was obtained via similar channels (certain academic fields). Frankly, if I first met him today I wouldn't befriend him. I won't give up on individuals I already care about but as a group "they" are to be assumed beyond saving and I advise anyone to just dodge them as elegantly as possible. Nothing good comes from associating with them.
5	~~Ok I have thoughts already but~~ I'm going to focus specifically on how "emotions" are used in discourse:\n\nI acknowledge that, we can be passionate about a topic and still be factual. The speech could be on the *great* **importance** of clouds for the ecosystem and it would still be right.\n\nI acknowledge that, I and anyone else has the potential of demonstrating emotion during discourse and it's a pretty common/human thing. Like, for 99.99% of everyone ever it's going to happen to them.\n\nI acknowledge that, while we live in an objective reality (however subjective) people have different access or barriers to that reality.\n\nI acknowledge that people don't change ideological beliefs or paradigms simply because I have a one person conversation with them. That sort of conscious change happens over a lengthy period of time. My engagement with someone is a minuscule part of forming that person's worldview.\n\nI acknowledge that, I have the power to choose my battles or that overall my battles are meaningless in the greater span of things.
1	there are tons of strategies, just find the right books, conflict management etc  \nif its about intimacy - go nvc with m rosenberg 
1	Put your psychologist cap on and use your logic to understand why they think the way they do on a deep level. When you understand them in a non-condescending way, it becomes ENORMOUSLY easier to deal with them.  \n(Also to throw my opinion in here, your understanding of macroeconomics feels a bit on the over-simplistic side. Not to credit their outrageously irrational argument though)
-2	Arguing is pointless. Marxism keeps on rearing its ugly head every so often. It is baked in at the amygdala level. Most humans simply aren't good at connecting cause with the effect.\n\nMake money and hire someone qualified to take advantage of tax loopholes. Store money offshore, get a Swiss passport. Prepare for a disaster. Keep some food, gold, guns. Buy an island. Build shelter. Find a hot partner. Fuck your socks off. Reproduce, if you are into it.\n\nEnjoy life as you watch one country after another descend into Solzhenitsyn's dystopia. This is all you can do. Do not out yourself as a libertarian. Do not argue with people online.\n\nJust keep on making $ and worry about protecting it from the lazy zombies.\n\n
0	Try asking them for specifics, being open to their ideas and offering a chance to talk about it another time if they can't give you logical counterpoints. If people feel like you are looking down on how they think, they react by giving more emotional responses so it's good to keep your own responses open and asking for clarification rather than immediate disagreement.  Also, sometimes people forget the background of their stances and really appreciate  having the chance to think about their opinions. Ive had quite a few lovely discussions after letting people think about it.\n\n Some people simply are emotional and really can't help but talk about things from a feelings perspective. May not be worth the argument. \n\nI will say that we are prone to automatically invalidating view points different from ours by only hearing the emotional aspects of their argument. Sometimes it's good to remember our own bias too.
0	How wonderful would be a relationship with an ENTP ?	ENTP ? Are they the ones ? 
12	In my experience, no. Give me an INTP any day.\nI’m sure it depends far more on the person than the MBTI, but in general, ENTPs need to feel like the shiniest one in the room. They are also accustomed to using their charm as a substitute for sound reason and will eventually come to view an ENTJ as a competitor instead of a partner because ENTJs won’t let them gloss over facts.
11	Why are you the way that you are?
6	I was in a relationship with one for 6 years. We had our moments, but it crashed and burned hard. \n\nIt probably depends more on the person and not the MBTI type. 
11	Like mating a tank with a court jester.
4	“Answer”
4	I had dated an ENTJ for 3 years. We eventually broke up because I moved to another country, but the compatibility was high. Both are highly goal oriented, and the conversation was always either productive or interesting. Both are thinkers so personal space is ample, communication is direct and clear, and both focused on improving themselves or their options. The best part about entj women is they don’t baby you and expect you to be independent and self sufficient, which is exactly how the entp thinks. Their Te can be tough to deal with, but it takes understanding of what Te is in order to appreciate its strengths. You must allow their primary function to flourish and act- organization and action are their super power. As long as the entj knows that the entp will ask for and consider their advice seriously, it doesn’t mean they will choose that path. Entps like the entj have many reasons for their decisions based off of an internal sense of logic, so each must independently come to their own conclusions or else feel like a puppet. This was never a problem with us, but I have seen it happen to another entp/entj couple. Overall, if both parties are mature and have mutual respect for each other, most likely it’ll work out. 
3	ENTJ highest compatibility are the following:\n\n1. INTP: https://youtu.be/WZBEuKPPEx0\n2. ENTP: https://youtu.be/qC5i-4VbSx4\n\nNTJs are meant to be with NTPs. Having been in NTJ + NTP relationships before, it is exquisite.

2	Yes.
10	Why is it so hard to connect with people / make friends	Entj here. Have watched some videos lately where people basically say friends are the most important thing in life and praise their childhood friends a ton. Made me think. \n\nI feel like I don't have many genuine friends. Most of my childhood friends, which were only a handful, changed beyond recognition and not in positive ways. I also move location a lot so it is harder to keep in touch anyway. Right now I'd say I have about 4 real friends and we keep in touch only every other week and per text. \n\nI have a ton of "sonewhat friends", such as my six flatmates with whom I get along but who lack a genuine interest in my person and the stuff I do everyday. Same with workplace colleagues, where Incan usually only make one real friend. I don't necessarily enjoy being around the "somewhat friends" as it lacks genuineness. \n\nAm I a complete wanker? I am very cognizant of my weaknesses in interpersonal relations and I usually try to work on them when meeting new people. It is not that people dislike me, they want me around. It is rather that there is no real connection. I am not making friends that I can count on, that will accompany me through the crazier parts. It seems like more of a means to an end and that saddens me. \n\nI can survive on my own but obviously feel like an alien and man is not supposed to live alone, that's a fact. \n\n\nWhat are your experiences?
6	most people have at max, 5 "real friends" Sounds to me like you're doing just normal, but you want more than is standard. Maybe due to depression, or some other reason, who knows.
3	I was just thinking of this lately.\n\nI have like 5-6 really close friends that I thank god for. The problem is, we’re spread all over the country now, so we only see each other maybe once a year. Otherwise all our contact is through our group text thread, which has daily activity thankfully.\n\nRecently, I was telling some of my coworkers how I proposed to my now fiancée. I said we had dinner at a nice restaurant and I proposed outside right after.\n\n“That’s it?” says my coworker.\n\n“Yeah...”\n\n“You didn’t get your friends together and celebrate?”\n\n“Umm......no......we didn’t...(we don’t have any friends?!)”\n\nIn my life, I know plenty of people that are alright and perfectly fine people, it’s just that I don’t really think of them as close friends. We just happen to be together at gatherings every few weeks. It feels weird. Idk if it’s normal. But when I think about it, I realize that I just simply don’t really care about them. I wish there was a non-rude way to say that.\n\nAnyway, not sure if this helped but I was just reflecting on this and saw your question prompt and it aligned perfectly. Sometimes I feel the need to re-take the rest because I feel more like an INTJ as I get older.
2	i didn't know how to process my own emotions, and constantly judged people. \n\nFixing those problems helped me start to connect. with people/friends/family. 
2	I have one true friend. Sure, I have a few people who I know I can count on for a lot. But I only trust one person whole heartedly, which is nothing short of amazing for me. 
2	Looks like us ENTJs are going through some rough times.  I intended on keeping this blog to myself when I put it up but this is the third time I’m referencing it here in as many weeks.  Seems appreciated when I do so I’ll offer it up again..\n\nwww.mymentalmodel.com second entry down is ‘struggling with isolation’.  Happy to chat more beyond that :)
2	Meaningful relationships are both hard to come by and take effort. There is a quantity to quality trade off and it can be hard to find people who you have a meaningful connection with. 4 close friends is fantastic and it sucks when life takes you far from them, but that doesn't mean you are a walker by any means. Give yourself more credit. :) 
2	I'm glad you have flatmates who you get a long with and have people to spend time with. :\)\n\nEvery friendship has a beginning point and with a majority of these beginning points there is a common meeting point of contact. Beginning point means most friendships do not start deep, they become that way. The pace of the friendship depends on the two people: initial openness, availability, mutual connection, and mutual depth of enjoyment from one another's company. Common meeting point of contact means that in most cultures, people keep seeing the same people because they either know the same people or they share a physical space of activity/purpose \(work, class, dorm, favorite coffee shop, etc.\) You can of course, make friends outside of a common space, but it requires at least one person to initiate and another to be receptive\-\- both to be open and trusting enough to be friends with a stranger.\n\n**How do I have genuine friendships where it is mutual to be a part of each others life in the most ordinary and extraordinary ways:**\n\n1. YOU have to change how you look at people and friendships: You have to be fine with superficial conversations for others to warm up to you. People first need to know if they can stand being around you. Even if it superficial level stuff, people are still revealing themselves it just takes time/effort for more unveiling to happen. You have learn to value and appreciate small things about others, to see more valuable qualities about others. Which also means, you have learn to put up with and accept other peoples flaws or weaknesses. Whenever it is hard to accept people, you should first think about your own personal flaws. If you want a deeper level of communication and support, you need to know how to do that for others. Just like the other person, you probably have your own walls that others think you would not be interested in deeper connection. So asking questions, responding with sensitivity, and being there for a person can help you deepen that friendship connection and allow you to know friends deeper than you have ever before.\n\n2. Acquaintances or surface-level friends can become genuine friends, with effort and time.\n\n3. Make new friends. Not all the friends you currently have, will be interested in having a deeper connection with you. And that's okay. You don't have to push those people away. Sometimes the issue is people don't have enough time and energy to fit all the people and responsibilities they have. You may learn people different from you connect with you on more levels than people who you find to be the same as you. This pushes you to connect and communicate on the surface level with anyone and have a beginning point in friendship with a variety of people. Also, the more connections you make with a person, the more trouble areas you will find within yourself in trying to perceive and understand differences about them. In time you develop more patience, more understanding, more acceptance, and love towards others. These new friends can eventually become genuine friends as well.\n\nREALLY Important: The more you step out of your comfort zone to meet and get to know people, you may start to experience a lot of discomfort, frustration, impatience, and annoyance. Everyone is different in regards to “poking” points and threshold. Don’t forget, every person is different from you so you will have moments you may lose interest or don't know how to move past that point. The key is to learn to accept or appreciate these differences between you and another— also recognize these could be issues you have within yourself. You have to be willing to put down your walls, your pride, and lack of tolerance or understanding to appreciate the good in every person. Your in a good place if you don't have to work on those. It should be very easy talking to you then.\n\nIt is a challenging and new place to shake everything you believe and know about friendships and how to have genuine friendships.\n\nDon't give up on the way. People recognize effort. Sometimes when you think your inadequate or not doing enough, there is someone who helps pick you up and hugs you for it.\n\nI hope something in this resonates with you. I hope you have more friendships, especially the genuine kind your looking for. This is my first time breaking down friendships. Hopefully I could help in some way. Good luck! 
3	The Bell Curve. Most of the people are ... meh. You are looking in the wrong places.\n

7	Strategies for not crushing on a female co-worker while building a friendship	#Situation:\nA month ago or so I met this ENFP girl at work, and I immediately knew I wanted to befriend her (or at least try). It's enthusiasm + openness. I work mostly with low openness, low enthusiasm, highly conscientious people, and she is the only outlier at our ~100 people project. I'm similar - high openness and enthusiasm, but I don't really have much people to share this with.\n\n#Problem:\nThat would all be fantastic, but I unfortunately always crush on the girls I befriend. This has happened numerous times before. Once the friendship is created the crush goes away.\n\nHowever, I feel it's gonna be an uphill challenge. I've been doing way too much Tinder chatting lately, and I'm afraid I'll unconsciously make the conversations similar... ughh... \n\n#Details:\nWe are physically located in different rooms and professionally do not interact directly more than once a month (separate sections of the company, simply allocated to the same project in different teams). We have no power or influence over each other or any of our work or decisions.\n\n#Options:\n\n1. Don't even try to create a friendship. I absolutely love my job and this project, I don't want to jeopardize it.\n\n\n2. Try to strike up some conversations, be mindful of staying purely friendly. **How? This is the question I present to you.**\n
19	[deleted]
6	[deleted]
3	You're already crushing on her, and there will be no way for you to surreptitiously conceal that fact unless you're cool as a cucumber.\n\nHere's what you do: treat her as an *acquaintance.* Not a friend. You can be friendly and cordial with her without falling for her. If you're physically separated from her at all times, this shouldn't be too hard. Just talk to her when necessary, and do your best to forget about her existence at all other times.
2	A handful of meaningful relationships is all you have in life that truly matters. The number of cars or chair or PowerPoint presentations or TPS reports that you have produced is pretty much all bullshit except in the context of providing you with the resources to raise a family, pursue hobbies and hang out with people you truly like.\n\nSo, if you both end up liking each other - great! You can always quit if it become an issue. However, if you end up crushing on a lot of women - does that imply that you are below average looking and end up rejected a lot?\n\nI mean it could be an age thing. I used to have crushes but now I have seen so much BS and retardation around me that I feel ashamed of my earlier days when I would put up strangers that made an impression on me on a pedestal, though chances are are rather dull or have some crazy beliefs.\n
1	Don't get your pie where you get your bread my man.
1	I have been close friends with an ENTJ for over a decade.  We definitely have chemistry, but we maintain an awesome friendship like no other.  \n\nDon’t miss out on an awesome friendship by taking it to another level just yet. \n\nBasically, no one ever regretted a relationship that started with an authentic friendship first. Just be a good friend. 
1	If she seems like an awesome personality that you're attracted to, why not just ask her directly if she'd like to go out on a date? If it works out, great. If it doesn't, just end things on mutual and professional terms.\n\nI don't see what's the value of going through the friendship phase, which, arguably, makes the potential of romance even murkier.
1	Easy, treat her like the likable, interesting, and competent person she is.  It's like being friendly with the Rock.\n\nhttps://medium.com/@annevictoriaclark/the-rock-test-a-hack-for-men-who-dont-want-to-be-accused-of-sexual-harassment-73c45e0b49af
5	Avoiding "hurt feelings"	Hello Everyone!\n\nLogged a previous post and realised I asked the wrong thing (https://www.reddit.com/r/entj/comments/8cepqu/handling_conflict/?utm_source=reddit-android)\n\nReplace conflict with hurting feelings.\n\nI've read on here and seen posts about us being often seen as cold and to the point. Having seen other ENTJ's call people out for their incompetence right then and there. In my mind I'm thinking the exact same however wouldn't dare because I don't want to have to deal with the person getting hurt feelings - "why do you thing I'm incompetent?!" "Because you can't do X, Y and Z". In the last two cases I saw ENTJ's calling out incompetence the accused party just accepted it and profusely apologized. \n\nI'm guessing based on what others have said, this comes with maturity and time. Stop caring about what other think and tell them what you think without the "nice" filter.
6	Having a preference for honesty and directness doesn't mean you can't adapt your communication to fit the circumstances. Similarly, having a preference for preserving social harmony doesn't mean you can't favor honesty where it's appropriate. This is an area where most MBTI resources that discuss Te vs Fe don't do a good enough job explaining the difference between the two. This OP sounds very Fe, but I'm just going to assume you typed yourself correctly as ENTJ. \n\nIf you're really struggling with this, ask yourself which people or which situations are causing this problem for you. If you're struggling to call out someone of higher authority than you on their incompetence, that's a normal frustration to have. Same if it's a family member that you can't cut out, and who refuses to change. It's not a prerequisite of being an ENTJ to constantly put your foot in your mouth where you should obviously know better, or to never have empathy when you overstepped someone's boundaries.\n\nIf you're struggling with directness in situations where it's clearly the better approach, you need to evaluate why that is. Social anxiety? Hyper-sensitive to hurting people's feelings? Not knowing how to say certain things well in the moment? If you know someone is going to erupt when you're honest with them, that's different than withholding it by default. Something is clearly holding you back, and I'm sure with some reflection you can identify what that is. \n\nMaybe take a minute and think/write down how to "best" tell someone something uncomfortable for them to hear. Choose a situation you're currently dealing with. If you truly struggle with this task, re-visit Fe vs Te. 
6	I agree with you. I will say that, as a youngish woman in a high-powered job, I also encounter sexism due to my directness. I have been told that I am "abrasive" and "overly aggressive" when I say things that are direct and accurate, without sugar coating, but not mean. Men who say similar things and act similarly are rewarded for the same behavior.  This is a common issue for women like me in fields like mine.  It makes being a female ENTJ more frustrating.\n\nI am much softer in my communication style outside of the workplace. Working at a law firm allows me to lean into that part of me at work and be more empathetic in my interpersonal connections outside of the workplace.\n\n*edit - typo*
3	I’m in the trades so being honest and direct is key to getting jobs/projects done. Someone saying something/someone hurt their feelings is usually met with a shoulder shrug. Still, it’s always important to express yourself professionally at work, imo. But sometimes people are just gonna get butt hurt and there’s not much you can do other than not saying anything at all. \n\nOnce I was called by a contractor and was asked to help finish a project. I told them that if I was going to meet the deadline, I would have to be given seniority on the project so that I could direct the work flow and assign tasks to others. Once there I encountered someone who, imo, really had no idea what they were doing. I told them that they had spent too long on the current task and that they needed to finish and move on to the next one. It was the most professional way I could have said “you need to speed the fuck up because you’re costing me money”. They took what I said as a personal criticism and accused me of treating them in an “unfriendly” manner. I had to tell them that we weren’t friends and they needed to do what I was telling them to do or they needed to leave. They just didn’t understand what was going on and tried to argue. So I threw them off the job and finished it myself. There is no scenario I can see where it would have turned out well with this person. I could have said nothing and avoided the conflict and not completed the project on time (and not get paid what I was asking), or I could tell them to speed up. 
3	Hum... there’s a huge difference (especially at work) between saying “you are something” and “you do something bad”. Sorry but saying “you’re incompetent” is just a useless and improductive judgement. It’d be way more ok to say “you should learn/improve this, as it is not a definitive statement. 
2	radical  candor or something is the book called.  google that , there are presentations also
4	ENTJ music taste	Would like to see what kind of taste in music everyone has and why.\n\nI’ve led a lot of lives, but heavy music has been the only constant in my life. As in almost all I listen to falls between punk and metal. Think it’s that insatiable love of power.\n\nWas listening to Hatebreed and realized this band just embodies ENTJ for me. I listen to them when I’m being a little bitch and need to get something I don’t want to done.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/HB3tmC2f3t0\n\nWhat’s your favorite music? Why?\nWhat are some songs that you think embody ENTJs?
11	As long as a song has a good melody, I like it. As much as I appreciate intelligent lyrics, I find myself caring less about lyrics and more about the melody. As soon as music starts playing, my mind focuses on what's at hand anyway, so I have no mental capacity to pay attention to lyrics.
11	[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cfskAGScbA&t=94s) is my favorite band. Makes for great workout & post-breakup music. Call it what you like.\n\nAlso really into ambient, chillhop, and I guess some early/mid 2000's rock. 
8	I listen to things that make me want to do something. Aggressive metal and hard-hitting electro with complex melodies are at the forefront of my music taste but I also enjoy swing jazz and high-tempo Latin music sometimes.\n\n“Chill music” has no purpose to me. I find it boring unless there are harmonies because that makes it musically interesting to me and typically that makes me want to sing (which still follows my aforementioned rule).
6	Vaporwave and metal video game soundtracks
7	Anything you can walk like a badass too or anything dynamic.
6	The strokes, Interpol,  and Arctic Monkeys for my fundamentals. \n\nDjent metal (Gojira, Meshuggah, etc..) for intense moments.\n\nTame impala for focusing. 
4	Classical. It is very intricate and stimulating. I enjoy playing the parts on repeat in my head until I have every part and harmony memorized. It’s a great algorithm of logic. Baroque is my favorite for this reason.
5	Classical music
3	Heavy Metal, punk rock :-) 
3	i mostly listen to pop because it's fun and flirty. HOWEVER, my favourite musician is [joanna newsom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHAHgjL0YzQ).\n\n\nlately i've been listening to a lot of 90s/early 00s pop. i love it a lot. at night, i mostly listen to joanna newsom, cocorosie, or manchester orchestra. sometimes fka twigs but i always wake up during one specific part of a song and it creeps me out to hear it at night. :) 
3	I lived and breathed the hardcore scene for years. Only after my band started doing really well did I stop listening to heavy music and started going for way more chill folkish indie stuff
3	Bassnectar. 
2	Hatebreed...  haven’t listened to them since highschool.  Destroy Everything was the last song I listened to before ever Friday night football game.\n\nThat said,  I’m in my 30s with a fiancé, kids, 2 dogs, and a high stress job.  So I’ve toned it don’t a little bit as far as music goes haha.  The Steeldrivers, The Devil Makes Three, and Deer Tick are all great bands...  definitely not metal...  but all about booze and partying.
2	I listen to whatever sounds good, specifically when the production is cohesive, especially when the vocals are 'married' to the instrumental. No matter the language, if I can bop to it, I'd listen.
2	Metal, almost exclusively. Cool to see similar comments. Top band atm is called Fallujah. And I simply cannot get enough of [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rt1QVlOkRfU) but the assholes have been delaying an album for over a year now. As far as "why", I firmly believe that superior musical talent outside of this genre simply does not exist and love hearing how technical the various groups can get while still sounding unique.
2	Meshuggah all day. 
1	For just entjs in general, something along the lines of Knives and Shadows, Wolves Among Sheep, or Hellmarch
1	Classical, metal, dream pop, any interesting electronic music
1	Doesnt matter the genre. I like a good chord progression
1	Jazz and lo-fi hip hop
1	ha, great pick, i havent heard it for 10 years when i was banging in a club. nowadays there are no more clubs to play this music in my country.  fucking culture  .. neutered aggression   \ni like IDLES recently. punk is very philosophycal and agro, more so than metal imo 
1	Usually heavy stuff. The more aggressive the better. Rock, post-hardcore, rap, dubstep, trap. Still enjoy other genres from time to time like country, melodic EDM, reggae. 
1	my ENTJ guy friend likes normal pop stuff of Bruno Mars or Charlie Puth
1	tbh I listen to tvxq, bts, exo, astro, shinee, and many other artists
1	Anything therapeutic. Something that makes you feel Powerful and motivated...nothing cringy though.\n\nLike I could listen to Metal, Classical, or just organ music really...something that sounds aggressive and dominating...it helps fuse with my dreams for power lmao
1	I like metal, especially European bands, such as Sabaton and Tyr. Rather than pay attention to the lyrics, I will think about various things, such as the future, while listening.
6	ISFJ guy here - dealing with ENTJ's insecurities?	Hey all, I'm an ISFJ guy who's been dating an ENTJ girl for a few months now, and things have been pretty great so far. But there is one thing that periodically comes up and it has to do with a past infatuation I had.\n\nFor context, I had a crush on an INFJ girl a while back and I told my then-just-friend ENTJ about it. She was very supportive but since then I fell in love with the ENTJ and I have since moved on from the INFJ entirely (we're still friends though).\n\nThe thing is that sometimes my girlfriend gets insecure about my past infatuation, claiming that I still have feelings for the INFJ even though nothing could be further from the truth. I've tried again and again to reassure her that I love her alone, but she just won't have it sometimes. She says that I don't really love her and that I should be with the INFJ. I'm at wit's end trying to convince her that I have no remaining feelings for my former crush, but she simply feels like I'm lying to her, even though I don't feel like I've done anything to deserve that, especially since we've been so openly honest about everything since we started dating.\n\nI honestly have no idea what to do anymore because nothing I'm saying seems to be reaching her. Is there a different approach I should take? Or should I leave her be for a while? I'm so lost and any advice would be absolutely appreciated.
6	I figure you'll get a lot of personal advice here, so I'll give you my MBTI take on it fwiw. \n\nYour girlfriend is an "unhealthy", or currently insecure, ENTJ. If Te were doing its job, rational evidence that you do care, have always cared, and have always been faithful should be taken into consideration. You're not getting through to her because she's sitting her feelings (Fi), looking for every strain of counter-evidence that you *aren't* really invested in her, because it reaffirms how she feels and the conclusion (Ni) she's drawn as a result. Pulling individuals out of unhealthy patterns like this requires pulling them back to a healthy version of who they are. In this case, I would absolutely be more direct with her. When she makes an unfounded claim backed by some (Ni) conclusion of what you *must* be feeling, immediately unseat it. I'd unseat unhealthy Ni in this case by playing out the scenario as it would actually be, e.g. "if we break up, I'm not going back to her, I'd be unhappily single for X time and thinking this was a really stupid way to end things." I know words and genuine affection come naturally to ISFJs, but that may not be the way to reach her in this case, so you might consider adapting your approach to fit her situation. \n\nJust my take on it, as I think function loops generally do a good job at describing unhealthy patterns of behavior for each type. I will also say that if you have a history of cheating or going back to previous partners, throw out everything I just told you because that changes things. I'm assuming you do not. But I can sympathize with you and in some ways empathize with your girlfriend, so best of luck figuring this out if she's really important to you. 
3	I think this is more of an insecurity thing rather than an ENTJ thing. That being said, if she is an ENTJ and has made her mind up, it can't be hard to change her narrative. I recommend two things: \n1. Ask her why her reasoning lead her to this conclusion, find hole in her logic. During that conversation, ask why she still feels this way after all of this time and if there is anyway you can alleviate the stress. \n2. Tell her bluntly that her mistrust compromises your relationship. That you can't be in a relationship without trust. Also, people who refuse to trust sometimes are up to things that make them untrustworthy....so you know you might want to dig into that. 
7	Ouch. That really sounds like it’s hurting you. \n\nAnd the reason why it’s hurting you is because you know it’s untrue, yet your partner keeps pushing this same talking point. She disregards your honesty and instead pushes a false narrative. It looks like you’ve stumbled upon one of the secrets of the ENTJ.. we often suspect others have it out for us, even those who are so close to our hearts. This behaviors is obviously defensive in order to protect ourselves, but there comes a point where such a counterattack-defense becomes senseless, especially in the sphere of a relationship, where two partners should work to build each other up. And that is where your girl is.\n\nTo me, I wonder if there is something deeper going on here. She ignores your honesty and repays you with a knife in your heart, accusing you of not loving her, telling you to leave. Obviously, this is very bewildering for you and puts you at your witt’s end. You are desperate and have no idea what to do. Take a step back: your girlfriend knows this. She sees what she’s doing to you. It is an absolute power play. She wants you at her mercy. This kind of steaming plate of bullshit that she keeps serving up to you is completely unacceptable, because it does not honor a trusting relationship. The fact that she refuses to believe your honesty with her reinforces that she doesn’t actually care about your side. Is this the kind of partner you want, constantly manipulating your emotions? Why do you give her such power?\n\nYou’ve tried being diplomatic. You’ve tried talking. You’ve tried reasoning. Your partner responds with a giant slap in the face, telling you to leave and that you love someone else. Unacceptable. ENTJs sometimes only understand things when the stakes are high, and when you directly hit back. And I think this is the only recourse, since talking through will not work: she will not permit your side. You need to explain to her very plainly that you cannot continue in a relationship where your partner does not trust you. You need to explain to her that her behavior is hurtful and also unacceptable, since a relationship should be built on mutual trust and respect. You need to tell her, and also realize this truth for yourself, that you will leave her if she doesn’t respect you or trust your honesty. And of course, if she doesn’t fix her behavior, follow through on your promise, and this will teach her a great lesson for her future. When you put your cards on the table, this will be a wake up call to her and will alert her the seriousness of the situation. At which point, she’ll capitulate to your needs, or attack you again. If she chooses to be irrational by attacking you again, saying you actually love the INFJ and this scenario is an easy way for you to leave the relationship, your ENTJ will have lost completely, because you’ll leave her for not fixing her behavior. Either way, you pull out ahead. The flaw here is with her, so why do you allow her to put you on the defensive?\n\nIf I were in this relationship, I would have left a long time ago. The “insecurities” are a nice cover for the darker manipulation that is truly going on.
2	Yeah she is criticizing your potential desire to leave her. She is also she is afraid of not being good enough for you. She needs you to dmeonstrate and prove loyalty to her. Watch this for more information: https://youtu.be/WracDPYfTww\n\nEDIT: I also forgot, there is this 6-7 video playlist that goes through the mechanics of relationships in a new psychological way not thought of. I think it will do great to help you with this relationship. Btw, ISFJ is really compatible with ENTJ so keep at it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7_i40Y6N8E&list=PLCPzIFw2QJDeDrBLackkpYWEY5KUPVQYG
1	My god, I am not entj but I’ve been in this exact situation before. Your girlfriend might not be completely irrational. Try to observe yourself when you are around the infj. Maybe even don’t see or talk to the infj for a while, and focus on your gf. My ex was also isfj with infj best friend. He would always do stupid shit like stare at her for a long time even when she wasn’t talking to him when I was next to him. He’d also talk more to her than me. There are probably small things you don’t notice that are making her feel this way. Invalidating her feelings are not the way to go.
0	As an ENTJ, the best move you could make is to give her an ultimatum. If she doesn't stop complaining, you leave her. It's super simple, and it would solve the problem. Remember, ENTJs are rational thinkers who can make a decision. It's time she makes the decision if she trusts you or not. 
0	I do not think this is specific to being an ENTJ.
-2	theres nothing u can say, its only what you can do.  \nstop pouring words and emotion over her, and start acting like shes your priority 
8	Advice on roommate situation	I have this roommate who i've lived with for 3 years throughout our undergraduate degree and he's also a good friend. He's a smart guy we're in similar programs so occasionally we'll be in the same classes.  Fast forward to now its exam time and he's skipped this class that we have together since the first week of school. I mean hasn't gone to a single lecture and he just messaged me asking for a big favour and wants me to send him ALL my notes, lecture and textbook. Now I've been to almost every class, written every exam and worked my ass off to make these notes and don't feel great about just handing them over for nothing in exchange. When he asked me I told him i could send him the chapters for the exam he missed and he asked if he could put all my notes on an external drive. \n\nI don't want to give away my notes that i worked hard on for nothing. I don't know if i sound petty or bitter but I just don't think its cool for him to put me in this position simply because he skipped class all semester.\n\nI don't want to send them to him and then resent him but I don't want him to fail. I'd send it for something in exchange but he doesn't have any notes or anything I need. \n\nAdvice? am I being too bitter? what should I do?\nhow do i say yes without hating him and how do i say no without him hating me? not trying to ruin this friendship or anything just not comfortable giving away my notes that i worked really hard on. \n\nplease ignore typos, I'm cramming for exams at the moment.\n\n**EDIT**: Thanks for all the responses guys, appreciate the feedback. I ended up telling him i'd send him some but I wasn't happy about it because I worked hard on them. He clued in to the tone of the situation and realized how unfair his request was. Sent him the material for the exam he missed only. Cheers!\n
6	"Here they are. I worked hard on these. I think I earned a pizza. You're buying."
4	I had two college roommates like this, one failed out and the other might as well have. Don't look at it like you've saved this person from failure. One set of notes will not change a bad work ethic and likely a bad GPA, exam grade or whatever.\n\nAnother way I look at it when I purposely give away my study outlines to certain individuals is that it actually benefits me come exam time. Why? Because no one can use my outline like I can -- I wrote it, and wrote it with myself in mind. There's also the substantial boost in retention when you actually prepare notes versus being given them. This guy has literally nothing to work off of except what little you give him. Basically, the notes are of way more value to you than they are to him -- giving them away doesn't mean you're both 50/50 now. \n\nI get that you're friends but these sorts of people never turned out to be my "good" friends in the long-term anyway. They never quite make it into adulthood. 
6	No point in burning a bridge.\n\nI'd give him the notes, but would let him know how ya feel.
2	Bail him out once and tell him that you are doing this because you have known each other for awhile now, but THIS IS THE LAST TIME. After the exams are over, repeat that. The simple explanation would be something like: you are already paying a ton of money to be here, so you might as well learn something. If he thinks that you are too stuck up - oh well. You have not compromised yourself.\n\nThough details matter. It would suck to completely burn a bridge with this guy. If he is indeed smart, then it makes sense to keep in touch with him, connect via LinkedIn and maybe other medium. That said, you probably would not work in the same place as him. If he is a lazy INTP genius, then he will have to deal with reality that work ethics matters. Maybe he should learn this lesson from others.\n\nStill, you should not bend over for him. If he can be useful to you, then explain to him that there is something called quid pro quo and that he owes you. Also tell him that skipping many classes like that is retarded. Maybe it is a class that is not too important? Like I mentioned before, details matter.\n\nI also find this drama funny because this would not be an issue if all lectures were available online. The employers are yet to caught on to the fact that brick and mortar education is way overpriced.\n
2	"Here's the notes but I gotta say this makes me uncomfortable *for reasons you stated.* Please don't ask me to do this again.
4	I used to do this with lesser know classmates for money.  Especially when would bring the notes for the test.  You put hard work into your notes, you should be compensated.  Just ask.
1	I totally know how you feel and people like that drive me crazy, I would honestly say no because I really don't mind saying no in situations like this and I'm pretty upfront in general.\nHowever, I can definetely see how this is problematic in your case, so I'd suggest either talking about it openly with him and state that you've put hard work into this and won't give it away for nothing or\nyou could ask him to pay, which is fair IMO.\nGood luck, I know things like that probably make you a bit more stressful on top of the exams but you can handle it just right.
1	Your work has value, ask for cash. Him not offering when asking means he's a mooch in my book. I'd burn that "friendship" to the ground, because it isn't a friendship.\n\n>...but I don't want him to fail.\n\nHe has prepared himself to fail. It's not your responsibility.
1	well, u obviously feel like ur not getting a fair trade.  \nso figure out what you could get in return.  \nand its not necessarily something FOR you, but something to see him work and respect what you respect.  \nso its mostly an intimacy problem, you working and sacrificing for something, while he prioritizes something else.  \nu need to get on the same page, what he wants, and so on.   \n2 issues, as u can see 
1	Lay down the tough conversation. Give some of the notes, but not all. Ask for something worthy back.\n\nIf he resents you, then that's that. \n\nAnd if he ends up resenting you,  giving the notes as a complete wuss wouldn't have made a difference of him being a shit person anyways.
0	I’d probably give him the notes, since he missed all that class he missed out on all the info that isn’t in the notes and probably won’t do well anyway, and judging on his lack of attendance, his study habits probably aren’t aren’t the best either
8	How to tell my entj boyfriend I don't feel appreciated	We are both 26 and have been together for 3 years, living together for 1. I am still a student, while he is starting his own buisness. He was working in IT but he found it boring so he decided to start his own thing/change career.\n\nAt the house, I cook and clean. Wash our clothes. Iron and fold. Now I don't mind this set up, it works for us. He brings in almost all the money, pays the bills.\n\nThe thing is.. I just don't feel like he appreciates what I do. I am not expecting anything big. Just a "thank you" or a compliment or even a bouquet of flowers or something just so I know and feel like he cares. He is so obsessed with his job and I feel like he is taking me for granted. Like it almost doesn't matter if I am here or not. I don't mind doing all these things, but it's nice to feel appreciated sometimes you know? Am I being unreasonable?\n\nI wake him up with a blowjob almost every day and we also fuck almost every day. He has always been very dominant in the bedroom and into rough sex. I happen to like rough sex but the fact that there isn't much romance or appreciation outside the bedroom, it has made me like it a little less if that makes sense? I need some love and tenderness to balance the rough sex out.\n\nHe is ENTJ, I am ENFP
7	Perhaps show him this thread? I think you’ve laid everything out quite well here. I’m an ENTJ female, and this would also leave me feeling really really empty and sad if a boyfriend treated me like that. As ENTJs we will likely spend a lot time and energy focusing on our goals/work but that isn’t a valid excuse to neglect our loved ones. You should be a priority in his life as well at this point in the relationship, and if he knows this is how you feel, it really isn’t difficult to make you a card or stop by the store and bring you flowers so you know you’re cherished. You deserve to be treated with love and gentle care and matured ENTJs are fully capable of that!
12	I was exactly that boyfriend for a while when I was about 20. I’m 27 now, but bad experiences and tough times forced me to grow up. \n\nI can tell you that he’s got to go through a similar journey - a really tough one where he needs to learn to let go of control and appreciate what’s important in life. Unfortunately, for us ENTJs this journey is not easy.  It feels like embracing death, and if he does it the way I did it, he’ll drive you nuts and probably spoil the relationship forever. \n\nHowever, all hope isn’t lost because I’m sure he’ll be open to hearing a logical argument and will be up for the challenge of becoming a good boyfriend while running a company. This might be the best way to get him to work for you and most importantly for his own well being. \n\nHope this helps. \n\nP.S. if you’re planning on sticking with him through this, which I think you are, then it’ll be one hell of a ride and your maturity and resilience will be tested. Be prepared! \n\n
5	Hi there, ENTJ (M) here, also in a long term relationship with my ENFP girlfriend. Both in our late 20s. I have to say that what you described was uncannily similar to what I experienced with her.\n\nFirst of all, let me preface this by saying that it is not in our nature to regularly express our love and appreciation for the people in our lives. I KNOW that without the support of my girlfriend I'd never be able to go out and kill it at work. But it is not a natural action for me to say that out loud. So it's important to understand that it's not that we don't appreciate you guys, it's just that we don't verbalise these thoughts.\n\nMore importantly, to answer your question: go up to him and tell him straight up what you've outlined on this post. If he knows that you feel this way, and he actually cares about the relationship, I'm willing to bet that he'll be more affectionate, even though that's not a natural mode of action for us. That's what my girlfriend did and it worked.
6	Just tell him. We appreciate directness 
2	[deleted]
1	Say: “I don’t feel appreciated”. And then back up this point of view with facts and known instances that explain your point of view. Don’t overthink it. ENTJs love the truth if the matter, and want to hear it articulated precisely. 
1	Obviously every case is different, but my experience as an ENTJ and knowing other ENTJs, a lot of us have a mindset that we don’t really see thanks as necessary for the normal things in life, unless it’s a standard part of a social process - thanking your wait staff for instance.\n\nIf he’s not thanking you outside of the bedroom, he may have a mindset that your contributions were somehow expected or necessary part of your relationship and the business opening process.\n\nSo, obviously a discussion is needed to set this expectation straight. Lay out that while you may not be a part of the workforce, your studies as a student still take time and are your full time job. What you do around the house is extracurricular, and while you’re happy to help him out with ironing and cleaning, if it’s not appreciated it’s ultimately not entirely your responsibility. \n\nThat’s the blunt way of putting it, so sugarcoat it a bit, don’t go in aggressively or in a hostile tone. While ENTJs do like to be challenged, we’re defensive and guarded if approached the wrong way. Ultimately you’re a team here working toward the best relationship.
1	Putting aside some very... questionable advice you're getting in this thread, I would bet he appreciates you a lot more than he is letting on. I personally feel 10x more loved and appreciated when that appreciation both unspoken and reliable. Having to come out and ask for something that I want, as opposed to someone simply doing it of their own accord, feels like two totally different levels of care and understanding. I guess it's an -NTJ thing from everything I've ever read, but actions are so much stronger than words. Hence, I end up trying to over-do the actions that I think show love instead of saying "I really appreciate you", as I myself would find that empty in the absence of action to support it. You seem like a very reliable and permanent fixture in his life and routine. \n\nSo I don't think you're being unreasonable at all, you seem like a very caring and dedicated partner. ENTJs tend to be very intense individuals and nothing you wrote about your partner really surprises me. Doesn't mean he doesn't care though, and I do agree with another poster here that perhaps showing him this thread would do you both some good.

1	No tricks. Lay it out like it is. I think it'll go well. :)\n\nEdit:\nHave you considered having kids in the near future? The biological clock is ticking and it's a natural lifelong sense of purpose. You're already in a traditional role, it's the only missing part.
1	You have to be honest. I am ENTJ and probably because I did chores all through childhood I took it easy as an adult until I realised it was important to step in and do my part. He has to know that relationships require a degree of cooperation over the small stuff, like making the bed or ironing or washing up. He may not know how to do these things and could be embarrassed about it. You should tell him how turned on you are watching him vacuum. Reward him for a good job. 
1	i dont understand, do you thank him for the money and work he does?

4	Best Friends of ENTJ?	Calling all masterminds:\n\nWhich types are your best friends? Which do you really click with? And why is this?\n\n\nFor me, my best friends are always ENFP. It’s actually pretty amusing to see the sheer litany of ENFP best friends I have. E + E = very wild and fun, N + N = similar thought processes, F + T = interesting differences in perspective, P + J = they are so so wild, and I can usually bring things back to order when the ENFP blows it up in a wild, euphoric spree. 😁 ENFP and ENTJ make quite the pair. \n\nWhat are your experiences?\n\n
13	I'm INFJ but my best friend is ENTJ. And there's one thing she told me before that I'll never forget.\n\nI asked her what she thought of me and she said, "I find it easier to deal with you." 😂\n\nEDIT: Rechecked our convo and changed it to the exact words she said. 
7	INFJ because they’re so mellow but lowkey crazy, and ENTP because they know how to have a good time and be that friend where all you do is insult each other from a loving place haha\n\nNotice nobody said ENFJ lol
4	I wish I knew more ENTJs -- I can't say I've ever disliked one's company, even if I disliked the person. Hopefully that makes sense.\n\nI'll throw support behind INxJs and ENxPs. Obviously depends on the person but for one reason or another these usually work out well. \n\nI like INFJs because once they're comfortable with you, the whole Fe "I really don't want to overstep" thing fizzles away and I end up having very raw, honest conversations, which I enjoy immensely. They tend to want that honesty since they repress it so often with most people. ENTPs because they're intuitive enough to grapple with what I enjoy talking about, but grounded enough to offset how intense I can be. ENFPs are a trade-off, as I'm not as challenged intellectually (in general), but they're a great outlet for "being myself" in a way I can't always express with other types.\n
3	My best friends and romantic partners are ENFPs too! :D
3	INTP, ENFP, ESTJ
3	Pretty much ALL ENFP's. Which makes sense because according to socionics (if you buy into it). In these relationships, ENFP is the benefactor and ENTJ is the beneficiary.\nThis is definitely true for me - I think my ENFP friends have essentially taught me how to human. Also, like.. emotional support
2	My best friend is also an ENFP and she is my absolute favorite person. I think we balance each other our well - she makes up for what I lack and vice versa. We also have a genuine connection and we accept each other for who we are with absolutely no judgment. It's pretty great.\n\nOther close friends are ESTP, ENTJ, ISFP, ISTJ, ENFJ, ESFP.

2	I'm an ENTJ (f), my two best friends are:\n1) INTJ (f), she is me in a less intense and dominant, calmer, more passive version. We are still different enough to enjoy each other's company and express our different opinions.\n2) ENTP (m), our conversations are priceless and we really think alike, they are nicknamed "The debater" for a reason, he is a crazy talented debater and his points are always spot on, makes it one hell of an intellectual challenge.\nOther than that, my other friends which are not as close to me are mostly extroverted and feeler types (my observation, not sure about the exact types), which makes it a bit more interesting to interact with them but also disconnects us a bit as we seem to not always understand each other.\n
2	ENFP, INFJ
1	INFJ and INFP for me so far. 
1	My best friend is an ENTP, but his T is pretty borderline.
1	INTP, INFP, INTJ, ENTP, INFJ
1	My best friends are 2 other ENTJ females and an INFP male ☺️
1	INFP-INTP-ISTP.
1	ISTJ, ESTP, ESFP, INFP, & ISTP.
1	Strangely, we are all either ENTJs or INTJs (bona fide... we have all taken the MBTI).\n\n
1	INFJ, INTP.
1	Usually people of types that share cognitive functions have better rapport and understanding, so for ENTJs these are types that value Fi, Te, Se, & Ni. Friendships across the Fe-Fi divide can present a challenge as Fe & Fi don't easily see how the other expresses their affection. For the full layout: [**ENTJ Friendship Types**](http://personalitycafe.com/entj-articles/280-love-types-entj-12.html#post20825162).
1	My best friend and brother from another mother is an ENTJ. I have about 5 close friends and only one of them isn't in the "analyst" category. I've only ever had one "fight" with my ENTJ friend in 20 years. We didn't talk for about two weeks, then we got together at his place and had some drinks and never mentioned it again. 
1	ENTJ girl here. My close friends are female INFJ, INFP, and ENFJ. I really like the N\+F. They can offer sympathy and help talk through things with me when other "T" personalities can't... ESTJ/ISTJ/INTJ friends are the WORST. 
22	You Are All Fired	Clean out your desks and just leave. Now.
20	You’ll hire me back as an independent contractor when I start profiting from the skills you taught me and have better rates than competitors though. 
12	Finally :D
9	B-b-but I live here dad....
4	Ka is a wheel. You'll want us back later my friend. 
5	[Put. That coffee. Down. Coffee's for closers. :D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUqo5tPZjrM)
5	I'll see your ass in court
3	Bye!
3	Miss me yet? 
5	Cool. I'll go start my next project.
4	Are you trying to be like Donald Trump? You know he's not an ENTJ right?
2	I don’t work here 
2	That's okay I already made my millions, finally I can do whatever I want to :D
1	You can't fire me. I'm union. Plus they like me better here than they do you. 
1	Fuck you too
1	Good. More free options 
1	You don’t get to fire me. I’ll fire myself, thank you very much. 
2	External influence on developing emotions as an ENTJ	I’ve recently tried to understand where I fit on the ENTJ scale, since I was always emotionally intelligent and very aware of my own and others’ emotions. I can easily spot through body language the way someone feels or the truth behind their words. Socializing is my fuel and I love learning about people and analyzing their behavior.\nAnd still, I see myself as a someone who is intact with her emotions.\nGrowing up with a mother who has a very dominant Fe function, I always found myself disagreeing with her whenever she used that function to justify whatever decision or idea she proposed. I wonder if she influenced my emotions or my awareness of them.\nI am a person of facts and reason, I get extremely annoyed with inaccuracy, passive people and wasting time. ENTJ seems to be me, but not the stereotypical cold-hearted one.\nAm I just an ENTJ who is really aware of her emotions or am I mistyped? 
7	I don’t think being an ENTJ necessarily means you’re out of touch with your emotions. It’s very normal to be able to understand, decode and analyse someone else’s emotions and feelings when you’re with them. What I think you’ll find is that, as an ENTJ, your emotions change your thoughts and thinking process subconsciously. Sometimes you’re probably not even aware of it. ENTJs are still very factual, if we’re faced with accuracy and statistics, how could we ever disagree with it? We’re about being efficient and productive. \n\nI think the stereotype is a joke. It’s not a reflection of cold-heart vibes, we just don’t beat around the bush and attempt to bring our emotions into discussions and debates. I think what you’ll find is your emotions do change the outcomes you have about situations, but they’ll disguise themselves so your brain can’t see. :P Does that make sense?
4	I am ENTJ, too, and I have an exceptionally high EQ (i can read body language, micro expressions and overall energy, which is why I can type people according to MBTI pretty much flawlessly), BUT I was raised among wolves (female sociopaths and a choleric ESTJ father), yet I've developed all these abilities. Maybe you are an ENTJ with the social variant like me (I am So/Sp)? Also, ENTJs are famous for cutting through the bullshit, why would that not apply to emotionally charged situations? It seems like the rationality of NTs is perfect for these.
3	I've definitely got a high EQ as well. I was raised by a narcissist, though, so learning to read people was something I did very instinctively and without realizing until I was much older. It's really common among abuse survivors to learn to read and adapt to situations instinctively, often without even knowing they're doing it.  \n\n\nI don't really see the point in pleasing people (responding to other replies you've made here). However, I'm not gonna be a total dick. There are times when you need to be soft and times when you don't. Learning when to do what is key. You can't ever please everyone so there's no point in trying, but it's also not smart to be a domineering asshole all the time. :P\n\n\nStereotypes are really dumb. Everyone's raised differently, and there are also things like Enneagram to take into account. The stereotypes can be funny as a joke, but a lot of people (that post here) seem to take them as gospel. There are far too many variables in real life for anyone to fit the types 100%, but you also shouldn't strive to do so. \n\n\nYou should look into enneagram as well! That can sometimes change how you appear a LOT. I'm a Type 7 so I come off a lot more ~fun~. 
2	I was also raised by an Fe-dominant mother, in addition to some other confusing family circumstances. I think a major blind-spot with MBTI is the inability to truly explain how early childhood "external influences" affect function development later in life. What was good for me was either the same as, or lesser than what was good for others in the household. Not a conducive environment to developing healthy Fi. \n\nOn the flip side, I've had relationships where the primary method of communication flowed constantly through Fi, positively and negatively. For me, that is overindulging an area of myself that eventually becomes destructive, because it conflicts with my desire to be rational and impartial about my behavior. I would refer to it as a very unhealthy Te-Fi loop: I don't value my own emotions, so I rationalized decisions that are made me feel worse, felt worse, and needed more emotional support to sustain the shitty cycle of poor decisions making me feel "better". Again, not a healthy expression of Fi.\n\nEmotion absolutely plays a role in the decision making process of the ENTJ. Fi should, ideally, always be present to ensure that one isn't pursuing their goals with such intensity that they bastardize their own values, needs and sense of self in the process. It is also how ENTJs connect to others. But beyond that, experiences that don't align with Fi, or force you to overindulge it, are toxic and should be avoided. 
2	Hello, fellow female ENTJ here. I think healthy female ENTJs are more in tune with our feelings... we're a little softer than our male counterparts, so I've discovered haha. I also think as the "commander" or "leader" personality type, we're better than other extroverted T types \(coughESTJcough\) at reading people... partially because in order to lead and command groups of people, we have to be able to read our audiences. We may often ignore feelings because we deem them inefficient or a waste of time but that doesn't mean we can't pick up on them. 
1	1 the system is not our design, the design is much more  \n2 profiles are contextual  \n3 having superior attributes is not a cocnern  \n4 girls have a predisposition for prioritising relatedness/intimacy - cultural thing  
3	Type Damon Grey of MBTV	Have any of you ENTJs followed the work of Damon Grey? Apparently, he self-identifies as ENTJ. So is he one of you folks?\n\nHere's his Youtube channel:\n\n[Damon Grey - MBTV](https://www.youtube.com/user/CCrandall0518/videos)
3	From the portion of his FI rant I just watched, I’d definitely say so.
3	Definitely, and definitely the best ENTJ on YouTube, too. \n\nMakes me wish I had an ENTJ friend. Unfortunately I haven’t seen any in my region. Maybe they’re only in Pokémon Red (I have Pokémon Blue)

8	How do you deal with inefficiency you can't change?	I am a textbook ENTJ. With all the strengths and weaknesses that come with it. \n\nSome background: Currently I'm doing a PhD and I'm very involved in research and academia. However, while my project is going well, milestones, planning, quality and all that, I cannot help but notice how there are so many things around me which are being done in a less than optimal manner. As a PhD student, though, I hardly have any influence over these things. I try to take on some tasks, but at the end of the day my goal is a PhD, and not fixing everything, so I focus on this. But even in my industrial experience, I have noticed plenty of inefficient work. People seem to love meetings of the type "Let's brainstorm and not get anywhere." or "I feel bad so let me rob you of 2h of your time." which is infuriating. I am very open to giving suggestions, but a suggestion will not be put into action unless the leader is both able and willing.\n\nI'm young (25) and I understand I still need to work my way up to such positions where I can change things for the better. But it seems to me these years that I have before such an opportunity opens are just years I have to spend ignoring these things. The alternative is sadly getting frustrated.\n\nHave you had similar experiences? How do you deal with that feeling of knowing that something can be done better, but not having the power to alter it?
7	I am a classic ENTJ and PhD student as well. The inefficiency around me in academia doesn’t bother me,  as my objective is to get my PhD. So I keep my head down and just focus on doing my personal best. I have tunnel vision and an action plan about my PhD and the rest of things going on in my lab I filter out. I’ll gladly help someone if they ask but I just don’t have the energy to focus on what others are doing otherwise. As for meetings, most meetings of any kind have a lot of wasted time and bother me haha, but unfortunately they’re unavoidable - just gotta sit through them.
6	Academia is a giant bureaucracy. Get your piece of paper, get the hell out and start a new business. Well, maybe after working in the industry for 2 years.\n
2	Don't get distracted by the noise.  Focus on finishing your education and then you have more control over what type of environment you'll be in.
1	I change.
1	Haha PhD student ENTJ here too!\n\nI deal with the feeling of knowing that something can be done better, by preparing myself for getting into a position where I will be able to do something about it. I'm in my third (and hopefully final) year, and I've decided that I need to spread my wings to a different institution once I have graduated/submitted. I'm well aware that there are going to be similar problems, but I'm not going to do a horizontal move, I will be moving upwards. I think you need to pick one or two areas which you commit to improving. One of mine is teaching- I love lecturing. I would love to be a program director, but I know its a long game. First I can play around with the content in sessions I will deliver, become a module convener and implement changes within a module, and then hit that target. As for research, every inefficiency you see is a publishing opportunity. Academics write all the time stuff along the lines of "nobody has looked at X, we should start doing Y" and just leaving the suggestion there. That my friend is not a source of frustration, but a rationale for something you could build upon. \n\nResearch is additive. Every paper, thesis, conference poster or powerpoint is a tiny spec of sand. Your tiny speck of sand attracts other specks of sand, and before we know it, there's a huge mountain of sand. Then one day someone is going to drop a speck of sand and boom, something big happens. We know something we never thought we would know before. It completely changes our perspective, or opens up even more questions which require new methods to answer them (ones we have yet to develop). The whole sand mountain falls down (i.e. a paradigm shift), and we have to start again, building a mountain out of specks of sand.\n\nSo yes, it is bloody frustrating. But honestly, you could be a speck of sand that takes research down an avenue which (in time) leads to a new technology, cure, theory, or whatever...all because you got frustrated and said "there's a better way of doing this"! You're not in the "wrong place", and you see things differently from other academics- our perspective is rare in academia and I think will be an asset. So, keep writing and researching, and figure out where you are going to direct your frustration. Which mountain of sand are you going to influence?\n\n Finally, some practical advice: don't go to meetings you don't have to go to! \n\nHonestly, I don't bother. figure out what meetings are mandatory (e.g. meeting with your supervisor), which ones "could just be sent in an email", and which ones really drain in to your time. People might look at you disapprovingly and suggest that you haven't got "enough to do" or don't care. Ignore them, because going to a meeting which is a waste of time is "being busy" which is different to being productive.\n

1	This thread confirms I am an ENTJ, however I hover with INTJ and ENFP contextually.
3	Possible mistype as INFJ. Help me decide?	About ten years ago I took an mbti test as part of a leadership training thing at my old job and scored INFJ. I had been working as a commodities trader and asked to be made the new team leader when the previous team leader was promoted. I did this for two reasons: team leaders made more money and I was the only person remaining on the team I thought was qualified. I did not enjoy being a leader.\n\nI recently got back into mbti and I was fine with my type, I felt it described many things about me but not all. The thing that made me finally consider I might be an ENTJ was the description of ENTJs as robots, which is something I have always said about myself. Specifically I would say "I'm not a person, I'm a robot with a really good person emulator" which is how I feel about myself in social situations. I am very comfortable being in social situations, I don't mind making contact with new people, I don't mind "open-mic" type events or performing in front of people. The thing is though that I am also very very comfortable being alone, and have solitary hobbies like painting and writing.\n\nThe biggest thing I never identified with about INFJ was the idea of very clear morality. I don't really think in terms of moral absolutes, and I am not mystical in any way as INFJs are sometimes described. I was raised an athiest, and I am almost congenitally incapable of belief in the supernatural, although I do consider myself a *philosophical* Buddhist. Specifically I'm a [mereological nihilist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mereological_nihilism) and do not believe in the existence of an unconditional objectively identifiable self.\n\nI have a degree in math, but I wasn't a good student. In school I was way more interested in hitting on girls and hanging out with my friends, and I do believe I have very strong social intuition regarding the feelings and motivations of others, which is why I believed my type was INFJ.\n\nI'll answer any questions if it would help.\n\nEdit:\n\nYour analysis has been extremely helpful, the best part is I don't need to change my user name. Thanks.
11	There isn't a ton for me to conclusively point to in the OP that goes one way or another. That said, here are some general observations I have about you, and why I think you're more likely an INFJ. \n\nFirst, your style of writing is definitely Ti. You have a very formulaic way of laying out your ideas where it's always "major premise, examples, but also counter-examples", almost like you're debating with yourself out in the open.\n\nThis stems from a desire for a label that is definitionally precise. In the INFJ, it goes something like this: you have an idea, you want to learn everything about that idea, you think you can see where the idea holds up and where it needs refining, Ti pinpoints and refines the specific flaws, ultimately weaving it back into Ni, where it's still not satisfied. You highlight certain traits about yourself, e.g. being a "robot", because they don't fit into the framework as you'd like them to, and so you can't settle on it. Put simply: you form conclusions based on reasons that make sense to you, rather than having a conclusion and rationalizing it with supporting data as needed. You said yourself that there's no "objectively identifiable self", which to me suggests you'll never be satisfied with any label's inability to fully encompass who you are. I really think you're Ti > Te.\n\nAlso, I have never met an INFJ that thought in moral absolutes, and I wouldn't associate that feature with this type in general. Coming out against the grain as an INFJ by saying "here's what I believe, take it or leave it" is totally antithetical to their desire to maintain social harmony (Fe), and maybe more importantly, their lack of conscious Fi. Your description of being raised atheist and now being incapable of belief in a higher power strongly suggests that you draw from logical principles that you're comfortable justifying, rather than "this is right or wrong, and I know it is".\n\nLastly, you're almost certainly an Ni-dom, I don't see Te-dom here. Why didn't you like being a team leader when you knew you were qualified? Why are you confident in your "strong social intuition"? Why are you a "robot" emotionally (cue another rant about Ti vs Fi)? Hard to take a stab at it without knowing you better, but everything you've written here suggests INFJ. \n\n
7	u/Acernal I think analyzed your post pretty well, but I'll throw in my two cents about INFJs in general.\n\nENTJs are more like coconuts - very very hard externally, soft and delicious inside. That's why there's a lot of posts about struggling with emotion here - ENTJs are impossibly full of repressed emotion. INFJs are more like peaches - very good at being soft in social settings, but a rock solid core when alone and/or necessary. That would account for that robotic self-perception. \n\nI believe the reason INFJs are perceived to have very clear moral lines is because famous INFJs are gripped by an Ni-Ti ideal that they use Fe to charismatically spread about, and it's rare to discuss how they got to their conclusions over time. Hitler for example spent years talking to others and really listening to what people responded to in his rhetoric. He perfected his message and really honed it, always using Fe to correct his Ni and Ti. Sadly, his end message was one of resentment and disgust.\n\nI think the average INFJ (yes, oxymoronic) won't commit to beliefs they cannot logically perfect, much like xNTPs, but because of their relative anonymity that isn't considered when discussing INFJs. It does not help that xNFPs and ISFJs type themselves as INFJs all the time, so they misinform the world on what it means to be an INFJ.\n\nI hope that is clarifying.
1	The robot part definitely sounds T-dom, but consider that you may also be an ISTP or even an ESTJ. ISTPs in particular share all cognitive functions with an INFJ and can test as one.   \n    I'd recommend carefully reading through socionics INFJ/ENTJ profiles and seeing which ones you identify with. They are more detailed than MBTI ones which makes it easier to settle on type.    \n[ENTJ by Gulenko](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=LIE_Profile_by_Gulenko) | [ENTJ by Stratiyevskaya](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/42486) | [ENTJ subtypes](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/46746-LIE-ENTj-subtypes?p=138234&viewfull=1#post138234)    \n\n[INFJ by Gulenko](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=IEI_Profile_by_Gulenko) | [INFJ by Stratiyevskaya](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/42491) | [INFJ subtypes](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/44198-IEI-INFp-Subtypes?p=40033&viewfull=1#post40033)    \n\n[ISTP by Gulenko](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=LSI_Profile_by_Gulenko) | [ISTP by Stratiyevskaya](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/42483) | [ISTP subtypes](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/4440-Discussion-of-LSI-ISTj-Subtypes?p=142621&viewfull=1#post142621)    \n
2	You're a dynamic and complicated human being and the MBTI has relatively low accuracy. 
3	Were you ever an introvert or were you always an extrovert?	INTJ here! I was just wondering if any of you had every been an introvert in the past and if so, what changed? \n\n
19	I thought I was extremely introverted (and initially thought I was INTJ or INTP) but it just turned out that I had social anxiety which I kind of grew out of with the help of therapy. I wouldn't say I'm a complete extrovert now but an ambivert.\n\nOpening up, being vulnerable and connecting with lots of other people is the most rewarding thing in life  - it really broadens your mind and gives you this satisfaction that can't be found anywhere else.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I still prefer close, deep connections than knowing many people superficially. But it doesn't have to be one or the other. You can have both. You can have the security and fulfilment of the former with the fun of the latter. But if you asked me if I wanted to read a book alone or go out for dinner with freinds, I would choose to go out. Whereas before, I would've been so apprehensive due to my anxiety, I would've just defaulted to reading the book alone not really fully realising what I was missing out on.
5	I used to be incredibly shy, but I think it was mostly due to having a talkative and overbearing mother. Once I moved away from home and family I became less shy and now I am extremely extroverted. 
5	Always an ambivert.
3	I used to engage people in conversation from the child seat of the shopping cart
3	Always an extrovert, just a highly selective one.
2	Tested as an ENTJ in my early 20s but a TAIS profile ranked me high on extroversion and med-high on introversion.  I didn’t even know that was a thing so I researched a bit and it made sense.  \n\nThese days, I’m more likely an XNTJ working on becoming an XNTX.
2	I personally think that people are either one or the other. I for instance have always been extroverted. However, I was shy when I was a kid. I don't gain energy by hanging out with just anyone. I gain energy hanging out with my friends, and specifically more than I gain by myself. 
2	I'm kinda both. Very expressive, especially at work, but I need quiet time to reset. And I keep a handful of close friends, rather than a large social circle. In the MB analysis, I'm and E, but near the middle.
2	I was only an “introvert” because I was steamrolled by manipulative ENTJ types my whole life. 6 years passed now, and I’ve emerged as an ENTJ myself (hopefully a less manipulative one).
1	As a young kid I felt shy a lot. As I began working on improving myself, my self-confidence grew, and I got more out of myself.\n\nI am clearly more E than I, but I have movements when I is better.
0	Actually, all my life pretty much I was an extrovert and then I moved to Arizona (which I did not want to do - long story not for here).  Lived in AZ for 3 years, became an introvert.  Moved back out of AZ a couple weeks ago back home and i feel like a mix of I/E.  I also come from a place (and am back here now) where people would just as soon tell you to go fuck yourself as they would say hello to you.  I love Boston.  It suits me.  But when I’d come home for visits from AZ, I’d be an extrovert again.  Arizona fucking sucks and it can turn an E into an I.  
5	ENTJ lovers, do you find yourselves being controlling/possessive of your partner? Why or why not?	
23	I believe our higher calling as ENTJ's is to not control but to delegate. To be good leaders. That's what can make us great. As I mature I get better at controlling less and leading/inspiring/delegating more. For me personally the single element to work on most as I work that direction is to use goals, expectations, and deadlines. I try and offer those things with a delivery that inspires. I prefer autonomy in others but I can become irritated if that autonomy doesn't land where I expect it to. Which Ive generally learned to view as my fault not theirs, unless excessive communication was provided to the individual early on. \n\nWhich loops me back to one of our downfalls if not careful; it's easy as an ENTJ to expect someone else to do what to us seems so obvious.  Personally I'll give someone the chance early on to do what is "obviously right" but after that, if they've messed up, I'll control or write them off unless I'm consciously working towards that 'higher self' I mentioned in the first paragraph. \n\nWith my wife all of the above remains true. In many senses my wife gets the most extreme version of what I'm referring to in the work place. So she's a great litmus test for growth and whether or not I'm being someone I don't wanna be. Ultimately my wife does look to me for leadership so long as I'm nice about it. But there lies a fine line between control and leadership that I doubt I need to explain to folks in this sub. 
11	Yes, they simply do not push back enough. I'm working on it.\n\nDisagreeable women also make me calm for this reason - I know I'm safe from becoming controlling as they will let me know way before it happens.
7	Nope. I'm not at all jealous and I like spending time separately. I can be bossy in other areas of my life but with a romantic relationship, that's supposed to be the one place where I can just kick back and be trusting.
7	No. Trust is very important to me and I don't like drama. My partner and I have a lot of trust. We communicate well. I wouldn't be with someone who made me feel like I couldn't trust them. 
8	I'm a low-maintenance person, friend and partner. I put a high premium on non-verbal communication. I have an extremely busy schedule and need to maximize how I use my free time. \n\nIdeally, I'd like to be with someone who also values those things. Acting like a domineering overlord is exactly the opposite of what I want. 
7	My long time partner is an ENFP (so imagine what it's like to attempt to 'control' her)! Over time I've learnt to recognise that her free spirit is the absolute best thing about her and to attempt to control that is stupid and futile.\n\nI also concur with what the other poster said about trying to control your environment. You can't, and as ENTJ leaders the optimal strategy is to set a clear and exciting vision, and to make sure that everyone working with you, is committed to that same vision and have the resources to work towards that goal. If achieved, everything else falls into place without the need for you to micro manage (which is a suboptimal use of your time).
4	Nope. I wouldn't want to be with someone who is controlling so why would I act that way?
1	No. In fact, he’s a recruiter and I almost accidentally sent him after a friend of mine who was interested in joining the Army. I realized that it would have become a date and I was legit confused, because it would be a good thing for him to take her out as a professional, but it would obviously be weird for me to set them up like that. I personally have no feelings towards the situation but I recognize that other people might. 
1	The “why” is a fair question.  The “why not” is a stupid question.  \n\nE: Seriously?  A downvote because I ~~think~~ know that people should allow others their freedom and not try to control other people (especially a significant other) ?  What kind of freedom do you value in a relationship?  Yours but not your SO’s?  \n\nOkay buddy.  
8	What is Your Profession?	I am interested to know where people are regarding their current professions. Also, what is your ideal job? What daily actions would entail?
15	I quit journalism because it’s dying and corrupt, and now I work in professional rodeo (achieved my childhood dream of being a cowboy since astronaut isn’t possible yet)

7	Jeez. All of you have much more interesting careers than I do.\n\nI'm a cook, working on a promotion to shift lead/management. I'm gonna use the extra money I'll be making to go back to school and become an electrician. That's the goal, at least.

There are *lots* of ENTJs in the academy, but they tend to concentrate in certain fields in my experience, many more in the social sciences and humanties than in STEM or the arts.

16	How to let go of the need to prove yourself to people who think lesser of you?	As an ENTJs (at least me) whenever someone is giving us advice or telling us do something, it feels like they're implying that we don't already do that/know that. How can I become a better listener/worker and let go of needing compliments
25	"The lion does not concern himself with the opinions of sheep" -Tywin Lannister, the best fictional entj
6	I had this issue at work literally yesterday. At the risk of sounding arrogant, I am widely respected amongst all my colleagues - managers, teammates, etc. I have senior managers single me out for hard work and other employees who are notoriously distrusting not think twice when I give them an answer to something they're looking for.\n\nThis one guy on my team, an equal, who I'll call Jim doesn't trust me for anything he asks. He will specifically ask me a question and when I give a response he challenges me on it and decides to research himself or ask our manager, who just spits back the same answer. It drives me NUTS and I end up telling my manager (who is also a good friend of mine, so it blurs the lines of what's appropriate to talk about) that it bothers me.\n\nMy boss tells me to focus on the fact that literally everyone except Jim respects the hell out of me and what Jim thinks doesn't matter anyway because he's not on my management hierarchy. She told me to keep doing what I'm doing and not worry about one person. As ENTJs, our drive to be successful is deep and inherent, and the benefit that results from this inner drive is trust from others. They think that A) you can get the job done, and B) if they're giving you advice, you will use it to develop into a a better version of yourself (something ENTJs constantly try to do). People giving advice don't really waste their time talking to those who won't grow from it.\n\nSo in essence, don't worry about fishing for compliments. The compliment is that people think you are smart enough and well rounded enough to take the advice and grow from it. So to quote my boss, keep doing what you're doing.
3	I want to be admired, but it's impossible to feel this all the time. I always end up perceived vain. So i tried other way. I expect FEEDBACK. Good/bad/personal view of the others are essential to have some kind of "objective" picture of yourself. \n\nIf you hear something one times - let go\n\nIf you hear something two times - watch out \n\nIf you hear something three times - consider advice as legitimate\n\nYou wouldn't believe what people can teach you about yourself. 
2	 Don’t take them seriously. Continue to focus on improving you. Never stop that. I’ve got my dream apartment. I just got a dream job. I am getting laid. I love my life. I like surprising people. And I like people thinking I’m a dope and then I surprise them with my aptitude and charm, people skills. Whatever you want to call it. Just focus on making yourself more and more awesome. Address every insecurity. Once your confidence is wicked high, this shit doesn’t bother you. I’m there now. I couldn’t care less if someone thinks I inferiors. I’m having a ton of sex. I have a job that people generally stay at until they retire and My life is Just. Fucking\n Dope. Hard work and luck. Get to it.  
2	Quite frequently people aren't telling you how to do something basic because they think you don't know how to do it, they're telling you so they can let go of any anxieties lurking in the back of their minds that you *just might* not know how. So in these situations, it's not personal. Dealing with these people is principally about reassurance. Smile, repeat back the instructions so they know that you heard them, and over time they'll reach a point where they don't associate you with those anxieties anymore, and they'll trust you--and trust is the highest compliment available.
2	Are you sure you're an entj?
1	INFP here and this is how I feel.  Ni or Ti guys mess me up with it if I am not wary.  Ti I can ward, but Ni fuckers are relentless.  I'm like there are 70,000 relevant details you don't know that I don't have time to explain, and I did consider *ANYTHING AT ALL* before I did what I did.  I guess I have a threshold for condescending|noting|(constructive criticism).  \n\nJust try to remain calm, and tell yourself they are just covering their bases.  Besides this, if you need to fight back, just let me know.  There are a million ways to skin a cat.
1	Totally. That's not always a bad thing though. Maybe I don't already know XYZ. Now I do, that makes me better. Maybe I'm doing the thing but I'm not doing it in a way that is efficient or visible. Knowing this gives you the opportunity to improve. So, instead of taking an instantly defensive posture when some one is giving you feedback/criticism look at is as strategic gold. You can use this to be better if you let yourself. \n\nIf you immediately shut down people trying to give you advice you're going to get the reputation for being defensive, inflexible and hard to work with. If you need some objectivity to help you parse the useful feedback from the pointless feedback, imagine your rolls are switched and you're giving the advice. \n\nDon't underestimate the power of humility and winning people over. Makes getting your goals accomplished a heck of a lot easier than thinking you know best and mowing everyone down. \n\n
5	How do you remain productive and focused while plagued with nonproductive emotions like anger, self-doubt, fear etc.. when under immense pressure, stress?	I'm asking ENTJs because you guys are the most productive and emotionally resilient type. I'm an INTJ if that matters. How do you remain productive and focused while plagued with nonproductive emotions such as anger, self-doubt, fear, etc.. when under immense pressure or stress?\n\nI know everyone goes through tough times. But to give some background: the last year and a half have been almost entirely suffering and pain for me, physical and mental, due to chronic medical problems. I had to make sacrifices to remain an A student with the exception of a couple of classes.  The two people I've spoken to about this think I'm strong for having endured all this but it's not enough. I didn't push myself everyday even while I was terrified of dying just to survive, I need to succeed, if I don't then all of this was for nothing. I want to apply to a graduate program, graduate and start my career. There are a few W's on my transcript because I had to withdraw at the end or middle of the semesters because I was too sick to take the finals or midterms for those classes which will probably affect my candidacy for the programs I'm interested in. The limit of my mental and emotional resilience has been reached. How do I get myself to keep going and push forward even though the mental and emotional exhaustion and self-doubt?
9	Deep breath :)\n\nI think the real answer is you don’t.  I find people are easier to understand when you think about them like biological machines.  Your machine is breaking down.  The dash lights are coming on, seals are starting to break, funny noises coming from the engine.. and you’re here asking how can you keep going without breaking down.  \n\nI get it.. I really do.  1 vacation in the last 10 years and it took my dad being terminally ill.  There was a lot of weight on my shoulders after that.  Couldn’t stop for anything or anyone, especially myself.  It’s literally how you run yourself into the ground.  If you want to perform at a high level like you seem to be, and do it more than a few months at a time, you have to take care of yourself.  Diet.. exercise.. yoga.. meditation.. find your balance and be as healthy as you can be.\n\nLife is a marathon, not a sprint.  I’m still not great at following that advice, but it becomes more obvious as the years go by.  Happy to chat more if you’d like :)
4	I just mutter to myself "If this is gonna be my hell then so be it." And then I move along. But if it becomes a bit mentally or emotionally overbearing I distract myself whether it's watching a tv show, taking a walk for at least an hour, or playing the piano. Do whatever makes you "happy" for a while then do what you have to do. Just don't lose yourself in your happy place or else you'll get stuck in a rut and forget what needs to be done.
2	Usually my work and being productive are the most stable things in my life. If something gets me very riled up, it's sort of my safety net. I can always push it to the side and get a good load of work done. It's still there and bugging me, but I know that I'll feel a lot better if I have a good day of productivity under my belt. I'm a lot more likely to calm down and deal with the emotions more appropriately if I've not just wasted the entire day whining.

3	Dealing with SO who has been putting up a lot of weight	I don't know how much of this is me being an ENTJ or just a jerk but I would likely to know what you guys think and help me figure a way out.\n\nWhen we started dating she was what you'd call thick...but she did not pay any attention to her eating habits... Many a times when we are out for food and the way I see her gobbling down food and gulping the beer reminds me of a pig (w/o any malice)\n\nNow when she gets naked there are 3 layers of flab on her belly..this really depresses me and kills my mood...I work out in the gym everyday and take good care of my body.\nI obviously want to have someone who takes as much care of their body and looks good.\n\nTalking to her is something I don't want to do...takes any hints of her putting on weight very badly and will go down a bad path. Very poor at keeping habits. \n\nWhat do I do?
29	So she’s fat, neglects her body, violating your standards, and living a gluttonous/unhealthy lifestyle. While using up resources that could go elsewhere. What’s there to debate? Sorry our sub isn’t triple ply charmin ultra soft. 
23	We’re ENTJs.  We **are** jerks.  \n\nBy the way, you have to kill her.  
13	offer to bring her to the gym\n\nframe it honestly and directly, make it clear that you want to help her for her own good as well as yours\n\nif she respects you and loves you, she will listen and jump at the opportunity to work out with you\n\nIf she scoffs at the idea, takes offense to it, gets upset with you over it, AND you are disgusted with her, are you two right for each other? Definitely not, and at that point you should have no problem breaking up with her.\n\nalso, like the other guy said, ENTJs are jerks, but we're not unreasonable jerks. we just tell people what they don't want to, but need to hear.
9	I’m sorry but I laughed harder than I should have at the “3 layers of flab.” \n\n\nAnyway... I think it bothers us ENTJ’s when we see people not making a conscious effort to better themselves—especially when it is a loved one. I feel like a lot of ENTJ’s I know place a large emphasis on self-development in most or even all aspects of their life. I think living a healthy lifestyle is pretty common among ENTJ’s too. All the ones I know take care of themselves fairly well. You should not feel bad for feeling the way you do. You should bring it up to her and be supportive throughout the process. Be gentle with the way you approach her in this situation because being told you are thick (or overweight) is not something that people can handle very well. I am sure she knows and is aware of her body but she could be having a difficult time controlling her eating habits. She could also be stressed and is coping with her problems by stress eating?
8	>...reminds me of a pig (w/o any malice)\n\nLaughing my ass off. Yeah, no malice at all.\n\n>What do I do?\n\nYou dump her. I mean, what's the plan? Spend the rest of your life with her? As she gets bigger and bigger and starts having medical issues? Or settle.
5	Honestly man sounds like you should break up and find someone else who values fitness like you do.\n\nYou can go down the "You should work out" path and try encouraging or including her in your workouts or something, but most likely that will just piss her off and create arguments since even if she needs to be healthier, she's not going to want to do it as an obligation rather than her own decision.\n\nA leopard rarely changes their spots, even less when someone else is trying to force them to.  Go get yourself a leopard that likes to run of its own accord, you'll be happier for it and your current girlfriend will find a guy who is equally lazy to be with.
3	Gluttony is a deadly sin. You know what to do.
3	Since I don't know you or your partner, I will say in fairness that most people honestly do not even know how to begin taking care of themselves. The amount of misinformation and targeted, false marketing in the fitness and nutrition industry is staggering. Going it alone, without any prior knowledge, is really hard. If she doesn't have the willpower as it is, I think it's clear she needs help getting there. Not saying it has to be you, but it's worth appreciating how many people fail at this task, especially alone.\n\nThe bigger problem I see here isn't her weight, but your mutual inability to discuss the topic. That is blatantly unhealthy communication. Constructively offering advice to someone you care about should not be construed as offensive in a long term relationship, so even if she did lose the weight, I feel like the source of this problem would still exist. I would make the best attempt you can at presenting her with a reasoned, constructive diet and workout plan that is in her best interest. Maybe offering to workout with her would help, since it indicates you're not ashamed of being seen with her in public (or are you?). If she rejects it and can't have a mature conversation about moving forward, I think it's time for a change. 
3	She is probably using food as a coping mechanism for stress. Talk to her to see what’s stressing her out. Everyone deals with stress in a different way. Perhaps you can show her exercise is a better way to handle stress. 
2	Stay, say nothing, be miserable. Stay, say something, she freaks, be miserable. Stay, say something, it goes well, things improve. Leave, things improve.\n\nThose are your options, pick one and stick with it. People who will not help themselves are a waste of time and energy. 
2	> Talking to her is something I don't want to do\n\nSeems to me lack of communication in your relationship is a far bigger issue than she being overweight. This is a sensitive issue. You must address the issue, but also be as diplomatic as possible about it. Don't accuse her, simply guide her. Make it known that this is something that bothers you and that you are willing to help out. If she gets upset, then she gets upset. Let her calm down, and approach the issue again. At some point she'll catch on that just because the problem upsets her, it doesn't mean it will go away on its own.
1	So dtmfa! You're damned if you don't, damned if you do on this one. But I would err on the side of saying something. Maybe you're upset because she got fat and that's what you wanted to do. 
1	A lot of times I don't have conversations because I think I will be too harsh/offensively straight forward. Before cutting things off I would at least give a conversation a try. I would put it in terms of concern about her health and taking good care of herself. Not sure what her type is, but I'd preface things with not wanting to come off the wrong way, emphasizing that you love her, and that that is why you are bringing this up. Don't ever mention weight, only infer that you don't want it to sound like you are talking about weight. If you can encourage her to start thinking about healthy eating and self care, weight change will probably follow. 
1	If you really loved your so a. you wouldn't be using the word pig to describe her and b. You would have been forthcoming simce a long time ago and already communicated your dissatisfaction and worries with her. Are you even in love?

4	Fi-users and pride	I am really attracted to an INFP friend of mine. His passion, his tenderness, his humanistic care/concern, his subjective happiness, his artfulness and very conscious self-presentation. It's appealing.\n\nBut, I do get scared of the Fi-dom thing. It just seems that, in a lot of discussions, it's not so much about a sequential train of thought. or a clear resolution.\n\nHe is fine with leaving it at some idyllic and well-meaning, albeit bleak, aphorisms on humanity/the world. He seems to revel in his full-bodied and poetic acknowledgement of human shittiness, whilst he works on himself to not be these qualities he sees as fundamentally inherent in people (so as to be a beacon of hope, I suppose).\n\nI want to talk more about consequences/reasonable inferences, but he is concerned with the overarching sentiments. I see him do this with other stuff (like, being cynical about medical systems or certain drugs, even though they really work for certain conditions). He is very confident in his sentiments. It's sexy/charismatic, but I know it can easily cross into bullshit.\n\nIdk, working on understanding this mindset more. It is appealing to me.
4	Lets just say there is a reason why pragmatism is a thing. You could see the IxFPs role in helping define what the end goal should be. However in matters of *how* to optimally get there, you shouldn't rely on them, lest you and everyone around you want to be fucked hard in the ass
14	Why is Vanity Considered A Bad Quality?	Just want to see an ENTJ perspective on this.\n\nWhat harmful effects does vanity have on a person, if any? When do they come about? \n\nWhen has vanity become too much? How do you moderate it?
12	ENTJ here.\n\nTL;DR: Vanity can blind you to reality and limit you. Vanity can make you look weak and not trust worthy to others. Vanity paints others as inferior which can lead to unfair disadvantage and treatment. “excessive” is the key word to vanity and that’s terribly subjective. Knowing your goal and understanding how much the opinion of others matters to you will determine your behavior. \n\nLet's start with a common understanding of what Vanity is. [Definition]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanity): "*excessive* pride in or admiration of one's own appearance or achievements". Key word here is excessive. It's long been associated as a negative personality trait as far back as the Greek Mythology of [Narcissus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissus_(mythology)) and Native American morality stories of the [Corn Husk Doll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_husk_doll).\n\nThe excessive pride in one’s self is seen has a negative because it's associated with both physical and emotional damage to ourselves and those around us. Vain people are seen a selfish, self-centered and narcissistic. This isn’t just an elevation of one’s self but also contributs to a devaluation of others. So, where pride or confidence is "I'm satisfied with who I am" vanity is a view of superiority "I'm better than you and you are inferior to me".  It's often associated with attention seeking which is also frequently seen as a negative personality trait. Vanity can be seen as an undeserved pride in one’s self which diminishes preserved competence. \n\nVanity can be confused with confidence. What's the difference? Vanity says, "everyone will love me because I'm special and amazing and if they don't they're jealous and stupid". Whereas confidence says "I am satisfied with myself and I won't be negatively affected if I'm not accepted. I'll take negative feedback and use it to be better. I’m not better than you, I’m simple satisfied with me". \n\nThe line separating confidence from excessive self-adulation can be a fine one. If you’re accused of being vain consider your motivations. Are you attention seeking *for praise*? Do you think you are superior to your audience? Additionally, this could be a communication disconnect between implication and inference. If I, as the speaker am implying (what I want to communicate) that I am confident in XYZ situation my audience may infer (what is understood) that I am *excessively* proud of myself. This could simply be a miscommunication. How you say things and your motivation for saying them is a large part of how your audience will interpret your communication. \n\nAs an ENTJ, I have a desire not only to *be* competent but for others to *perceive* me as competent. This can manifest in being unnecessarily correcting or demonstrative of my “knowledge”. Instead of people thinking, “Wow, they know their stuff!” they sometimes think “Wow, what a know-it-all”. So, I’ve been working hard to demonstrate my knowledge and capabilities through my actions. If I need to be showy or attention seeking for praise, that’s excess to me. Your mileage may vary. \n
5	Vanity alone is rarely "too much" for me. Some of my best interpersonal relationships and friendly, competitive rivalries have been with other ENTJs who are 10x more vain than I will ever be. Part of it stems from competition bringing out the best version of myself. A bigger part of it has to do with who I am to most people - as someone responsible for their well-being, or in a mentoring role. Most of the time, I would strongly prefer not to be those things. If someone with strong willpower and convictions wants to challenge me at something, and they genuinely think they are superior, I very much welcome that challenge. I learn best through destruction and reassembly.\n\nHonestly, I find that when people are offended by others' overt flaunting of their skills and accomplishments, it's because they are not nearly as successful themselves. The remedy must therefore be to tear down the successful person and bring him/her down to the level of the emotionally-weak person. And yes, I get that this is not always true -- some people have an ego so large it is suffocating to be around, and it is pretty clear when that is the case. But on the whole I'd still say there's a stigma against successful people because triggered-Fi is the opiate of the (online) masses. \n\nAs long as "vanity" doesn't overlap with "immaturity", I think it's fine. If you're overly vain to the point where you're ostracizing people, recognize that and adapt. But the bar is pretty high, to me at least, for when that's really necessary. Genuine success should be embraced and encouraged. 
3	Personally I take the pro fanity position
1	I'm an ENTJ and am considered to be a vain person by many of my friends (I can never tell if they're joking about this). I always talk about me being high and mighty, in a humourous way, but their is that irresistible drive to be that person. So far, I have been able to become/gain what I might have gloated about earlier in a reasonable amount of time.\n\nBottom line, if it lifts your morale I think being vain is good but you have to check yourself from time to time. Always be vain about what you want to achieve and don't currently have, works as a reminder for me. If you aren't getting there you have to back down and figure things out. The worst thing vanity does to a person is push them into a make-believe world, always keep your grip on reality and where you actually stand.\n\nThis Drake lyric has always rung true with me, *I know I exaggerated things, now I got it lile that*
1	Vanity is considered a bad quality because the person who exhibits it implies that that he is better than the others to whom he's speaking. It shows an obsession with the self, rather than an interest in improving the world. Being vain is a way of being mean to others while simultaneously making yourself look insecure. It's a lose-lose.\n\nOf course there's room for confidence, self-love and so on, but vanity is when those inwardly complimentary qualities are taken too far.
1	i dont know well the definitions for nonvalues and vice, i much rather focus on the virtues and measure how far from it you are  
0	The selfie generation would without a doubt say it's not a bad quality.

5	Mental Illness and 'Strength'	In terms of dealing with mental illness, how have you found the healthy balance of self awareness/compassion (needed to know where to head, who to contact, what to change, what to apply to, etc) and resolve/strength (needed to focus, enact, not be swayed by momentary yet powerful negative impulses/feelings) as they pertain to handling mental illness? \n\nI'm very used to not acknowledging a lot of feelings, but I am also psychotically depressed, on and off.
4	Obviously a tough question. Jordan Peterson talked about helping his patients and much of it was not dealing with mental illness per se but rather getting them out of a rut life-wise.\n\nMeaning that if they are not happy at work, have some limiting beliefs and irrational fears and lack of friends or education, he would point them toward steps they can take to get them closer to where they want to be.\n\nSo, ENTJs tend to be better at taking care of themselves than an average person, but I still have got to ask - during the times you are not psychotic, have you done enough to help yourself when you are not in control?\n\nSoftening the fall that is. Do you have enough money to not work for a few months? Do you have some friends that you can talk to? Is your weight ok? Are you reasonably fit? Do you live with people you cannot stand? Do you hate the city / street / country / climate that you live on / have to deal with? Is your personal life lacking?\n\nAgain, this might sound like babysitting, but I still wanted to ask - are there small (or not so small) steps that you can take that do not have to do with mental health but overall happiness?\n\nWhen you get psychotic and you happen to hate your housemates, you may only get that much angrier.\n\nAs for how to deal with the actual underlying condition - I do not know. Probably the wrong sub.\n
2	TL;DR I think my strength/ability to deal with my illnesses comes from a slight bit of love addiction.\n\nI have been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (with bipolar traits) and complex PTSD. Years before those diagnoses I was diagnosed usual depression/anxiety, but it turns out those are just by products of the BPD/PTSD. This time next week I will hopefully find out if I have bulimia. I tick literally every single box for that ED, except instead of puking, exercise and fasting are my purging methods.\n\nThey say people with BPD aren't self-aware at all, however I'm a bit of a weird case because I'm emotionally and psychologically naked. I have the deepest understanding of my own mind, my issues, my vast history of abuse, and how all of that affects my behaviour now. I do struggle with my emotions though. I struggle more than I realise when I experience distressing emotions which are usually distressing because they set off certain triggers. I won't go into detail on that because it's so complex, I don't even know where to begin. I think the only reason as to why I'm so self-aware is because I spent a lot of time around my aunts when I was a child, and they placed a lot of emphasis on spiritually, the soul, etc., etc. I grew up with an incredible interest in spirituality which evolved into an interest in psychology (analytical psychology specifically). I first discovered the MBTI when I was 15 or 16, and that opened me up to a whole new world of understanding the mind, behaviour, etc. I knew I was a complex person, but it wasn't until I was 20/21 where I got my BPD diagnosis. Because of my desperate need to understand what was going on in my mind years prior to my diagnosis (years prior to my realising that I had an actual illness), I started doing a lot of studying, analysing, and constant never ending intropection. As a result, I introspect every single second of every single minute I'm awake. It's been like this since I was 13 I think.\n\nIt was only in the last year that I learnt how to deal with my emotions. I've emotionally shut down (apparently something that occurs in PTSD sufferers?) and that has helped me process my emotions MUCH better than I have ever done before. In recent months, however, I have started unraveling. I'm hoping I will go back to successfully shutting down soon enough. I hope. I desperately hope.\n\nI'm unmedicated and I have never had any form of counselling or therapy. I refuse it because I absolutely will not be able to handle confronting my past, specifically the part where my cousin molested me when I was a kid. The reason for that is because my family still speak to her knowing what happened. If I let that get to me I would have committed suicide a long time a go. I did make numerous attempts, but my mum stopped me each and every time. God help me. It's easier to just ignore what happened and dissociate any emotions from it because I have to live with these people. No choice about that. My only escape is to get married (the joys of having a third world culture in a first world country!), but I struggle in the relationship department and my family refuse to give me an arranged marriage. \n\nAs for compassion, I have so much love to give. But it's only directed toward my niece and nephews. For whatever reason, I've become an INCREDIBLY maternal person. I remember wanting my own baby when I was 12 years old. I think it might come out of a sheer desperation to feel wanted/needed, essentially accepted wholeheartedly and unconditionally. I've been subjected to abnormal amounts of bullying, hatred and abuse since I was 7 years old. Emotionally I'm in severe pain or I feel this excruciating emptiness unless I'm with my niece and nephews. And when I'm with them, I need constant physical affection (hugs, kisses, holding hands, even just sitting on a sofa and having them lean against me) to feel reassured that I'm loved and that I'm giving love. It's like being a child and constantly crying out for attention from a parent. My mum says I suffered a lot as a baby because she couldn't tend to me a lot. Maybe the reason why I'm so compassionate is because I feel inclined to give what I never got. 5 years ago, before the kids came into my life, I was constantly suicidal, constantly self-harming. All the positive love I feel now because of them used to be self-hatred. I owe my life to these kids. Even now, I still struggle with incredible amounts of self-hatred, but I don't focus on that anymore (90% of the time at least) because I'm too busy focussing on them and how much happiness they bring. \n\nI think the vast majority of my strength comes from having my niece and nephews in my life. Before them I was a wreck. Now I'm still a wreck, but I'm a wreck who gets a thousand hugs every day. I wouldn't be alive if it wasn't for those hugs. The part of my strength that doesn't come from them comes from accepting that I can't change my past, but I can change how I deal with it and what type of person it makes me. That's something I have struggled with a lot in recent years especially because I left Islam right before my mental health degraded so severely. But over the last year or two I came to accept that I might not be Muslim but I do still believe in god (not the anthropomorphic "sky dad") and the afterlife, however I certainly don't believe in hell because I think this life is punishment/torture as it is. I've come to realise my ultimate goal is peace and tranquility, and I'm likely to not achieve it here, but probably will after death. And most importantly, I've accepted that all of this might just be my imagination playing games with me because it's so desperate to believe that peace and tranquility are achievable without a lobotomy. But I'm okay with that because a hopeful delusion is better than a negative delusion. And after my experiences with existential depression, a hopeful delusion is MUCH better than no delusion.\n\nIf it counts for anything, I self-medicate with exercise. That helps SO much.
1	try dry fasting and zero carb  \neat once every 2 - 3 days, eat only good qual meat  
3	Living in Japan	Do/ have any of you live in Japan? I may be going there for some work (maybe a year) soon.\n\nDoes the culture mesh well with your personality? \n\nDo workplaces welcome a lot of new ideas/suggestions from subordinates?\n\nAn ENTJ perspective on this would be nice. 
2	I stayed in Okinawa for 3 months and visited the mainland Japan while there. (I am also part Japanese, but was not raised with their customs besides what was common to my area). Yes, it meshed *very* well with my personality, and if I didn’t have remarkably loud kids I would probably move there. \n\nAlso no, they do not welcome advice from subordinates. 
2	Big work culture as the centerfold for everyone's lives. I'd say that most ENTJs have a proclivity to do well in the culture - doesn't mean that every ENTJ will like it tho
2	ENTJ here. I lived in Aomori Prefecture for 3 years from age 17-20. I LOVED it and I miss it more than any place I have ever lived. \n\nA few things that probably helped: \n-I worked with other people from my home country so I didn't have the social/cultural aspects of a Japanese work place\n-Being a good guest in someone else's home country is VERY important to me as is being a representative of my own country so I put in a lot of effort to educate myself and assimilate wherever possible\n-I keep an open mind and I'm willing to try new things\n\nI'm super jealous. Do you know where in Japan you will be going?
1	Tokyo is awesome. Love Tokyo. 
1	I’ve been living in Japan for 5 years. I’d say the entj stereotype being industrious fits well in the Japanese workplace. Bluntness is a no-no here though, which can be a struggle to deal with. Huge emphasis on politeness but an ever-present implicit hierarchy in language. If you can adapt to these things just fine you’ll do well.
1	I live in Japan now. Going on my third year and for the most part, I enjoy living here. \n\nThe culture meshes with my personality in that there's not a lot of room for emotional thinking. I don't have to listen to people's emotional appeals to do X or Y which (in my opinion) have nothing to do with the topic at hand. \n\nOn that same note, there is a LOT of red tape here. It's so inefficient and it drives me crazy. Prepare to get permission to have a meeting about when to set a good time to have a meeting. \n\nIf you want to do anything, you need your coworker's approval, your boss's approval, and at least your boss's boss's approval before anything gets implemented. \n\nI work in a very traditional field so there might be other industries that are less...ridiculous but this is the norm from what I know. 
11	When ENTJ’s realize they have a soul..	
1	Anybody have experiences dating a male INFJ?	Hi, female ENTJ here. New to the thread. Dated a male INFJ for the first time. \n\nWhat has been your experience? Issues you've had with INFJs?\n\n\*\*\*\*\*\n\nI posted this to the INFJ subreddit but wanted to get fellow ENTJ thoughts:\n\nHi all\-\- would love your thoughts on an INFJ ex. I  dated a male INFJ\-\- two months. He's wonderful, sensitive, thoughtful, creative and observant. He is open and genuine with his feelings, and we developed feelings for each other VERY quickly. As a female ENTJ, I'm pretty decisive when it comes to liking someone or not\-\- I usually figure this out after the second date, and if I don't see potential I'm done. But once I invest in someone, I'm 1000&#37; in heart and soul, and it may take some time before i am comfortable fully opening up to someone \(the same is true for INFJs\). Two weeks ago was turning point for us. We developed feelings really quickly for each other. He finally opened up about a painful and difficult divorce and how it took him a long time to recover and put himself back together. I also felt comfortable enough to talk about my past relationships and to be vulnerable with him \(which was DIFFICULT for me, I hate being vulnerable\). Things went extremely well for a few days after, I felt we reached a great level of intimacy and trust. But he suddenly and noticeably pulled back days later. He felt  vulnerable after telling me about his divorce and his fears, even though I've been supportive. He caught me off guard and said he had intense feelings for me but worried about our future and where we might end up geographically and he doesn't want to choose between career and me. This seemed alarmingly unnecessary\-\- he was talking about a future hypothetical that doesn't exist yet and that wouldn't affect us for another year and a half if it did come true true \(I should note we're in our 30s\-\- he's applying for full time teaching positions at colleges this fall\). If he is honest about his feelings for me, I think this is all a logistical concern and he's spiraling. He went into full turtling mode for a few days. I sent him positive, reassuring messages. As an external processor, I am finding this all very difficult and confusing because his concerned seemed illogical to me. \n\nWe finally had a chance to meet in person this past weekend... He decided to break up. The traumatic divorce and his uncertainty with where he will be geographically gave him immense anxiety. I gave him every ounce of positive support that I could, and I promised to move for him and to be a teammate and partner in big decisions \(I have never made these promises before with anyone but meant them with him\), but I couldn't talk him back from the ledge. After a week of solitary thinking, he didn't want to me to move for him, even after I told him he wouldn't have to and I wanted to give that to him. He emphasized how he felt about me and felt guilty and stressed about requiring a "gesture" from me so he's choosing to be single for the next year until he's figured out his next job. He wanted to end it earlier than down the road to prevent \(potential\) heartbreak.\n\nSo... After three hours of a very emotional and loving \(and teary\- for both of us\) conversation, he said goodbye. I have to say, he's turned this stoic ENTJ into a puddly mess. I'm giving him space and I respect his decision but... I'm not sure how easy it is to coax an INFJ from a decision once it's made. We left each other with a lot of love for each other. Is he open to coming back once he's had time to process \(and go to therapy, which he's been doing\)? I know as an ENTJ, I can be pretty decisive and final if something's not right, wasn't sure if INFJ was the same, especially since it wasn't about me? Given time apart, can I continue to show him love and support or is this really over? I'm an external processor, so I have a hard time understanding this process of ghosting or disappearing for a week to think. I've never had someone break up with me because they liked me too much!\n\nMy \-NFJ friends said it's a difference in values. If he's still dealing with baggage, he sees it as I'm fragile from my last relationship, being single for a while is safe and secure and better than risking \*potential\* heartbreak in a year even if the short term makes me really happy. I see it as... i am really happy now, so I choose to make it work, and we will fix any obstacle that comes in our way \(because we can, and people move for each other all the time\), and I will give him these assurances. INFJs don't mind being alone. I hate it as an ENTJ. 
4	> he's choosing to be single for the next year until he's figured out his next job\n\nINFJs hate surprises and uncertainty. He may be too stressed and worried about his career right now, uncertain about his future, and knows he can't give the relationship the full attention it deserves.\n\nINFJs will procrastinate until they're sure they can finish what they started. He won't expect you to wait for him but he seems to care about you very much, so if you're available once things are stabilized he'd probably like to get back together.\n\nHe may hesitate to make the first move at that point though, ashamed of putting you on hold like that. Keep in touch, and once you hear he's found a job, ask him out! :)\n\n> I'm an external processor, so I have a hard time understanding this process of ghosting or disappearing for a week to think.\n\nNi and Ti are both slow internal processes, especially with Ti in the lower part of the stack. Maybe similar to how xNTJs process their emotions?\n\n> I know as an ENTJ, I can be pretty decisive and final if something's not right, wasn't sure if INFJ was the same\n\nYup, INFJs take a long time to make decisions but don't easily change their minds once a decision is reached, unless there's new information or the situation changes of course.\n\n> I'm mostly curious about male INFJs and how they make decisions. They're extremely rare, so I just don't have as much experience with male INFJs, and they seem pretty different from their female counterparts. Was curious if anyone had insights into how they think and deal with relationship stress. I also noticed INFJs tend to be loners and are pretty comfortable being alone, so I can't tell if that's INFJ or male INFJ...\n\nYes, INFJs are introverts, males perhaps even more obviously so. At the same time, high quality companions are hard to find and we value them greatly.\n\nMen tend towards IxTx, Women towards ExFx. So male INFJs would be more introverted, analytical, and stoic, whereas female INFJs would be more sociable, agreeable, and expressive. Male INFJs also tend to be more confident and emotionally stable. Finally, male INFJs usually hang out with NTs, whereas female INFJs are more likely to hang out with other NFs, due to gendered differences in the distribution of types.\n\nI often see people mistake INFJs for ExTJs, since a determined INFJ is superficially similar to an ENTJ on best behavior.\n\nMost MBTI celebrity lists are awful. I'd be happy to list some male INFJ examples if you want. :)\n\nINFJs share characteristics with INTJs, ENFJs, ISFJs, and ISTPs. Strategic and analytical like INTJs, diplomatic and accommodating like other FJs, good at diagnostics and putting their feelings aside to tackle hard decisions coldly and objectively like ISTPs. Not as efficient at debating, logistics / operations, or asserting their own needs as INTJs. I'm assuming you're already familiar with N/S differences.\n\nUsually conclusions are reached with Ni then rationalized using slow/weak Ti, or rough plans are made with Ni then gradually refined and debugged using slow/weak Ti. Hence the apparent "resistance" to explaining their reasoning.\n\nI'll use INTJs as a reference point to discuss INFJs' cognitive functions, since I'm close to an INTJ and they're somewhat similar to ENTJs like yourself.\n\nINFJs are very analytical, but Te-PoLR means INFJs have difficulty expressing their reasoning, similar to how INTJs have difficulty expressing their feelings even though they have them.\n\nNi means INFJs usually perceive how everything fits in the big picture, and how things will turn out. This requires data, is not instantaneous, nor infallible. Usually an INFJ's best insights will happen later when they're alone and undisturbed. INFJs hate being the center of attention, and hate making mistakes, so they're usually reserved - yet they can be surprisingly bold and determined when necessary, especially when Ni foresight and Fe social responsibility intersect. (every INFJ has had a few "You shall not pass!" Gandalf moments)\n\nFe means they're mindful of how their decisions will affect other people, which means they often sugarcoat things, go along to get along, and often sacrifice their own comfort to accommodate others (even when it's not necessary, as you may have noticed). It doesn't mean they let other people make their decisions for them, however. FJs are often self-righteous and sanctimonious, including thinking they know what's best for others even when they sometimes don't.\n\nTi provides critical thought, but being in tertiary means it takes more time - like an INTJ processing their feelings. They're also not efficient at constructing logical structures/arguments, unlike types with Ti higher in the stack. In normal operation this is fine, since Ni spatial reasoning produces conclusions as accurate as other functions, but tertiary Ti is inadequate for quickly articulating those conclusions into verbal sequential arguments which may seem to Sensors and Thinkers like INFJs are "skipping steps" or just "making stuff up". (it took me about 10 minutes to write this, and I'm still not totally happy with it)\n\nInferior Se means INFJs are slow to react, hate surprises, and generally dislike team sports. However they enjoy Se activities they can do at their own pace, such as travel/exploring, martial arts, and outdoors activities like hiking, climbing, camping, etc.\n\nINFJs are weird.\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions. :)\n
5	My experience with INFJs is that they come on very strong, but they are not monogamous nor commitment types - they need lots of love from many different people. 
3	[deleted]
1	Yes. Will DM you. 
1	god, how can you be inlove with something so broken?  \n1 you always have to be autonomous .. its irrelevant wht they do, you do your own thing.  it seemes like you came with demands and expectations.  \n2 NFs are very predictable that way, if their intuition goes haywire , theres nothing else to do but wait it out. the more u push the easier it is for them to back off.  (as i said, why the hell would u pursue such a creature)  \ni suggest training yourself in neuroscience, him aswell
1	Do you really think another male INFJ is going to have enough in similar with your dude that advice from someone else will have any crossover?
1	Non-Te Users	What do you notice is the biggest difference between Te-Dom's/Aux's, compared to the rest of the types?\n\nWhat often frustrates you in this difference? What are non-Te users blind to, at least occasionally? How does it manifest? Are they able to see this when you tell them? How do they react?\n\nMy friend has an ESTJ brother who, on the one hand can be extremely domineering (edit*) and controlling, but on the other hand always ends up having the exact advice she needed to follow, without which she is enduring unwanted consequences.\n\nIdk, the emotional part of communicating ideas and recommendations in Te-users, especially Dom's, is something that would make them a lot more effective (imo) (just as much as non-Te users may need to think about how they sort through and prioritize things).
4	They're weirdos B)
5	The Te types are more about crushing the opposing side. Whenever I get blasted by some hyper aggressive guy on a MBTI sub they always have a flair that has a XXTJ type.
0	help me type a friend.?	help me type a friend ill describe him to you. his very basic and definitly an introverted.he doesnt like to follow any trends but prefers to be himself.his very artistic and imaginitive,and enjoys making jokes all the time.hes good at painting,drawing,music ect.his very average and he also wears simple cloths,in terms of behavour.very childish,
9	Does he know where the space bar is, by any chance?
5	You say he is definitly an introverted, but also that you are his friend. Introverted does not have friend. This cannot be. 
1	sounds like an infp. im not 100% certain though. 
0	A very creative child. 
1	What r your favourite TV shows?	
3	* House of Cards\n* Mr Robot\n* Game of Thrones\n* Mad Men\n* Californication\n* Billions\n* Breaking Bad\n* Rick and Morty\n\nOthers I've enjoyed are\n\n* Peaky Blinders\n* Prison Break\n* Sherlock\n* Gotham\n* Marco Polo
3	Not a lot, but I very much enjoyed FlashFoward, Lost, Bojack Horsman, & found House of Cards very interesting.
3	Mad Men, The Sopranos, Archer, South Park 
2	Alias\n\nThe Blacklist\n\nPsych\n\nCriminal Minds\n\nLucifer\n\nSherlock (BBC)\n\nGame of Thrones\n\nAmerican Dad\n\nBob's Burgers\n\nSuits - maybe. I'm not a fan of Meghan Markle. She brings the show down for me. I used to only watch it for Harvey/Louis/Jessica before I gave up mid-season 3.\n\n(If anyone has recommendations, I'm all ears!)
2	well, the tv shows i like are quite varied. it goes from comedies like HIMYM to detective shows like Elementary to Westworld and silly shows like Lucifer.i can say i used to like Blacklist, i liked Person of interest, the following,dexter,black sails, supernatural and many more.i have a lot of free time traveling between University and home and work,and having a book for some freaking reasons make strangers want to talk to me,which i find it annoying and well,a waste of time,putting headphone on and watching shows solves that. i watch pretty much everything, but i've gotten into animes, idk, the simplicity and the sense of humor appeals to me. 
1	None.
1	I love Suits 
15	Get up, work to achieve small goal, do research, go back to achieving small goal or go on to the next small goal, do more research, eventually get tired & go to sleep. Next day...	Get up, work to achieve small goal, do research, go back to achieving small goal or go on to the next small goal, do more research, eventually get tired & go to sleep. Next day... \n\nRepeat over and over, achieving small goals every day, that are slowly progressing towards finishing larger & larger ones. If I didn't have to sleep, I would probably not stop other than for short breaks.\n\n(This is all I'm doing right now, I feel like looking from the outside in, I might seem obsessed or insane, or both! In either case, keep working towards your goals, sometimes I take a break and this subreddit is a nice one to spend a few minutes in.)
17	Allegory time. A man goes to cut down a bunch of trees. He saws and saws. He reaches a point where he feels like he’s working extra hard and accomplishing less. His saw has become dull. He feels that if he stops to sharpen the blade, he’s not “working” or “being effective”, but if he takes time to rest and sharpen the blade, he’ll be even more effective and efficient when he goes back to cutting. \n\nTake some time for fun and personal development. It’s just as important as actually working.
1	When do you schedule 15 minutes of fun into your busy week? Which day / time window is best? Do you schedule fun in Outlook, Trello or Google Calendar?\n
20	Did you become an ENTJ from survival/coping needs?	It's something I noticed in a couple of ENTJs as well as myself. I have dealt with a vast history of abuse, and I'm still dealing with bad emotional abuse at home. The ENTJ traits are things I have forced myself to develop to cope with it all.\n\nI didn't actually realise I was an ENTJ until a year ago. I started having the biggest personality crisis realising that I am in fact an extrovert because since I was 16 I was convinced I was an INxJ. I had the intense fragility of an INFJ, but lacked the strong Fe. Eventually I realised that I am a huge extrovert, it just got covered in introversion because I never had friends, a social life or anything to expose the extroversion until I started working in retail.\n\nIn the last couple of years where I started standing up for myself, becoming more vocal, generally becoming more resilient, and that made me go full ENTJ. I realised these changes are what I have to make to survive with my borderline personality/PTSD. I still have the intense fragility because of the BPD and PTSD, but that feeds the ENTJ traits.\n\nWe're stereotypically tough with non-existent emotions, but I think those of us who have experienced abuse are probably some of the most vulnerable out of all the personality types. We just hide it well.
10	You might be on to something.\n\nFor me, it was a series of events over several years, leading up to my father passing away.  Each time, it was my emotional state that caused confusion and each time, it was rational thought that led me through it.  I think that just like yourself, it was a function of positive reinforcement.  \n\nFor the last few years, I was an excellent problem solver but not much else.  Be wary about letting your MBTI type define you :)
8	I think you may be in the right track about ENTJ evolving out of abuse for some individuals... but I just wanted to check in with you regarding your comment about being borderline.... are you staying that you have borderline personality disorder? If so, was this formally diagnosed? \n\nI’ve never heard of anyone openly stating this about oneself. Most BPDs, from what I’ve been told, are not aware of their diagnosis- even if they are in therapy for it...
8	Your story is very similar to mine- I've gone through significant trauma that makes me feel very vulnerable at times. However, I believe that having an ENTJ personality has helped me get as far as I have. It's funny how emotional abuse skews your worldview, but I have always reacted to it in an ENTJ way (Te-Ni-Se-Fi). The reason I act very differently from a lot of other ENTJs is because they grew up with a different set of facts (they were allowed to stand up to an authority figure without being punished, etc), making it possible for them to display their strengths differently. I spent all my intelligence on trying to escape an abusive household, rather than dominate others. Still a big work in progress, but I'm optimistic that I'll eventually have a "normal" life.
4	Everyone here has already contributed a lot to the discussion so I'm not going to jump in on that. Just wanted to say thanks to OP because I've never realized it before but this is also true for me.
3	Well, didn't experience any crisis. I am just an asshole
3	I think you may be on to something here.
2	I'm not going into detail about the abuse, you wouldn't be interested in my stupid feelings anyway, but my life was pretty bad from 8 to 13.\n\nBut you may have a point. I'm currently in university but comparing myself to my highschool period, I've become a lot more disciplined and social (in the good way, before I just had bad friends). My life really improved here because I'm finally able to do something that is meaningful to me.\n\nAny suggestions on how you improved more in the workplace?
2	I think it's very interesting that many of us ENTJs are identifying with this.\n\nFor myself, up to the age of 16/17 I identified strongly as INTJ. I won't go into details but having gone through a number of events which forced me to have to provide for myself financially and for my family, I felt compelled to act on my ENTJ traits (Extroversion, Aggressiveness, Social Tact) in order to survive.
2	i don't know about that. honestly, this is the way i was when i was a little kid, but abuse and ptsd messed me up so much for a long time that i forgot how strong i was. i'm still fighting an uphill battle, but now i know i'm more resilient than anyone trying to push me down.\n\n\ni did think i was an introvert for quite a long time, but i realize now that was depression talking. i was always hanging out with someone- in school, outside of school, extracurriculars. i remember having to schedule lunch with people in middle school because so many people wanted me to sit with them. but i was too depressed to really see i had friends or how much i liked being around other people, so i just assumed i was introverted. turns out i was *very* wrong.\n\n\ni remember as a little kid always being very mouthy, though. always talked back, always refused to back down, always standing up for myself or someone else. and even as i got older and stopped seeing that about myself, i did the same things. i actually thought i was an enfp for ages because my coping mechanism was just blinding happiness. no one will ask you if you're okay if you always act completely happy, right? i'm not sure your type changes, but it's possible you were different when you were very young and lost sight of that through all the trauma. all i can say is i hope you and everyone else here (including myself) can overcome whatever bullshit the world has thrown at us.
2	Mine wasn’t a result of trauma, but I typed as INTJ when I was younger. I think nurture played a HUGE role in that; the introversion was largely a lack of self confidence rather than my utilization of cognitive functions.\n\nOne day, in true ENTJ fashion, I just decided to be different. Just like that; flipped a switch. I had been masking Te for a long time as a coping mechanism borne of low self esteem/shyness. I just forced myself to get over it. \n\nI think most personality things are hardwired, but nurture dictates which traits rise to the top and which are suppressed. That was certainly the case for me, and I am 100% all the way ENTJ.

5	Yeah... still dealing with shitty parents. God, independence must be amazing. (Am 16, not allowed to do anything like drive or shit like that)\n\n\nVerbal/emotional abuse from step mother, used to get physically beat by my mother, yeah... you might be on to something. I force emotion away because it interferes with the clear thought necessary for survival. 
2	I think its the other way around stressed entjs have a very difficult time becoming self actualized. People don't generally a accept entj in this world, especially as women. I think you had delayed maturity.  Otherwise you would have typed correctly the first time. I had to have an older intj teach me how to judge appropriately.
2	Always tested as ENTP until about a year ago i wanted to be more decisive in my life and leave behind all the trauma. Now I test as an ENTJ, and my life is amazing. 
1	I believe that personality types are a broad framework that you are drawn towards at birth, but develop and shape in different ways based on environment and circumstance.  As a result of growing up with verbally abusive and immature parents, I developed the really cutthroat aspects of the ENTJ from a young age probably as a coping mechanism to survive (figuratively).  But since I turned to music as an escape from my environment as a child, I became very in tune with my emotions.  To this day I consistently get goosebumps from music (studies show that this means you are more in tune with emotions than the average person), and I don't have the stereotypical alien response to experiencing emotions that are abnormal to an ENTJ.  Your MBTI results are not an end all be all.  It's an accurate way of describing your baseline thought process, but it's not a one size fit all thing.

1	I tested as an ENFJ when I was younger but I think that being a hormonal 12 year old girl affected the results. I began to choose my career path, etc. with the results of the personality test saying I was an ENFJ. I think being an ENTJ has helped me to cope with trauma and made me more interested in psychology in general. I might not follow this subreddit otherwise.
1	I really don't think that is accurate, but I've been wrong before.\n\nI think it is just part of your natural desire to analyze everything and then arrive at a logical conclusion. \n\nI would venture to say you were already an ENTJ and had you not been you would've dealt with your issues in a different way.\n\nThe same logic would be applied to falling madly in love as an ENTJ and then evolving into an ENFJ, which I still don't see the logic behind. \n\nI think I could've grown up in the most lovey-dovey family in the world with tons of hugs and emotions and been confused the whole time, it would not have converted me to ENFJ.

8	ENTJ's which personality types did you have the best relationships with?	I'm trying to gauge what personalty metrics really stand out for fellow ENTJ's that led to lasting relationships. \n\nIs there a similar trend? Do we fall for more NJ's? Or are the elusive INFP's our gold standard for a meaningful relationship? What about ESFJ's or ENFPs? \n
10	ENFPs and other NTs for me. I tend to steamroll (unintentionally) INFPs and other I-F types. I try my best to keep in mind the feelings of others but I do need someone who can stand up to me (or not be crushed by me) when get in a logical rut and fail to do so.
5	INTJ and INTP\n\nI have enjoyed the openness of ENFJs, but I've known 4 very well and I don't like any of their personalities. I've stopped speaking to two because they were just so toxic. I'm sure I wouldn't speak to another one if I had the choice. The last one is a friend of a friend but I have issues with her and I'm *glad* we rarely see each other. The weird thing is when I have to get along with them, we get on like a house on fire. It's incredible. But they're so toxic.
3	Wellllll my most peaceful relationships were with -STPs but my favorite relationships were with INTJs (they were more passionate and connected but a lot more volatile) 
4	INFP for sure, I know she’s the one! 
3	infp was my strongest relationship. my best friend of like 8 years is an intp and i think my best friend when i was younger is an intp as well. i'm not sure about my other bestie. they said "i don't like being described by four letters" or something like that when i asked. i'm pretty sure they're an ixfx of some kind. 
3	Marrying an ENTP in July (: The books say we should be struggling, but I think we're perfect. 
3	I'll just be here waiting for someone to say that INFJ is one of the personality types that they had the best relationship with. XD
3	80% of my social circle are INxx.
3	INTJ

2	Best were, in descending order: INFP, ENFP, ESFP, ESTP\n\n\n
2	ENFx's are great.\nI have one great friend, ISFP, but it's good only as long as i am cool. 
2	Girlfriend of 5 years is an ENFP. My closest group of friends are INTPs, INFPs and one INFJ. There's an innate sense of curiosity and wonder in their conversation that makes them deeply refreshing to spend time with.

1	Whoa .... what a read....
1	INTJ, followed by ENTP then INTP. Nothing really sticks from outside the NT group. I don't run into a lot of ENTJ but I do like them.  I am Enneagram 6, too, so that might make a difference, I expect Enneagram 2 would desire more malleable partnerships.
1	INTPs and ISTPs work the best for me. My wife is a INTP.\n\nStay clear of Fs if your are a TJ. \n\nMy best friends are ISTJs\n\nF's seem to have a problem with logical reasoning so don't debate them, they'll get butthurt easily.
1	The two friends I've known the longest and am the closest with are INTP and ISTJ. I generally get along with most other T types, because we can talk about complex ideas such as politics, although I can be friends with any type, as long as they're ok with me being brutally honest.
1	My two closest friends are INTJ and ENTP, we get along perfectly.

11	Do you guys always feel being misunderstood or needing to explain yourself to people.	People just don’t understand me. Now I feel unique and more above to people. More superior and stuff. \n\nI tend to say abstract sentences making my jokes or comebacks a little more analysis and more process. \n\nPeople who are called “average” I think are more below than me and I feel always smarter and more unique than other people. \n\nDo any of you relate?
16	[deleted]
11	Learn your skills.  What do you think makes you smarter or superior to others?\n\nI get the others not getting your sense of humor, and you've probably thought or been told that you overthink your jokes.  That has little to do with how smart someone is, and quite a lot to do with their thought process and sense of humor.\n\nIf you think you're better than everyone else you will burn yourself out.  Acknowledge your strengths, capitalize on them, but someone will be better than you at something else. \n\nWhen I was around 15 I had this idea that I was all that and a bag of chips, mostly because I seemed to be the only one who put time into things, or did them the way I thought should be done.  If you let that idea linger too long, you'll end up burning yourself out because no one will want to do anything with you.
10	Knowing that you’re unique and different is one thing, thinking that you’re above others is very different.  \n\nOne leads to a deeper understanding of yourself and the world around you.  The other leads to a superiority complex, unhealthy relationships, and an unbalanced perspective.  I would suggest you be mindful of this.
13	What you're describing there is textbook teenage narcissism (which I can unfortunately relate to). I hope you're a teenager, otherwise that attitude is alarming.
5	"People just don’t understand me. Now I feel unique and more above to people. More superior and stuff."\n\n"Do any of you relate?"\n\nWhen i was 12\n\nYou will learn. INFERIOR Fi. \n\nBut generally, yes, you will be more comfortable with INTJ or ENTP. A well developed SF will learn to respect you, as long as you give them an "in" ie always be stylish and don't try to look too weird like Steve Jobs and his stupid turtlenecks. (They are in now but not all of us can afford to inflict our all black efficiency wardrobe on the rest of humanity for 50 years)\n\nI hear NFJ.exe is also good fun. 
6	it's very immature and self alienating to act like you're above everyone and it's also super boring. life is more fun when you start to find the joy in other people, even if they seem "average". you're probably not as unique as you think. other people are also probably more unique than you think.\n\n\ni used to think more like that, but after i stopped trying so hard i started having a lot more fun.
3	Honestly man. I’m 30 now. I’ve been into this introspection stuff for a while. I have worked on self improvement a lot this past year and I think now my greatest strength is being able to interact and make everyone - that has a sense of humor - laugh. Being relatable and making everyone comfortable. So if you’re having to explain yourself or are constantly getting misunderstood. Work on it. We all have the potential do be charming as fuck. I’ve legit mastered it. Online I do well. Like dating apps. But in person I blow my online persona out of the park. You don’t have to go all out in your replies to people. I sometimes keep it simple that I come off as aloof but then I catch them off guard when I actually know my shit. I like surprising people like that. It impresses them much more than being a show off or coming off as elitist. 
1	Succes requires some form of self-admiring
1	It's cool that you know your worth. Although, what's the point being superior and unique when noone knows it besides oneself? \nYou seem alone and bitter. Noone know about how awesome you are. In the past i could relate.\n\nNow it's different. I work hard on emotional inteligence, empathy, public speaking, writing clearly and interesting. I love to learn, so someday i can teach the crowds and unique talanted invidiuals. 
1	I always felt like it was sometimes hard to click with other people because most people lack the depth and intellect, or aren’t as inquisitive as I am. So naturally, conversation preferences are different, or others would not understand my intensity or abstractions.
1	Not at all. But I've worked in customer service for years where most of my customers were of ethnic minorities who could just about speak English, and I've also been nannying my niece and nephew since they were both born (they're 2 and 5 years old) so I gained excellent communication skills from both of those things. Speaking to a toddler and an adult who only knows basic English is exactly the same thing haha.\n\nAlso, I have an excellent grasp on how to explain things to certain personalities. People reading goes a long way here. E.g. Some personalities are very interested in hearing the backstory, the explanations, and would hate to hear the basic explanation. Others would rather have just one sentence explanations, and that's more than enough.
1	My problem is, I know how crazy I really am, does that mean I'm actually as sane as the rest of us, or does a realization of that, mean I'm even crazier? 
1	YES! It's like there are so many people who have never thought about anything that doesn't directly effect their lives, and don't care about complex topics such as politics, philosophy, science, etc.
17	Tired of coming across as rude and insensitive	I am completely dumbfounded by coming across as a rude, insensitive, or cynical person. \n\nDeep down, I’m not that way and I’m just sharing my opinion of what I think is true. People seem to have a strong bias for being liked and following the norm than moving forward or being right. \n\nAccepting this is the hard part. People seem to want to crush a person immediately, when they speak up with an unpopular opinion. \n\nI’m just tired  
21	As much as I love and value brutal honesty  I have learned that being diplomatic is a useful skill. Its a lot easier to get people to confront things they don't want to by easing them into it than smashing them in the face with it.
7	::brutal entj hugs::\n\nI solved this problem by only hanging out with ENTJ's INTJ's and ENTP's works fine...\n\nUntil I have to deal with any of the other personality types.\n\nSeriously though, the best solution, and the most commonly suggested is just get a trusty XNFX type friend. They are supposed to be able to advise us when we are being stupid. \n\nThis is our challenge. Other types have to deal with other challenges. Face it head on like a true ENTJ and figure out the solution - bolstering your weak Fi! The problem is you are being too authentic in situations where it's more socially acceptable to basically lie - the NF types call this "social harmony"\n\nInferior: Introverted feeling (Fi)\nFi filters information based on interpretations of worth, forming judgments according to criteria that are often intangible. Fi constantly balances an internal set of values such as harmony and authenticity. Attuned to subtle distinctions, Fi innately senses what is true and what is false in a situation.[19]\n\n"Fi is the ENTJs' weakest function, but it does mature over time. ENTJs have difficulty applying subjective and emotional thoughts to their decision-making, since they believe Feeling obstructs decisiveness and impartiality. While this is applicable to objective criteria, ENTJs must learn to recognize the great importance of Feeling in relationships and personal contact, since it creates the close bonds vital to human beings. At worst, a failure to engage the Feeling function can make ENTJs appear overbearing, insensitive, and abrasive. Further, it can result in an underdeveloped system of morality and values, which can disengage ENTJs from the personal world of self-fulfillment."\n\n- Wikipedia
4	Practice gratefulness and try to do good things/charity. In the end we are all alone, so why not help each other suffer less? Maybe someone will help you. 
3	There’s an interesting dynamic of EQ vs IQ in those situations.  I’ve been trying to solve the same dynamic for myself for the last year or so.  Literally just wrote about it yesterday.  \n\nI think we’re living in an emotionally charged society right now where compassion is being valued more than intelligence.  They’re not supposed to be mutually exclusive, but they don’t seem to be understood that way.  \n\nI can’t think that this has something to do with the safe space and thought bubble dynamics.  More than ever, people have been given the opportunity to surround themselves with things that make them feel good, and reinforce their view of the world.  By sharing a hard truth, you’re making them face a shared reality, and when it challenges their reality, they don’t feel good.  \n\nIf you’re dealing with an ENTJ or similar, we tend to adjust our view of the world to accommodate for new information.  Many others will try to adjust the information to accommodate for an existing view of the world.  If we point that out to them, were labelled as assholes.  I’m done accepting that criticism.  I’m nice, I do it with a smile, a calm demeanour and from a good place.  Those who resist that level of engagement have a much bigger problem to worry about than I do so I try to end up at a place of compassion.

4	Coming across as rude is equal parts what you say and how people interpret it, and since you can't control how people interpret it, you have to control what you say. Obviously this doesn't mean you shouldn't speak your mind, but just be conscious of what you're saying. It sounds like you already recognize you often come off as rude, but that doesn't mean you have to always be that way. Maybe just work on your word choice?
2	Is it really a big deal?\n\nFor as long as you are competent, people will tolerate you at work. That will give you a chance to save a bit of fuck you $. Meanwhile you can look for people that you are compatible outside of work. Also plan your next job / career move where you will actually like most of your colleagues.\n\n> I'm just tired\n\nWell, work less and go running and swimming and lifting and stuff.\n
2	My personality is severely disordered and I don't know how to heal it.	I discovered the root cause of my mental illness through basically becoming an expert in psychiatry.

2	I'm not sure you can self-diagnose this, why don't you get a professional evaluation? Also they'd be the one to tell you how to "fix" it. Though you can choose between a kind of talk-therapy, to actually discuss it and why you feel you have all of these diagnoses, or CBT or medicine or a combination of those.
1	Visit behavioral psychoterapist. 
1	It's impossible to suggest therapies online  especially since many of us aren't qualified. Take the common advice in this post - go seek out some therapy so that someone can guide you towards the right treatment. \n\nWhat I do see is you might be highlighting issues that pertain to social situations. This might be just a delayed development of social confidence. You might be questioning your actions in your head more than enjoying yourself in the company of others. \n\n**I have dependent personality disorder.**\n\nThe dependency might be from not having freedom to be your own person, usually as a result of narcissistic parents. Or not having personal confidence in being Independent. There's nothing wrong with being dependent, we're all human after all and can't possible accomplish everything ourselves. But you might need to identify what aspects of dependency you dislike that you exhibit in your behavior. It might not be a problem. Or you might be too self critical to let it go. \n\nOne thing that could help is journaling out your thoughts and qualms about not liking being dependent. What aspects worry you? Why is it a worry? Do others raise a common issue that you're aware of? May be take that as an internal fact check to adjust your behavior. \n\n**I am incapable of sincere laughter.**\n\nDo you laugh out of nervousness or to make the other person feel better? I can't recommend much other than just increasing your social interactions to become more comfortable being yourself socially. If you're shy and introverted, limit it to less people, potentially one on one sessions. Try online communication if going face to face is hard. If in groups, find a trusted group of friends that won't judge you but want the best for you. This won't always be family members, so find someone you are absolutely comfortable with. \n\n\n\n

12	How to Support Depressed ENTJ?	Hello,\n\nI'm wondering if you guys have some thoughts on how to help someone who is depressed. I don't think the MBTI type matters so much but perhaps you have a different perspective than others might that's more tailored to this person's depression. \n\nI've had many depressed friends and I think I handled it all wrong. I've been trying to give advice when I think they might have needed to have their feelings validated. Have any of you been depressed and what were the qualities of someone who you genuinely thought helped or is helping you through it? Thank you.
34	ENTJs get depressed because there's too much to do and they run out of energy to do it all. If you want to support a depressed ENTJ, run errands with them (even if it's just going to the grocery store with them, going with them to the mechanic, etc). The act of accomplishing whatever they're procrastinating on can give them energy and help them get the ball rolling on other productive activities that need to be done. Plus, they'll love you for paying special attention to their real needs.
11	For most ENTJs, validating feelings is the last thing they want.  From personal experience, it’s usually relating to a problem that they’re not able to solve.  If it’s a low priority problem or a short term one, it shows up as frustration.  The bigger the goal and the more important it is to that individual, the closer frustration gets to depression.\n\nThey’ll be happiest when making real progress on that effort.  And if they can’t, as was my case, sometimes new goals is what’s needed.  \n\nHow you would fit into that would depend on all the other details involved.  I have a private blog where I’ve written a bit on this dynamic, it’s available if helpful.
4	For me, I always need to feel like I'm moving forward. When I'm feeling down, one thing that always improves my mood is coming up with plans of action (career goals, fitness goals, financial goals, etc.) because the plan gives me hope. Talking through ideas and possibilities with someone is something that I LOVE to do because it inspires me and gives me hope for the future.\n\nWhat I absolutely hate is when someone dissuades me from thinking/talking about a problem in order to get my mind off of whatever is getting me down. I need to lean into the issue or else I feel like I've given up and am a failure. The key for me is that I always need to feel like I'm moving forward and not wallowing in pity.
2	Sometimes, ENTJ's get depressed because of a chemical imbalance, too. Might not be the problem but I always like to advocate for the medical side of things as very few people seem to be okay with therapy and medication, and I think it saves lives, quite frankly. \n\nJust "being okay" with medicine that treats depression can let your friend let go of any social stigma attached to it. Way too many people I know committed suicide because of depression that could easily be wiped away with a pill.

3	A lost kid looking for help.	I'm a sophomore in college studying mechanical engineering and ever since coming to college, I've lost all my motivation and drive. I can't even study because I don't know why I need a gpa. My confidence in my ability to succeed has become detrimental. Can you guys please help me? I think these three problems are causing my decline.\n\nI've lost sight of a long term goal. I use to want to get into a top ranked school but after accomplishing that, everything looks pretty blank. I know I want to own my own business but don't know how to accomplish that from my current position. From what I see, most people in my position will be stuck at a mid to high level management job with good pay and be completely satisfied. I do not want to end up like that.\n\nThe other thing that I've struggled with is how our existence is worthless. I've realized that we are just a spec in the universe and a lot of what we do is futile. Problems such as the great filter, faster than light universal expansion, and a cold death threaten to erase everything we do. Unless I pull off a miracle, I will be completely forgotten in a thousand years. There are 90 billion people beneath our feet and how many do we remember. It frustrates me greatly that people don't see this and worry about the stupid little problems that surround them.\n\nLastly, why the fuck should I use my intelligence to help these dumbfuck humans. I see a helpless cause. Everywhere I look, I see incompetence and stupidity, it makes me feel angry and sad to see how some things are run. Maybe I should let them rot in their problems and suffer for the stupid decisions they have made, it's natural selection. If they make a bad decision, then they should pay the price. Why should I take my precious time spent alive addressing their mistakes. If they fucked up, then they should feel the consequences and learn from their mistakes. I've even made a plan to get a degree in bio engineering to access viruses and treat them with antibiotics to create an super antibiotic virus to wipe humanity. \n\nIf anyone of you guys have experienced similar thoughts, can you please guide me through? \n\nLastly, it's been great finding this sub. Reading through the sub, I feel like I have found a group that I can relate to.\n\nHave a good day :)

6	You are realizing a lot of things about the world in a short period of time. I remember being a sophomore in college, and my thinking was not too much different than yours. A few pieces of advice....\n\nIn the short term, you need a short-term goal. That means focusing on your studies. It's not about your GPA -- it's about honing who you are as a person and developing your mind. College is not about getting a piece of paper that says you're smart after four years, it's about making yourself into the person you want to be at a time when all the tools you need to do so are at your disposal. You're paying a lot of money to be there, so you'd better take advantage of it. Study to learn and to shape yourself -- not for the grade.\n\nAs for a long-term goal, that is something you must decide. What are your priorities? Family? Money? Travel? Art / creative pursuits? Working with people? Think long and hard about what makes you happiest, and consider pursuing that. Like many things, this can be a balancing act. Authors still have to eat -- but maybe you minor in English and work on your book on the weekends once you land a good MechE job? Or maybe there is a specific niche or project you love working on in MechE. If you become a specialist in a field, you can take that passion to grad school, and as far into the future as you want. There are millions of permutations to happiness, and it's absolutely within your grasp to achieve your vision of it.\n\nTo your other comments, life is worthless if you say it's worthless. Life is worthwhile if you say it's worthwhile. Who cares if you or I are blips on the cosmic radar? We are all we have, so let's accept that fact. Measure your worth by your own standards. If you're anything like me, your standards are high as fuck -- so you will always have something to strive towards. There is no empirical measure of the impact we make on the world, but this trendy idea that "society at-large" just makes shit happen and there's nothing we can do about it as individuals is bullshit. You have no idea the impact you've had in the lives of people around you. Live your life so that you can shape the world into a more positive version of itself by the time you're gone, so that it would have been worse had you never existed. And if you fail in doing so, you failed gloriously.\n\nFinally, when you say "why the fuck should I use my intelligence to help these dumbfuck humans," you forget that, you too, are a dumbfuck human. Everyone is stupid, and there is no cure. Human error will always be a factor that introduces chaos to the world. That's why we need each other -- to restore a semblance of order, to check each others' work, to correct and educate each other. And sometimes accidents can turn into beautiful discoveries. You never know.

1	It's difficult to learn how to love Man, but it can be done. I suggest starting with Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged. She was an INTJ and INTJ's have an uncanny knack for unlocking ENTJ's hidden potentials. I would try to spend some time around some other NT types, get a different perspective within the rational group. \n\nRealize that not everyone is worth fighting for, but there are many exceptions. Fight for those people. The shining stars drowning in dogshit...\n\nFor now, try to avoid young S types. They're usually the ones that make us crazy.

Every test I took in the past came out positive for ENTJ and since Business school I kept getting ENFJ, thought it was an anomoly.\n\nAfter seeing my psychologist, I tried it again. ENFJ-A. Who am I and have I been living a lie? Can people's personality profile change over time?\n\nMy results are:\n\n**ENFJ-A**\n\n**MIND:** This trait determines how we interact with our environment.\n\n92% EXTRAVERTED, 8% Introverted\n\n**ENERGY**: This trait shows where we direct our mental energy.\n\n60% INTUITIVE, 40% OBSERVANT\n\n**NATURE**: This trait determines how we make decisions and cope with \nemotions.\n\n47% THINKING, 53% FEELING\n\n**TACTICS**: This trait reflects our approach to work, planning and decision-making.\n\n69% JUDGING, 31% PROSPECTING\n\n**IDENTITY**: This trait underpins all others, showing how confident we are in our abilities and decisions.\n\n75% ASSERTIVE, 25% Turbulent\n
6	Since you're on the cusp of T/F, I'd recommend taking a test that lists all 8 the functions, that could give you more clarity. Maybe you just have a lot of Fe. That's not untypical for mature ENTJs, hence the fact that we famously have the highest EQs.\n\nOther than that you could watch videos of ENFJs like Edgar Ramirez (his Larry King NOW interview is a very suitable one) and compare his energy and tone of voice (which is brimming with emotion) to videos of ENTJs like George Carlin, Isaac Isamov or Steve Martin. The difference is really obvious in these cases. NTs always sound a bit deadpan compared to feelers.
6	The important question to ask yourself here, which would likely solve your dilemma, is "how do I use emotion to make decisions, and how much do I prioritize those decisions when I do?" \n\nThere are very strong misconceptions, both on Reddit and online, that if you are a "thinker" type, especially an "extroverted thinker (Te)", you must fit certain stereotypes. This isn't helpful. Mature individuals tend not to have rogue emotional outbursts, and as we age, we learn to read social situations better. We choose words more carefully, don't react with volatility and understand when to engage versus when to walk away. Being an effective communicator means it isn't always about "me", but about how to effectively get a message across. Being an "efficient" thinker and speaker doesn't *always* mean aggressive and brash.\n\nSo if you test out closely for T/F, ask yourself what questions you've answered to make this so, and how balanced you are when expressing yourself. Both Te and Fe are socially-oriented functions, hence why I stress your presentation towards others as determining which one fits you best. \n\nIf you really prefer generalizations, ENTJs prefer to "get to the point" when they speak. It tends to be "speak first, apologize if truly necessary". They want to know "am I doing what's best for me, following what I want?". ENFJs are adept at reading body language, moderating their interactions with others as they go, and sympathizing when the other person feels attacked. They want to know "does what I'm doing actually make sense, and are my reasons for exerting so much of myself to others sound?"
2	16 Personalities assessments seem to differ a bit for ENTJ. They call ENFJ the Executive. I brushed it off as all other MBTI material has placed me as ENTJ. Anyone happen to know about copyright or patent potential for psychological assessments like these? How or if they are protected once created?
2	The tests are not failproof. You need to get into looking at the hierarchy of functions within each of the types and decide yourself what you are. \n\nENFJ and ENTJ are so different, they are like different species!\n\nIt's not hard. While ENFJ's and ENTJ's are both excellent leaders, their style is very different. ENFJ's will rely more on their friends and allies to create a plan of action, while ENTJ's will create the plan themselves. ENFJ's really worry about the happiness of their group, they will put happiness above the smarter action. ENTJ's want social harmony, but they will trade happiness for the sake of reason and advancement of their plan (Margaret Thatcher)\n\nDo you have minions? If not, you are not an ENTJ. \n\nDo you put on a fake smile to make people around you feel better, even if you're feeling down? If so, you're an ENFJ.\n\nThere's a thousand more examples I can think of. I am a very strong ENTJ type with 51% on my J, so I am more interested in people than some ENTJ types, but I am still an ENTJ. I am nothing like an ENFJ. Sometimes I wish I was, they are quite amazing. They can do things I cannot. 
1	I used to think I was an ENFJ too until I realized I resonated more with ENTJ’s. I took this test to confirm: https://www.quiz-maker.com/QLB6CNF\n\nIt is the most accurate in my opinion. 
1	This is the most accurate write up I've found where ENTJ's find similarities with ENFJ's. \n\nhttps://www.quora.com/Myers-Briggs-Type-Indicator-How-are-ENFJs-different-from-ENTJs\n\n> ENFJs think of themselves as logical; they like to think themselves positively, so when being logical seems like a virtuous trait, they like to think that they are; that’s how many ENFJs mistake themselves as ENTJs but ENTJs rarely mistake themselves as ENFJs. One clue for people who usually get ENFJ & ENTJ from test results is that this usually means that they are ENFJ. ENTJs maybe get mistyped as ESTJ or INTJ, at most, ENTP, but almost never ENFJ.\n\n> The jarring difference between the two is the placement of emotion over cold logic in making a decision. ENFJ's will factor in the emotional aspect over logic, while the opposite is true with ENTJs. ENTJ's are more resilient to criticism whereas ENFJ's aren't. \n\nLooks like I was an ENFJ all along....
7	What should I ask you on a first date?	INTP female here.
20	If you want to test maturity and their personal development, ask them competence related questions that test their ability for introspection: when you get an ENTJ talking about a project that they've done, ask them about how they feel about the outcomes and their role in the project, what they learned from it and how they are planning on improve themselves, and how they are fairing in that regard.\n\nWhy is this important? A young, ambitious, excited ENTJ can be a bit of a bull in a china shop. If they show personal introspection, the next step is them developing introspection with regard to their relationships, which is kinda what you want in a person to build a life with. 
9	What are your goals and priorities for the next year. :)\n\nA way for an ENTJ to show their competence and feel comfortable.
8	First dates are 2-way interviews. Ask whatever you want to ask.\n
5	When it comes down to it, I want to know what your philosophy of life is. Philosophy in general is of great theoretical and practical interest to me. I need to see you have a well-thought-out worldview. Start with lighter topics first.  \n\nI also want to see that you’re discriminating, that you care about my worldview and value the ways it aligns with yours. Feel free to challenge me in ways it doesn’t, I don’t mind being wrong. I want to grow. I like for my partner to have that same attitude. \n\nI don’t expect you to share all of my passions and interests and opinions, but I want to be able to respect and value yours and hope you’re able to respect and value mine. \n\nBe yourself, find common ground, explore questions that arise naturally. My INTP and I were friends before we fell in love. Wishing you the same success. 
3	Favorite tv shows, authors and media outlets - because that says a lot about a person.
3	Argue with me. Challenge me. Win the argument or make a good, valid point. Teach me something, show me your mastery over anything - literally anything you do to a high level of skill. I will respect you forever. \n\nAs an INTP you should have no problem, your IXXP opposite will attract the EXXJ and the shared N will make the whole relationship seem magickal. You probably won't even have to try...
1	Joust with them, it makes you seem interesting.
1	"So what's your damage"
1	Im married to an INTP and what go me super interested him from the get go was the following: \n1. Good sense of humor and straightforward nature.\n2. His interests and how developed his thinking was on subjects. \n2. His ability to invest interest in my passions.\n\nSeriously just be honest and if it doesn't work then it's good to know that.  
4	How do u guys get mad?	Meh: I turn cold and just making sure that everything is fair
12	Shows up as frustration.  Anger requires emotion.
4	99% of the time I question myself and look for a fix in my frustration and mindset. The negative emotion doesn't get out, it is analyzed and canalyzed (I'd like to say, generally in sports, but these last months it's more videogames and internet troll).    \nThe 1% of genuine anger didn't occur since I consider myself "almost mature or close".
3	I get on reddit and downvote _everything_. If I'm not happy, you get -1 internet points from me! ^^^muahahaha
3	I noticed that logically reasoning with people don't always work that well so I often fake anger while being completely calm on the inside and it would draw enough attention to solve my problem.
2	I usually don't; it takes talent to piss me off but when that mission is accomplished, I flip out and start gluing everything to the ceiling.\n
1	The usual. I'm much more disagreeable, say things I might regret.
1	I start getting sarcastic and openly attack the object of my ire. If that doesn't change the situation, I start plotting punishments and revenge in order to teach them a lesson. (Only if they are disposable - would never do this to a friend or even an ex friend, we do have a sense of honor, you know)\n\nThis applies to everyone. If it's a policy I'm pissed about, I go after the politician responsible. I make angry posts on reddit about how China sucks (Tibet issue) I start friending and following their political rivals. (Currently I'm a Republican because it's the lesser of two evils)
1	long tempered. I bottle everything up until I just let it all out. Scares people since I'm so used to not reacting or getting mad easily. 
7	Romantic Relationships	Does anybody else feel extremely uncomfortable when it comes to the emotional side of romance? \n\nI was recently considering entering a relationship with a man that I had a lot in common with. We got along perfectly but I found him to be a little bit too sensitive and emotional. I told him so and gave him the flick because I personally don't want to sit down and talk about my feelings every night. \n\nI've never been in a proper relationship before because I become too annoyed with how emotional people tend to be and it just really grinds my gears. \n\nHow did/do you handle romantic relationships with non ENTJ's? \n\n
4	Initially romantic relationships always felt this way for me. I found that relationships rooted in learning about each other first made it easier for me to then be very passionate. My Greek romantic passion has always come after my pseudo guarded, analytical, cognitive functions as an ENTJ are satisfied. \n\nI believe it's important as an ENTJ to generally identify what you want (ideally) prior to the relationship and to work backwards from there. Strong maternal instincts, fitness, well traveled, kind, true, stimulating conversationalist etc were big deals for me. \n\nOnce I had drawn that line I found the person (eventually) and was able to forge the relationship pretty quickly. It felt more like a natural fit. It felt like a life partner. \n\nIf you don't want emotional then add that to your list. But I would probably urge you to focus on larger things in the event someone whose passion sweeps you off your feet is ruled out. You sound like you'll know quickly if they irritate you. So it won't waste much time. \n\nThere are and probably always will be times I have to feign emotions. It's part of our personality type. I believe this is important to how we function. Case and point, my sister might need a hug over analytical advice. Or my wife might need to be told a warm compliment after a rough week when I'm in no mood to give one. There will be times as an ENTJ where you need to realize it's not about you. "Lower the robot guard" I sometimes tell myself, "...what does this person need right now?" I think we have the ability to do that and it's a sign of maturity when we sharpen and use that empathy chip for the sake of someone else.
5	Don't feel bad about that. It is very self aware of you to know what works for you in a partner and not waste another persons time trying to make a square peg fit in a round hole. That's the opposite of cowardice. I have this same issue with my friendships and acquaintances. I have no patience for drama and self inflicted problems. It is 100% okay not to let yourself be roped in to other peoples drama. \n\nA healthy relationship doesn't make you feel bad. It took me some time to find a partner who was really easy going. If we have a problem we talk about it in a straight forward way and find a fair compromise. My partner is self sufficient and secure. They don't *need* me so I'm not taking care of them. We have fun together. These are the things I like in a partner; a person who has their shit together. \n\nIn my experience, people with good communication skills and stable personalities are, unfortunately, hard to find. Good luck!\n\nEdit: Homonyms are my kryptonite
2	You need to work on developing your inferior Fi. This is the main ENTJ challenge. First, remember, emotions are NOT lies and they are not obstacles. They are powerful tools and very chaotic datasets that are difficult to read, especially with logic. You need to use your INTUITION in these situations and just let go with what you feel.\n\nIt's VERY difficult for ENTJ to learn to do this. I find the older, mature INTJ type to be helpful as friends for development of this. \n\n"Inferior: Introverted feeling (Fi)\nFi filters information based on interpretations of worth, forming judgments according to criteria that are often intangible. Fi constantly balances an internal set of values such as harmony and authenticity. Attuned to subtle distinctions, Fi innately senses what is true and what is false in a situation.[19]\n\nFi is the ENTJs' weakest function, but it does mature over time. ENTJs have difficulty applying subjective and emotional thoughts to their decision-making, since they believe Feeling obstructs decisiveness and impartiality. While this is applicable to objective criteria, ENTJs must learn to recognize the great importance of Feeling in relationships and personal contact, since it creates the close bonds vital to human beings. At worst, a failure to engage the Feeling function can make ENTJs appear overbearing, insensitive, and abrasive. Further, it can result in an underdeveloped system of morality and values, which can disengage ENTJs from the personal world of self-fulfillment."\n\nWikipedia
4	People who tend to talk about their feelings, Imho, are the ones who have a very limited understanding of themselves. I dont like to tak about feelings because I know how I feel and there isnt much to add about the issue. Also I am rife in suspicion about my correspondent’s ability to respectfully process this vulnearable side of mine. Maybe its just a me thing. Maybe its a generally entj thing. You decide.

14	What would your bumper sticker say?	And don't give me any crap about how you're too cool to ever own a bumper sticker. 
21	Everything's okay; I'm in charge. 
13	"Fuck your sensitivity."
10	I’ll just do it.
10	“My other ride is your mom”
11	“Fuck off”
3	i got a license plate frame that says " top: be the best , bottom: accept nothing less" in italic sporty lettering. motorsport vibe. i think its uplifting motivating to me everytime i see it and hope it is for everyone that does.\n\nlike, just grab the fucking bull and enjoy the ride
3	> And don't give me any crap about how you're too cool to ever own a bumper sticker.\n\nI would not want my car to be an easily identified target, but if I were to get one, it would say: "Blue Lives Matter" (maybe with a pic of a cop) so that when I get pulled over by cops, they might let me off.\n\nThat said, the sticker better be removable. I would only put it on when I am driving somewhere, not when the car is parked.\n
3	I have considered a LED thing on the back of my car with a few programmed buttons that change it to say things like "GET OFF YOUR PHONE" or "GET OFF MY BUMPER" or "TURN OFF YOUR BRIGHTS" or "PLEASE DON'T REPRODUCE THANKS"
5	MOVE OVER
2	Work hard. Play harder.
1	*Clean me*
3	Male ENTJS, what's your opinion of female NTs?	Is any of you in relationship with one?
10	We really connect with them. I’m close with an NT, I’d say it’s pretty new and exciting on the romance side of things. I find I blend with them better than other personalities. 
9	I'm a male ENTJ (gay) but my roommate is a female ENTJ.\n\nWe are always on the same page for everything in terms roommate conflict stuff. Our nonverbal communication is spot fucking on and we have become very close friends from living together.
6	Since NTs are uncommon they can have an interesting perspective.
6	Horny ENTP women are awesome!
3	No messy emotions to deal with. It's more dry, but at least calm.
3	we dont give a shit
2	I get that there are some temperamental similarities among all the NT types, and I guess among NT women, but I think type still matters. I couldn't give you a straight answer to this question since I have had very different experiences with female INTPs than I have with ENTPs. Can't recall having ever met an ENTJ female, and only one INTJ. \n\nI guess generally my views are more positive than not, but I can't go much further. 
2	I have casual friendship with one female ENTJ. We don't meet often but for 7 years we've keeped in touch and consulted each other. She is strict (finance audit) and laugh loud. Her stubbornness to invite me to salsa parties (like for 2 years) finally made me decent dancer. \nI would think that she don't care about me, but when we meet, she makes me feel special. 
3	I find INTPs to be a bit too cold/boring for my liking and the ENTJ I was hooking up with for a while was cool but got on my nerves pretty quickly if we spent prolonged periods of time together.

1	NT is ideal for any human,  \nthe problem is values and attributes. that human needs to be virtuous and to want to get more virtuous ) with a vengeance 
1	Fascinating on everyones response. \n\nNot that you asked, but as a female \(E/I\)NTJ I feel a male ENTJ and I would murder each other \(figuratively, obviously\). \n\nI work with a male ENTJ and we have trouble making extended eye contact even though we both like and respect each other from a coworker perspective and agree on most things. Man we fight though and everyone around us thinks it get super rough but we are like "What, we were just talking?" lol.
3	Dear ENTJ lovers, are your partners always a second priority to you? Why or why not?	
17	No, I prioritize what needs to be prioritized. Maybe for 2 weeks I have a deadline due that is super important and I'll prioritize that. Maybe my relationship is hitting an important point and I'll prioritize that.
13	When I fall in love with somebody, I prioritize the future I want to have with them. And sometimes that means putting work first. But I would never prioritize work to such an extent that I would neglect my partner for long because that would defeat the whole purpose.
21	Actually, my relationship becomes my number 1 after I fall in love. And it actually kind of pisses me off because I can’t focus on the usual things as much because I am so completely hypnotized by the one I love, so productivity goes down. But you can’t really help these love things, so you’ve just gotta suck it up and enjoy the ride. :)
5	Not really. I try to make my partner happy, but obviously I take my own health and future as a first priority.
7	No, my SO is extremely high on my priority list. That being said, I've made it very clear from the very beginning what kind of life and lifestyle having a relationship with me meant. \n\nI would not be able to live with an SO who would bitch day in and out about my work habits and schedule. My SO accepts these non negotiables however, so I also put him high on my priority list in return. This includes calling off work appointments or leaving work early, no questions asked, and no second guessing myself, if my SO is ill etc and needs my help at home.
5	I place a high premium on my commitments to others, and the highest in someone I'm dating. In terms of their needs, if they need me to take more of the burden financially, I'd do the best I could (within reason). If they were physically sick, I'd be there as much as my other commitments would allow. I'm not the best "raw" emotional support, but I do try, and would prioritize their emotional needs over mine if they had a rough period they were going through. Relationships are inherently give-and-take, and should never be one sided.\n\nAll that being said, prioritizing someone's *needs* over others or your own is absolutely not the same as prioritizing *them over yourself*. The latter is extremely toxic, unhealthy, and reveals a low self-worth. I would never change my career path for my partner so they could pursue the career they wanted at my expense. I would never cut off my relationships to close friends or family because they felt more comfortable that way. And I certainly would never conform to their belief systems and values just to prolong the commitment. \n\nTl;dr --> Prioritizing my time and resources, always. Prioritizing their identity over mine, never. 
3	If we respect and love the said partner as a definitive ally of ours, I would presume that we would make them our utmost priority. However this concept is rather ideal. In reality trusting a person with your ultimate affection is a losing hand, since it leaves you vulnearable. In the end only thing we can trust is facts derived from analysis and ourselves.
3	If something work related comes up that i can’t put off, and I have to cancel on a date or a partner,  I will. 
2	Honestly I hate to admit this but yes. However, I don’t think it’s an ENTJ quality. 
2	I completely put my partner first. We rarely spend time together now so I put him first. If he's happy, I'm usually happy
2	I never understood why people think the two (work and family) have to be mutually exclusive.  You can pursue important things on your life while simultaneously being a good pattern. I work very hard in my career. I've advanced significantly in the 4 years since I started my job and I've not found it hard to plan/make time to spend with my partner. 
2	Never. They are always my top priority, nothing else much matters without romance. Currently, my work is my romance, though, since my husband is deceased and he left his work to me, and I plan on taking the full two years of mourning before even considering dating - I may not ever date again. So that's a bit confusing. It did come down to it one day where we had a big debate about which one was more important, and I always crumple under pressure. I would always give up my work, no matter how important, and sacrifice it for the sake of my partner, ultimately they are worth more to me. 
1	I try to focus on my SO but I start feeling I'm falling behind and I start villainizing her until we break up, it does get me back to where I feel I'm doing good but god damn I know it's not right. Happened twice already. 
1	[deleted]
1	Frankly, it depends on whether my partner is worthy of that prioritization and if they can handle it. Having my full, intense focus can be unnerving to some types. What I mean by worthiness is: are they my equal? Can they exist equitably with me in life? Can they keep up? It might sound mean (it probably is), but I don’t do well with partners who need to be THE BIGGEST THING in my life—especially if that comes with the cost of trying to crush the ambition out of me in order to be number one. But if my partner can hold their own and ‘match’ me, I will move heaven and earth for them.\n\n
11	Big 5 Correlations (x-post from r/INFJ)	Edit*\n\n##[Results Post Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/89k2lv/big_5_correlations_results/)\n\n-------\n\nHey there, ENTJs! I'm a mod over on r/INFJ and we've been doing this experiment to see if we can confirm any Big 5 correlations between MBTI types. So far I've got input from INFJs, INTJs, INTPs, and ENTPs, mostly. I've asked a few other types as well and now I'm coming to you :) I promise to come back with results if I get enough people to participate. Just state your type (it's ok if you're not an ENTJ) and your % scores for each Big 5 category, and feel free to add anything else from your results if you want to share. Thanks in advance! (see below for more info)\n\n-------\n\nThere is a lot of talk regarding MBTI vs [the Big 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits) - [is MBTI as valid](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2012/08/02/what-is-the-current-thinking-about-myers-briggs), do they correlate ([1](https://psychology.stackexchange.com/questions/13460/what-correlation-research-has-been-done-on-mbti-vs-big5), [2](https://personalityjunkie.com/09/openness-myers-briggs-mbti-intuition-big-five-iq-correlations/)), etc. I thought a community post would be a good way to see what kind of distribution we have when we compile results. With enough participants, I'll report back the distributions and see what shakes out :)\n\n##[You can take the Big 5 test here](https://www.truity.com/test/big-five-personality-test)\n\n(it's free, the $29 "cost" refers to the cost of their premium report, and you also don't need to create an account to see your results, just click "no thanks")\n\n**Please comment here with your type (let me know your type so we're not mixing results) and the percentages for each Big 5 category.**\n\nBelow is an overview of the Big 5 for those who are unfamiliar.\n\n-----\n\n[*From wikipedia:*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits)\n\n> * **Openness** to experience (inventive/curious vs. consistent/cautious)  \nAppreciation for art, emotion, adventure, unusual ideas, curiosity, and variety of experience. Openness reflects the degree of intellectual curiosity, creativity and a preference for novelty and variety a person has. It is also described as the extent to which a person is imaginative or independent and depicts a personal preference for a variety of activities over a strict routine. High openness can be perceived as unpredictability or lack of focus, and more likely to engage in risky behaviour or drug taking. Also, individuals that have high openness tend to lean towards being artists or writers in regards to being creative and appreciate the significance of the intellectual and artistic pursuits. Moreover, individuals with high openness are said to pursue self-actualization specifically by seeking out intense, euphoric experiences. Conversely, those with low openness seek to gain fulfillment through perseverance and are characterized as pragmatic and data-driven—sometimes even perceived to be dogmatic and closed-minded. Some disagreement remains about how to interpret and contextualize the openness factor.\n\n>* **Conscientiousness** (efficient/organized vs. easy-going/careless)  \nA tendency to be organized and dependable, show self-discipline, act dutifully, aim for achievement, and prefer planned rather than spontaneous behavior. High conscientiousness is often perceived as stubbornness and obsession. Low conscientiousness is associated with flexibility and spontaneity, but can also appear as sloppiness and lack of reliability.\n\n>* **Extraversion** (outgoing/energetic vs. solitary/reserved)  \nEnergy, positive emotions, surgency, assertiveness, sociability and the tendency to seek stimulation in the company of others, and talkativeness. High extraversion is often perceived as attention-seeking, and domineering. Low extraversion causes a reserved, reflective personality, which can be perceived as aloof or self-absorbed. Extroverted people tend to be more dominant in social settings, opposed to introverted people who may act more shy and reserved in this setting.\n\n>* **Agreeableness** (friendly/compassionate vs. challenging/detached)  \nA tendency to be compassionate and cooperative rather than suspicious and antagonistic towards others. It is also a measure of one's trusting and helpful nature, and whether a person is generally well-tempered or not. High agreeableness is often seen as naive or submissive. Low agreeableness personalities are often competitive or challenging people, which can be seen as argumentativeness or untrustworthiness.\n\n>* **Neuroticism** (sensitive/nervous vs. secure/confident)  \nNeuroticism identifies certain people who are more prone to psychological stress. The tendency to experience unpleasant emotions easily, such as anger, anxiety, depression, and vulnerability. Neuroticism also refers to the degree of emotional stability and impulse control and is sometimes referred to by its low pole, "emotional stability". A high stability manifests itself as a stable and calm personality, but can be seen as uninspiring and unconcerned. A low stability expresses as a reactive and excitable personality, often very dynamic individuals, but they can be perceived as unstable or insecure. It has also been researched that individuals with higher levels of tested neuroticism, tend to have worse psychological well being.\n\n[*From a peer-reviewed paper:*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0191886996000335):\n\n>The NEO-PI Agreeableness score was correlated only with the thinking-feeling (T-F) dimension; the NEO-PI Conscientiousness score was correlated with both thinking-feeling and judging-perceiving (J-P) dimension; the NEO-PI Extraversion score was strongly correlated with the extraversion-introversion (E-I) dimensions, while the Neuroticism score from the NEO-PI was not related to any MBTI subscale score. The openness dimension was correlated with all four especially sensing-intuitive.

3	entj wrath	i have to say out of all types entjs have the most wrath and willpower.when an entj attacks someone you can litteraly feel that force behind them.\nif i comepare enfjs vs entjs both have a strong will but the enfj is going to attack someone through a strong will,but cool inside.\nentjs on the other has inferior fi and that is going to give them pure wrath when they angry
21	Little consideration for the emotion of others seems to be status quo for an ENTJ, but so is the relentless pursuit of a goal through maximum efficiency.  If that goal becomes destroying another human, it’s not pretty.\n\nI would say that almost any entj who succumbed to wrath is experiencing a moment of weakness.  Wrath is an expression of fear, hate and anger.  All emotions.  When an entj is thinking and acting emotionally, they’re unbalanced.  
10	It's a lucky soul who crosses an ENTJ and survives to tell the tale.
10	Should be fun to watch when an angry ENTJ runs into a defiant INTJ.
10	ENTJS -- do you ever feel like you can be too cold / direct / emotionless?	I've always been an ENTJ, but I took the MBTI quiz again a couple days ago and found that I'm more of a radical (so to speak, as in I'm in the high 80-percents for each trait) ENTJ than I used to be. I also find that it's really easy to cut people out of my life and do things that other, more emotional types would have a lot of difficulty doing. Does anyone else share this experience? If so, do you think it's a bad thing to be emotionally detached all the time?
14	It'll be up to you to decide whether or not being emotionally detached for long periods of time is "good" or "bad" in your life.\n\n\nPersonally I think there is nothing wrong with it, to a degree. Over a stupid issue I found it very easy to cut off 3-4 of my best friends who I hung out with on almost a daily basis because I decided they were being too stupid and childish. I think for most ENTJs we value a result above all else, which means we become comfortable with whatever the means may be. \n\n\nFor extended periods of time, being emotionally detached will definitely cause strain on relationships you have or are trying to build. I am far too blunt without ever noticing it, and hurt others feelings. I've become increasingly aware of it and now try to make sure I don't speak so "coldly" to others. But that's because I value relationships to that degree.\n\n\nAs a side note, be aware that many people may think you are just coming off as a prick, instead of someone who just isn't emotionally invested in things or people. 
12	I can see why a lot of ENTJs would act cold or emotionless to achieve a desired result, but that strategy only works well when you're in a position of power. Often times I've found that acting cold towards others will have unintended negative consequences, even if it technically achieves the desired result.\n\nPersonally I do think it's bad to be emotionally detached *all the time,* because I tend to feel very strong emotional responses to a lot of things -- so I assume others do as well. If I'm with friends, I'm emotionally engaged. Even if I'm meeting someone for the first time, I'm emotionally engaged. But at work, in stressful situations, or regarding politics or philosophy I find that emotional detachment is the way to go.\n\nIt's all about finding the right times to be emotionally engaged, and striking the proper balance between emotional engagement and detachment if you want to achieve the best outcome.
3	I refer to it as flipping a switch. If I need to turn off the emotion and detach, I can. There may be consequences, but I can do it quickly if I have to, depending on the situation.
3	Controlling your emotions (you can never exterminate them completely) will give you a great edge in life. This superpower may invoke the loathing of your colleagues and friends, thus proving detrimental to your life goals. In devils advocate devil gives an advice about looking humble and little, concealing your power and hitting the hardest once you have the chance. Dont create more enemies than you need. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/tdQ3aXO4gys\n
2	u say it likes it a bad thing.  \nits important to have a full spectrum of expression. that way you select whats ideal per context 
2	I don't feel that way, but i'm aware that other people feel I am. I'm also aware that no amount of effort in that area will satisfy some people. \n\nAs for cutting people out of my life, I can certainly do it. But it hurts and I don't enjoy it. 
1	I am pretty sure that I can one-up you and I am not even a sociopath.\n\nThat's like being a gay chicken champion whilst not being gay.\n\nPretty impressive, if you ask me.\n
1	Its good to be aware of it. I do not find it easy to cut people out of my life if I love them. My enneagram type is 6 though. I'm very loyal. I have been widowed, which was difficult, but I moved on in some ways immediately. I wasn't destroyed by it. Its a form of resilience, I don't seek to abuse it, which is what unhealthy entj's would do.
1	What I feel is that sometimes people think I'm being cold/direct/emotionless or even rude when, for me, I'm acting normally 
1	Too cold? If you mean like a bull made of iron in a china shop full of china made of icicles, then, um yeah. \n\nI am not emotionally detached all the time, I indulge in my emotions quite often. It's just that I can turn those emotions on or off with alarming precision.\n\nI don't think that's a good thing, in all situations. I can say with absolutely certainty that I could cut anyone out of my life, if necessary at any time, and feel very little emotion after a short period of mourning for the ones I was most attached to. It is very difficult, if not impossible for me to re-attach to people who have hurt me. I feel very deeply, so forming deep and lasting attachments can be a very scary, risky thing for NT types...it can throw our whole world out of balance. We need that cold detachment to prevent ourselves from being overwhelmed by too many high value attachments. I am very careful with whom I attempt to form true friendships with. \n\nSo the solution I have acquired is to just have a strong code of morality. Loyalty, honor, family first, that sort of thing. There's not much else I can do, it's not like I try to be this way, it's hardwired into my brain. \n\nOne thing my INTJ husband taught me (he was nearly 50 when I met him, and was balanced, so had attained a very high level of development)  was to always keep the door open. Don't burn your bridges, ever, unless you really can't help it. Don't compromise on your principles, but don't treat people as disposable.\n\nThat being said, if someone acts like a total asshole to you consistently and has no redeeming qualities, fire away.  
6	is ni at its core just this...?	is ni at its core just internal associations? eg certain memories about things/events connect together to form an image of that person or thing?
6	I imagine it as a mental network of organized concepts in an isolated system and you are creating probable outcomes within the system
4	Pretty much. It's your internal web of knowledge. But it's also the conscious extrapolations and educated guesses you're able to make about things you don't overtly know.
4	Yeah but alot of tumbkr kids have muddied the waters of Ni Si dichotomy. "Si is memory" well who doesnt use their memory? Ni is basically credited as psychic powers, however I really think of it as just images speaking.
3	Imagination.
0	ye
-1	It is more than just that. Fi is responsible for epiphanies. So yes, to echo another user, it is also like having psychic power. It can sometimes connect seemingly distant concepts. I think Magnus Carsen is an Fi dom and he knows the right move to make almost right away but verifying his hunch takes longer. That is Fi, Te for you. I think.\n\nHe could be on the autism spectrum and not well captured by the 16 MBTI buckets.\n
5	Where can I find ENTJs in the wild?	
24	you have to walk around in tall grass for awhile. we're fairly rare so it might take you some time.
16	Don't find us, we'll find you. 
12	[deleted]
9	Honestly, ENTJs are pretty rare, so your best bet would be to meet as many people as possible and then pick out possible ENTJs based on behavioral patterns. This will be harder or easier depending on your type. If you make it a habit of typing as many people around you as possible, you start being able to type people quicker and more accurately.\n\nI can tell you how I would type another ENTJ, but that's very easy for me because I am also one. I'm going to assume you are not one, however, so I'll try to make a list of behaviors that you can look out for. Obviously, not everybody who exhibits most or all of these behaviors will be an ENTJ, and not everybody who is an ENTJ will exhibit all these behaviors. But the more of these items you can see in one person, the greater the likelihood.\n\n\n* ENTJs are Ns. If you are an N, they will be able to satisfy your need for deep conversation. If you are an S, you might be wondering why this person cares so much about things that will never happen. Or you will find them too spacey and impractical.\n\n\n* NTs usually gravitate towards science-y fields. They like talking about facts and data.\n\n\n* Whether a person is a feeler or a thinker shouldn't be too hard to figure out. If you're an F, you may find them insensitive (ENTJ male) or a bitch (ENTJ female). \nIf you're a T, you probably won't run into too many problems with their way of thinking.\n\n\n* First three play to a lot of stereotypes but are usually easier to discern at first glance. The following items might require more observation. They also describe how the functions ENTJs have manifest in the positions they do.\n\n\n* ENTJs are Te-doms. That means their Te will overpower everything else. Indicators of high Te (and therefore low Fi) include the need to organize everything within sight, bluntness, and putting low priority on the feelings of most people. The last item can be most readily seen when (not if) an immature ENTJ decides to try to become the Supreme Leader of their friend group. Hand gestures will be abrupt. One gesture ENTJs like to employ is the "shuffling egg boxes around" motion. In order to figure out what I mean by that, imagine that you are holding a carton of eggs in front of you. Your hands should be on either side of this box. Now lower the box abruptly a few inches. Raise and lower the box the same distance while simultaneously moving the entire box a few inches to one side. Now imagine doing this multiple times. This is how an ENTJ looks when they are trying to explain their latest organization scheme. Another classic Te gesture is where you press the pad of your thumb together with either the pad of your index finger or your middle finger and then move your forearm up and down a little bit, using your elbow as a hinge. This gesture is supposed to signify "accuracy" or "I know EXACTLY what I'm talking about" or something. Since these gestures apply to all people with high Te, you can also spot ISTJs, INTJs, and ESTJs doing them. ESTJs and ENTJs, who have Te as their first function, will just do these things more often and more vigorously. Buzzwords to look out for: "efficiency", "organization", "restructuring", "that makes no sense", "optimal", "data". Another sign you're dealing with a Te-dom: they will jump at every opportunity to use bullet points.\n\n\n* ENTJs have Ni second. They are constantly looking to not just organize things, but organize things in such a way that people five years from now will be using their systems and marveling at the foresight the ENTJ possessed while he/she was designing it in the first place. \n\n\n* ENTJs have Se third, which means that if you get in the way of them trying to gain power through their genius Te-Ni planning or you piss them off (by getting in the way of them trying to gain power through their genius Te-Ni planning), they will try to intimidate you with a piercing stare or with child-ish displays of force. If you don't have Se higher in the stack, you should move aside and let the ENTJ accidentally hurt themselves by overestimating their strength in this area. More positive displays of tertiary Se include having a few hobbies that are more physical (rock climbing, archery, playing an instrument) as a means of stress relief. I know a few ENTJs that are into martial arts, boxing or weightlifting. These hobbies appeal to their more strategic side. A person who is constantly doing high-risk physical activities is more likely to have Se as their first or second function (these are your ESTPs or ISTPs) or a very, very stressed INFJ or INTJ. Even then, INFJs and INTJs have Se as their fourth function, so Se is more likely to show up in them as binge-drinking or playing videogames for fifteen hours straight.\n\n\n* Fi is the last function. Kinda hard to see because most of the time it is just not there. Indicators of inferior Fi include: being extremely sentimental and generous to a very small group of people (like family or very close friends) and not being able to recognize when they have said something very offensive (but usually very accurate) to others.\n\nIf I have time or there is interest, I might go over how you can distinguish between ENTJs and common mistypes, like INTJs and ESTJs.
6	Y tho?
4	I think if you try this ‘in the wild’ you’re going to end up with a bunch of ESTJs you thought were ENTJs. \n\nNormally you’ll find us at work. Until I met my ISTP who showed me the value of not killing myself for career, it was my favorite place to be. But we probably won’t date you if you’re a colleague or client, because we know that could damage our reputations/work lives. \n\nTL;DR: :shrug: Try loudly espousing an opinion you know is disingenuous or incorrect and see if one of us swoops in to debate you? 
2	Drop rates are quite low for this particular item.

1	An internet dictionary defines "wild" as follows:\n\nhttps://www.thefreedictionary.com/wild\n\nSo, I think every now and then, there are some fine-looking ENTJ chicks at Starbucks. LOL!

1	I'm not sure, I've never met or known of another ENTJ offline \(though I'd love for this to be the case\).

12	ENTJs, how do you know when you love someone?	It could be anything like actions or small things that you do for that special someone! :)
28	I also had an ENTJ boyfriend during my second year of college. I do not know if this applies to every ENTJ, but here’s my story.\n\nAt first, he questioned a lot of things about me... such as why did you choose this major? Why don’t you do this instead of that?! Somewhat personal and straightforward questions that made me think and “explain” myself. In the beginning, I tried avoiding him bc of the way he approached me. I felt overwhelmed by his outspokenness and “arrogant” demeanor. \n\nHowever, I started to notice that he was interested in me when he was doing things that he wouldn’t normally do for other people. He would wait to open doors for me, asked me about my day, and offered to drive me to my house since I always took the bus home after my classes. \nThis may be considered small things, but since he comes off aloof to people around him.. those things started to catch my attention. 
22	INFJ here who dated an ENTJ.\n\nI asked an ex this once and he said "Love is action" so as long as he wanted to do small things for me that he normally wouldn't do for others, he knew he loved me.\n\nEventually he didn't anymore and that was a sign.
11	I remember having an epiphany the first and only time I’ve fallen in love; I was amazed by how I loved him more and more every day, even though it didn’t feel possible because my heart was already bursting with love for him. It just hit me one day like oh, so this is what falling in love is. I felt a bit caught off guard by the power of the sensation. I had thought I had been in love before, but previous relationships paled in comparison to the meaning and experience of this. It was like the difference in mental processing between reading and comprehension. It made me feel like there were parts of myself and life that I wasn’t yet aware of or couldn’t yet understand, which is humbling when you’re 17/18 (as I was) and think you know everything there is to know about these things.\n \n11 years later, I’m still in awe of our love for each other. People think we’re still in the honeymoon phase. I wouldn’t want to go on living without him in the world, he’s the King on my chessboard. I’d use any and all resources to protect him. \n\n‘The knees of my heart shall I bow’- from the auld Scottish lullaby, *Balulalow*\nhttps://youtu.be/viZI1Ua7S6o 
9	Irrational preoccupation?
9	[Female ENTJ] Honestly, I let my guard down and show them who I really am; privately of course. I'm one of those ENTJs that is very charming and knows how to effectively work a room. Basically give people what they want to see from me.\n\nBut if I find someone I find interesting, I 'breadcrumb' them with little bits of personal information, things no one would know, and I do this over time to see if I can trust them.\n\nIf I don't trust them, I slap on the superficial mask and drop the feels all together.\n\nIf they pick up on that I'm different towards them than anyone else, then I show them parts of my 'squishy self' (my real sense of humor, private hobbies, personal fears, goals). I ask them questions, deep ones, to see how they tick and if we are capable to have a real conversation where we are both vulnerable and honest.\n\nThis takes a long time...sometimes a year or more. The only ones who seem patient with me exposing my layers bit by bit are INTJs. They know how to hasten the process by asking blunt, well calculated questions that pull me out of my glitterball of a shell.
7	Make sure they have an orgasm too. And cook for them. 
5	ENTJ here who recently broke up with an ENFP. \n\nOther people’s feelings and emotions can sway ENTJs, it’s important you don’t let them sway your own though. I thought I was in love with her, but I just got so caught up in the excitement of meeting someone new that I didn’t really listen to myself. There were obvious signs she was not the person I could love forever, so I broke it off with her. \n\nThere’s someone else in my life I’ve also had an incredible connection with. We’ve recently strengthened that and it’s been awesome. Sometimes it’s important to really study the feelings you have about someone. \n\nYou know you love someone when you fight for them, which I didn’t want to do for my previously relationship. She wasn’t worth the effort. :)
3	If we make it through the first real fight, recover, and he deals with it pretty bloody well, I know there's potential for love. Communication is probably the most important thing to me in a relationship. Imo, the best time that's exposed is during/after a fight/argument. I'm not one to fight or argue, but obviously something along those lines is inevitable for the least argumentative/petty people.\n\nImo, you won't know it's genuine love until after you have a fight. That's where you really get to know the person you're with.
3	It hasn't happened yet. I am an extremely broken person because of how I grew up, and will probably never love anyone. Not because I don't want to, but because I don't know what it feels like to love someone. I simply can't do it.\n\nHowever, there are people that I care for and worry about, so I surmise that this is the extent of my "love". 
3	Once we get past the mutual N chemistry? Probably the fact that I would literally kill for them if necessary. Since I'm an ENTJ that means it's never necessary, but it's always on the menu. \n\n #selfmademorality\n\n
6	Orgasm
2	Do you mean infatuated or in actual love?
2	I say something stupid, sabotage the relationship and they end up hating my guts.
2	I get smitten by the mind. I also go all in - in terms of effort. I spend as much time with them as possible. I feel in the early stages of a dating I'm guarded and have to be bigger version of myself. With people I fall for, I get comfortable being myself, it no longer feels like i'm trying to impress them. 
2	I feel something in terms of connection I cannot explain rationally. I enjoy the fact that sometimes my Intellect takes a backseat and I just FEEL. Yes...I'm an ENTJ 😀
1	this is more a question of neuroscience really, and how many people actually poke at their intuition, . but NTs, are probably the most likely to make a list of those arguments pro attraction. so .. its a list, its contextual, it depends on attrbiutes and how ive perceived them 
12	China Banning People From Transit for Bad "Social Credit" Scores	
10	Black Mirror has begun accurately predicting real life. Lovely.
4	"The real division is not between conservatives and revolutionaries but between authoritarians and libertarians." - George Orwell
3	No joke. Just like in black mirror. 
2	This is disgusting, and so open to abuse. I'm sure the backwards primitive savages in charge of China, bloody communists, have great social credit, despite being worthless human garbage. 
1	In my county we have already such a system of credits. If I want to leave the county by plane and visit my girlfriend in the U.S. I need to collect around 7000 to 10000 points (the points are marked with kn which is an abbreviation for kuna). Without those points you just can't get a plane ticket no matter how hard you beg them.\n\nThe difference is that we don't call those points "social credit" but financial credit. A lot of people just use a slang and call it money.
13	ENTJs that took them a while to find the right career fit; what steps did you take?	As an ENTJ myself, I can imagine the frustration of not working to your fullest potential is relatable here and wanted to know how I can solve this problem? My current work is too slow in terms of growth and learning, and is far too administrative in nature to my liking. \n\n
6	I'm 34, almost 35, and I just got out of a job like that. I loved the company's mission but they had no vision and the leadership was exceedingly transactional instead of transformational. It was frustrating to put in so much admin work when just a little focus would've made it much simpler and easier  \n\nIt was a hard decision but now I'm in a position that let's me flex my strategic muscle. I love it this far and may have even found myself a mentor in my new boss. \n\nThe biggest question is: are you qualified for the kind of job you want to be in?  If not you'll have to cut your teeth somewhere to get your for in the door. 
3	Find a useful hobby that you feel automatically motivated to do everyday and practice at it till you are so good that you can build a career out of it or a business
2	I haven't found the right career, but I think I'm on my way. I'm 23, I barely have an education (meaning I've got everything except for a degree), and I've been in retail for the last 3 years. I only left retail 3 weeks ago.\n\nI'm currently working in the charity sector for a charity which I'm not entirely crazy about in the sense that it's great they're helping vulnerable people, but I don't see myself working here in 10 years.\n\nI applied for the job without thinking twice about what I was getting into. It was just another job out of the hundreds I applied for. When I got the call saying I got it, that's when I FINALLY - after years and years and years and years of wondering where my life was heading - I FINALLY realise I want to continue working either in the charity sector or as something to do with family support, where I'm specifically working with victims of sex abuse or child abuse. I feel inclined to do it because I want to give them the help that I never received after my experiences of both.\n\nI can't believe I had to come this far to get even the slightest idea that this is what I want to do. Even if it doesn't work out and I end up in something completely unrelated like finance within the next few years, it gives me something to work toward in the meantime.
2	I'm 26 and running my own business in fitness. I am my own boss because i can't stand supervision. It makes me too damn triggered (both positive and negative way). I've worked 3 years as basic employee on gym and 3 months as coordinator. I learned how business works and run away. Never more.\n\nCurrently i am close to being broke but as happy and free as it could be in work. 
1	This is why I love medicine. Endless avenues for self improvement, working towards better outcomes, new knowledge, and improvement of the efficiency of my job. All are viewed as extremely desired in a candidate. It's just awesome. 
1	ENTJ-A here.\n\nHobbies are for you! An outdated term, but still fitting for most of us (especially if you're high in openness), you're a Renaissance man!
6	How to handle betrayal?	One of the few people I thought I trusted betrayed my confidence today. Strangely, I feel hurt. Of course, I want nothing more than to see this person crash and burn, but I work with them, so I have to see them on a regular basis.  \n\nMature ENTJs: how can I handle this betrayal appropriately? Obviously I will never trust this person again, but I'm wondering how I can cope with my own feelings. I would like to avoid just taking vengeance against this person, as I'm pretty sure I would regret any harsh action in the long run.\n\nI'm mostly mad at myself for being a fool enough to trust someone I've only known a year, and doubly foolish enough for it to be a person I work with.
6	Forgive but don't forget, and move on.
3	[How to Get Over Break Ups and Betrayal - Jocko Willink - 13 mins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c709rGYW8v0)
2	You’ve already felt what you needed to feel. You have realized the gravity of your mistaken trust.  \n\nI see three things you can pursue:\n\nAn apology, if you think that will help.\n\nAnother job.\n\nFear, fear of this person.  Fear of accepting that you have a fault and that person in someway had succeeded more than you.\n\nPick a pursuit.\n
2	Usually with any kind of betrayal, I end up utterly destroying the person because it eliminates the threat. And then I create as much distance as possible. Someone who betrays you does not have your own best interests at heart, but is driven by selfish means. These people are dangerous! Best of luck.
1	Forgive the INTJ interjection here, feel free to tell me to rack off but one of the things we are good at is underhand revenge and one of the reasons we are INTJ is our trust issues (no one betrays us because we don't trust anyone enough to let them in - or we have learned not to).  If you *had* to enact revenge an INTJ way would be to make sure it never came back to you, a series of steps that fell into place like a domino chain.  The sensible, wise, annoying thing to do is forget that shit of course (karma, yadayadayada) but, if needs be, secret squirrel all the way.
1	sounds like a good context to grow from.  \ntheres no such thing as bitterness for a mature individual, its illogical and inefficient.  \nur probably missing information about his perspective  
1	Went through the exact same situation recently and it was a friend that was an INTJ. We have nuclear weapons on each other. Luckily I don't see them on a regular basis though because I can't stand them anymore.\n\nI understand the anger at yourself, I felt it too but that anger doesn't help anyone so just remember to chalk it up in your book of lessons to see why you made that mistake and avoid it in the future.\n\nThe cool thing about being an ENTJ though is that it's so easy to cut someone out of your life. You should have more influence, power and control than the other person. Don't go to war though openly as it weakens your power base. Ignore them when you can. \n\nDo not forgive and do not forget, but don't feel anger. As an ENTJ you are better than feely types and can control yourself and take the optimal path once the initial pain from the betrayal fades.\n\nFor me, I'm not even taking revenge because luckily the person I had trusted and befriended is unstable and I knew it. I don't need to do anything active to let them self-destruct. I thought they were worth saving and respected them because they were intelligent and had good ideas, but end of the day if someone is a drama-queen and has a victim mentality, they will betray you at the first chance.\n\nI should've known better, they told me how they had betrayed other people and I thought I was different. Boy was that foolish. NEVER believe that someone will treat you differently when they have betrayed others already.
1	No. A dead beast can’t do anything. But you do have a good point. Which is why I leave no threat standing.
4	Self-Improvement	Who would you consider worth following on Twitter when it comes to self-improvement, productivity, time management, and energy management? It'd be nice if I could get it down to one. I tried the self-improvement subreddit. That was surprisingly a bust.
3	You probably won't find much on the Internet. 
3	Jocko Willink\nhttps://twitter.com/jockowillink\n\nJordan Peterson\nhttps://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson (currently a lot of political idelogues are after him, so the message isn't as pure, but the controversy will die down eventually)
3	No one. Self-education is a prerequisite to self-improvement.
2	Part of improving yourself is looking inward instead of outward for answers. Unless you understand your own flaws on a deeper level, you won't know how to go about improving them. Really engage your Ni and figure out why you do what you do, and what the root cause of most of your bad behavior is. Self-help books and internet sites will help, but won't be the solution. Everyone has different psychological motivations for their habits, so while self-help material may be helpful to the vast majority, only you know yourself.  
1	depends on the platform. i find twitterstale  \nfacebook is good.  /keen4 < add me
1	Go look up Tom Bilyeu or Tim Ferriss, on whatever social platform tickles your fancy. Those 2 guys are my spirit animals.\n
5	ENTJs... how do you guys feel (or how do you guys act) when your SO or close family member are emotionally in need or when they’re crying over personal distress?	
9	Help them as they are half of your life if they are your SO, if they are family and wronged you in the past in a major way then it’s their problem. If it’s a close family member that hasn’t wronged you in the past then give them advice.
7	It's an opportunity to show them that I care as I am not the most affectionate person and also I am often busy with my own stuff. 
5	I think of a solution for them and try to help them think through the problem. If they're not seeking pity or attention then we usual fix whatever the problem is. Source of emotional distress: eliminated. And now they can go back to life.\n\n\nUnless it's something that can't be fixed like someone dying. Then I just try and comfort them in the way they like best- hugs, letting them vent, etc. 
3	I'd probably try to solve whatever is causing you pain. Either physically find a solution, or try to put it in perspective.\n\nWatching my SO grieving at birthdays and Xmas hits me hard. I just hold him, comfort him, leave him alone if he wants to be alone. \n\nAnd if I don't do either of those things, then I think you deserve it or have brought it upon yourself.
2	Well, ideally, especially if it's your SO, you've been spending a lot of time with them in non-stress or minor stress situations building your relationship and discussing communication and support methods within your relationship.\n\nBy the time your SO is in major distress, you should know how your SO likes to be supported in times like these and you do exactly that. 
2	My natural inclination would be to help them fix the problem. Realistically though, I would do whatever is appropriate based on the situation. If you only ever express care based on what *you* think should make someone feel better, chances are you're not a very good listener. MBTI doesn't have rules about which types can show compassion, or in what ways, when and how they can. Basic reciprocity is the foundation for any relationship. \n
1	Thank you for you guys responses! I can also see that ENTJs value reciprocity when it comes to being there for someone. 
1	If it’s their own fault I have little empathy unless it’s my wife.  Then I force it and try to keep my mouth shut.  
1	I can honestly say it’s the one time in life I feel genuinely incapable. Most people don’t want solutions in that moment, and my next default is cracking jokes (also not usually great), so I end up awkwardly trying to comfort them while looking like Lassie trying to figure out how to get Timmy out of the well. I can’t seem to muster a sympathetic tone that doesn’t sound patronizing to my ear (even if I’m feeling genuine sympathy for the person). \n\nI try to leave the comforting to the feelers if at all possible. 
1	I usually start mansplaining to them the solution to their problems, even though I'm female. Sometimes with hugs. Then I go find them something they like to eat, like, donuts or a hamburger, or make something they like. ENTJ's like to show off their simpler talents to those they love, especially if it serves a dual purpose.
3	ENTP or ENTJ?	Okey guys, I'm really confused. I read through cognitive functions but I can't match them with my behaviour and everything. I just see in myself all of them.In past I've been typed as ENTP, but also ENTJ and INTP. I've got a couple of facts, so they can help.\nI've been suggested to copy this ask in ENTJ section so maybe some of you can help.\n\n- I like to have interesting conversations, I don't care if it's about politics or some concept in the movie, as long as it's not gossip about people, it's just boring\n\n- I can be pretty blunt sometimes, and it's not because I want to offend people or sth, I just don't like to circle around something I have to say, but If I see that it may seriously worry someone, then I try to smooth it\n\n- When I go somewhere by car or by the train I prefer to listen to music that talk to people during the ride\n\n- I identify as ambivert\n\n- I may be starting many things, projects etc but it's hard for me to finish them, I get bored quickly and once it's not knew anymore I loose excitement\n\n- I'm into extreme sports\n\n- I really like riddles and solving them gives me a lot of satisfaction\n\n- I'm pretty sarcastic and I may look like I don't care about people ( what I've been told) but I do. I'm just not good at expressing it with words, I always just hope this person k n o w s it\n\n- I'm compassionate, expecially if it's about dogs,or other poor animals\n\n- I think being polite to people it's important, so they will be polite to you too and everyone will be pleased\n\n- I'm future oriented, I spend a lot of time thinking about where I want to live, what I want to study, what qualities in partner I value, what do I want from life\n\n- I often rationalize my feelings. When I'm sad or angry etc I try to do a bit of research and for example if I'm on my period at this time I explain it by it.\n\n- If there's someone I like but I know there's no future for it, then I won't act on those feelings, there's no point in that, but still, feeling it is tiring\n\n- I'm lazy and I procrastinate a lot\n\n- It's not a problem for me to come and talk to a stranger, and when someone has to go and ask about something it's usually me\n\n- You know this moment when you're in the center of a city at morning preferably and everyone's rushing somewhere, usually work or they have something urgent to do, and there's a lot of noise, and e n e r g y and you're in the middle of it- I love this feeling and moments like that. Also I feel great when I know I did a lot of things, but it's not often cause I'm so lazy. I can lay in the bed all day sometimes and search through Internet but at the end of the day I feel bad cause it feels like I've done nothing to improve my life or myself or anything. \n\nSo what do you think?\n\nEDIT So how I've been suggested I'll put here how I behave during stress. For example, I've been stressed before survey cause when there's something wrong I tend to panic and think it's deathly disease or sth ( which in most cases is nothing serious.. last one was flu, but nevermind..) but I become withdrawn, usually I don't want interact with people then ( because I can't really focus on entertaining them and thinking things through in the same time) and I prefer to be left alone to work this out on my own in my mind ( Chaos outside is okay, but I really do crave harmony and peace inside of me, I like to have everything clear and figured out, so there would be no thought that haven't been 'categorized'). I situation like that when I will be tired overthinking I'll probably try to occupy my mind with something else, movie, tv show, book, anything, 'cause I want to try to relax a little bit ( but soemtimes it's not possible) or I try to go to sleep cause I can ignore everything then.\n
9	Id say ENTP\n
3	I really don't like typing people this way, based mostly on a smattering of random facts, but I think you're more ENTJ than you are ENTP. People can have a different opinion and that's fine, but reading what you gave me, I see a lot of Fi and Ni, and probably Se. Could also make you a case for Te, but not enough information here. \n\nAsk yourself why you're deeply compassionate with disadvantaged animals one on one, why strangers lean on you for help, and why you need "harmony and inner peace" inside you. Your method of processing emotion seems to value empathy and one on one bonding more than "what is best for the group" or "how can I put on a good face for who I'm with". Adjusting your speech so as not to obviously offend someone is a sign of maturity, not always Fe. I'd need more information but these points struck me. \n\nI also categorize a lot of  your statements as strongly suggestive of Ni. Investing in others when you see a long term future + you deeply care about them is very Ni-Fi (and generally an -NTJ quality). The way you categorize your thoughts and emotions, coupled with how you process sensory information (you like it in "blasts") does not sound at all like inferior Si. Ni is concerned with knowing deeply, including oneself. You obviously have a strong conception of who you are, what you want, and what you want to become, and can see those traits in others. Ne can do this too, but cares more about what they could do, or who they could be, rather than "I am X person, and how can I be X better". You also put a high premium on unstated but silently-understood communication, which is very correlated with Ni.\n\nCould keep going but by this point I think you either agree or you don't. Take my opinion for what it's worth to you but I'd say ENTJ. Or at least, not ENTP.\n\nEdit: And just to throw more gas on the fire that is my unpopular opinion, my first impression was INTJ. Fwiw. 
2	IMO, ENTP, based on my recent experience. INTP maybe, too.\n\nI was wondering, ENTJ or ENTP, too. My tests put me almost in the middle with only a slight bias towards ENTJ. The answers and descriptions for both ENTJ and ENTP sound like me or ways I can think. I consulted reddit to see.\n\nGo ahead and read the ENTJ and ENTP subreddits.\n\nMany posts here have me nodding my head, or when I disagree, I can at least see how they got to their conclusion. They're direct, to the point, little rambling, and no pulling in of unnecessary information.\n\nWhen I read the ENTP subreddit? JFC. It was infuriating. Constant rambling, tons of unnecessary shit. They include a lot of extraneous details, with no detail making the "close" or concluding the point, often not even being linked back up to the point.\n\nYour post reminded me of a lot of the ENTP posts.\n\n>I can be pretty blunt sometimes ... but If I see that it may seriously worry someone, then I try to smooth it\n\nSo are you blunt or are you not? You're not making a "close" here. You're leaving open possibilities. That's straight up P over J. An ENTJ will be blunt, even if he does understand he has to communicate his bluntness in a way the other person will be receptive to. However, he's not trying to "smooth it over," the change in behavior is entirely objective-based, the motivation is pursuing the goal, not worrying about worrying them.\n\n> I identify as ambivert\n\nENTP. You're reluctant to make a judgement here, again. An ENTJ might acknowledge that not everyone is always introverted or extroverted, but he's happy to say, "for functional purposes, I *am* an extrovert, and this is why."\n\nAnd a lot of your shit, you just ramble on without any attempt to relate it to how you're an ENTJ or ENTP. It's just there for "lol maybe it's both, you decide!" There isn't clear motivation for why you brought some of these up. Wtf does extreme sports have to do with anything? How does it demonstrate you're one or the other? It's just rambling.\n\nI've gotta go to work. These should be sufficient for demonstrating you're not an ENTJ.
3	>I'm lazy and I procrastinate a lot
1	I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:\n\n- [/r/mbti] [ENTP or ENTJ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/852ssj/entp_or_entj/)\n\n&nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))*
1	I would guess you're ENTP based on the information you've given. 
1	I was stuck in the same situation as you. You're actually an ENTP. ENTJs barely show compassion towards other people which ENTPs are able to compensate for.\n
1	You are an NT, alright. Let's go through them one by one:\n\n1. More likely an ENTP. There was nothing about efficiency or goals in that sentence.\n2. Can be either. ENTPs do not always care about other's feelings but they are generally better at pretending to be human when they care.\n3. Could be either. More likely ENTJ than ENTP, but if you think you are smarter than the average, why bother.\n4. Ambivert - could be either. If you are an NT and an ambivert, you are unlikely to be an INTx. Ok, this does not really help.\n5. Starting projects and then losing excitement - definitely an xNTP.\n6. Extreme sports - does not apply. Probably means you have high testosterone.\n7. Riddles - most likely an NTP, possibly an INTJ and least likely an ENTJ - not pragmatic.\n8. sarcastic and does not care - NT. ENTPs tend to be decent communicators though. Maybe you are stronger with technical IQ than verbal IQ.\n9. Most people like animals; does not say much.\n10. Politeness - more of a P than a J trait.\n11. Future oriented - an NT trait in general, though NTPs are less likely to plan far ahead than NTJs, so this one is a point toward ENTJ. That said, ENTPs are perfectly capable of planning. Also, if you spend a lot of time thinking and little time planning, then you are not likely to be an ENTJ. ENTJs have got to move, even if the plan is imperfect.\n12. Rationalizing feelings - ENTJs are less likely to make excuses. Could be just a woman thing :)\n13. Not acting on what won't work - just a mature NT behavior.\n14. Lazy and procrastinate - 100% ENTP.\n15. Talking to strangers. ENTJs are not afraid to talk to people but they probably hate asking people for favors and would rather "negotiate from the position of power" so to speak. I think ENTPs are more flexible with people, but women tend to be particularly good at communicating and "relationships", even ones that only last 10 minutes.\n16. Last one - ENTJs do not necessarily avoid crowds, but they tend to be preoccupied with things that they have to do. Unless on vacation, if surrounded by people who are doing stuff, ENTJs will probably also feel like they have to do something. Also, this sort of situation could energize more than one type. As for being lazy - again most certainly not an ENTJ.\n\n\nAdditional question: do you enjoy trolling people?\n
1	[deleted]
0	THIS EITHER THIS? How about none?\n\nMost of people are in middle of normal distribution. ENTP and ENTJ are some kind of extremes. It's more likely to be ENTx then one of those two. It's most likely to be xxxx. \n\nI discovered it when i also tried to figure out whether am i ENTP or ENTJ. Answer is... xNTx...\n\nBig five model is more precise. \n\n\n
8	ENTJ what are you doing today to improve yourself?	
11	I worked out this morning, I'm about to play strategy games and practice coding, and I'm going to dancing lessons tonight. I try to engage myself physically, mentally, and socially almost every day.
7	Reading.
3	Going to play 2-3 hours of tennis after work, work on packaging/design for my online store after for 2-3 hours, watch 3 recordings from a conference I have a virtual ticket to, help a friend with an email sequence strategy & revising FB Ads for a wellness client we’ve been working on together (~1 hr), then game for 2 hours with friends because fun. \n\nSo a good mix of creativity, problem solving, and lots of getting shit done
3	Hit a couple PRs in the gym today on flat bench and weighted dips. Went home and walked my dog for an hour as "cardio" (hate treadmills). Outlined around 3 chapters of notes, re-organized them in a shared outline. Cooked 4 days worth of meals. Have spent the rest of the day watching basketball, which I also consider improvement since I never sit down anymore. 
2	I have a date tonight. Just getting myself out there and experiencing the world. I graduate this year, so I plan to move overseas and pursue my career there. \n\nToday though, a date with a cool chick, went for a swim, had drinks with some good friends and finished an assignment. :) really great day. Exercise really helps with mental well-beings and improvement. 
1	I spent 3 hour reading and watching about psychology and done notes, writed dairy, talked with friend to talk about what i figured out. 
1	Nothing.
1	I am studying how to master a relationship with an ENFJ because all of my friends are INTJ and ENTP.\n\nAlso, since I'm a writer, I'm writing an article about it. Gotta maximize productivity.
1	1) Workout after work\n2) Work on my business after my day-job\n3) Invest in my network (chat with some friends)
1	I'm trying to learn how to understand and permit growth within my Si blindspot, so far I'm coming up short on reference material... I think I'll have to blaze a trail and watch interviews of Si dominant people to see how they portrait that so as to make it a thing I can tangibly dissect and ingest.\n
1	I decided to take a shower tomorrow.
22	anyone enjoy organizing?	I spend a lot of time organizing my stuff and I really enjoy it. It is super meditative for me and is really nice to see progress in organizing and contstantly trying to improve. \n\nAnyone else?
8	Oh yes. I love to plan to organize and also do enjoy implementing said plan. \n\nA clutter free space is a clutter free mind. 
3	No, hate hate hate it. So many other important and productive things I could do instead ... Since I am so messy by nature (and it hurts me), one day I might kick myself in the ass and overdo it get super organized, border-line OCD.\n\nWell, maybe ... \n
3	My amazon order history would make it appear like I do. Sometimes I get in the mood to improve or just rearrange things. It feels good to let your thoughts wander and just be in the moment at the same time you’re moving forward. I also like change and fresh starts, however minor. \n\nOften though, I just want the final result without having to worry about the process. I can control clutter most of the time, but I don’t really enjoy chores and maintenance work much at all. The ESFJs I know have an easier time with it than I do. I’d rather just pay someone to do it. 
2	Honestly having things organised and in their place is just so satisfying. The only thing that can compete imo is the *process* of organising which I too, find meditative
1	Of course! 
1	i do like to organize, but also it tends to make me really anxious. cleaning is fine, but i tend to get way too gung ho about everything i do and i'd get overwhelmed by it not being perfect. i do plan on being a LOT more organized when i move out and live on my own, but living with other people is a losing battle.
1	That feeling when absolutely everything has its own place and it’s at said place at the same exact time.
1	Just got out of a terrible mood by cleaning my room. I totally relate, OP.
1	I like to organize people into massive political forces to menace my opposition
1	Oh god yeah. I love it. I feel so COMPLETE after I organise stuff. \n\nPersonal favourites:\n-	Uni notes. \n-	Wardrobe. (Colours)
1	Pegboard is my life.  
1	Yes, I learned interior redecorating in order to maximize my efficiency and efficacy when I do organize. One of our sarcastic functions makes us love ordered visual aesthetic.
1	Deep cleaning is my idea of a fun Friday afternoon activity
1	Can you do a long distance relationship?	Maybe I’m the only one who can.\n\nI don’t have a problem with a long distance if both sides are communicating and wanting to put in effort. But it just seems with my luck, I keep getting losers who don’t have the grit for a relationship.\n\nFirst was an isfp who ended up breaking up with me as soon as I got back into town, and it turns out he was cheating on me. \n\nSecond (presently) is an enfj who completely shut off his communication with me this past week. I can tell he has no more hope in the relationship (but I’ve only been gone 3 weeks). He’ll still get my letter in the mail soon though 😉\n\nThis enfj told me that we all have “physical needs” and he doesn’t know how to stay committed sexually while I’m away. I’ve never understood this! I have never felt the need to go sleep around just to satisfy an urge when I can just satisfy myself with my own hand. It isn’t worth it to me to use someone only for sex, and I’ve never understood it- it comes quickly to an end. To me, it doesn’t honor a genuine relationship. So why do other people feel the need to sleep around over and over again to fruitlessly have other people satisfy them sexually??\n\nHave you ever had a successful long distance relationship or are we ENTJs the only rationals who possess the ability? 
6	Hey! I’m an ENTJ female who’s been with my INTJ boyfriend for a year and a half now. Only four months of that was spent together, and we’ve seen each other three times since. I see him again in 6 days for the first time in 8 months!\n\nI think maybe it works because we’re very similar and focused, and both very collected and loyal. Maybe you need a type more similar to yourself? Of course it’s been hard at times as it will be with any LDR, but being so similar means we don’t have to have these tiring long conversations about feelings and shit because it can stay unspoken but understood.\n\nHowever, it can be hard to be with someone like an I/ENTJ over distance because obviously we aren’t super expressive, and without physical actions affection tends to take the backseat. \n\nFeel free to message me for advice! My boyfriend and I are US/UK so quite the distance, so I have some experience with it.\n\nedit: Just reading your part about sex and commitment, have also never had this issue. In fact, it’s quite the opposite with us. He’s quite insecure and I’m the opposite, so he sometimes frets that he can’t please me, but I’ve never for a second thought about anyone else and neither has he. Maybe it’s an NTJ thing? We invest long term.
3	ENTJ's are smitten by the mind, so it could work well. Eventually you'll want much more closer contact. 
3	I don't see a reason why -NTJs couldn't work out a LDR. I actually can think of many reasons why these types would be the least likely to cheat, but I don't think that's necessary here. Aside from extraordinary circumstances, cheating is just wrong. I become attracted to people for many reasons: strong intellect, charisma, if they feel like a worthwhile long term investment, and yes, obviously for physical needs as well. But I wouldn't rate that as any higher than their other qualities; it's a package deal. I certainly wouldn't call it a license to cheat, which leads me to the following:\n\n> This enfj told me that we all have “physical needs”... blah blah blah\n\nIf someone wants to cheat, you shouldn't spend time thinking about the rationale they gave you for doing so. People cheat because they want to. Some are immature, some are spiteful, and almost all don't know how it feels to be on the receiving end. But again, don't think too hard about which one it is with this guy. Him thinking about it is as good as saying "this has, is, or will happen eventually". But you personally wouldn't cheat, and you don't want to date someone who can't understand why that's hurtful and wrong. It sounds like this person has a different set of values than you do, and I don't know how you have reconciled them to this point, but I'd think critically about this. \n\nI am personally very against the idea that being separate from your partner leads to cheating. I see it as a very flimsy excuse that people use when they don't want to be honest with themselves. I never cheated even in past relationships where I was on the receiving end of it, and if I did, I certainly wouldn't pretend I did it because I "had to", or whatever "needs" this guy is trying to sell you. 
3	Hi, INFJ here who's been with ENTJ boyfriend for over five years, most of which has been long distance. It works first and foremost because our core values are the same; and that our value of harmony/balance of a relationship is high up on the list. Also, if either of us didn't put the work into the relationship, it would have crumbled years ago. I don't think much of it has to do with actual personality type as it does with a similar hierarchy of personal values.\n\nBeing with each other physically is as easy as breathing; maintaining the relationship over a distance takes compromise and grit. What helps is eliminating the distance every so often, and continuously setting up visitations and goals. Not everyone is capable/suited/willing to hold a long term relationship, and fewer can hold a longer term long distance relationship. Shit's hard.
2	*Update*\n\nHe broke up with me over a snapchat yesterday. Telling me that sometimes when you love someone, you have to let them go. Referring to himself letting me go. But I didn't want to be let go. I wanted us to stay together. So what he says makes no sense.\n\nSince he wanted the freedom of an open relationship, it seems to me like he just wants to go fuck around to fulfill his "physical needs". So no, he doesn't actually love me. If he did, he wouldn't have felt the need to stray or to then "let me go".\n\nHis birthday gift and love letter are still in the mail though, so he'll get them soon enough. Only after he opens and attempts to reach out to me will he realize he will never be able to contact me again, since he is blocked on everything. It will serve as a good memento for his loss.
1	I could do a LDR if the intent of both parties was to progress to a SDR (short distance relationship).
1	Thanks for your reply and sharing your experience. One of the reasons he gave for the breakup was that he couldn’t be with me physically. And I agree with you that physical affection really is just the easy part. The rest takes work. So I think when he decided to end things, it was just because he wanted an easy relationship. But that kind of thing doesn’t last. A substantive relationship has a deep amount of investment and both parties are willing to give that freely, no matter what, as you have.
1	Is this a same sex relationship? You keep saying "he" and you have the male symbol on your flair... \n\nSorry... just wondering...
1	Interesting, I'm sorta in a long distance with an ENTJ, but I think i'm more capable of this long distance sexually (isfp here) than he is, i'm not as sexually driven as him. but he puts a lot of effort on trying to visit, and plans things moreso than I. It somehow has been working so far.
-1	>I don’t have a problem with a long distance if both sides are communicating and wanting to put in effort. But it just seems with my luck, I keep getting losers who don’t have the grit for a relationship.\n\nYou get this means you can't do a long distance relationship? I can start a Grammy Award winning band, but I keep getting loser band mates who don't have the grit for a band. Blaming other people doesn't actually give us skills...except for a skill for whining.\n\nI have had a long distance relationship, at least to some degree.
6	How comfortable are you generally with physical contact?	Just a quick question in terms of physical touch. I'll give some context.\n\nI've got two ENTJ friends now- I started this year with one already, and I've picked up another on the way. For the record, I think you guys are awesome. You all seem to have amazing senses of humour, and you're warmer than people give you credit for- you know, deep down. You're remarkably focused, you're smart and creative, and the ENFP/ENTJ business partnership is a new discovery for me- it turns out we work rather well together. \n\nThe first ENTJ is female, we work together, we're amazingly creative when we're working together, and over the course of time we've become really good friends. We hang out frequently outside work, she initiates a lot of our hang outs, which, from what I can gather, is a good thing with your type. She hasn't been very into physical contact, which is fine, weirdly for an ENFP I don't love physical contact- I'll do it, if someone initiates it, but I won't initiate it myself. She sometimes grabs my arm to stop me from like, walking into moving traffic without noticing, and she's patted me on the shoulder a few times in an encouraging sort of way, but it's very brief. \n\nThe second ENTJ is male- definite ENTJ, we've discussed MBTI- and is far more physical. He wasn't when we first met. He was actually oddly formal and ended up shaking my hand which was strange but sweet. \nWe know each other through class but we've started hanging out a little outside. He's got into the habit of grabbing my arm and holding on when he's laughing at something I've said. I don't mind so much. If we're standing, walking, and I say something funny, he'll stop and just grab my arm as if he needs the support while he's laughing or something- we get quite into our conversations so it's fine. \n\nHe's also in the habit of putting a hand on my knee if we're sitting down, in similar situations. He's recently started going in for a hug when we meet and later when we go our separate ways. Female ENTJ has commented on how it's not something she would do- as a group we're interested in MTBI and talk about it a lot. \n\nSo I was wondering if this is typical behaviour for some of you, and why might it be? Is it atypical behaviour for some of you? Is it different with female ENTJs and male ENTJs? How comfortable are you usually with physical contact, and do you tend to initiate it?\nThanks! \n\nUPDATE: Yeah, you were all essentially right! 
8	Guys don't typically touch your knee if they're not interested. Breaking the touch barrier _like that_ is typically a clear indication that he's into you!\n\nThat being said, physical touch is one of my love languages. I dole out hugs like there's no tomorrow. But anything below the belt is not one of those friendly touches
6	Male ENTJ here... Te/Ni/Se/Fi SCOEI LIE Gamma Quadrant. Just a quick intro of what I am and what I am about.\n\nTo answer a few of your questions, I am personally not touchy with people. It is a respect type of thing for me. I view touching as a sign of intimidation or a sign of full trust. With people I work with or with people I barely know, the only touch they would get from me are handshakes at most. If it gets to the point where rapport is built, touching can resonate into different things (fist bumps or hugs, etc). \n\nIf your ENTJ male friend is very touchy with you, he may like you. Just sayin'. 
5	Physical contact is emotional engineering.
4	Hey! ENTJ female here. I can’t speak for the rest of us, but I personally hate physical contact and reserve it for my closest closest relationships. I love physical contact when it’s my boyfriend, and I like to be touching him as often as possible, I guess because it’s a nice way to feel connected without being overly emotional (he’s an INTJ and doesn’t like being overwhelmed or touched much either). \n\nOtherwise, I get unreasonably irritated at being touched by strangers, but if it’s well intentioned- like I was on a professional leadership skills programme over the weekend and I was very ill and a couple acquaintances kept stroking my arm or patting my back to make sure I was okay, which I understood and appreciated.\n\nGenerally, I don’t like being touched unless I initiate it. I don’t really hug family because it makes me uncomfortable, and I don’t like people being too close to me or crowding me. I’m fine with contact with my boyfriend like I said, but get angry and frustrated if someone is too close to me and I didn’t initiate it/am not sick or something.
3	Two of my friends who are dating and are entj don't do PDA. Also no platonic hugs or nothing. I on the other hand love handshakes, hugs, highfives, etc. \n\nBut thats dependent on your love languages. Now, this seems an awful lot like the dude is attracted to you. It may be his love language is physical contact but I am almost certain he is into you. 
3	I am not cool with being touched 
5	This is bullshit. You are supposed to be into INTJs.\n
2	Male ENTJ here,\n\nI personally really dislike people touching me unless it is my SO. I am pretty sure it isn't an ENTJ thing but it is just me.
2	No physical contact. It crosses a boundary. Yeah, I’ll give a hug if it looks like you need one. But yeah I don’t even really bro shake my friends or anything. I know some of them want/need a physical greeting, but it makes me uncomfortable to award someone else with a level of intimacy with me. So I’ll wave instead.
2	i don't particularly like being touched, but i am touchy feely with certain people. i like hugs, high fives, fist bumps, etc. but that's really about it. depends on the person, though. i don't casually touch people, though. hugs? sure. just casually brushing someone? no.\n\n\ni'm probably a lot more touchy feely with other females, though. i'd say i don't particularly mind people touching me as long as we've known each other for awhile and it's not OFTEN. hugs are pretty great, though. big fan. as long as i don't actively dislike someone i really don't care that much as long as it's not 24/7 and they're all over me. (if someone puts their hand on my shoulder or something a lot, though, that freaks me out. are you into me??? please stop.)
2	ENTJ here. I usually don't go out of my way with pda or touching friends, it's more about being formal and respectful. However with SO's I'm really touchy feely and it's more about maintaining a bond.\n\nLike everyone said, that guy's into you and making it really obvious to you.
1	Yeah I'm not big on physical touch which for current and past relationships has been a bit of an issue.
1	All this just for confirmation that he's attracted to you? He is, and I'll further suggest that you keep the unneeded subtlety to a minimum if you want a fulfilling relationship with an ENTJ. I could see the correlation between physical contact and extroverts, but otherwise, this isn't type related. Other than etiquette (handshakes, etc), it's certainly not something I pay attention to.\n
1	1. are you male for female?\n2. am I supposed to know what MBTI means haha feel left out here 
9	Are there any unaccomplished ENTJs?	Most ENTJ descriptions characterize a person of that type as successful, talented and charismatic. I can honestly say that I do not live up to those standards, even though I'm trying to resolve the situation. I would say that my cognitive functions align with ENTJ ones, but would it be possible to be one despite lacking achievements?
15	Fellow fuck-up here.\n\nI realized my expectation/perfectionism was WAY out of line with my ability.\n\nShit changed.\n\nI quit crying in my corner. Quit isolating myself. I set small/reasonable/achievable goals that were steps on that monster goal that lived in my head and debilitated me.\n\nWe’re goal driven. It all starts with your goal choice.\n\nThen it’s the perfectionism. Nothings perfect. I fuck up. Life is failure. Growth is failure. \n\nBeing tough mentally is an art and takes practice. I have to feed myself dumb motivational Youtube videos every morning. But whatever feeds me and keeps me getting back up.\n\nAnd when ENTJ’s discover that natural ability, holy SHIT, it grows quick.\n\nSet your sights right and let yourself grow and you’ll start kicking ass. \n\nENTJ. There’s a monster in you. You’re a badass. Destroy your enemies. Conquer demons. Build up others. Crush all obstacles. Run raw. Be you.
27	YO MAMMA OOOOOOOO!!! (Now downvote me)\n\nBut no. A certain personality type != success. Everybody is unsuccessful before they are successful, so maybe you just haven’t had your success yet. 
7	i’m an entj and i’ve been unemployed for 5 years and spend my days lying in bed applying to jobs that never call me. so yes. 
7	I've accomplished nothing in my life. I've never had a gf for more than a few months despite being (so I'm told) very handsome. I made it through college by the skin of my teeth. I'm not good at having fun. I don't like people. I hate myself. I'm terribly socially inept. I get overexcited and sabotage every opportunity presented to me. Every. Single. One.\n\nI currently have no friends, no career, no girl. I am 100% convinced that even if I did luck out and get one... it would only be a matter of time till I screw it up and hate myself even more.\n\nI was once a follower of you-know-who but now with my spectacular list of spectacular failures and shameful moral shortfalls, I'm convinced He hates me too. I give up.\n\nI've been unemployed for a month and spend my time trying not to think of what a fucking asshole I am while drinking, smoking weed and cigarettes, barely eating (hey at least I'm losing weight) and praying that I'll just come down with cancer.\n\nI just don't care anymore. Funny thing to realize now: I'm honestly not sure I ever really did. I curse the day I was born. I'm 37 and giving up on life. I'm going to bed now.\n\nTL;DR: $%*&
1	Yes
2	[think of it this way](https://vlipsy.com/vlip/the-good-place-i-was-pre-successful-joAn8qXo)
1	Sure, just like I'm pretty sure there's some unaccomplished xxTJs.
-3	Donald Trump\n\nAlso, Napoleon was a sore loser\n
13	How do you cope with loneliness?	I like being alone most of the time, but sometimes i crave for someone i can talk to unfortunately i havent social skills and dont make friends easily.
14	So get the social skills. Not really very difficult for basic friendships.
5	My two cents on it is that you really need to be yourself and let the chips fall where they may. Otherwise you'll just be attracting people, not friends. I know you took a jab at yourself about your social skills, but in fairness to you, simply having more connections isn't always the answer. The level of honesty, depth and overlapping goals/values you share with one person is way more valuable than having 5-6 "ehh" acquaintances. I have more "friends" now than I ever did, but almost none are close. Even though I could pick up the phone and make plans at any time with at least dozen people, what is the point? Same shit every time, just on different days. Sure feels like loneliness to me. \n\nMy healthy way of "coping" is to put myself in situations to meet new people, since the people I'm surrounded by obviously aren't a match. I get involved in as much as I physically can, and when I do, I act like myself and let people make their own judgments. That's the most you can do. No point in talking about the unhealthy mechanisms. 
3	I try to always keep learning something or keep my mind occupied with a non-meaningless task that requires alot of brain power.\n\nI play chess and there's so much thinking involved that I tend to forget about being lonely. 
3	Reach out\n\n
3	OP, why don't you think you have the social skills? What happens when you try to talk to people? You may private message me if you want to talk to someone.
3	Technically, you're using social skill right now, by what motivated you to ask this here in reddit, the only difference in real life, is that you have face to face -vs- computer text to computer text. Hope this helps & good luck.
2	Find a hobby and meet some similarly minded people. It's hard when you're not used to socializing. Bite the bullet!
1	As an ENFP with an ENTJ friend who also doesn't have many friends, I'd recommend to stop trying to "fix" those around you. Not everyone has the same values, goals, opinions, and skills as you do, and not everyone aspires to be like you. If you want people to stick around, learn to let them be and accept them for who they are, even if you don't agree with how they go about things. 
2	ENTJs, what are your thoughts on INFPs? Do you get along with them?	My husband is an ENTJ and I’m an INFP. I’ve never really heard of that combination before on any forums, but we get along perfectly because we sort of balance each other out, and I’m just wondering about others’ experiences.
3	I believe there are a few posts about this type pairing in this sub, since I recall commenting on it a few times. They might be useful to you if you can find them. \n\nPersonally, I view INFPs more positively than not, and I tend to have great conversations with them if we have overlapping hobbies or interests. I do sometimes get (rightfully) criticized for being too intense, but never when I'm around my INFP friends. Being around INFPs can feel like a nice balance for me, since I'm more apt to talk about ideas I haven't fully developed yet or more personal topics that I just need someone to listen to. 
2	I like some of them, dislike others. Some are fun sometimes, but not other times.
2	Mature ones are good as friends. I like their laid-back and accepting demeanor, though I think I would look for a bit more J in a serious relationship. 
1	It's pretty common for a lot of people to view ideal relationship pairings as having no letters in common except the S or N and I do see people talk about the INFP-ENTJ pairing, just not as much as say the INFJ-ENTP pairing.
1	People, regardless of personality type, can be great depending on their ability to have mutual respect and a good perspective. I can't think of a personality type that is an absolute no for me. One of my close friends in high school was an INFP. 
1	I grew up with an INFP. (I'm an ENTJ)\n\nWe would often fight, but as we've grown up and rounded out things got a lot better.\n\nAlthough he can still rub me the wrong way at times.
7	Fi & Fe	Do yourself a favor and develop your Fe and Fi. This will actually improve your analytical, debating, psychoanalytical, communication, and logic & reasoning skills. I know it sounds weird, but all you're doing by trying to be as logical and objective as possible is decreasing your awareness of and repressing unavoidable factors. To be as logical and objective as possible, you'd have to remove neurochemicals, and if you did that, you'd have no motivation, desire, care, etc. It'd be self-defeating. You'd pretty much be a walking lobotomy if not worse.\n\nPlus, Fi and Fe can do some seemingly superhuman things. Did you know monks who are able to punch with the force of a mid-sized car going 20 miles an hour are actually using their Fi as a driving force behind their Te to do this?\n\nAlso, if you don't develop your Fe, you kind of turn out like Azula from ATLA. Lonely, disconnected, isolated, and eventually insane.\n\nUsing Fe and Fi do not make you weaker. Using them doesn't make you sensitive. It makes you more self-aware and more aware of others.\n\nI think Jean Grey from X-Men is a good representation of this. Initially, she has trouble using her powers, so it's kind of like her Fe is uncontrolled. She hears everyone's thoughts, emotions, and pain and doesn't know how to regulate this. Imagine hearing a clusterfuck of noises. It's like that but much worse like hearing several people repeatedly be stabbed, crying for help over and over again except more intense.
13	This *feels* like such a scam.

2	> Did you know monks who are able to punch with the force of a mid-sized car going 20 miles an hour are actually using their Fi as a driving force behind their Te to do this?\n\nI highly doubt that's physically possible. Maybe in terms of pressure, force/surface, but not just force.\n\nBut futhermore good post. Every function has it's merits. Any practical suggestions on how to improve?
2	I used to have a pretty well developed Fe until I sabotaged myself and underdeveloped it because it was hindering me. I have excellent communication, socialise extremely well, I just struggle with maintaining friendships unless the person comes to me first. I spend so much time focussing on those closest to me that I neglect those that have the potential to become closer to me. The worst part about this is that I just don't care enough to do something about it. I'm happy with a quiet life so this isn't something I think twice about.
1	I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:\n\n- [/r/estj] [Fi & Fe](https://www.reddit.com/r/ESTJ/comments/83x514/fi_fe/)\n\n&nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))*
1	azula was hot, though, so i don't know. 
1	Nah, its useless to try to be something you're not. It comes across as cringy and unauthentic.\n\nIf you want to use Fi or Fe, let a friend do it for you. That's what they're for.
1	>Did you know monks who are able to punch with the force of a mid-sized car going 20 miles an hour   \n\nI thought this was pretty bad but then you started talking about cartoons.

29	Bernie Sanders Bumper Sticker	This is a reminder for some of you that sometimes people will frustrate you. Sometimes people will attack decisions that you made a long time ago that you don't particularly care for one way or the other. It will make you angry and petty. And you'll be tempted to give in to your pettiness. Sometimes it is good to be thoughtfully petty.\n\nThis is also a reminder for some others that kindly worded requests can often get you better results than harsh words and direct action. \n\nNet neutrality may be dead, but hindsight is 2020.
25	> kindly worded bernie sanders sticker\n\nThis is a crappy sticker. Too many words, so the font ought to be far too small. Also, it says almost nothing about Bernie except for one pretty clever pun. It is bad enough that most people are not going to read your sticker, but now 95% of those who do will not understand it. Not the best strategy.\n\nAlso, why would you want to live under socialism. Don't you remember what happened the last 17 times kulaks were sent to Gulags for greater good?\n\nWell, this movie is playing in South Africa all over again now.\n\n
14	You should be mod of this subreddit.
12	My thoughts gravitate towards visualizing his 4 grand estates whilst claiming to be an advocate for the poor. 
4	ENTJ sub for Bernie Sanders? ;)
7	Net neutrality is dead, my ISP increased my Internet speed by 100mbit this month.
5	There's a great word in the dictionary called "tactful."
2	Kindly worded requests are my forte.
3	Does this entj like me?	He's been ignoring me nonstop. Like literally we'd see eachother in the halls and he'd look directly at me and look away. I remember once when we were walking towards eachother we both stared into eachother eyes and he STILL didn't say anything to me. And it's really weird because he used to be so nice to me. \n\nThe first couple of times we met he seemed to be really interested in me and he asked me a ton of questions about myself. He even asked if I considered myself ambitious. Then all of a sudden he started ghosting me. I tried following him on instagram but he ignored my request.\n\nBut the other day he was nice to me again but I figured that was cuz he was in such a good mood  (he was being nice to everyone, upbeat and asking ercyone a bunch of questions about themselves). \n\nI really can't tell if he completely hates me, or is neutral towards me, or straight hates me. \n\nI'm an 'infp' if it helps 
13	**It sounds like he has lost interest in you.** But that could be for many reasons. If you weren't receptive to his advances, for example, he could have decided you weren't into him and dialed back on his interest. In that case, if you like him, you should probably make your interest clear. If he's still into you, he'll start showing interest again. Or he could be busy and realize he's not looking for a relationship. Or he's found someone else. Or maybe you betrayed his trust or did something that made him realize you weren't the right person for him.\n\nIf you're not interested in asking him straight up, try initiating a bit more (if you're interested in a friendship or something more) and see how he responds. 
8	The people I treat like this I do not like. People I like I seek out, interact with, etc.\n\nI don't hate them - I just don't want to waste time on them.\n\nI'm an ENTJ just in case that isn't clear.\n\nIf I were to hate someone I would actively work to remove them from whatever context they were in that overlapped with me.
8	I would do some of this but not the ignoring the instagram follow. I would follow back a crush for sure. When I see my crush I do a lot of eye contact and hang around close to her when I can. 
7	Maybe at some critical points in your conversations with him, you didn't show genuine interest/reacted badly to what was being discussed hence he probably ruled you out as his kind of person OR...you betrayed his loyalty in some way eg. sharing his intimate thoughts with other people OR you tried to manipulate him in some way. \nA few I can think of.
5	[deleted]
3	A similar thing happened with an obvious entj I know as well. Ignoring  me as I walked past with an angry look, yet show signs of interest in other ways from afar! \n\nNote: I am an infp as well- sometimes we come across as aloof, even to TJs.\n\nI daresay entjs here will tell you to be direct with him, and/or stop trying to figure him out. \n\nMy advice with any guy is to lean back, let him live his life, don't try to force anything, keep yourself happy and date others. Entjs like directness, but you can't make them like you, and initiating with them doesn't change anything. Do you actually like him or you just trying to figure out how he feels? the latter really, is his own job. It's up to him to figure out if he likes you. I am a major SX so I can't help but enjoy the passion and games, but honestly, the truth is that you will be better taking your mind off him and focus on other connections. 
3	Maybe he's got something, or someone, on his mind. I had a recent break up, and while I see women I find attractive, pursuing one isn't something I'm remotely interested in right now. I might flirt a little, but nothing more, just yet.
3	You have to win over an ENTJ. They have ridiculously high standards for themselves and who they choose to date. They will sometimes shrug off advances if the person doesn't 'meet' their criteria. However if you can win them over, then they'll put in 200% to make you happy. Try to get to them through their mind, through engaging conversations. If you struggle to contribute have them do the talking that may help you have more material to contribute to. 
2	Uh age of said people?
2	Just ask him. We're pretty direct people. 
2	Just from the post "Does this entj like me?" I feel pretty confident in saying "probably not" because if I'm correct in my analysis, an Entj will make it clear they are interested, so much so, that one would never be asking that question in the first place. Based on that and the post, the answer is no.
2	>I remember once when we were walking towards eachother we both stared into eachother eyes and he STILL didn't say anything to me.   \n\nSounds like you didn't say anything either so... not sure what to make of this.   \n\n>I really can't tell if he completely hates me   \n\nWhy would he? Is there an elephant in the room that you thought about while posting this, but wouldn't include (too personal or whatever)? Did something happen that could have hurt him? Example: Did he ask you out and you turned him down?   \n\n>I tried following him on instagram but he ignored my request.   \n\nYou are casual acquaintances irl, yet he would ignore your request on some social media website?? And there's no weird history between you?? That part especially doesn't add up. If he was just acting cold and distant but maintained the facade of everything being normal then I'd give you some shrugging-equivalent response like "he lost interest", like some others have. But ignoring that instagram request (assuming he actively uses that site) (I'm having trouble picturing an ENTJ man using instagram tbh) is off. It's at least passive aggressive if not an overt sign of hostility. I would never even consider declining a friend request online from a person I know irl. He definitely has some problem with you and either you're holding back some part of the story or there's something you don't know about, like something someone told him about you.
2	No he doesn’t like you.  We are the type to go all in and make things happen.  If he’s not putting forth effort then he’s not into you.  
1	The Instagram thing... did you ever share a personal secret of his?\nThat's really the only reason I can think of for ignoring a follow, unless he's stopped using it.\n\n\nAlso, i do the same thing to people I know and like, if I had somewhere to be then I usually just keep walking if I make eye contact, only occasionally nodding or stopping to say hi. There's maybe one dude at my school I'd stop for because he's like a brother, and no one else. So unless he's really into you, he's likely to not stop. And he doesn't. \n\n\nHe probably doesn't like you. \n
9	ENTJ checking in. What's up everybody!	I'm just wondering how my personality type people view on talking about sensitive topics such as religion, political view, abortion, race/racism in public? I feel like we should discuss these topics to solve our societies problems, but we're prohibited to even talk about these in public. I consider myself peaceful anarchist, so these topics are not my biggest concern, but I'm just curious how you all think. \n\n\nEDIT: sorry for the confusion, but I'm asking how you feel about talking about sensitive topics in public. Thanks. 
9	[deleted]
3	>religion  \n\nA good thing, it helps people. I don't want to talk about the tiny minority that uses religion as an excuse for saying and especially doing horrible things. That's not religion.\n\n>political view  \n\nTheoretically a social-liberal, but I despise the political system of my country.\n\n>abortion  \n\nAbsolutely for.\n\n>race/racism in public?  \n\nDon't know what you mean by this one. An impopular opinion I have about this, is that racism is a fear, hence is not rational, and therefore should be treated as such, however bad the behaviour. Openly racist people are just scared of something.
3	[deleted]
3	Wow, I feel like I missed the mark on this question in my earlier responses. I don't discuss my views with others on sensitive issues if I don't think they want a debate. A lot of people like asserting their opinions on things without wanting to actually defend their opinions (out of intellectual laziness or not wanting to offend or push their opinions on others). This personally bothers me a little because I like debating with others in order to clarify my stances on issues. It's also important to realize that there are plenty of people who don't actually base their opinions on facts (though they would never admit it because who wants to think of themselves as irrational???), which can make trying to persuade them that the facts they are using are factually incorrect or not actually relevant and/or conclusions they derive from these facts are inaccurate impossible. A lot of people also see my forceful assertion of my opinions as something to back away from when I'm really looking for somebody to push back a little so I can see things in a different light.\n\nBasically, when I find myself arguing with a less-informed person, I get bored. It's a waste of my time when I start seeing premises as faulty. But when I find myself arguing with a well-informed person who has a different viewpoint, we both appreciate the other's viewpoint without necessarily changing our own. If you have gotten to the point where you know you are well-informed in an issue and have formed an opinion, the addition of new information probably won't change your opinion that much. If it did, then you were never well-informed in the first place. Exception being if one of the people was able to provide a significant amount of information the other didn't even think about, etc. Some people can start with the same information and form different opinions based off of their life experiences or personal beliefs. If opinions differ, it doesn't necessarily mean that one person is wrong. You just accept a difference of opinions and move on. This is why I usually keep my opinions to myself. Expressing them is not necessarily productive.\n\nThe well-informed people with similar viewpoints to me usually become my close friends :p There is nothing more satisfying than having your viewpoint validated!
2	Why risk your career when only like 10% of the population is smart enough to understand what you are even saying and of those only 10% will agree with you?\n\nLet the far left and the far right bash each other's skulls. The country as a whole will remain mostly in the middle and you are but a drop in the ocean.\n\nMeanwhile you can make money and spread your seed.\n
1	Atheist. Pro-choice. Emma Watson type of Feminist. Social liberal, fiscal centrist. Libertarian leaning in the sense I am pro capitalist/free market principles. I value smart regulation, allowing for maximum freedom and competition, as well as transparency/honesty and accountability. Certain markets are too regulated or regulated in the wrong way, others aren’t regulated enough. I do not believe in the freedom to discriminate, which is what American right-wing libertarianism seems to be a lot about. \n\nIn the absence of competition, there's little incentive to produce a quality product or use money wisely. This is true for all monopolies. A government with too much control becomes the ultimate monopoly. Government should protect us, not run us. \n\nSocial conservatism is a gateway to authoritarianism, but so is unrestrained socialism. If it weren’t for capitalism, we’d still be living in caves. That said, I don’t dislike socialists nearly as much as fascists; I have a burning hatred for fascists. \n\nMost religions not only obfuscate the truth, but actively perpetuate lies, diminishing one’s capacity for critical thinking from an early age. Often the best lie is mixed with truth; for example, Abrahamic religions acknowledge that patriarchy exists, but they preach that it is natural and part of God’s divine plan. These institutions (among others) nurture patriarchy. Patriarchy breeds hypermasculine and hyperfeminine gender roles and societal pressures. Hypermasculinity is violent and misogynistic, and cut off from emotion. Women and young girls are sexually objectified. Patriarchy is alive and well throughout the world, to varying degrees.\n\nSo is racism. I’m white so I really can’t comment too much about it other than to say I know a lot of people with casually racist beliefs. White supremacists are pathetic. 
1	I guess I'll add my data to the collection you're getting.\n\nReligion -- I entertain a certain level of spirituality, but I'm very opposed to established religion. I think it runs counter to reason in most people, and even in otherwise very rational people, they rely on it as a crutch for their irrational beliefs. Using it as a social and family institution to bring people together, unite around common values and deter crime is totally fine. I don't think one should base one's personal value system on it -- even if those values are "good". Someone should be able to arrive at the conclusion "hey I probably shouldn't steal from my neighbor" without being told "thou shall not steal from thy neighbor." \n\nPolitical views -- I'm a strong advocate of personal autonomy. I hate labels and reject using them to try and understand people. I *really* hate absolutism, as my positions have some nuance to them 99% of the time. Political parties and their platforms no longer have relevance at a national level in this country, imho, so I don't subscribe to them. \n\nAbortion -- My position on autonomy influences my position that women have a right to their own body. I might have some room to bargain around drawing the line around 20 weeks or whatever, but that's more to suggest my view isn't totally absolute, nothing beyond that. \n\nRacism -- we are in no way living in a post-racial society, and anyone who argues otherwise is willfully ignorant to what racism means. Mostly heard this as a left-leaning talking point after Obama was elected and I couldn't disagree more. Going from overt --> institutional doesn't necessarily mean better. 
1	I believe this is one of the reasons why I posed a question a while ago here in this ENTJ subreddit about what ENTJs think of The Alt-Right. I think ENTJs could talk about anything or could handle pretty much anything. It's not like some of the SJ Guardians out to silence/censor you. Of course, when you're talking about "in public," that's a different story and so I believe I don't really need/have to address that one as that one is pretty obvious.
1	It pisses me off
1	I don't think we *need* to have in-depth debates about controversial topics "in public". Personally, I would welcome it but I also understand that many people really couldn't handle it. I always chuckle at that cliche quote, "you can't handle the truth", and then I pause and think of people who this statement actually applies to.   \n\nSo no, "in public", with your clear name or even your appearance/voice attached to the statements I believe there are so many taboos for a reason and they will always stay in place (albeit not the exact same taboos). However, I am for free speech in the legal sense. I believe there should be no libel laws, no "hate speech" laws, none of that stuff. All of these exceptions end up abused by those in power to silence people with less power. Every time. Laws that limit what you can say are not needed. Common decency would still exist. You could still be fired from your job for offending your boss or being uncomfortable from a PR perspective. Privately owned websites could still censor whatever they like. I just want the *legal* freedom for everyone to say or write whatever they want, whenever they want. Seeing people persecuted legally for things they said or wrote makes me sick. It's a loud and proud declaration that we are moving backwards, we are regressing and this is happening globally. All of the most developed countries are increasing legal limitations on speech and even *journalists* of all people are increasingly marching to this tune in recent decades. Any pretense that we are *not* moving towards a full on 1984 thought police dystopia has been dropped lately. Politicians and journalists are joining ranks and telling "the people" that speech is a privilege they control access to, not a right.
1	Political view: Probably Democratic socialist. I like Bernie Sanders quite a bit, though I think he leans a little on the idealistic side.\n\nAbortion: yes! \n\nRacism: People should constantly be striving to be more aware of their prejudices and bias. Policies should be made so that everybody gets equal opportunity.
1	I think people are too indecisive to really have a singular point on a matter.
1	The sensitive topics are the ones I like discussing most, it's important that people allow themselves to discuss anything, in order to solve problems, first they have to be acknowledged, regardless of how uncomfortable, otherwise nothing changes.\n\nPlus it's a chance to show someone what they may not expect, & they'll believe you're truly open minded, it's one thing to say it, it's another thing to show it.\n\nAs far as religion goes, if we all ditched religion and accepted our own mortality, maybe we'd stop being divided, & actually start doing something about a real chance a immortality, not because of some concept that we don't even have control over, but because of ourselves. The world is the way it is today because of people.
1	I’ll follow the Precedent \n\nPolitics: Republican/Libertarian Hybrid\nAbortions: Against it personally \nRace Relations: It should be discussed in any honest manner. People are so Damn uncomfortable about everything these days \n
0	The social butterfly, good hearted extrovert is an enigma.	You cant write down the mind of the extrovert into a book. Their speech is lost to the sands of time.

4	trying to find the difference between nfjs and ntjs?	hey so during my life iv made both ntjs and nfjs mad.....nfjs tend to lash out at you and hits you in the emotions there sharp words can realy hurt and it stings............ntjs tends to hit you in your will,willpower,there words are extremly sharp to the point you can realy get a fright,.......now this begs the question.its ovious that nfjs are reading emotions.....but when an ntj realy snaps and releases some sharp words were are they attacking and whats going through there minds?
32	xNFJs: "If you don't do this, you're a terrible person."\n\nxNTJs: "If you don't do this, you're a stupid person."\n\nPick your poison.
19	NTJs are into tough love, so if they care about you at all, then they will point out that your writing style sucks and nobody will hire you if you write emails that look like this.\n
10	Idk but as an ENTJ it really takes quite a lot for me to become *actually* angry; usually ppl just think I'm "pissed af" when I'm just actually annoyed. \n\nAs for your question, there are actually a few articles on Google that describes the differences between ENTJ vs ENFJ... we actually differ by quite a bit. It's the ENTJ vs INTJ that is actually confusing. 
8	entj: Not likely trying to manipulate, more likely trying to dominate/intimidate by presenting airtight logic/argument as to ‘our way’ - which we’ve put some thought and effort into already, and which we are going forward with regardless of what anyone thinks. Chances are good it will workout well for you if you follow our lead is what we’re thinking. :) 
3	What an awesome question that im severely overqualified to address. :) As an ENFJ two of my closest friends are ENTJs, one of them is like a blood brother to me and as far as I know both would kill for me. Since we have infirior fi and ti we both have alot of identity issues. We aren't sure if we're as talented or whole hearted as we think we are. The infirior fi scorn is more of a fear of feelings or a disgust of showing them and a disregard for others and a preoccupation with how loyal someone is. Infirior Ti trargets a persons qualities and calculates their shortcomings and exploits them, we have a fear and disgust for incompetence. We both value community and tribe and other people. But we are very impatient. Im a 3w4 and I have lost several friends throughout my life from my outbursts and coldness. It is something that im trying to stop and im not proud of it at all. My friend said it best, "you tend to treat people who are your intillectual infirior poorly." However I dont think im that smart and have alot of problems. But we're both focused on the outer world and we can judge others before self analysis.  The difference is that ENFJs value social rapport and openess. ENTJs value social function and streingth.
3	Have an ENFJ friend, we disagree on about anything, except the fact that we should both agree on something.
32	New interests as an ENTJ	Do any other ENTJs, when finding a new hobby or interest, go balls to the walls about it? I rarely find new hobbies I am interested in, but when I do I get VERY excited and somewhat obsess about them. It becomes sort of consuming for a while. 
25	Go big or go home :)
15	Oh absolutely, this is 100 percent me. My bank account always feels the effects too lol
8	Absolutely, a real interest for me is never just a halfway kind of thing. I'll buy books related to it and devote a lot of time. Right now it's ASL. Is there a specific interest for you right now?
5	This is my husband, entj. I was so happy when he took up yoga, the meditation, stress relief, and exercise. Its nice to see his obsessive behavior work out so well for , him. 
4	Motorcycling was my "new hobby" in 2011. I now own only a motorcycle and have ridden over 130k miles. It has also never seen the inside of a shop. 
2	At least get a decent knowledge of it, yes. I have my words to say in everything I ever had an interest in, even a small one.
2	This is so me. Took up swimming last month. I now go every day 😂
2	Yes,  definitely.  I want to know as much as I can about it.
2	That's me. Yeah.\n\nWhenever I have more than 3d of doing nothing... My mind starts coming with all these possibilities of things I could do, so I'd sign up for more things than I could manage.\n\nThen whenever I have a lot on my plate, I get overwhelmed. I need to meditate everyday just to ensure that I can focus on only ONE thing at a time, and chunk related tasks and unimportant tasks at the end of night (e.g. email).\n\nAlso found that: The more I take care of myself, the more I seem to be able to take care of the world. That is, the more I focus on my diet, sleep, exercise and got that handled, the more chaos I can allow into my life.
2	> go balls to the walls\n\nWoman, you have no idea how much that would hurt. Ok, when you give birth without anesthetic you will.\n\nFor practice, try smashing your tits into the wall ... a few hundred times.\n
14	ENFP looking for insight into the well-kept emotions of ENTJs	ENFP here. Best friends (both female) with an ENTJ for ~6 years. Little bit of turbulence over the years (peaking as we got closer) but overall a strong and rewarding friendship, and one that will likely last a lifetime. I'd say, for the most part, we balance each other out. I think our friendship has shed light on our individual strengths and weaknesses, leading to a lot of individual personal growth, and concurrently, growth within our friendship. \n\nOne area I continue to struggle with you ENTJs, however, is your emotional distance. Being a highly sensitive, emotional person, I'm left emotionally starved by you. Sometimes, this starvation manifests rather undesirably... aka needy, smothering, and possibly clingy. I think my friend sometimes is frustrated by this, maybe even a little off put. In reality, if only she might say something as simple as "You're a great friend to me and I really appreciate you", that would be enough emotional sustenance to feed a nation of ENFPs. \n\nAgain, as a highly sensitive, emotional person, I've tried to be open and honest with her about this, but she's really f**king good at rationalizing her way out of the conversation and I'm left feeling like an over dramatic puddle of insecurity. I can tell that it hurts her that I'd even question her love and loyalty to me, even though that wasn't what I was getting at. At the same time, I get the feeling that my vulnerability to open up is sometimes viewed as a weakness... Not that I care what she thinks of MY vulnerability, more that I wish she'd realize I won't think of HER vulnerability as a weakness.  \n\nLook, I'm aware of my own shortcomings in the need for external validation, and I try to minimize that need as much as it makes sense. That said, I'm still left feeling underappreciated and unfulfilled sometimes. Quite literally, the only explicit expression of how she feels for me is a quick "Love you" when hanging up the phone, or parting ways (we don't live near each other). That's not to say that she doesn't show up as a friend in other ways (i.e. always there when I need her), but life crises only come so often for you to show up and care! I just... need more of a regular dose of affection. \n\nI realize, however, that maybe I'm looking for evidence of love and loyalty in all the wrong places so.... What I want to ask you guys: how do YOU think you're showing affection/love/appreciation of someone? Is it in something that you say or something that you do? How can I feel confident that you DO care, even if you don't show it? \n\nIf you don't want to answer those questions, I'm open for any insight you have on how you view your friendships, or what friendships mean to you. Thanks!\n\n\nEDIT: Hey! So far this has been really insightful and I appreciate all of your thoughtful responses :) I do want to clarify that other than this, my friend and I have a really really great relationship and am sincerely blessed to have her in my life. I also realize (even before posting) that this is likely more of a me problem than an ENTJ problem. This is really valuable feedback. Thanks again.
13	So, I'm trying not to set my blasters on stun, but this does hit a bit of a nerve for me-- it is why being an ENTJ as a woman can be a real challenge. \n\nBy all appearances, she's been a good friend, and you don't tell much about what your value proposition is for her. I have all kinds of feeler friends (even my husband) and they serve different purposes in my life from social conscience, to shared history. The one thing the enduring friendships do have in common is that they have come to accept me as I am and acknowledge that having a friend that can move mountains balances out with having to deal with someone who doesn't cheerlead, blow smoke, or play Pepper Pots to your Ironman. \n\nFirst point: her vulnerability is different than yours. You assume that 'her showing vulnerability' is showing you the gooey center of love that she's hiding under a thin veneer of logic. That's not what her vulnerability is. Her vulnerability is the risk of allowing someone she has loyalty to compelling her to generate a response that she wouldn't normally give. It doesn't matter whether it is through guilt, emotional manipulation, societal expectations- they're all still forms of coercion. Personally, I'd rather overt coercion than the pressure from a loved one to be something I'm not. At least with overt coercion there's no expectation to pretend that it is all benign. I can go toe to toe with despots, but a feeler who has internalized becoming a victim is my atomic bomb- and I won't engage.\n\nIs she really "rationalizing"? Rationalizing seems to suggest that she's using logic to come to an irrational or incorrect conclusion or to avoid a difficult discussion. It isn't rationalizing if she's using logic to guide her response to behaviors or if her conclusions are something you don't necessarily like.\n\nSecond, you learn really quickly as a rational that there are many people for whom the need for reassurance and love ends up being a gaping black hole of need that can't be filled. At the beginning of a relationship, I'll play if reassurance is needed, but if it looks like some sore of personal issue that I can't fix- I will ignore future bait. I won't reinforce bad behavior or needs that I don't have the capacity to fill.\n\nI'm guessing your ENTJ friend has picked up that you want additional reassurance, and isn't providing it for a specific reason. I'd lay it out frankly, "You probably have noticed that I have hinted that I need additional reassurance and/or affection. Can you tell me more about why you do or don't decide to do it?" and if she's hesitant to answer- ask if she's worried about how you will handle an honest response. \n\nDon't ask if you don't really want the answer, though, because the real solution to this quandary may not that you get more stroking when you want it, it could be that you just accept your for who she is and what she's able to give.
11	I’m a female ENTJ and I’ve experienced this exact dynamic w my female bff of 25 years.\n\nYou have to build yourself up socially through other means than only this relationship. Something that was really great for her was getting some other close female friends. \n\nThere’s nothing she can do to make you feel more confident. You should focus on the many wonderful positive aspects of yourself. Do confidence building mantras. \n\nThe way I show affection is by taking care of people in practical ways. You might be able to get her interested in “dealing with feelers” type of info for NT types if you haven’t tried that. \n\nAlso you could try to explain it like this to her: \n\nAsk her to think of you holding a cup. This cup needs to be filled with attention and affection. If she comes by once in awhile and dumps a lot in at once it just spills over the sides and the cup is soon empty again. It would be much more effective if she came by more often with small doses.. same effort with a better result for everyone. \n\nThere’s people who are much better equip to give you some of what you need. Try to appreciate that she’s out there .. ready, willing and able to be your greatest champion, and that will likely always be the case. \n
9	Time - If you're getting time from an ENTJ, you are important to them. If you call out with a real need, we will respond! That quick "Love you' is probably significant, too. \n\nIf you get too whiny, they might start pulling away. We do hate that. \n\nI'd say diversify your friend pool, find someone to fulfill some of those emotional needs your friend is not meeting. She isnt your life mate, just a friend.\n\nDon't put too much burden on her. That feels icky to us. We're not your emotional tampon. That *love in the wrong places* statement is right on. You feeling worried that you care so much is bordering on a bit weird... Friendships should be natural. \n\nIs this relationship balanced? What is she getting from you? I need to vent, share stories that my husband isnt interested in with my friends... Does she get to do this with you? \n\nDon't stress is so much. Play it cool. 
5	1) If I'm close to someone, they're family to me.\n\n2) I will compliment them (honestly and thoughtfully) ALL THE TIME, call them honey, sweetie, darling and whatnot, but I won't make big gestures like saying "You're a great friend to me and I really appreciate you". \n\n3) I will be their no.1 cheerleader (and bodyguard if needed), but also their mommy, if they're about to fuck shit up unneccessarily. \n\nYou wrote: "I can tell that it hurts her that I'd even question her love and loyalty to me". I would be hurt just as much. There's nothing like ENTJ loyalty. \n\nMy advice to you: Get a fuckboy that's good at complimenting, so that you don't have to feel so "UNfulFILLED" all the time ;)
6	> In reality, if only she might say something as simple as "You're a great friend to me and I really appreciate you", that would be enough emotional sustenance to feed a nation of ENFPs. \n\nMy intuition tells me that you haven't been nearly direct enough. You might try something like "I really value our friendship and your opinion, and would like to know what you think of our relationship. Do you think I've been a good friend to you?" Be prepared for her to answer honestly. You may love what you hear and/or it may hurt.\n\nHow often are you going to make her say it, though? Because repeating that sort of assessment every time she sees you is going to make her unhappy in a hurry.\n\n> Not that I care what she thinks of MY vulnerability, more that I wish she'd realize I won't think of HER vulnerability as a weakness.\n\nThat's an extremely difficult proposition. The type tends to viscerally fear and hate emotional vulnerability, especially in ourselves. Honestly, your hopes and expectations here seem unrealistic.\n\n> Quite literally, the only explicit expression of how she feels for me is a quick "Love you" when hanging up the phone, or parting ways (we don't live near each other).\n\nWow. I'm guessing she's a bit more free with that sort of expression than I would be, but still, damn. She *loves you.* And she's willing to tell you to your face, and the fact that she has gone out of her way to be there for you proves that she means it. I'm gobsmacked and more than little envious; you have a very good friend.\n\n> That's not to say that she doesn't show up as a friend in other ways (i.e. always there when I need her), but life crises only come so often for you to show up and care! I just... need more of a regular dose of affection. \n\nOkay, look, there's a balancing act here. You have a legitimate need for verbal affirmation and affection. If your friend is at all typical for an ENTJ, giving you that costs her some amount of effort and sanity. You can make a respectful request within the boundaries of the friendship for her to be more open about how much she cares, but there's going to be a limit. The smart thing to do is have that talk with her while also (as other people have suggested) developing other friendships that can help scratch that itch for you.\n\n> I realize, however, that maybe I'm looking for evidence of love and loyalty in all the wrong places so.... What I want to ask you guys: how do YOU think you're showing affection/love/appreciation of someone? Is it in something that you say or something that you do? How can I feel confident that you DO care, even if you don't show it? \n\nAs far as I'm concerned, words are literally worse than worthless unless they have actions to back them up. In fact I once ran into relationship trouble with my current SO where she was being *too* verbally affectionate and not doing enough tangible stuff to back the words up, so I felt like she was lying to me. If I call someone a friend then I am willing to put time, money, and a lot of effort into making them happy. If I tell someone I love them, I am prepared to sacrifice big parts of my own life to help them when they need it.\n\nThat said, the words do matter. I try to make my intentions and commitments clear while being succinct and not overly sappy (emotional, vulnerable) about it. Like I said earlier, your friend has told you that she loves you and has done her best to be there when you need her. The few people I have like that, I wholeheartedly cherish. That's all I could ever ask for.
9	Dance	For 5 weeks ive been practicing dance (salsa Casino). I challenged my fears and took a group class. All my life i felt embarresed when i had to dance, because i couldnt LEAD woman in dance. Now, i have solid frame and i feel confident and kinda natural when dancing. \n\nHave you guys expierienced such feeling? Do you dance?
4	Just started Salsa lessons 6 weeks ago and it's ridiculous what the difference of 0 vs 10 hours of dance experience each give you (power law at play)--total confidence boost indeed!
3	I've been dancing on the regular for 17 years. It's a bit of an obsession and it's one of the most worthwhile things I have done with my life. I've gained so much and met so many cool interesting people. 
2	So overall, would you recommend finding someone to train you legit? Sometime in my life, probably sooner than later, I'm going to have to partake in a dance, and I'm dreading it. That shadow Si.. I feel very incapable of letting my body loosen up.
2	Congratulations, that's fantastic! You own that dance floor!\n\nYeah, I've experienced that feeling, it's my favorite. I do dance, can highly recommend Swing.
1	I gave dancing a shot at one point and I did okay (this was formal dancing so you can objectively say, I did okay) but it wasn't fun. Maybe with the right girl it would be fun. And maybe in earlier times when people danced in coherent, rule-based ways I would have been the first to suggest we go dancing. But modern free form random movement (what is called dancing nowadays) just strikes me as completely pointless. I can't relate to it at all. I'm also enough of a rogue to withstand any kind of peer pressure so I've managed to remain a non-dancer.   \n\ntl,dr: Classic dances seem like they could be fun under the right circumstances. Modern dancing seems pointless.
12	How hard is it for you to keep female friendships as a female ENTJ.	I wondered if this is just a personal thing, but reading a few threads I've noticed that many Female ENTJ have more male friendships that last,  than female ones. \n\n(FYI - the friendships have not ended for lack of trying on my part, even when they went after my bf at the time..) 
12	I can keep them. I just can’t make them....LMAO
9	Difficult
10	In my 20s it was hard. I found most women my age to be shallow or flaky. I didn't keep female friends longer than a year at a time. But I also couldn't stay friends with guys without them trying to date/fuck me.\n\nSo I went through a bridge burning phase. And I wound up with 2-3 really close female friends. We're in our mid 30s.\n\nAt any rate most of it was me. The people you will attract may not be who you want to be around. It's up to you to adjust your personality to attract the type of people you want to be around.
8	Easy.  My friends are about 50/50 and I genuinely equally enjoy both genders.  However, I’m very deliberate about setting clear and strong boundaries in all my relationships, so that helps.
6	Maybe try to find a female INTP? \n\nI'm a female INTP and have had great friendships with female ENTJs. Usually we compliment each other's thinking styles well, and have interesting conversations /activities with a sort of leader/advisor dynamic. There's also generally little or none of the stereotypical female-female social dynamics, i.e. drama, talking excessively about dating/relationships, and stereotypical female bonding behaviors like shopping. The socialization is typically activity/goal oriented, with the ENTJ loving the opportunity to plan everything and run the show, and the INTP loving that the ENTJ * wants * to do that. 
2	I have about four female friends that I have kept for several years. Two of them I have known for 15+ years. However, I have a slew of male friends that I have made various times over the past 15 or so years. When I best friends is a mail and we been friends for over 20 years, and I’m in my mid-30s. I just don’t really do girly things so it’s kind of hard to keep girlfriends when I’m not doing the same things that they do. I would much prefer to go skydiving with my friend on the weekend than go shopping.
2	I certainly have more male friends. I have issues being friends with straight women for some reason. I can't seem to keep up with the drama and things like getting nails done or wearing makeup. I've also made the mistake of trying to be a good friend that I end up getting taken advantage of "because that's just what friends do". \n\nI'm more of a tomboy who loves ice hockey, muscle dudes and a good punch on. \n\nMy most meaningful and longest friendships have been with lesbian women and gay men although I'm a straight woman. 
2	When I was younger, yes. I think now it's pretty even as I have wonderful female friends who are also practical and work oriented.
1	I think I’m odd because most of my friends have always been women, and still are mostly women and like, bisexual men? \n\nI was terrified of talking to dudes growing up, and felt I understood girls better.\n\nI do have weird thing where I don’t have many like... mid-level friendships? I either have casual acquaintances or BFFs. 
1	Why has nobody commented on the following sentence???????\n\n"the friendships have not ended for lack of trying on my part, even when they went after my bf at the time.."\n\nHoney, I hate to be the one, but you're acting like a doormat. That's never going to be the base of a healthy friendship.
1	I find it difficult to keep any friendships - male or female. I've been told by male friends that I get along better with males. I didn't realise this. I still don't see it, but I suppose it makes sense. I'm a 23 year old female with the sense of humour of a 13 year old teenage boy.\n\nSaying that, I do get along with females very well. I have an usually strong maternal side which draws people in, usually that's females. Also, girls generally like me because I know my stuff when it comes to make up and weight loss. And I've been told I can "talk for England". People like that.\n\nIt's so easy for me to socialise because I'm skilled at putting on an act. My biggest issue is turning the act into something that lasts. In the last year I made 2 very meaningful relationships with 2 women in their 40s who are experiencing mental illness. Now I've left my job, I've been struggling with the idea that I won't see them again. I consider them very close friends, I just don't know how to make the effort to visit them. Purely for that reason our friendship will come to an end. I just don't know how to maintain the relationship unless the other person does it with me.
1	Quite easily with the right females. \n\nMy best friend of nearly 4 years is a INFJ. She's very emotional, always feeling. I'm an ENTJ so I'm very blunt, rarely emotional. \n\nWe have a great friendship and I think the greatest part is how we balance each other out. She tells me when I'm being a little bit too blunt for the average human and I tell her when she's being a little too emotional. \n\nWe challenge each other in areas we wouldn't have thought we needed it and we push each other to see things in other ways instead of blunt(me) vs emotional(her). \n\nIf I get overly annoyed with other personality types in my friendships, it doesn't effect me very much/at all to cut my loses and move on. 
2	Is Jordan Peterson an ENTJ	
12	Probably an INFJ.\n\nI've been reading his book Maps of Meaning and how he came to his conclusions was not in the manner a Te user would. He argues for contradictory conclusions about psychological archetypes in mythology in a very Ni-Ti manner, which is indicative of being an INFJ. His primary interest his entire life has been how people tick and how to make the world better, and he came to the conclusion that *mythology* is the answer, that there's a universal map of meaning every human understands through story that we have codified into religions. No Te-dom would make that leap, because it takes so much Ni-Ti looping to make that kind of insight, and there was many periods Te would've interfered with Ni's leaps (I actually think he's right about most of it, which makes his insights more impressive). \n\nHe speaks about his struggles to "grow the hell up" and part of those were dealing with substance abuse, and it seemed more like Inf Se over Tert Se. He's also fairly high in Big 5 trait agreeableness for a man, which is definitely not a Te trait. Te users certainly test high for EQ but they generally do not have problems speaking their mind about underperformance in the workplace. He also argues firmly for proper socialization in children in a way that an Fe user would, seeing it as one of the most important aspects of living (he's not wrong, but his language is very Fe).\n\nThat's my take on it anyways. I could be wrong. \n\nEdit: A point I forgot to make is that he's extremely tangential in his lectures, which is characteristic of a dominant N function. He does not go straight to the point often. 
4	He's intuitive, has no trouble talking in abstracts and going on tangents  \nHe's an introverted thinker, very deeply logical, and his extraverted feeling is showing, which makes sense because he's a self help guy  \nSo therefore definitely either an INTP or ENTP.  
7	Not sure what he "is" but definitely not an ENTJ
3	I think INFJ, but he prefers the big 5 personality system over the mbti system.
2	infj likely\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ER1LOarlgg
2	He's got extrovert eyes (outward focus that is rather concerned with if he has to hurt other people vs. if other people will hurt him), he's for sure an intuitive and a thinker (obvious because of his rational speech and thinking patterns) and he surely seems like a J. His body language is also very ENTJ (calm and in control).\n\nTLTR: ENTJ, but probably not the most common Enneagramm type 8, rather something around 2.
2	It's fairly obvious to me that he is. I understand it's not the same for everybody though.\n\nThe real strength of an ENTJ is to be able to read statistics through the logic of choice. \n\n> ENTJ: Logic of choice between two alternatives. Mutual exclusion. Risk, which leads to success. The logic of finding a way into oversystem, formation of emergent properties. Or-or logic. Strict disjunction.\n\n"The logic of finding a way into oversystem." It's basically the logic that explains all logics. instead of defining everything individualy like an INTP would, the ENTJ looks for the highest point of view possible which lead JP into archetypes. \n\n"Formation of emergent properties." If you look at the world as if you were reading statistics, eventually you'll find patterns, you'll find these "emergent properties". The idea that ENTJ rellies exclusively on data is one of those big MBTI cliché that hasn't died yet. If anything we'd probably be in the middle when it comes to rellying on data alone. We mostly understand the world through a big play of guessing the meaning of what we see through common sense. It's all a big interpretation based on what would mostly likely be. \n\nPeople identify ENTJs with the Dominant Subtype. Which I find almost insulting since the Dominant Subtype although often succesful, is incredibly intellectually lazy. ENTJs are people who see patterns everywhere and who try to make sense out of these patterns and that's the reality of this type. \n
2	Did you see him argue with the gender studies professor??  Didn’t seem very infj to me. 
2	ENTP.
1	No. You're very close, however.\n\nHis type should be obvious upon viewing this discussion with another person who shares his type--and many of his views:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/v-hIVnmUdXM
1	he is an introvert. an intuitive and a judger, not sure about the Thinking part though.  hes dumb to me    \nprobably a depressed enfp  due to various diseases 
0	ISTJ very conventional and by the book, he basically just repeats what he has read before.\n\nHell, his catchphrase is "clean your room bucko."\n\nHis message revolves around adapting to the current system instead of actually changing it. Even his opposition to leftist politics is just that, he's anti-postmodernist/marxist but doesn't offer any alternative other than liberalism. Which you know... is what we have now. Same old.\n\nKnowledgeable but definitely a conformist guardian through and through.
6	ENTJ-INTP Movie	Perfect ENTJ-INTP Movie to Watch:\nMr. Peabody & Sherman\n\nIt portrays child ENTJs and INTPs SO well. It’s actually quite humorous and kind of cute.
4	I love this movie!
4	Off topic but wanted to say it somewhere: Black Panther, who was depicted as an ENTJ in Captain America: Civil War, became the standard INFJ go-to hero in the Black Panther movie.
54	The best part of being close to an ENTJ...	...is when they try to relate to you on an emotional level. I went through a rough patch a while back and my ENTJ friend took a valiant stab at being consoling. Needless to say, it was terrible (it was adorably terrible like watching a newborn fawn try to stand up for the first time), but it actually meant a lot to me because I knew that emotional support is not really his forte. Consequently, it wound up cheering me up quite a bit because I knew that it was 100% sincere. \n\nAnyway, I thought it might be helpful to know that while you probably shouldn't quit your day job to become a grief counselor, it doesn't necessarily mean that your efforts aren't appreciated. 
12	I needed this post today. Had a rough night yesterday after getting (some much needed) extreme tough love from my ENTJ best friend. \n\nShe always looks out for me and has the best intentions, but watching her try to relate to where I'm at mentally/emotionally is really like a baby fawn lol. 
5	We make great professional grief counselors because our own emotions aren’t involved, but we’re totally 'wobbly fawns' :) when attempting serious emotion with people we care about.
7	ENTJ with one ex and several close or previously close friends who were INFPs. It's equally nice watching them from the other end as you stop being rational and driven for five minutes to try to put all of that NLP psychology into practice and come off looking like the gold robot thing from Star Wars. It's part of why ENTJs are drawn to xNFxs, I think, because they enjoy feeling safe and comfortable trying to understand emotions, which will always be a very interesting mystery.
6	ENTJs are said to have the highest EQ of all types, how could they possibly suck at consoling? Dealing with other people's emotions by cutting through the bullshit and saying all the things that need to be said (with emphasis on the positive aspects that need to be focused on) is one of my biggest strengths and necessary part of being a good leader. It's not gonna be a pity party (as in pity vs. empathy), because pity never solved any problems, but building up people (mentally and spiritually) is probably THE no.1 strength that ENTJs have.
4	I’m a counselor...a grief counselor...and I’ve worked my ass off to be a damn good one. 
1	Yeah, well, we are Humanists. Feeling poorly isn't productive towards getting to goals, so it's not something I encourage. So, yeah, ENTJs can touch and feel your soul. 
0	This is not the best part of being close to an ENTJ for an INTP. At all. Maybe for an ENFP it is. \n\nMany ENTJs are psychologists because we’re so supportive and understanding, what with our high EQ and all. People look to me for emotional support more than I actually want them to. In any case, I don’t think INTPs or mistyped INTPs should judge who should or shouldn’t be in a mental health profession. 
2	what do you guys think about entps?	basically what the title says. what do you think of us?
7	Compatible as friends. Refreshing. Challenging. Discussion and debate is enjoyable, especially when we get somewhere new together. \n\nWe usually agree in my experience, but even then we have novel insights to offer the other. I love ENTPs, but they’ve never given me the feeling INTPs have.
6	I think of ENTPs and the image of a clown car and calliope music pops into my head.
5	Overall pretty cool (of course there are exceptions), probably my favorite of all 16 types but I can only handle their presence for 4 hours per day.\n
2	In the right roles I think they can be valuable friends and partners. From experience, they take a lot of pride in what they know and their ability to demonstrate it, which I respect. They're also great conversational partners if you like generating and picking apart hypothetical scenarios, which can be helpful and I enjoy. I wouldn't make them my business partner. I definitely wouldn't put them in any setting that requires a nose to the grind routine, since almost all my ENTP friends burn out of their forced routines way more quickly than others. But again, with the right support and environment, my view of them is generally positive. 
1	I like them. They're usually very charismatic and fun to be around, but are also down to have debates just for the heck of it without taking things personally. Appreciate them more as friends than coworkers though, because it can be hard for them to take things seriously and get work done.
1	I’m a 8w7 ESFP and I realized that I get along very well with them. Definitely my fave NT type. I’ve always been around SF/NF, but being with a NTs are definitely eye opening. I love how they can openly discuss their thoughts and ideas, and they’re willing to talk about (even sensitive) topics without fearing that they’ll be wrong (no wonder the 16person calls them the “debater”). Adding on, love how sarcastic and witty they are. Also, I have noticed that they will keep pushing your buttons, which is what I like to do, too. \n\nOnly thing that I had problem in the beginning was his auxiliary function Ti.. since mine is Fi... these two definitely clashes, but I think we are mature(?) enough to understand each other’s differences. 
11	Which subtype of ENTJ are you? Intuitive or Logical?	ENTJ subtypes:\n\n**ENTJ-Te** - Makes an impression of a mobile, energetic, action-oriented and strict person. Facial expressions lack in emotionality. Looks directly, at point-blank range, studying his conversation partner, with his gaze focusing for a long time on his conversation partner or on objects in his surroundings. A bit timid and diffident, though tries to hide this. At times, he is overly mistrustful, critical, and excessively categorical. It is difficult to distract him from what he has planned, tries to bring everything he has conceived to completion. - [**Full description**](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/46746-LIE-ENTj-subtypes?p=138234&viewfull=1#post138234)    \n     \n**ENTJ-Ni** - The intuitive subtype is pleasant and considerate in dialogue. He can be affectionate and cheerful, possesses a developed sense of humor, often becomes the soul of a company. Inspired, energetic, and optimistic. Mobile, restless, scattered, always in a hurry, aiming to accomplish much in time. Very enterprising, boldly takes risks. It's hard for him to concentrate on one thing for a long period of time. He has many ideas. Always has several points where he can apply his efforts. - [**Full description**](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/46746-LIE-ENTj-subtypes?p=138234&viewfull=1#post138234)
10	Honestly I think I’m a bit of both. Depending on how I feel during a specific time period I would change, but always have a little of both in my actions.
4	ENTJ-Ni all the way.  I’m good at studying people though, but extremely objective in conversation, almost to a fault.
3	I’m glad I found this... I didn’t know there were two types of ENTJ... I definitely want to encounter an ENTJ-Ni
3	Would not ENTJ-Ni be just INTJ? Is MBTI on the spectrum now?\n
2	ENTJ-Ni.  Has the FBI guy in my computer been talking about me again?  This is spot on
2	ENTJ-Ni resonates with me more. I test as an 8w7 sx.
2	Up until about 6 months ago I usually tested as an ENTP, but i always thought that just didn’t seem right. Like “this dude sounds like a fucking clown”. 
1	60/40 Te/Ni... maybe more 70/30.
1	Intuitive definitely.\n\nI find this site odd, there will be very good explorations into charter and mental process, but then it goes into very-pseudo-science like appearance and build.
1	70/30 or 60/40 ENTJ-Te/ENTJ-Ni.
1	Te except for the emotionless facial expression. I'm more expressive than almost anybody I know. Probably not mbti related.
1	Ahh, I like this. I always kind of doubt what type I am, and then read some incredibly accurate ENTJ description, like the Te one above.
1	Interesting. I'm skeptical though, need to research more. The descriptions by Victor Gulenko seem reversed from the Meged and Ovcharov ones.\n\nLogical (M&O), if anyone is bothering to count.
2	Does my boyfriend sound like an ENTJ?	My boyfriend has taken the 16 personalities quiz 3 times in about two years, his most recent type was an ESTJ. The time before this he was an ENTJ and the first time was an ESTJ again.\n\nIn our relationship he makes most of the decisions but it will depend on the situation. He will often ask me for my input with certain things. He's good at getting tasks completed and is organised. He has big dreams for the future and where he wants to work.\n\nWe often disagree about some things as he is a traditionalist in that way whilst I don't really care what other people think or do in their life. He sometimes has short term goals that can be unrealistic and doesn't listen to my advice until he's gone and experienced it and then realizes I told him initially sort of thing. He's no afraid to talk about the future with me and that's why we clicked Initally as we both could see a future together. I find he doesn't laugh at all my jokes, which upon some reading makes him seem more like an ESTJ.\n\nIf we have a conversation with a stranger he will always ask me afterwards if he said anything wrong, as there have been times where he gets too confrontational but doesn't realise it. He often says things such as he doesn't know why some people don't like me as I am kind to everyone. He's also the one to say sorry a lot and learns from his mistakes. He is caring and kind to me but not overly emotional and I can insult him without him taking it too seriously.\n\nIn every test I've done I always end up an INTP but it confuses me a little. I can be scared of the future and often rely on past experiences to learn and I usually just live my life as each day comes, I just have an idea of the person I'd like to be in the future. My boyfriend is always talking about the future and how I shouldn't be so afraid and says how good things will happen etc.\n\nWhat do you all think? And what are some ques I can look out for?
11	He seems more like an estj than entj to me. 
7	I second S. If you are both NTs, you are bound to get into NT discussions at some point, and you did not mention any. Granted, ENTJs tend to busy themselves with work to have too much time for NT discussions, but they surely have some.\n\nMaybe INTPs do not force this stuff on others the way ENTPs and INTJs might.\n\nMeaning, ENTPs and INTJs are likely to let you know what they are thinking whether you want to hear it or not.\n\nINTPs might be too reserved for this and ENTJs too pragmatic/busy, but still, at some point two NTs are bound to talk about/debate something like philosophy, morality, economy, politics, etc.\n 
4	Typing via online quizzes is not super reliable. Typing someone via a Reddit post? Good luck. I don't see the point.
3	https://www.preludecharacteranalysis.com/types/entj/vs/estj\n\nDoes this help?
3	I really like this website for reading about estj http://www.sociotype.com/socionics/types/ESE-ESFj/\nI'm an estj and he sounds like one to me. If that is so, you guys are polar opposites. I read a thread on intp about how annoying they find us esfj types; we're too bubbly, phony, stupid, sheep etc. It was pretty tough to read that but I understand why people might see us that way. 
3	Rant - Coworker incompetence	Hi guys, i just need a bit of advice about a coworker from any professional managers point of view. It keeps playing over in my head and is stressing me to the max because everyone else I've asked can't give me anything i can use. I dont know if its me or if its my coworker.\n\nIve been in retail for 20 yrs and manager for 2 years now and there is 1 staff member under me. Shes been there for 2.5 years. Everyone see's her as "aww poor coworker, she's so lovely". Yes she is a nice, bubbly person when shes gossiping or socializing at work, but when it comes to actually doing work she procrastinates, moves at a snails pace and cannot retain any information for more than a minute. Conveniently? I think so!. She also has never shown any loyalty to me or her job. This is driving me nuts.\n\nI started noticing this about her 6 - 8 months after i started working with her. I tried motivation, praise, encouragement and incentives but absolutely nothing works. I feel she basically wants me to hold her hand, show her how to do her job and then praise her with rainbows and fluffy marshmellows. 1. I aint got time for that shit and 2. I dont have the emotional capacity to deal with this womens emotional issues and I'm constantly walking on egg shells around her.\n\nIve also tried to make her accountable for her actions. I let her pick out her mistakes and then getting her to correct them. This is followed by her giving excuses and then repeating the same mistakes day after day regardless of how many times she does it, and its always followed with "i dont know how to do that can you show me again". In the end i have to fix her half assed job.\n\nI went to HR about her work ethic about a year ago and she had a performance plan set up, she didnt progress in that either so it seems HR gave up, as HR has followed up numerous times but nothing comes of it.\n\nI had a performance review just over a month ago for a wage increase as im a cert 4 but being paid cert 3. From the time i started, GP$ have gone up, ATV% is up, conversion% is up most of the KPIs set out for us individually have gone up except for coworkers, but dispite all that, this woman has complained to HR that im hard to get a long with and they've taken her comment as fact. What she said must of been pretty bad because HR gave me 1 out of 5 rating. Im assuming the owner kind of understands whats happening as she gave me a 4 out of 5 rating for ability to get along with coworkers. They also said that i wasnt keeping up with maintaining the store. How the hell am i meant to run a busy store on my own, especially when my coworker is meant to be helping me, and doesnt. Sounds like they're grasping at straws. I said to my coworker a couple months back "because we have so many locums in store, this is our store, we need to pick up our game and help each other run the store together". The answer i got was "mmmyeahk" with an eyeroll. I knew right then she never have my back.\n\nThere was also an incident that happened just after christmas. On the 22 Dec I told her 3 times "we're not doing the D catalogue  that starts on wed 26/12 as its only a 1 week catalogue and we have to many other things to do and we wont have the time to execute it. I even wrote it in our communications diary. When i had my P.R. it was bought up that she called another store ranting about how i didnt print the tickets for the catalogue and she needed help doing it. Like i said previously, this woman conveniently forgets. One of her jobs is to print tickets. There is only 1 way to print them. Yes she knows this. Aagh!\n\nIve caught her talking to the HR lady a few times like they're  bffs and now im beginning to think they are as im now being transfered out of the store. Im also not getting paid the correct award wage but was told that getting my proper wage was ok. I have yet to see this in writting.\n\nI work in pharmacy and its a big industry for women so my thoughts are that im just not sensitive enough to deal with them. This has happened to me a few times now, im good for a few years and then im having to deal bitchy women because i dont cave in.\n\nAnother thing i hate is people who expect to leave on the dot without completing their tasks or atleast cleaning up their work areas first.\n\nThis woman finishes at 5 and will get her bags ready at 4:50 and then will fluff around out back in the staff kitchen until 5. This started getting on my nerves so when I've see her do this, i give her a job that should only take 5 to 10 mins and i tell her this. Most days she doesnt get out untill around 5:10 or i have to tell her she can go. It satisfies my need to push her into doing some work but at the same time i just know shes going to be on the phone to HR telling them how i made her stay back adding to her "shes hard to get along with" mentality.\n\nI know im leaving, i have it in writing so no problem, but its the when. Its been 4 weeks now and its starting to feel like they're trying to manage me out. No transfer or pay increase. I did mention during my P.R, that it would be easy for them to fill my position as its a nice store. The owner smiled at me and said yes but its getting someone that can manage 'coworker' that will be hard. So i think they're aware of it, just ~~wont~~ can't  do anything about it.\n\nI absolutely feel like this woman has sabotaged my job. Or maybe im a bad manager, i just dont know. No one will tell me if I'm doing something wrong or how to fix this, not HR or the owner. Maybe they dont know how to and are hoping the next manager does??\n\nIve given up on her now. I dont give her jobs to do unless shes fluffing around and i keep to myself but my need to control and progress is eating away at me. I hate everyday i have to go to work and put up with so much incompetence and ignorance. Ive been applying for other jobs, but they're few and far between in the area i live in and moving house is not an option. \n\nWhy do women have to be so emotionally driven, aaagh, it drives me insane!
5	this is too long to read the whole thing but why hasnt she been fired
3	>  From the time i started, GP$ have gone up, ATV% is up, conversion% is up most of the KPIs set out for us individually have gone up except for coworkers\n\nI'd wager that most of us do not know what these acronyms mean.\n
2	I read the whole thing. I think you are doing a great job, taking care for people and looking out for them.\n\nThe way you self-reflect makes me think you are probably good manager.\n\nI think you need to calm down and take a break for a few days. You seem very upset. I think you already have all the answers for what to do, it's just about sleeping well, not thinking about work for a few days and then delivering.\n\nI am currently working one-level below a leadership position, and that is my dream going forwards. I do not have any more specific advice, but there were no red flags in your story that would make me see you as a poor leader or a failure.\n\nNot everyone has a good work ethic, and you simply need to find a company with similarly minded people and goals. I work in software engineering, and everyone at least in my team is hyper-conscientious. I talked specifically about this with my team lead, and he affirmed that everyone that doesn't pull his weight gets shifted to a different project.
2	I understand your situation.  I quit a job due to a very similar coworker.  Not only was she incompetent, but our (also incompetent) manager favored her and would cover up all of her mistakes for her.  She also let this coworker bully and push all of her work onto everyone else, with her blessing.  I had brought up that this employee was a problem and my mgr was basically vindictive and treated me horribly for it.  I was up for promotion, but things got so bad, I ended up quitting after one particularly bad incident.  My mgr's boss really liked me, but bc the idiot coworker was, "nice," it took him until after I left to really see what those issues were that I was the first to bring to light and the only one willing to speak out.  My other coworkers saw it too, but were afraid to say anything, esp when they saw how vindictive my supervisor was toward me for being the one who said something. \n  My supervisor was also a, "nice" person who people thought was incapable of being a jerk (which she was to me in particular, but rarely in front of others, my team members all saw it though and acknowledged that it was wrong), so I totally get the same feeling of this one person ruining my career.  In the end, it was my mgr's fault, bc if she would have done her job to get rid of this employee (supervisor was basically forced into retirement shortly after I quit and another team member also quit, and then bc she wasn't there to protect her favorite incompetent, she eventually got fired too, but not without ruining the entire dept).  I have been told by people that had I not been the catalyst  (quitting), nothing would have happened, which was exactly the way it seemed, my supervisor's boss and board members were pissed when they found out I quit, and that put my supervisor and her beloved idiot employee in the spotlight, bc I named them as being the reason I quit.\n\nI would just leave.  Let them deal with it, you have tried to train this person and she is untrainable (as was the one I dealt with, she could not grasp very basic knowledge, and the fact that she was even hired, basically she lied about how competent she was when she wasn't says a lot about my stupid manager eating up BS), she is also seen as a benign, "nice" person, likable enough that people don't see the harm she is doing, but FME very passive aggresive.  It's actually a pretty clever cover for a person capable of doing a lot of damage while looking like an innocent victim/asshole, Michael Scott style.    It's good that you're leaving, that's all I'll say.   I have been forced to look back on that situation as a hard lesson learned in office politics and what I can do in the future to protect myself from it happening again.  My bosses' boss expressed that he wished that I would have come to him sooner before things got so bad that I quit.  I'm not sure that would have helped, bc even though they got rid of my supervisor, they hired another idiot to take her place, so I think that there is jus widespread incompetence at the senior level and inability to see/understand what goes on at the ground level.  \n\nGood luck in your career.  Read the book, "The No Asshole Rule."
2	These lazy people and also HR are like ostriches. If you put pressure on them they put their head in the ground and wait until the danger has passed so they can continue being irresponsible.\n\nI have yet to see someone succeeding in changing these kind of people their behavoir so I wouldn't bet on it. Maybe you can get her fired and hope that the next person will do better.
2	It's the person, not the sex.\n\nI'm sure you've had a career working with women where everything worked out just fine.\n\nIf you didn't have the authority to fire her, I'd have relegated her to the most menial tasks in your realm of control... She's worthless, treat her as such. \n\nCan you lateral out of that company to another company with more growth opportunities for you? You sound like your fate is sealed here, do you believe that? If so, I'd leave. \n\nWhat do you want?\n\nWhat are you asking? 
1	I gotta wait and see the emotionally driven comments coming in.
1	How about you preemptively find another job? I worked as a slave in a large chain and I did not give a fuck - it was just a job. If you want to work with better people (although not guaranteed), try moving up in life. Maybe go work for one store that is not a chain; maybe start your own business. Maybe take some online classes to further your career.\n\nPeople around you are being paid by the hour, including HR. Why should you try to help this one store when the rest of the people do not seem to care? It's not like your hard work is going to bring about an early end to a war but merely an early end to your youth.\n\n
1	Having expectations people will improve or get with the program after a few months is a waste of time and energy.  You say it took you 6-8 months to realize what co-worker's MO was, but that really should have been evident within 2-6 weeks.  I feel after a few intro runs you see exactly what you're going to get.  Set your expectations based on the skill level of the job.  Clearly she's meeting higher management's and HR's expectations or she wouldn't be there.\n\nYou seem really concerned with her performance, and all the politics around her work and HR.  You're far more focused on what she's not doing than what you are doing.  No disrespect intended, but you've been working retail at the same location for 2 decades and don't have a high school diploma if I understand correctly.  If you're happy and satisfied, good for you, but you're clearly not.\n\nSeems like you're couching a lot of frustration with the employee when there are a lot of other dissatisfactions, like your lack of options and agency.\n\nForget about her progress, you've done what you can.  Focus on yourself and your own satisfaction.  You can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink. 
1	Two things. The error is her. I hate those people. It is awful to deal with. She is manipulating the situation to make you feel like an outsider for your work and to make other people feel the same.  I would do the following:\n\n1. accept transfer and get the f*** away from her. Let. Them crash without you. \n\n2. Leave. This isn't worth the ulcer it is given you. This issue is with HR and your boss too because they refuse to help you.\n\nIf that doesn't work/ isn't viable, this has worked for me:\n\n1. Identify the conflict of working together. Make a long list of what you have tried to help her "be the best she can be" (HR loves that). \n2. Talk to HR saying you are worried you can't reach her and that you would  like help to make her experience and work ethic better etc. Point out that you know she has a great relationship with HR and that you were hoping the could help you with the better insight. Do this with your boss and HR.\n3. Set specific, easy to prove weekly to monthly goals. Make these with HR and your boss.\n4. After she fails for 1-2 weeks,  raise your big concerns and discuss what would be required to take action about her significant issues with your boss alone. Make your new goals part of making this decision. \n5. Let her failure of goals burn her image with the boss. \n6. Keep going to HR and troubleshooting. This will make it more awkward for HR to be close with her. Also, this will make more work for HR which they won't want. This will make this lady more of a problem with them. You show you are trying so hard to make this better and to improve your understanding. Don't become a different person because this will make peeps suspicious. \n\nThis takes a ton of effort and may or may not work. Its worked for me before though.
1	TLDR\n\nBut from I got out of it, it sounds like the person you’re complaining about is complacent, and/or doesn’t care about their job. Their mind is on other things in their life and they likely don’t see their job as their “work”. Basically, they’re probably just lazy. \n\nI have a coworker as well who seems to be the way. Oddly enough, they are also a woman. One of the differences though is that my field is in the trades so it’s unusual to see women. My coworker seems to take her work very seriously, she aims to be industrious and professional. But somehow is unable to accomplish anything in a timely manner. And I do mean anything. 
63	Curiosity, anyone else do this with music? Instead of an album or list of songs, it's usually 1 song at a time, over and over, for hours or sometimes a couple days, before going to another song?	I find myself listening to the same song over and over a lot, -vs- a whole album or list of 1,000 songs, I find one I like and just repeat it for hours before I go to another song, and basically, do the same thing again. Curious as to any others that do this here with music, if you find yourself listening to music a lot, I pretty much listen to music whenever I'm awake, except when I'm working with people in person, then the music is off, but that's about it.
29	I became a audio engineer because of this lol.
13	I usually do that but with artists for weeks at a time. 
7	Yes ALL THE TIME!! I find a song that I can vibe to and can relate to it. Often times it's an up beat song and I liston to it while driving, cooking, working, working out. By the time I've  exhausted all enjoyment out of it; a new song would come long to save me from that song.
5	Not to that extent.  I can go maybe an hour on one song (or more if it’s a song I am trying to learn to play).  Serious question and not trying to sass you or make fun: do you find yourself developing deep and intense fixations in other parts of your life, or is it a phenomenon limited to music for you? 
4	I usually do this with Spotify albums. Once the songs start to get annoying I move on haha
4	sometimes. usually i go back and forth between a few songs. or albums. i'm pretty much always listening to music, as well. except when i'm writing. 
5	Never correlated this with a personality type,  but I absolutely do this
2	Those fifteen minute or half an hour extensions of video game or Homestuck music on YouTube - I'll cycle between four or five of those plus one or two bits of the same real music for sometimes days.
2	[deleted]
1	Yup. That's me. Although, after 2-5 runs of a song, I usually listen to 1-2 others, only to go back to the original song again. Not sure why. It's like white noise to focus my mind, without being distracted by real life sounds around me.
1	I STILL listen to Matchbox 20's first CD. Oh and Live's Throwing Copper as well as Silverchair's Freakshow. I'm stuck in time 😎
1	Yes. Definitely.  But it's generally because of the words of the song and it what state of mind / emotion I am in at the time. Disturbed - The light, is one of those that I still go back to every time I feel "lost",  lmao and Happy - Pharrel Williams is just the opposite. Currently it's Blitz und Donner - von Erdling 
1	Familiarity woes me.  
1	Goodness, this is so accurate! YIKES.\n\nI hate it when music services or a certain app doesn't let you loop something xD
1	I'm late to the post here, but I find it so eerie that you listen to music the same way I do. I'm notorious for listening to the same 5 to 10 songs for a month or two until I get tired of them and move on to the next. I was even worse with this when I was a kid, I would play a song on repeat for a solid hour because I didn't want to listen to anything else except for that one song I loved.
4	Which traits are attractive to entj?	Is there a specific traits that you guys are attracted to or try to look for in SO? \nAlso, do you guys prefer F or T? \nLastly, do you guys prefer someone who is more outspoken or reserved?
16	In no particular order, I deeply value dependability, confidence, self-sufficiency and the ability to maintain a deep conversation.  \n\nWhile that might sound generic, I'm finding that these are more make-or-break for me now than they ever used to be. I'm at a stage in life where my time is a valuable and limited resource. I cannot date someone who disproportionately depends on me, and who I cannot rely on to support me when I make time for them. I have no problem being a reassuring partner and validating that they're attractive, on the right path, or whatever it is they need. But if in talking to someone it's clear you have no faith in yourself to actually achieve anything you're talking about, in my head I've already moved on -- talk is cheap. I don't want to date someone whose life revolves around me and what I do for them -- no one wants to feel like the lowest block in the jenga tower. And yeah, if every conversation feels superficial, illogical or hyper-emotional, I don't see a long term there. \n\nI don't care about outspoken vs reserved, as long as you're a mature version of either social approach. F vs T doesn't mean much to me either. Personally I've had the best romantic conversations (flirting, talking about future aspirations, even small talk at the bar, etc.) with INFJs and certain INFPs who I know well. For the most part, if you're not all talk and you're equipped to handle the intensity I bring to my own goals and routine, I'll make the effort. 
7	* Kindness - I'm mostly unaffected by mean strangers, but if someone I care about is mean to me, it just won't work. \n* Honesty - Both with me and with themselves, no delusions\n* Knowledge and curiosity - I want to learn from her, and vice versa.\n\nOutspoken is fine. Strong opinions are fine too, when paired with strong arguments. Judgmental is not fine. Dignity is a must.  \n\nWhat's F/T? 
6	Generally I’m going to say it’s going to vary with different people regardless of type, and heavily based on their attachment style and upbringing. Personally, I like fellow NTs. The love of my life was an ENTJ, just an unfortunately super damaged one. The most annoying person I ever dated was an ENFP, followed by an ESFP. I had one friend who was INFP, who I also found really grating, but in all of these cases it was more about how much of a hot mess they were, and less about specific personality types. \n\n\nTL;DR I prefer fellow NTs, especially ones that are outgoing and confident.
6	Dependable is a good start. I also appreciate open.
3	thoughtful. hard-working. classy. someone like Claire Underwood
3	I'm attracted to extroverts that are great conversationalists. Confident speakers and very social people stand out to me as well. I find it odd that I can get more smitten by someones mind than their looks. I look for personality equals and hate power play. I try to avoid conflict but don't mind discussing through disagreements. \n\nCan't say that I prefer F over T, I can't figure out someone's MBTI without them telling me. I like people that can relate emotionally and intellectually. I hate reserved or introverted people, since there's a greater likelihood for passive aggressiveness or never knowing whats on their mind. If they're indifferent it makes it a chore to get things done. \n\n
6	loyal 
3	boobs, face, butt, money
2	Honesty and authenticity.
2	Direct communication that comes from a place of caring and compassion. I don't want to play games with people I care about.\n\nTimeliness and consistency. I want to be able to count on you.\n\nBullet points. List oriented people make sense to me. and if they understand what I mean by "planned spontaneity", I'm all in 😄
1	Game playing, lack of emotional maturity, deceitfulness. As I said, it was more that they were shitty people.
1	The thing that most attracted me toy husband is that he is always on time. Very reliable, always open to suggestions and a good communicator. He plans well, and he asks my advice. 
1	Wow thank you for your clear answer! Feeler/Thinker?
1	NT all the way... It just feels like being with someone of the same "kind".\n\nMy hubby is an INTP and I wouldn't have it any other way :) We're the same (Thinking, Intuition, Sensing, Feeling), but different (shadow functions - Ti vs. Te and so forth).\n\nOther than that: intelligence, honesty, loyalty, kindness, humor and sex appeal - but that's what everybody wants I guess.\n\n
1	Dependability is cool, I’m a big fan of people who are willing to put themselves on the line for people they care about, and I also like people I can confide in because I really dislike stewing on things that bother me.  I also really like good conversation, so I’d say someone who has a different perspective than me.
11	I'm not good enough, opinions?	
3	I do think that ENTJs should spend some time figuring out why they are doing what they are doing, what is it that they really want before spending 100 hours per week inside a bulldozer.\n
1	Not good enough isn't specific enough, not good enough for what? not good enough at what? etc. Figure out what is wanted, get it done, then it will prove one self by achievement or not.\n\nThis is interesting, one could use their feelings of worthlessness, to manipulate one self to take action. Why does one feel worthless? Is the starting point. Keep asking why until you're working toward a desired goal.
1	"They have double observers." Yeah, b/c other types only have one or none.\n\nI can see how a dominant Te would give someone an objective view of what they're lacking in competencies/knowledge. Which depending on where that person is in their life, might feel pretty shitty.
1	Ya, I get it. There's a Buddhist idea: when you think you are not good enough, you think others are not good enough as well.\n\nWhen I saw this question, I didn't ask myself whether I thought I was good enough - I asked if I think others are not good enough. \n\nAnd the answer was clear.
5	Do you ever feel like your expectations for yourself are too high?	I feel that I have unrealistic goals, not just for me but for most people, and then I am very hard on myself when I don't achieve what I think I should. I hold myself to a high standard, but I sometimes think it is too high. Have you had this experience? What do you do? 
10	no.
3	i once told my therapist i never set goals because nothing's ever good enough. i'm not sure what to do about it, but i think i'm definitely getting better. one thing you can do is, when things don't go exactly how you planned, tell yourself it's okay. you learned from it. you'll do better next time. work hard so you KNOW you tried your best, even if you have trouble accepting failure (whether it's big or small).
4	shoot for the stars and land on the moon. Look back and wave at Earth to see how far you've come. 
3	Too high for those who aren't like 
2	I used to be harder on myself, but after 2-3yrs of working on it I’m doing better. I think what helps is making sure you have a defined set of smaller goals in place as stepping stones to the bigger goal. Failure is okay as long as you get back up and keep trying! Feel free to PM me. 
1	There is a difference between too high standards and being too ambitious, and I mean near impossible ambitions. Try to know if you have too high standards or if you're being unrealistically ambitious. \n\nAlso, if you do have too high standards, don't be afraid to lower them to "high standards" from "too high standards". Crushing high standards are better than giving up on too high standards.
1	Yep, totally\nWhen I get a test back, I always complain if there isn’t a hundred there, even if it’s like 94\nIn HS btw

3	entjs and temper	i noticed alot of entjs have bad tempers and can become realy scary when they loose there tempers,give some experinces when you guys realy lost your tempers and what happened? yopu dont have to sound politicaly correct lol
21	I have two very different types of temper:\n\nThe frist is based on frustration (esp. when people are being fucking inefficient), which is the kind of high on emotions 'I want to scream at you and punch you in the face' temper. Of course, I don't actually do that, but I feel like it at times. Outwardly, this mostly shows in me becoming very snappy and sarcastic with the people I'm frustrated with, followed by me working extra hard to proof them wrong, and that no, fuck you, you are *not* doing this efficiently, and I'm going to proof it to you.\n\nThe second is hatred, which doesn't happen often, but when it happens, it's deep and final. If I hate your guts, it's definitely a case of 'Hell hath no fury', and I will do everything I can to make you miserable, because fuck you, I hate you, and you deserve it. You would *never* know though, as it wouldn't show, and I'd make sure you'd never realize it's me fucking you over.\n\nIn both cases, it's emotion over rationality, so I guess it's both cases of losing my temper, and I hate myself for letting it happen. It happens though every once in a while. And both are extreme, and I guess scary, but in very different ways. Working on myself to be a better person in the future.
7	I cuss frequently; profanity isn't necessarily an indication of anger. I also don't really get truly angry because most stuff in the world is petty human bullshit that isn't worth getting pissed off about. Frustrated, sure, annoyed, yeah, but those emotional reactions to external stimuli are more like indicators that I need to get off my ass and fix whatever is pushing my buttons. If someone really does well and truly piss me off though, it could get ugly. Another human being pissing me off hasn't happened in quite a while though.
6	The two entjs I know are guys and they get annoyed/frustrated pretty easily but rarely ever angry. When they’re ticked off, you can tell because they don’t try to hide it but when they’re actually mad it’s scary af. \n\nI’ve seen them both blow up (one time at each other) and it was horrible. Lots of threatening, one punched a wall, we had to hold them back, etc. Like two pit bulls going at it.
3	Generally, in my own experience I have alot of patience, so by the time I go H-bomb on anyone's ass, it's because there has been a long build up to it. \n\n\n\nBut on a day to day basis I may throw a little TNT in the mix, but that's generally due to frustration or stress, maybe due to work or even someone being illogical,  bias or not using their brains - those TNT moments are generally very short lived and low key, like swearing under my breath, and turned into a joke as not to make those around me feel uncomfortable, if they picked up on it. \n\n\n\nThe only times I really would loose my cool and go bezerk is when someone has been continuasly dishonest with me or if I feel that I have put in all the effort and support into a relationship and I've been used. \n\nI think regarding dishonesty, its two fold because I value straight, raw honesty and because by being dishonest with me you undermining my intelligence. I may not pick it  up straight away,  but I gather information consciously and subconsciously, and if I confront that person,  it's always with facts and if I get any hint of a lie, I see red. \n\n\nAnd unfortunately,  if this is an entj trait,  I can make people cry. Something I always warn people about.  Coming at someone with facts they can't deny in a manner that makes them feel less than an ameoba is crushing to those that on the other end. \n\nIf I don't blow up. I cut you out of my life and erase you from my memory.  This I think is harsher on the other side, because there is no explanation why I've gone from this warm, caring person to not even acknowledging your existence,  but this is generally when I've been hurt really deeply emotionally.\n\n\n
3	Well, there's "losing it" (aka being neurotic and mean, especially in intimate relationships) and then there's justified, necessary anger. Sometimes a bitch just needs to get put in his or her place. \n\nENTJs are supposed to be natural leaders - being terrifying is part of the job ;)
2	Your spelling and word association irritates me.  
2	9 day old post, but would like to add.\n\nlike a lot I saw here, I am really calm, most likely because I tend to have a very emotionless looking face, but inside its true too, but I feel like the reason some of our tempers might be bad is because most not like us, I've observed, tend to noticeably get more irritated as something bothers them, and then they over flow, where as I would blow it off, until I get to a point where it over flows, so it seems like it came out of no where. \n\nWe may, maybe, get more annoyed than most, but I feel like we  just hide little annoyances better.
2	I find myself cussing at my computer a lot when it does something I don't want it too and wastes a few seconds of my time with dumb shit.\n\nBut it's just because I don't understand technology, I understand people, so I never get mad at them, everyone's motivated by something, but technology, is just technology, it's all the same boring shit.
1	"Grown ups" don't keep "track" of their temper tantrums...in fact "grown ups" who have their priorities straight, AVOID losing their tact...cause it's absolutely ridiculous to brag about having a temper, lmao. That's for spoiled brats.\n\nAvacyn...a little too self-absorbed with premeditated rage...don't you think?\n
9	“This is the part of the job that I hate” - Ronald Reagan as an ENTJ	
6	"Don't make me have to kill you.." \n\nMan, if I've said that once, I've said that 1,000 times. 
3	Great skit! RIP Phil Hartman.
1	I read somewhere he was an ESFP?
1	He wasn’t an ENTJ. He was an ENFJ.
7	Interview Tips	I think I have a good chance of getting an interview for a Staff Assistant Position at a US Senator's Office in the next few weeks, and this will be without a doubt the most important interview of my life thus far.\n\nI'm not necessarily the most qualified when it comes to resume, but my volunteer experiences, skills/traits, and networking (went through Dale Carnegie with the hiring manager) will give me a very good chance to get my foot in the door.\n\nWhat tips do you have for interviews?  I'm working to always expand on answers rather than just yes or no, but I'm very open to anything else that may help me out.\n\nWould a properly tailored suit make a difference in this case?  If so, would a thrift store suit (good shape) be able to be tailored properly?  I'm a bigger guy (5' 8" 250lbs, with a gut) if that makes much of a difference.  All of my recent interviews haven't needed a suit.
8	At the end of the interview when they ask if you have any questions, ask: "Do you have any reservations about hiring me?"\n\nIt leaves a huge impression in my experience, and can completely make the difference if they're on the fence. Always feels like it's the defining moment of the interview. \n\nDo it, your future will love you for it.\n\nIt has served me well, and has worked like a charm for my friends and family, too. I can't remember if I read or somewhere or if I came up with it on my own. I do know, though, that none of the interviewers we've used it on had ever been asked it before, and they all loved it.
2	1. Network with people that work with your interviewer. See what past applicants did to impress them. \n\n2. Always wear a suit, regardless of how casual the job is. It means how committed you are to being professional. \n\n3. There's not much you can do in the short term to reduce your weight nor should it hinder you to get the job. However, in the long term, make an active decision to eat better and exercise, because you owe it to yourself to be in the best shape possible to perform to the best of your ability and for as long as you possibly can.

6	Double-observers?	'sup?  \n\nDo you agree with this video?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mFXWgvN9dA  \n\nDo you find yourself being a little more Ni, Se, or relatively solid at shifting between the two?  \n\nimo, an ENTJ who prefers Ni much more than Se, would be more like an INTJ, more introverted, the ones who perhaps question their type.  \n\nThe ones who prefer Se a little more than Ni, would be more like the stereotypical 'get it done' stereotype, as that kind of presence is actually Se, not Te, anyway, lol.  \n\nThoughts?
2	[deleted]
2	Straight up - about every convo I have with my ISFP husband, I talk about patterns/big picture, the future; he talks about specifics and facts, the now. We've had a few very recently. 
-2	Thanks, I liked the blonde. Would smash.\n
0	Why are entj guys so fucking crazy	Started talking to this guy like a few days ago, we get along great (I'm an entp girl btw) we're both pretty forward with each other and everyone's super grand except he's fucking insane. He's super protective and he like gives hints that's he's jealous and he seems super invested in this "relationship" already, he also loves teasing me about like everything and loves making all the decisions. Another thing: he really likes the role where like he's kinda the man and he knows more than me and he say more capable and stuff and I can't really do anything and it's fine I guess because it's true (he's 5 years older) so I can't figure out if this is an entj thing or like the age thing. \n\nI have a close guy friend who's an entj and he is the most manipulative person I know but like he always has good intentions like I dated this guy who cheated on me and my entj friend knew that so he got his sister who went to school with the guy to spread rumors about it. And sometimes when i ask him for advice on what to do, he'll just tell me to do things or be like "that's not up for debate do it". There was another time I was talking to some guy that he hated so he like sorta threatened that guy I don't know what he said exactly but that's basically what he did.\n\nWhat's wrong with you guys?
16	what happened in the past 12 hours to make you flip out damn
12	Hasty generalization\n\nSome humans are crazy. The types do have their own brands of crazy though, that’s true- an ISFP is not going to do what you’ve described.
9	>"What's wrong with you guys?"\n\n\nThis is some heavy stereotyping to assume all entj's are like this. I think its mostly an age thing or them trying to "impress you" by acting macho and taking control. I can empathize with being invested in relationships early though, but I'm smart enough to not make myself look clingy, needy, or insane about it. \n\nWhen I fall in love, I fall in love hard, but I use tact, and know how to handle it. You'd never know I was so deeply in love with you unless I knew you felt the same. I asked my now wife to marry me 3 months after dating her because I knew she was the one and I knew she thought I was the one for her, but I'm not going to be threatening people or be super possessive because I know that those things are generally not good qualities in a person.\n\nMaybe they just need to grow up.\n\n**Edit formatting issues**
6	First guy sounds weird, second guy just sounds like a good friend. I have a question.\n\nWho hurt you? Who. Hurt. You.? :(
2	A friend who'll be manipulative in front of you will be manipulative to you. Find ENTJs who are more mature.
1	erm. the two examples you gave dont seem to point in the same direction. so whats wrong with number 2? and why do u call him manipualtive? i see no example of manipulation  (or define manipulation .. )  \n\nsecond there are many ppl with OCD, most of em are IxTJs but yes, anyone can be, TJ prioritize control, over everything , if their attributes dont allow creativity and permeability then that individual is stupid and aunattractive, just like any other profile )  \n\nur taking the default taht control is not important, which is bad, it is the opposite of you im sure, but that doesnt make it "crazy"  )  
1	lol where can I find a guy like this? (the first one)
1	Uhmm "What's wrong with you guys..?" nothing really?  We have the same question regarding other personality types. \n\nGuy number 1. From my experience When we like someone,  we LIKE them and we have already made future plans with them.. Yes we think in terms of future, because we don't like wasting our time..  If we don't do that, that means you are nothing but a quick flirtation, that we would probably forget your name in a few years time. \n\nGoing with the flow is hard... We can come off as over protective and yes we are jealous.  It's a bad trait that we have to work on, but from my experience is because by the time we say I like you we are already very emotionally involved and as cold as we may seem,  there is a volcano of emotions below it and generally we fear being hurt badly so we try and hold onto what we have. This can come across as controlling, which is another bad trait that we have to work on. (this being said, just be careful, as this is not personality driven when it comes abusive relationships though)  \n\nGuy #2 By the time you friend gives you advise it's because he has thought of every possible outcome and has chosen the correct one for you. That's why he expects you to just agree. \n\nOn being manipulative.  We come off as manipulative, because we ask people to do things that they haven't thought about themselves and when we say, "Hey have you thought about doing this... A light bulb goes off.." A friend asked me once how I got it right that people would do things for me..she only saw one side..she didn't see what I did for them as well..... 
1	You talk too much. I'll call you run-on. 
1	Entj guy??	Hi okay so I'm probably an entp girl and I started talking to this entj guy a few days ago. Hes told me he's really into me and wants to take me out and stuff and he's super sweet and basically perfect but he always kinda does this thing where he's likes being like the one on top of his shit and he really likes taking control. I don't really mind that part but some other times he'll say stuff like "aww ur so forgetful it's adorable" to me when i forget what topic of conversation we're on. I know that he knows I'm intelligent, but he always kinda makes these like sorta downgrading statements that he thinks are compliments. Also he's like really forward and kinda decides like everything and we've only known each other for like a few days but he's already made himself a really prominent part in my life. Is this normal for entj guys or should I be worried?
8	That's not normal for any person. If he isn't willing to hear who you are and learn about you, it is going to be difficult to be in a relationship. I think ENTJs can be like that but it isn't really healthy. That would piss me off. Sometimes, people can decide the kind of person they want an SO to be and will  see what they want in another. Call him on it if he decides something about you that is wrong. If he reacts really poorly, then you know he is doing that. 
4	I think you should communicate more. Whether it is normal or not for ENTJs to act like this, you shouldn’t brush it under the rug. Definitely talk to him about it and how he makes you feel. If he denies it or refuses to see his fault then drop him. Don’t settle
3	I could see him doing this to tease you if you've known each other for a long time, but fairly new into a relationship? I'd squash it if it bothers you. Don't expect or plan on people to change, but by talking to him openly and honestly about it, it's possible.
2	If you're not happy with a behavioural trait you need to raise your voice and squash it. Say it diesnt fly with you and you hate being generalised. He should stop doing it. My mom has the same trait and it drives me nuts. 
1	First of all, you have a habit of taking the force out of your statements with filler words ("like", "kinda", "sorta"). People in general will step all over you if you communicate like this and I bet it goes deeper than just phrasing. I'm not surprised someone is behaving rather pushy with you. I would question if it's really his true nature to go as far as he does, or if it's simply what seems to work best with you, what you respond best to. You may not be aware how much control over situations you actually have. But let's move onto specific points:  \n\n>he always kinda does this thing where he's likes being like the one on top of his shit   \n\nAre you implying that he is not? Have you tried calling him out when he's bragging or whatever you mean by this?   \n\n>he'll say stuff like "aww ur so forgetful it's adorable" to me when i forget what topic of conversation we're on [...] he always kinda makes these like sorta downgrading statements that he thinks are compliments.   \n\nI doubt that's how he thinks of it. This is just a thought experiment but if I told someone their forgetfulness was adorable it would be to reassure the person that they don't need to worry about this weakness of theirs, that I don't mind. This would typically be prompted by them acting embarrassed about something. Do you act embarrassed in these situations, and then he responds with a line like that quote? His delivery might confuse you (the emotional tone may be somewhat "off", too harsh, too forceful, too serious) but if that's the order of events then I stick to my hypothesis that he's trying to comfort you about an insecurity he senses. It's not a compliment, but also not an insult.   \n\nENTJs definitely notice people's weaknesses and all too often we ignore delicate sensibilities and just point them out. If you've only known him for a few days and it's already bothering you that might become a serious problem. I've got two reasons there's hope for you though: 1. He probably judges himself more harshly than anyone else including you. So if he points out one negative thing about you a day remember he also noticed three flaws of his own that day. 2. Since you just met he is observing you a lot more closely than normal. His teasing / negative observations should decrease with time. That said, don't wait for that, have a proper argument about it asap. If you're right about his type he'll appreciate directness. He can dish it out, he can take it.   \n\n>he's like really forward and kinda decides like everything   \n\nThis goes back to that first remark: You don't strike me as the kind of person who is comfortable making decisions. ENTJs are impatient, to put it mildly. You'll have to watch out that you don't become his yes-woman simply by not speaking up. Never assume he can read your mind. State the (to you) obvious. I doubt he has any idea you find him too pushy.   \n\n>Is this normal for entj guys or should I be worried?   \n\nThis is an interesting question, made me chuckle. What does it matter if he's "ENTJ"? Either you're okay with the way he treats you or not. We can't tell you that.
0	Tell him that his dick is small.\n
0	How do you guys trash talk	The way I trash talk is I goto their deepest points and that's when I dominate. I always like to win because I feel superior so how about you ENTJ's?
22	I don't, it's not dignified. And if you're spending time talking shit, you're getting behind.
8	This post is utter shit.
5	If you are skilled you shouldn't need trash talking. 
4	It's all about having an air of authority... about how you carry yourself. That people just know you are packing heat without speaking a word...\n\nPresence speaks volumes. What do you look like when you sit in a room? \n\nTrash-talkers are little nits who are trying to find their place in life. They are of little consequence to the big fish in the room, to the power players.   \n\nI just read 13yo... I was a loner at 13. AP classes, doing my own thing - people though I was odd. I liked that. Aloof. Air of mystique. I read alone often. I had a friend. I had more teachers as friends. \n\nFocus on your grades and getting ahead in school. Your persona should not be a mouthy twit... might try for the weirdo brain. Good luck.  \n
3	ENFP here, but I have one ENTJ friend and they have never once engaged in trash talking someone, for as long as I've known them. They dislike a lot of people- we've had some conversations about certain people and exactly *why* they dislike those people, but when they come face to face with these people, you'd never know. \n\nThe ENTJ I'm friends with is polite to everyone, but I think I can detect a layer of *cold* when we run into someone I know they actively dislike. I just don't think they want to waste the energy on being outwardly hostile. It'd be beneath them imo. \n\nI'd hate to see my ENTJ genuinely angry though, as I imagine that might be a different story. I've seen them irritated, but angry? Man, that'll be an interesting day. 
2	I don't do trash talking, I find it below my level.
2	With the sweetest of smiles and the sharpest of blades.
1	The only time I trash talk is when I’m playing games against my friend who I’m super competitive with.  The most it ever comes to is “Dude, why are you so bad haha?” or maybe “Holy shit, you just got fucked on”, but it’s all in good fun.\n\nTrash talking people you’re not friendly with is a good way to piss people off and lose their respect.  People like people who are good at things, but people hate people who rub how good they are in others’ faces.
1	You sound more like an ESTP or ENTP, they're into one-upmanship for the sake of it.\n\nIf anything ENTJs have temper tantrums when things don't go according to plan.
1	How do i confidently speak my mind?	Hey guys,\n\nJust to put a few things in perspective before i ask my question.\n\nI've done the 16personalities test and i keep coming up as an E = 52%, N = 55%, T = 69%, J = 64% - Assertiveness = 76%\n\nOut of all the tv shows and movies that i love, Ari Golds character from Entourage is my favourite. I can see a lot of myself in that character but especially his immature way of dealing with his anger. I can get really frustrated and angry when people at work are incompetent,  lazy and ignorant.\n\nHow do i become more outspoken as I'm getting angry or frustrated to relieve those emotions before i explode? I find i bottle it up until it i cant take anymore and i hate feeling that stress. Is it a matter of just practice makes perfect or are there other techniques i can try? Ive tried googling but is really no help.\n\nI've tried being more aware of my rising anger and frustration and try to slow down, take a break or walk away but sometimes at work, I'm a retail manager, i dont have the time to do so and i end up raising my voice at staff and all respect for them flies out the window. *cringe*\n\nThanks in advance.
5	Personally, I don't put much stock in online tests or the percentages they yield. If you understand jung's cognitive functions and in good faith you classify as ENTJ, that's great. If that 52% E is really an outlier and you're INTJ, that's great too. My advice isn't type-specific but I thought I'd add that disclaimer just in case. \n\nFor me, I am constantly putting things in perspective towards something greater. When I'm healthy and motivated, the irritating things people say and do are easy to brush off because my focus is entirely on something more pressing -- work, academics, personal relationships, etc. When I'm stressed out and on edge, that's when I start getting bogged down in picking apart everything people say and do. I get distracted from the forest and start chainsawing through the trees. \n\nWhatever those areas are in your life that you genuinely care about and invest in, keep those as a constant reference point. At work, you're there to make money and remain professional. That doesn't change based on what other people do. Part of being a successful leader is the ability to create value independent of anyone else's help or validation. Personally, because I'm highly competitive, I treat it as almost a personal challenge against myself to stay focused and productive even in the most irritating situations. Re-framing it as "oh, this is supposed to be irritating, gotcha" works a lot better than expecting more from people, only to be inevitably let down. \n\nI wish I had something more concrete for you, but I'd be lying if I said I found any value in meditation or some other generic solution. Focusing on your own constant improvement as opposed to leading every horse to water is the best I've got for you. 
1	Here's what I've found about being outspoken:\n\nI used to be very reserved, afraid of 'proving myself the fool' as the saying goes.  I worked on it to the point of being gregarious and outwardly aggressive sometimes and it's had its ups and downs.\n\nYou will miss opportunities if you feel like you have something to say but don't speak up, it's ALWAYS worth the risk of being wrong.\n\nHowever, you will also miss opportunities if you speak up aggressively.  People will quickly, reflexively stop listening when they feel threatened, or even don't like the tone you're using.\n\nTry speaking up using these guideline:\n\n* "I'm concerned that...", "I think that..."\n* Stick to the facts\n* #1 interest for Managers and HR: themselves, #2 is the company's money\n* If you're unsure, say that.  "Help me understand..."  "Do I have this right...?"\n\nAnother great bit of advice, working for a UK based company as an American, "It's more about what you don't say than what you do say", so for a difficult employee you don't say they are crap, but you also never have anything good to say about them.  It's incredibly effective.\n\nEdit: In the end though, communication is only a tool and you can only convince those willing to be convinced.  Confidence is the biggest factor in getting people to follow you, and confidence is built through trusting your own decisions and taking action when you need to.
3	INTP Attraction	What do you find attractive about INTPs?
12	They are rational, can be excellent do-er's if not broken, have the most beautiful authentic smiles if they do; they reason, self improve, question everything, faithful as fuck and enjoy being pulled out of their comfort zone a bit to experience the Ne and Fe. What is there not to love?
9	Smarter generally than the average bear. Not to diss any bears reading here.
10	They are fascinating. It is like having someone who is a mirror of yourself (mirror functions and all). You're interested in the same issues, but the opposite sides of it. You can come to similar conclusions for polar opposite reasons, or equally have the same values and yet come to different conclusions. \n\nWhile I've ruined my relationship with an INTP by being enitrely immature, overbearing, and plenty of other things, just the memory is quite stimulating and motivational, and even years later I occasionally end up realizing that something they thought or said before was actually, in retrospect, entirely right. 
6	I don't. \n\nBut to be more helpful, a close ENTJ friend of mine is currently in a happy relationship with an INTP female. He has driven many relationships into the ground, mostly because his other partners couldn't challenge him intellectually and so he'd end up neglecting them for work & etc. With her, I think her intellect and ability to make him question the path he's on (in a healthy way) makes him value her time a lot more than he is accustomed to. Being the "alpha" partner is great and all, but it is nice to have someone who does more than validate you emotionally. She is able to be that for him as an INTP, and so from his perspective the pairing is obviously fruitful. 
10	Oh where do I begin.\n\n1) They are soooo mentality attractive. You come to the same conclusions and for the same reasons but arrive to the destination from different directions. They can fuck you mentality very well. I enjoy lots...\n\n2) They are full of ideas and as an ENTJ you can organize them and make them real. What fascinates me about INTPs is that they are just full of amazing abstractive ideas waiting to become reality. Even as an ENTJ, they can help you take your ideas to another level. An Idea machine that gives you so many goals and excited tasks. \n\n3) Their mind, their mind, their mind....
6	my wife is INFP, she helps keep me balanced. 
6	I am married to an INTP and have been with him for 7 years. It's wonderful. We solve issues by proposing logical explanations and solutions. When we do vent, it is to get help troubleshooting issues/wierd social  quandaries that come up. He is wonderfully patient and has insight that is so different from mine. Also, he is very loyal, direct, and honest to everyone. All the INTPs I've ever known are like that. Great people. Super interesting. 
2	That they're NTs like me (which feels like being with someone of the same kind), their no-bullshit attitude and their incredibly sweet nature. BTW: my hubby is an INTP.\n\nThe big thing is, that they can and will challenge ENTJs intellectually (which in itself is really rare and amazing)- but there's work to be done emotionally, too. Making it work with someone that has your very shadow functions is the most challenging combination possible (and possibly the most rewarding in terms of personal development). You'll not only need to honestly examine your own weaknesses (which sucks :D), but also learn how to react to weaknesses that are totally contradictory to how you go about life and dealing with conflicts (which sucks even more). \n\nSo, yeah, dating someone with your shadow functions is not for pussies, but so worth it ;D
1	[deleted]
1	I don't find anything attractive about anyone when it comes to that, at least as it pertains to relationships & wanting to be with someone. Sex is completely pointless to me. Does anyone else share the same conclusion?
3	ENTJ's and Psychedelics - what is your experience?	Quick background: I have been researching my MBTI lately to see how I can better mesh with other types. I came across this website, and find that their 4 passenger car analogy to be helpful in explaining: \n[ENTJ - Personality Hacker](https://personalityhacker.com/entj-personality-type/)\nIn this article, they talk about how "perspectives" (Introverted Intuition Ni) is our co-pilot, or Auxillary Cognative Function. They go on to say that developing this function is important as it helps us understand people, makes us more effective leaders, etc etc. \n\nI thought to myself, I think I am actually pretty good at Introverted Intuition. I hate to say it, but it is part of what makes me a very effective social engineer. So I examined myself and tried to figure out HOW I developed this function, and everything points back to a time in my life that I started experimenting with psychedelics, primarily LSD and Mushrooms. It is very hard for me to pinpoint and explain why (perhaps it is in my StrongBox of Feels TM), but I know that it was the crux. \n\nI did some more reading, and unsurprisingly, LSD is used quite often in personal growth. [Here is a podcast by an ENTP regarding psychedelics and personal growth](https://personalityhacker.com/podcast-episode-0158-psychedelics-and-personal-growth/)\n\nSo my question to this subreddit: What is your experience? 
8	Acid is pretty sweet. 
3	There are those who approach psychedelics as though it’s just another way to get high. For me and my SO, it’s more of a spiritual journey. \n\nSpirituality is separate from a belief in any religion or god, one can be a religious zealot and spiritually stunted at the same time. Spirituality also doesn’t actually require a belief in a soul or spirit, which is why there should be a better word for it. \n\nWe identify as atheist, but actually our idea of a god is more pantheistic (i.e., Spinoza’s God) and mathematical in nature. \n\nLSD allows me to directly experience what I identify as the closest thing to a god that I believe exists: that feeling of universal oneness, that we’re all strands in a singular, interwoven, ever-expanding, and eternal fabric of consciousness. In these experiences, you become more of a god yourself. You can feel your power and purpose, even if you can’t put it into words. I recommend it. \n\nI’ve never had a bad trip. Neither has my INTP boyfriend, and he’s done it far more times and has taken greater doses than I have. We’ve taken the standard dose once per year (every New Year’s Eve) for the last several years. We don’t have the opportunity as often as we did when we were younger unfortunately. \n\nWe did experiment with microdosing for a period of time last year, that was also a positive experience. Science is well aware of the therapeutic value of LSD, it’s being used in clinical trials for PTSD and other mental illnesses as we speak. DMT is a different animal, I’d recommend gaining some experience with mushrooms and acid before going there.\n
2	very insightful and spiritual experience on shrooms. felt like i was looking into my subconscious fears and worries and what was holding me back. realized that the extremely high expectations i set for myself in life ( school, friendships, etc) was causing me a lot of stress and that i can lower them a bit to make myself less stressed and happy. felt very peaceful and at one with the universe, like nothing could ever make me worry every again. some cool visuals. 10/10 would do again, can’t wait to try acid! 
1	Tried coke once. Almost fought with a soldier in the toilets of a club, then left the club a few hours later with three empty glasses hidden in my pants (to steal them). I still have the glasses.
6	What are artistic jobs that fit the ENTJ-personality?	Hi my fellow ENTJ-types,\nI am approaching high school graduation in Germany and I am looking for things to study at university/jobs alltogether that fit the ENTJ-personality but have artistic elements to them, as I can't imagine being an entrepeneur/politician or something like that, which is apparently the stereotypical thing to do for people like us.\nAny recommendations?
7	I'm a theatre student, I'm an ENTJ that adores the creative process. I realised my analytical side requires depth and the ability to deconstruct ideas. I went to a pretty good business school at first to study accounting & finance, it was there I realised I need to engage BOTH my creative and analytical skills. As I've continued in my current studies, I've realised my ENTJ habits lead me towards problem solving and leadership, which has allowed me to do rather well when directing and providing a creative vision.\n\n\nBeing an ENTJ doesn't mean you can't be creative, I often describe myself as 'an ENTJ with introverted interests' - Figure out what makes you enjoy X, Y or Z, do what we ENTJ's do best, reverse engineer and analyse! Hope this helps ;)
6	Do what you wanna do- don’t put yourself in a box because you’re “ENTJ”. Personally I studied STEM and did a music degree at the same time. Now I work in the IT field, am taking business courses part time, and play in an orchestra. Do whatever you wanna do to fill that creative outlet, whether it’s a career or a hobby. 
5	I am a self-made woodworker! I get to do all the business-y side of things and control the direction of my company, while also pursuing an art craft. I went from nothing to fully self-employed within 3 months, and have now been supporting myself for 3 years on my way to financial independence.\n\nSo my recommendation- self-employment through starting your own artsy business!
2	I'm a musician but I wouldn't say it fits the entj personality 
2	Any. You’ll just be driven to lead people, most likely, and maybe not be the best at the field itself, or maybe you will. In music, you’ll be happiest as first chair and then director. Theater, producer. Doctor, medical director... for me, it’s been that I enjoy working with people more talented than me and then leading those people. I bought my own business...
2	I would say all artistic jobs can benefit from the overlook of an entj. Art needs audience and patrons. Entj excels at analysing the market and its ebbs and flows. A musician entj would know how to maximize his fame or income through such an analysis. He would have carved his career path so that he wouldnt be left with a very unpopular, unmonetizable skill that he does with “passion”. He can compromise his talents, flairs and inclinations with current trends in the industry, hence reaching both prestige, financial stability and ample career satisfaction.\n
2	I don't know why you can't imagine being in a stereotypical profession, but any art like theater or filming—really all arts involving more than just one person—need directors and planners, etc if you want to just be part of the process. If you want to be painter, photographer, musician YOURSELF, that is just a personal choice, so do it if that is what you want your life to revolve around.\n\nSure they can guide you, but no personality type or stereotype can tell you what's right or wrong for you.
1	While leading people is a natural skill for me, i realize that i love producing fine art more because i dont have to rely on anyone to complete each painting i make.  
1	* Architecture (including landscape architecture - designing parks and stuff) \n* Civil engineering - design, construction, and maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment (roads, bridges, airports, etc)\n* Urban planning - deciding how available land will be used\n* Game Developer\n\n\nHonestly, you will probably be good at whatever you decide to do, as long as you enjoy it.
1	just do what you want and are passionate about. you'll be good at anything you do, so long as you love it.
1	I do creative writing. Let's me unwind from work.
1	Film / TV Producer. You're the boss on a creative project, but a lot of the day-to-day work is business, finance, people management, selling, negotiations, etc. which suits an ENTJ well. 
1	I'm not an ENTJ, but interestingly, I've found Fi to be the best to use as a guide for what you want to be in terms of careers. Like an idiot, I was basing what I wanted to be on my Ti, Ne, and Si. I thought those careers were my passion. They're not. Passion stems from Fi and only Fi. You won't find your passion relying on any of your other functions.\n\nI was also judging some by salary, thinking "$80,000 per year seems like a comfortable salary" Then, I realized how stupid that was.\n\nRealistically, I spend VERY little money, so I wouldn't need an $80K salary.
1	Taking over the world in the most beautiful and elegant of manners, all perfectly executed through a graceful dance and climaxed like a D2 agonist with no receptor down regulation.
1	This line of work requires an extensive portfolio. What were your artistic interests in school? You could study design, web design, architecture, game design or become a concept artist.  You could study film as well, as I have a huge interest in independent and foreign art films.
1	It may not be immediately obvious but sport is a good choice. Hard to make fuck-you-money but freaking satisfying.
2	Songs you connect to as an ENTJ	So I've been listening to Dessa's new song 5 out of 6 almost on repeat for the last week. I was thinking about why I like it so much, and came to the conclusion it is due to the fact that it (and actually of lot of Dessa's other music), exemplifies an ENTJ approach to the world. I was curious if other people had songs that they enjoy because they connect to them through their personality type.\n\n[Spotify Link](https://open.spotify.com/track/4qIPSgvqri8XcirtRO6KjP)\n[Lyrics link ](https://genius.com/Dessa-5-out-of-6-lyrics)
3	I'm not sure being an ENTJ has much to do with taste in music. My musical tastes have changed a lot just over the natural course of aging and growing increasingly grumpy.\n\nAs I get older I find myself liking jazz and classical more. Especially Beethoven. Love me some Beethoven.
3	Caro emerald - I belong to you\nWelshly arms - I’m a Wanted Man\nFerrante and Teitcher - the moon was yellow\nZebra Katz - LST CTRL\nXiu Xiu - Sharp Dressed Man
1	[this is a pretty good song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STh0PaH1LjA)
1	I’ve been repeating Margaret Glaspy- You and I for the past few days.  I also like The Delta Riggs-Baddest Motherfucker in the Beehive
1	IDLES - DIVIDE AND CONQUER
1	[:F](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us2ylGAwBnk)
1	Cash Cash, Busta Rhymes, B.O.B., Neon Hitch - Devil\n\nI'm from the responsibly hedonistic and reckless breed of ENTJs. If it makes me happy, I'll do it. If I like it, I'll do it. If I want it, I'll do whatever it takes to get it. All that matters is that it isn't harmful and the consequences aren't long term/can be resolved. \n\nThis song is what made me realise I'm to blame for things that I've gotten myself into in the past. I've been dancing with the devil because I'm the one who approached him first. I calculate my risks and watch my back so damn well that I know exactly what I can get away with and how to get away with it. I play with fire when I can just because I can. All I have to lose is my family. Other than them, nothing else matters to me which is probably why I'm able to stretch my limits so far.
2	Taunts and passive-aggressive behaviour	I find the use of taunts and other manipulative means to express displeasure incredibly cowardly. As fellow entjs, can you relate? Also, whenever someone behaves this way my knee-jerk reaction is to show condescension/pity or call out the person for... well, cowardice. I recognise however that this is not good especially considering the percentage of people from other types in the world, who are conflict averse. How do I deal with such behaviour in a constructive manner?
7	I can’t stand people who use emotional blackmail to get what they want. Let’s face that some types are known for using fear, obligation, and guilt as staple tools in their arsenal more so than others. I think it’s so weak and low-level. I cut everyone who does too much of this out of my life in my early-mid 20’s, including my own father. \n\nFor those people you want or have no choice but to expend your energy on, I try to put myself in their head. Pity may not be helpful, but compassion is. Try to understand that they are already infected with a sense of futility and powerlessness, so making them feel even more incompetent doesn’t help the situation. You don’t want to become futile or self-sabotaging in your efforts yourself. Find the diamonds in their composition, focus on them, and help make those aspects shine. Accept the bad that comes along with the good, don’t wage a war against it. Gently guide others through example, and by standing firmly by your own boundaries.\n\nI try to remain very aware of that knee-jerk reaction to shine a spotlight on the inadequacies of others, and of the fact that it usually does more harm than good. It also helps to remember that I myself am not perfect either. I wouldn’t want someone losing complete respect for me because of my faults, I’d want them to look beyond my faults and see all of me. Try to make me a better person through compassion, not a lack of respect. Far easier said than done.
5	I do not have proper context.\n\nI like to meet people's passive-aggressive behavior with my own pa behavior. I act autistic, like I completely misread their intent and show them how I interpreted it. In any case, never show weakness. If you do not react, they will get annoyed and will move on to the next target.\n\nI do take a note of who they are, however.\n
3	I'm like the other poster, I cut them out completely. It's incredibly easy to do so. My most experience with what you're describing is with what I call petty culture and I make no time or consideration for people who espouse petty culture. I *somewhat* think this is a healthy option to do so. Don't bother expending energy towards addressing them
3	Agreed. I never really put up with anything passive aggressive or manipulative. If somebody has something to say they should just say so, even if they think it'd upset me. I respond way way better to honesty than I do to manipulation. And anytime I come across someone prone to these tendencies, I just cut them out of my life as soon as I can.
0	Mind to type me? I get confused with my type	People say am a Te Dom, some Ni dom, ESFP, ESTP, ENFP. Now am mixed up, so I need help on this sub because I get mostly Te Dom.\n\n\nPeople Often call me\nRude/Ignorant\nInsensitive\nMy goals are unrealistic often\nVery arrogant/boastful\nJudgemental \nCurious\n\n\nWhat makes me mad\nLaziness, Dishonesty, trying to piss me off, Stupidity\n\nGroup roles usually\nEditor/PPT Maker and all about tech\nUsually i am the one who manages.\n\nValues\nFamily, Intelligence, \n\nWhen seeing a problem\nI often see the result. For example, i heard that this guy was doing drugs. I often think about, so if i do drugs then this will happen to me. If this happens to me(i know its bad) then i will not do it\n\nDisorders\nDepersonalization\n\nAge: 13(am done doing stuff already)\n\nNOTE: I am not cherry picking. This is what people often call me and stuff.

1	Thoughts on Competitive Sports/Gaming?	
5	For me, if I'm competing on something by myself or games where there can be only one winner - I'm not as invested. The prospect of winning doesn't mean anything to me and it just feels arbitrary anyway.\n\nBut, if I play collaborative competitive games (League of Legends, Dead by Daylight for examples) I get a lot more drive to win. Winning with other people gives me a real sense of accomplishment and our collective struggle feels like we build meaning.\n\nDas just me tho ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
2	I don't do it because of the injuries, can't be ill/disabled for work.\n\nBut I loved to compete in judo... Got a bad head trauma and had to give it up. :(
2	I always get to the "good but not enough for competition" level, whether at sport or games I practice much. I am fine with it, as long as I won't try to get a living or achieve something in these domains.\n\nI once had such laser focus, for a simracing championship event I was taking on. I trained hard and prepared, and achieved a 2nd place on a hour long race, against people who trained with Nissan's GT Academy finalists ([and even a winner](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ga%C3%ABtan_Paletou) - though I personally never raced with them). Since then, I know I can rise myself to a good level of simracing if I wish to. It was a lot of efforts though.
2	Love competition/gaming domination of any kind. 
2	I used to play games WHOLE DAYS-WEEKS-YEARS. \n\nAddictive as hell, but I must live, so i treat it as recreation. 
1	i really miss playing softball like all the time. it was the only sport i ever loved. i've played a few different ones, but i loved softball so much and i was *good* at it. i'd like to try roller derby someday, too. i feel like my super competitive nature would be perfect there.
1	I've always been naturally competitive, but as I've gotten older it's more about the group win than individual. This works well at work where I'm supervising groups. In sports/games I feel I've shifted from "must win" to "must have fun". The most competitive sport I do now is adult kickball, and it's a blast. When we have game nights, it's all about laughing at ourselves and each other.\n\nI'm also a road cyclist and prefer riding on my own or with one person rather than in large groups. I know... not very ENTJ of me. While I'm very E, my resets tend towards I.
2	Any ENTJ's here ever worked as a plane pilot in the defence force or for commercial airlines? Did you enjoy it?	I'm looking at going into the RAAF as a pilot and hoping to fly fighter aircraft as it's something that I find very impressive and unique and it seems like a challenging and exhilarating job. \n\nHas anyone ever done anything like this? I have no doubts I'd enjoy doing it if I can get the job, just wondering if any if you guys have any experience to give. \n\nCheers. 
2	I have my private pilot’s license with an instrument rating. I absolutely love flying. Might have done it as a living except for a few issues, mostly my family health history.
2	How did you find your strengths in the workplace?	I find that I don't stand out of the crowd in terms of my technical skills. I am actually not that detail oriented on some of the technical requirements either.\n\nAll I know is that I am a bit more outgoing and capable of negotiating than my peers. Not sure if this even means much, since I am sure there are plenty of talented people at this.\n\nI now stand as an ENTJ without anything that I feel distinguishes me.\n\nI am 22 and got into the defense industry 8 months ago.\n\nI had ambitions to be like Elon musk and all the greats, just to be able to make a dramatic mark in history and help the world in some unique way. Sadly, I just don't know how I am standing out from the crowd.
7	Purchase Strengths Finder 2.0 book on Amazon, read it, take included assessment, find opportunities to leverage them to see your magic. Certified Life Coach here.
2	Seems like two choices.\n\n* One, trade your defense industry job for a job in a startup.\n\n* Two, keep watching your dreams die. 
2	I'm pretty good at poking holes and dissecting technical topics in friendly conversations. Most coworkers are good coders, but they don't have much opinions about how to do things the best (at least out loud). Helped me loads in job interviews.
2	Oh yeah not like negotiating isnt one of the most valuable skills in the world or anything /s\nBeing a people person will get you everywhere, if you can enhance that skill with leadership you will be going places.\n\nA book I would recommend is: *How to win friends and influence people*, yes the title is highly off putting but thats cause it was written nearly a hundred years ago, and you know what, the skills it teaches are pretty timeless cause people have stayed the same for pretty much the past million gazillion years.\n\nGood luck boi.
1	Are you looking to be an inventor/scientist "like Elon Musk and all the greats" or just looking to make a significant impact on history? \n\nWhat field do you work in?  It sounds like you don't think that you're exceptionally skilled in your field, at least compared to your peers.  To stand out you may work more diligently, efficiently, or take the lead at work.  Is there a particular way you feel that you don't stand out compared to your peers?\n\nWhat skills do you have?  Where do your passions lay?  What is your long term goal?\n\nCould you find a field of work in which you Excel?
1	Have you considered getting into engineering sales?
7	Have you ever been threatened? How do you handle it?	Hi,\n      Serious question.\n       I grew up in a bad area where people are not educated and resort to violence and threatening others in order to try and resolve conflicts. \n      For example, recently someone wrote a false ad on Craigslist claiming something was free. When speaking with him he told me he wanted to get around 100 for the item that was listed as free. I told him to stop wasting people's time with a false ad. He then threatened to slap me, and beat me up. He stated he was from a Lowell, MA and that I better watch out.\n      Personally, I find these people the lowest of society. Why resort to violence to solve your problems? Anyway, should I retaliate with equally as violent remarks? Or do as I usually do and just ignore the threats and move on? The second option makes me feel like a pussy, but it is very smart to do. 
11	People who like to sling baseless insults and jabs from a safe distance are very weak individuals. Recognizing that is the easiest way to ignore it. You don't need to hurt them back, they are already broken. Uneducated people such as the one you described only make their flaws easier to observe. He is obviously living a very miserable life. Let it stay that way.
2	Though difficult at times I say ignore and move on. Worrying about how you will look to such an irrational and ignorant person is a fool's errand and is a waste of energy.\n
2	You have an address for this neanderthal?\n\nHe didnt cause actual harm, so I get petty - carry his info around with me for a while - then sign him up for viagra, animal fetish sites, racist or white supremist sites -  other stuff that might offend him, based on what you know about him. I travel often, so I can do this out of state. I have a few people receiving weirdo mags at their home address. It was worth the subscription price (money order, through the mail). \n\nActual harm, I get a bit more creative... I have police and attorney friends.

1	If someone threatens me, I lose any basic respect for that person and become hostile towards them (at least in thought).\n\nI almost always ignore verbal threats or call their bluffs, I try to prepare for physical threats.\n\nOnce a thug came up to me begging for money. He said he'd recently got out of jail and that he was a nice guy because he was only asking, most people pull a knife from the start. Then he told me he had a knife on him too, of course. \nAt that point I told him to fuck off.\nIt was a very public place with cameras everywhere so I knew he wouldn't do anything.\nHe looked pissed, even lost his voice a little as he ran away.
1	i call him on his low logic and poor philosophy.  \nrarely back down, rarely ignore
1	Don't engage and give the worth of your time to this individual as if they deserve it. 
1	I just ignore these kinds of people, throw a witty remark that insult their intelligence and flies over their head, and be done with 'em.
6	How to deal with massive failure in life	Hello ENTJ friends.\n\nI just recently failed to pass trhouhg an interviewing process to a job that I literaly spent two weeks on sleepless nights studying and working on getting it. \n\nIt was later said that it lacked me some more profound knowledge on the topic being tested (software engineering to be specific) and they told me to apply later this year.\n\nI really feel useless right now even though I honestly *get it*... How do you guys deal with feelings of failure overall?
14	Failures always serves a future bigger victory. What you learned and experienced isn't meaningless, you're better prepared for anything in the like that might come to you.

5	I use logic. Last week I took a test for a software gig. Pretty sure they didn't like my answers because I haven't heard back. Many of my answers where about why this was a poor question.\n\nMany years ago in an interview I was asked the 9 dots 4 lines puzzle. I'd already heard about the puzzle so I pretended to *try and figure out*, trying different ways, which the interviewer delighted in seeing me struggle, and then after about 30 seconds "Oh, yeah, here" and did the standard out of the box *solution*. He thought I was a fucking genius. That company came at me hard trying to hire me. I didn't want anything to do with them. The test showed they were morons and easily manipulated. And sure enough that startup failed shortly after.\n\nAt Microsoft decades I ago they brought me in for an interview. One dude wanted me to write a function for finding the previous node in a linked list. Obviously he wanted to know if I knew what recursion was. Instead of doing what he wanted I change the single linked list to a double linked list and no recursion was needed. He tried to explain more to try and get me to write that super clever recursion function. I explained the benefit of speed vs memory use. Became clear to me this dude was a close minded robot I'd never want to work with. I cancelled the rest of the interviews and went to the zoo. Better use of my time.\n\nI have never taken a job where one of these moronic tests are given. If management is so bad they can tell a good candidate from a bad one just by talking to them I sure don't want to be a part of that company. Tests tell more about the interviewer than the candidate.\n\nThat's my logic. 
4	Typically I take failure very hard. However once the moping begins to recede, maybe talk to a trusted friend who can put things in perspective? \nAnd then next time maybe prepare for more than two weeks? The bright side is that they are willing to consider you in the future and you know what exactly to work on! Go ahead and plug away at it, I'm sure you'll get the job the next time around!\n
4	At least you failed forward.\n\n> It was later said that it lacked me some more profound knowledge on the topic being tested (software engineering to be specific) and they told me to apply later this year.\n\nIf you want to get hired at the same place, then write down everything that you think failed at and study up. A better strategy though would be to apply to lots of different positions.\n\nAlso get some small but clean project going on Github. Employers hate the uncertainty and being able to see the code that you wrote will be worth more than a very long conversation.\n
3	I find that I withdraw, think about my next move and get the fuck on with it. We're ENTJ's OP, when we have failed or when there is no way, we get back up and make a way for whatever it is we want to happen, happen.
2	You don't know what happened. Maybe someone's secret lover was hired. Thank them for the opportunity, feedback and keep moving on. Find something better.

11	As an ENTJ, what is your primary creative outlet?	
10	[deleted]
7	Music. I play clarinet, guitar, bass, piano and harmonica. Even though guitar and bass are pretty similar, I'm counting them as separate. 
7	Improving systems I work in or creating new ones. Such as at work, I love taking time to analyze current processes and imagine ways to improve efficiency. At home, me and my girlfriend play Minecraft every night on survival. I love making contraptions to automate the farming of resources in our world, even if I'm never gonna use the stuff. 
3	For vastly different urges: dancing and writing (fiction). Original choreography and stories, mostly.
3	music. i produce hiphop beats for fun\n
5	Writing short stories and dancing!
3	Guitar, vocals, and writing music.
2	I run a large facebook page and just got back int9 making fine art.
2	Dancing (Kpop, hiphop)
2	Photography. I've always been interested in it and took it very seriously in high school and during my undergraduate studies. I do still take the odd creative shot but it has been replaced by writing, which complements my studying law :)
2	Programming.
2	conflict  
4	Genitals
1	Playing video games, mostly league of legends
1	Playing guitar & hobbyist programming. 
1	I write raps, I play bass, and I play guitar.  \n\nFor me, rapping is amazing for emotional release.  \nI don’t publish anything, but I like looking for beats on youtube and writing raps to them.  \nBass has been my thing since I was 13, and even though I’m only okay at it, it’s really fun and gives me something to try really hard at.  I only picked up guitar recently and I’m not super dedicated, but it’s way easier to doodle on than bass.
0	I like to play the drums in my spare time. I might do some creative writing as well, depending on my mood and attention span.
2	Seeking advice on how to deal with emotions.	Hi all. So, I was talking with one of my coworkers(from HR department) about my plan to jump ship next month. I thought he was a friend but he apparently didn't think so. A manager in our company, walked up to me and said"I'm gonna have a position opening in my department and I hope you'll  apply for it." \n\nI'd rather work as a janitor than work in his department. I'm not sure if I'm mad at my "work friend" or at myself. Probably more mad at myself though. How do you guys deals with such intense emotions?
8	Learning experience. Why would you ever trust HR? Game theory. Their job is to help smooth out conflicts in the company and sweep things under the rug and to keep employees from running away and ... \n\n> I'd rather work as a janitor than work in his department\n\nFalse dichotomy. You could work as a janitor in his department.\n
3	I did something recently that bit me in the ass. \n\nI plotted revenge for a day or so, then decided I had to chalk it up to a learning experience. \n\n**NEVER SHOW YOUR HAND!**\n\nYou're mad at yourself. You blew it. You should have never revealed your plans. \n\nJust play dumb or say no thank you to the other manager. Cat's out of the bag now. \n\nI was kicking myself hard for a few days, I guess that's how I dealt with it, but I knew the mature thing to do was to just learn from it. \n\nI can only call myself an idiot for so long... \n\n
2	Wait for them to dissipate. It gets pretty intense though. Try not to make any major decisions when you’re angry. 
2	You're mad at both. You made a mistake in trusting someone you shouldn't have and your coworker betrayed your trust. Of course you feel angry, it's only reasonable. Don't try to fight that. Don't be led astray by it either, just experience it and acknowledge it. It will pass in its own time.\n\nTo answer your general question, find useful and productive outlets. If you have a lot of angry energy, exercise. If you're obsessing about an issue then analyze it, plan some contingencies, work out exactly how you're going to deal with it and then execute on that. And if everything is a mess and you need to clear some space in your head, /u/FrearKa makes a good recommendation - start writing it down. If you're like me you'll destroy or encrypt it afterwards, but forcing yourself to find words can go a long way towards sorting things out, and it's a relief to externalize some of the overflow.
2	I don't see him revealing this affecting you in any way. It's a step forward that you found out what his priorities are. Don't change behavior imo, no reason to be more guarded.
1	Be 100% honest about them with myself and accept they may never change. 
1	Clichéd, but I journal. I sometimes don't even know what I am feeling, or why I am feeling it. It's not until its out on the paper that I have a better idea of what is going on...and maybe what to do about it. I'm trying to get better at it.
1	It depends on which type of emotion you're talking about and the circumstances surrounding why I'm feeling it. \n\nIf I'm frustrated, honestly it passes pretty quickly. People irritate me every day and so it's on me to deal with that and move on. Actual anger is a different story but generally my willpower is enough to stop anything too reckless. I try not to drink or get behind the wheel when I'm angry, it's just not safe. Can't really recall "intense happiness" lately so I'm drawing a blank there. \n\nAnd as a far as sadness or grief, I've reached a point in my life where I make a conscious effort to experience it. I think that's a huge problem for Fi-inferiors to deal with -- delayed grief. My dad just died this morning and honestly it didn't move the needle at all, but I've been trying to force it out of myself since that's what a "normal" or healthy response should be. 
2	Mentoring	Need help on how to mentor someone.\n\nI'm the immediate past/founding president in a leadership organization, members are high school and college aged, and the current President and Advisor have asked me to mentor the executive VP.  We're about half way through the term, and just getting back up after a rough patch.\n\nThe VP is a 16 year old girl who doesn't have much initiative, but when I've worked with her on previous projects she's done well in tight time slots.\n\nHer direct responsibilities are broad and the organization is still growing, after quite a bit of shrinking, so a lot of the things that she's supposed to maintain have not been started yet.\n\nAny advice on mentoring someone who can perform well, but doesn't initiate the process?
1	>The VP is a 16 year old girl\n\nWait, what?!
1	What incredibly vague terms.\n\n1. What gave you the impression that she "doesn't have much initiative"?\n2. How long do you expect to be mentoring this girl and what are your goals for the relationship?\n3. Have you talked with her about her own plans and goals in regard to the Executive VP position? There's a world of difference between her treating it as just a thing to put on college applications versus something she is taking on as a personal passion project.\n4. How receptive is she to the idea of mentoring and to you in particular? Does she know you, how much does she trust you?
3	Biggest dumbass I've ever met tested as an...ENTJ!	I was surprised. I was certain that he was either autistic or had Aspergers syndrome, possibly INTJ, but apparently he's one of us, ENTJs!\n\nHere are his annoying personality habits (might be specific to his culture):\n\n1. overbearing\n2. irrational (does not understand formal logic)\n3. uses argument ad hominems or argument from authority as his main arguments \n4. completely ignorant about many topics, unwilling to open his mind\n5. racist, xenophobe\n6. cannot admit he is wrong even when given credible evidence, scientific evidence and evidence based knowledge\n7. stalkerish\n8. sends off a succession of 10 emails in a row, even when you don't respond to him! \n9. emotionally volatile personality\n10. completely lacking in emotional intelligence\n11. overweight, probably on a bunch of pharma drugs\n\nHe is a "scientist" who knows relatively little about science or his field of expertise and not up to date with current research. \n\nI'm wondering if science education is broken? People like him scare me, they should not be put in charge of anything. I'm 80% sure he has some sort of brain memory problem or other type of problem in which he can't access the analytical (frontotemporal) part of his brain. \n\nWhat do you guys think? How is this guy one of us?
22	I have a friend who married a doctor. This doctor thinks there are two different kinds of screwdrivers — one to screw in a screw, and one to unscrew it.\n\nScientists/doctors/anybody can be stupid. Good luck with that.
10	Every type has got it's share of dumbasses. You just found one of ours.
8	Stupidity is a desease and does not discriminate via type. 
5	There is no "us", that's not how MBTI works.
5	Block him. I used to think it was cruel to ignore annoying people, then I realised not everyone might find them annoying, and it’s probably crueler to pretend to like someone. Plus, no more annoying guy.
3	You are not impressed by him and I was not impressed by you and some INTP simultaneously claimed to be way smarter than me as well as him being a fucking moron at the same time.\n\nYeah ... per Reddit measuring contests, your friend must be very dumb.\n
3	Maybe he is on the spectrum? The two aren’t mutually exclusive. Why are you hanging around someone you don’t appear to respect?
3	First of all, if he's that crazy then he's not in a healthy state and no personality test is going to be remotely accurate. He even might be an ENTJ somewhere deep down, but he clearly isn't "like us" right now so what does the label matter?   \n\nSecondly, given your username as context it's 100% confirmed that this man is sexually obsessed with you. I hope for your sake that you've already caught on to this, if not you've got some learnin' to do. No man is going to send a woman chains of ignored emails without planning your future life as a happy couple in his head. He's probably browsing flower and jewelry stores as you're reading this and if you don't shut him down asap he will propose to you in a room full of people you know. Get uncomfortable. The longer you act "normal" or ignore him the more he'll build up his delusions of a growing connection and having a chance with you.   \n\nAnecdote to illustrate how not to handle the situation: I've lately been thinking about this problem from the female POV because I have a friend who is being low-key followed around by a weirdo in our classes for months now but she keeps a poker face or even a polite face and interacts with him like he's a normal person. She's a helpful type and she probably rationalizes her behaviour as the decent thing to do - but it's the reason he sticks around. SJWs will call that victim blaming but it's the reality of the situation. If she was rude to him just once he would stop trying. He's not a confident guy, the mildest rejection would put him in his place. In fact it has in the past. He previously did the same thing to another friend of ours and that only stopped when she and another friend would start avoiding him physically, literally changing seats to get away from him, childish high school shit. That's how I know ignoring is not enough. There need to be concrete signs of dislike or he will pretend he's being accepted. In MBTI terms there's an overabundance of Fe in the group so it's vulnerable to instances of "that guy" that inserts himself into a social group and ignores any hints that nobody there likes him. As the sole Fe-free asshole in the group I could bully this dude off the campus in 2 seconds if asked nicely, but nobody's asking and I'm not gonna risk my own reputation over other people's need to create problems for themselves. This frustration has honestly brought me close to just abandoning the group and looking for new friends. Since you're allegedly ENTJ you should be capable of dishing out some unmistakable rejection so get it over with and do that the next chance you get.
2	Eugenics.
1	I find your description suspect, I bet you are no saint.
1	First of all- personality typing is just sorting people by their answers on a personality test, which is just as indicative of how the person sees themselves as how they actually are. It's horoscopes for people who think they're too smart to believe in horoscopes. (Proud ENTJ over here btw, also an aquarius so I'm pretty emotional).\n\nMaybe he's a total fucking tool, in which case I'm sorry you met him. I'm going to devils-advocate here not to be a dick but to show that you're skewing the narrative in your head. If you analyze your thoughts better and he still comes down as the asshole this comment is completely my bad and I apologize in advance.\n\nBut pulling out the logical fallacy shit in a conversation is a sure way to end it and not convince the other person of anything. Accusing people of refusing to open their mind is pretty fucking low, maybe you're just wrong. You can't just throw that around, it's impossible to refute. Sometimes "evidence" isn't good, maybe he's better at recognizing bad data than you. Racism is wrong, xenophobia is wrong, but sometimes people call stuff racist or xenophobic that isn't actually racist or xenophobic. That's for the marginalized party to decide, if they're ever put in a position to do so which itself is rarer than people like to think. Maybe he needs a response from you. Maybe this emotionally volatile personality is just a response to your provocation.  And if a person is on a bunch of "pharma drugs-" maybe they're really fucking sick. Some people struggling with depression, or thyroid dysfunction, or ADHD, or kidney disease, or diabetes should be on a "pharma drugs." Pharma doesn't mean bad. \n\nBasically OP you seem to care a lot about what this guy thinks despite claiming to dislike him. \n\n*EDIT: Read your further comments and it sounds like you have a cyberstalker. My advice is to report it to authorities. I'm going to preserve the above text as a monument to my stupidity. Cheers OP.*\n\n
7	So what are you currently working on?	Discovery of this subreddit is a nice pass time. So out of curiosity, what is everyone working on, short term goals & long term goals?\n\nShort term: Stay ahead on work (I do art / magic the gathering for a living, some twitch gaming on the side.) & working on a youtube project in the mean time, first 1,000 subs in the next few months, if it goes the way it's looking. After that 10,000, 100,000, etc. This will take a lot of time.\n\nLong term: Gain a large enough following to start impacting the world, change some things, & maybe even write history the way I want before I die.
8	Very short term - cooking dinner. Very long-term - becoming the president of Eurasia.\n
2	Short term - warming up my feet. Not easy when you have bad circulation.\n\nLong term - I'll let you know when I get there. I'm a directionless ENTJ. I didn't do great in school due to mental health issues. Now, at 23, I'm finally getting out of retail and getting into office work. I have no idea where to go from there or what to work toward. For as long as I've been able to think about what I want to be or do for the rest of my life, I've never had an answer. So long term, I'm just trying to figure out what the fuck I should do/be.
3	I have no hobbies, mostly I just like fucking and lifting weights but generally my life is consumed by an educational path which forces me to spend four to five hours a day memorizing arbitrary facts for a massive life-income determining test I'll take in about one calendar year. \n\nLife is ok I guess. 
1	Pass a professional certification is my most short termed goal. Then find an internship, codify my trading strategy, and find a way out (understand, find an entrepreneurship project that would suits me).
1	My hobbies right now are creating a video game company and writing a book.
1	How do you think you can re-write history by being a gamer? Are you going to dethrone PewDiePie and then suddenly switch gears and become the world's most famous conspiracy theorist with 1B followers?\n
7	ENTJ and ENTP	Looking for thoughts from the world dominating masses.\n\nWhen I take the MBTI test,  I have sometimes come up ENTJ,  and other times ENTP.   I did some reading and realized that with no shared functions, I'm not really sure how it could be a mix. \n\nI don't doubt that I'm ENTJ.   I'm driven, previously founded organizations, have multiple long term plans for my future, and have determined my clear goals. \n\nI have a penchant for arguing and being provocative, I can almost always play the devils advocate. I love arguing and debating, and that is driving me to pursue law as my primary long term plan. \n\nI'm not terribly organized in my home, and I can go through couple day periods of complete unproductivity. \n\nI'm enthusiastic, and have decided on a career in public service, though I am open to multiple avenues to get there, which I plan to result in politics at some point. \n\nI identify with ENTJ and ENTP both quite a bit, and when I don't have projects, I seem to be more ENTP.  I prefer myself as an ENTJ, with the confidence, directness, and analytical ability that comes with it. \n\nI don't know if it's possible to move between two personality types in a short period of time, or if I just have a few quirks. \n\nFor added info, I'm about 19 now. \n 
22	If people want to fuck you and hang out with you, then you are an ENTP. If people send you their resumes, then you are an ENTJ.\n
3	If you're confident you are and prefer to be an ENTJ why are you posting this? 
1	Entps and entjs generally share a lot in common. ur what I've noticed is that entjs are more organized and get shit done, they'll tell you things straight up. Entps can sometimes have their own fenders and are mostly mkre charismatic in the "wow this person is an asshole but I still really wanna be their friend" way
1	You sound a lot like me. The J/P is the one where I’m the most split. What makes me ENTJ over P is.. \n\n1. Intimidating people accidentally and not even noticing. (sometimes I intimidate on purpose of course, but I don’t pay adequate attention to the response either way.) \n\n2. Blunt, stubborn, opinionated - but not a ‘devil’s advocate’ type arguer.\n\n3. I see things through to the end. Period. Rubber is hitting the road if I’m around. \n\n4. I’m pushed by others to be a leader even when not seeking that role or responsibility - then ostracized because I’ll never bend to the will of the group. This has happened to me a lot… but I’m 43 so I’ve had more time to mingle ;)  …\n\nThe ENTJ experiences popularity with a side of social alienation. Often we don’t care at all. But about certain things (longterm career goals) we care a lot and it can be devastating to our self esteem. (We typically recover and then are even stronger.) \n\nEither way you’re an extroverted “NT”. Personally I don’t know about all the ‘changes your whole stack’ stuff as I’m fairly new to researching MBTI. These two types both describe me as well, but ultimately I’m an ENTJ. Maybe you’re an ENTP with leadership skills - not a bad shake. \n\nSounds like the career path you’re considering will be a great fit. 
1	Who we are in any given moment can change, so I think saying you're between 2 types is just fine, who we were yesterday, who we are now, and who will be tomorrow, are not the same, sometimes it's gradual, sometimes it's in the moment when something more dramatic happens. In this sense, we're all probably at times, one or more other types, depending on specifics of course 8-)
1	This is kinda neat. I'm having the exact same problems- I am pretty sure I'm ENTJ, but I love ENTPs(most ENTJs don't) and when I've read descriptions I have a lot of similarities with ENTPs. I know I'm an NT but not 100% about anything else.\n\nAs some other people mentioned, socionics was pretty helpful, as it adds some more context to the whole system. I'd especially recommend Gulenko's profiles.
11	What do you want to leave behind after you die?	There are no wrong answers, but this is one of the things I've found myself obsessing with as I'm getting older (mid 30s) I am also curious as to how common "the meaning of life" and stuff in that area of thinking, are thought about amongst other ENTJ types.
11	When I imagine my funeral, I imagine them reading an eulogy written by me, not by those that knew or loved me. I think that’s the selfish part of me. I want to have the final say. 🤷🏻‍♂️ I want them to view me as I viewed myself. One at yo leave behind a strong impression. 
4	I'm middle-aged. My list would be happy, well-adjusted kids, an intellectual legacy (I'm a professor/writer), and a better/stronger community (I'm politically active).  But my kids are #1 without question...most of my adult life has been invested in preparing for/caring for/raising them and they will logically be my legacy.
4	I want to know that I made a difference in somebody's life.  Not at a large level, I'm confident I'll do that, but I'm not sure if my actions will personally affect one person monumentally.   To me,  that is a legacy, giving somebody a piece of you, and them adopting it into themselves.
5	I'd like to leave behind a united family. Aligned in business and mind, people have always told me my family is a secret society family. My dad's a prick and my family on both sides has been divided for a long time. I plan to align mine and my friends together. I want an empire, even if it isn't mine to keep forever, I'll be the one if I can help it to atleast give it a shot and a start. I know all things fall and I don't expect it to last but I want that sense of humor in the trying instilled in my family and my children. I'll give them the hard things my dad never taught me that I had to choose and teach myself. People and kids today are so weak it's ridiculous. Instilling some grit in the ones I love is what i want to see, they don't have to be perfect but I'll give them what I can
3	A group of people who I made happy and feel purposeful and will get on with their lives insted of getting their tears all over my nice mahogany casket. 
3	[deleted]
2	I don't have a will, but I did define beneficiaries in my investment accounts. Some nonprofits, my parents, my ex girlfriend. \n\nThe question of meaning in life doesn't interest me, but I'm convinced of reality and want to advance my interests even if I won't be around to see the effect. 
2	Thanks for that, I appreciate it. I think people do but mostly in a hypothetical sense. To be fair everything is hypothetical until it's realization but there's an intensity few devote to it. I have a lot of friends who are ingenious people with good patents or eyes for business but with little understanding of monetization or structure. They're all talented and have high iqs but as such they're prone to depression and existential depression. Most are so weighted down they can't plan or think of a structure they want to exist in 50 years. As time goes in I've been able to impart my ideals on but it's slow going. 
2	I would like to give my life saving another/others. That way my legacy would be the lives of others.
2	Lots of mini-mes and lots of inventions.
2	i think about this often. i'm 21 but i've faced death a few times and it made me realize how little i have. i want to leave a legacy, but even if that's just some close knit family and friends that's fine. right now, i don't really have anyone. it's freaky to think that if you die few people would notice. :|\n\n\ni always tell my family i want my body turned into a diamond lol. but i think maybe being made into part of the coral reef would be nice. \n\n\nedit: i also think about the meaning of life a lot, but i realize it's something that can't be qualtified. everyone has a different reality and their meaning and reasons are different. for me, i just want to be happy and feel fulfilled. i think that's what everyone should strive towards but most people don't. it makes me sad, but to each their own i guess.

1	I'm not sure. But thinking about it, if I died today, I feel people would rightfully describe me as guarded, certainly not courageous. And I want to be more open, I want to take more risks. Shit man. I have a lot of work to do. Opportunities everywhere to be brave and grow. 
1	Not much. In a few decades I'll be long forgotten. Even family will go days/weeks without thinking of me. There's no point in leaving behind anything because I don't matter enough.
2	How do you read the news?	I'm an ENTJ on the younger end of the spectrum and this is something I'm really curious about. With the information overload that everyone is currently facing, how do you prioritise what you read on the news on a day-to-day basis?\n\nDo you focus on the big stories? Do you only read what's relevant to *you*, be it in your personal life or at work? Or do you just read the stuff you simply find interesting?\n\nI'm at this strange stage in life where I'm still in education and have an offer for a great job in financial services in the bag. My two main goals are currently doing well academically and shaping my skillset/knowledge base in a way that will help me make a great start to my career. \n\nThe problem is that in the first few years I'll need to know about everything -- from blockchain through FX to Islamic finance -- and I'm currently finding it hard to figure out an approach to reading. I have a very limited amount of time in a day, so I can't spend hours going the news, but I also can't focus on a single sector/topic because I need my knowledge to be reasonably broad.\n\nI thought fellow ENTJs might have some interesting things to say on this that could help me optimise my own approach. 
1	Multiple sources, when I have to take a break and make something to eat, I'll turn on an actual television and watch any of the networks, but mostly it's online. Sometimes I learn stuff from reddit itself when the front page or "news" section of reddit has me checking it, but mostly, as long as the sky isn't falling down, I just check the news to make sure everything's normal, if it is, that's about it. \n\nI do like the weather channel as well, meterology is fun, and the snow when it's not below 10 degrees is nice.

1	I used to read 3 different news sites (two of which were actually more of aggregator sites), but that took too long, and the sites I used were too in line with me politically.  I like news aggregater apps like MSN news so I get multiple sources, and able to sort what I want. \n\nAs far as content, I did things I find interesting, or were relevant.   I've always liked politics, and new technology always interests me.  Financial stories are not too useful to me at this point, until I expand my knowledge of economics.   Local stories, too. \n\nI'll read it when I need a break, between segments of projects, or when I'm in transit not driving. Also, when I'm in bed at the end of the day, I usually browse facebook, news, and sometimes reddit. 
1	Google offers a Google Alert service. Narrow it down to the few topics/themes/ideas that you find worthy of following and it sends a summary report of the day's information to your email automatically everyday at a fixed time.
1	i really don't read the news. it tends to all be the same tragedies over and over, and everyone saying we need to fix the problem but doing nothing. it's tiring. that's not to say i don't ever read any news, but i try to keep from reading anything too depressing. \n\n\ni tend to read more about things that interest me, but that's often not news. usually articles about psychology. i keep thinking i need to follow some zines about extreme body modifications or something, because i love hearing about cool new mods, but i usually get distracted before i do it. :/
1	Multiple sources, but I prefer to read about world events and politics rather than read about happenings in my own city.
1	If you just want to make sure you've heard about world events that might be brought up at your work place the good old radio is very efficient. Find one of those channels that pretend to be unbiased and only broadcast news all day, I'm sure those exist in every country. You can check in on that at any time of the day and hear about all the big stories of the day in a matter of 10 minutes, plus this method avoids the dangers of clickbait links online. The last thing you want is to read your news online, that will quickly turn into a time sink and you're looking for ways to save time, right? If you commute to work in your own car you could listen to the radio in the car, effectively costing you no time at all since you can't do anything else in that time.
5	Let's talk travel! Any ENTJ backpackers? How do you like to travel?	ENTJs! Have you ever backpacked for a long period of time (3+ months)?\n\nWhy or why not?\n\nWhat is your opinion on travel? Do you prefer to work and have holidays? \n\nDo you like traveling in luxury or cheap as possible?
6	[deleted]
5	>Have you ever backpacked for a long period of time (3+ months)?\n\nThe longest I've spent backpacking was a one-month NOLS trip that I did last summer. Aside from my disagreements with some of the philosophy (on leadership, ethics, etc.) they propagated, that trip was easily one of the best experiences of my life. I'd love to spend more time backpacking (and just doing things outdoors), but I already have an extremely busy schedule between running a business and going to school.\n\n>What is your opinion on travel? Do you prefer to work and have holidays?\n\nI love working, but I also love travel. I generally prefer longer trips, but those are harder to fit into my schedule.\n\n> Do you like traveling in luxury or cheap as possible?\n\nI prefer trips of the 'rugged' nature. Going out and climbing mountains, walking across hundreds of miles of scorching hot and freezing cold desert, etc. There's just something appealing about asserting my dominance over nature, in my opinion. Granted, both of the aforementioned trips can be fairly costly, however, I wouldn't call them luxurious.\n\nWhat about you, OP?
3	Backpacking with an ENTJ? I'd rather go through a Boot Camp.
2	I’ve never had to opportunity time-wise to backpack for more than 2 weeks, but I do enjoy it. I love the efficiency aspect of minimalist packing and planning, and I love being able to play things by ear. When I’m on a trip, I kind of let my Te/J-mess ease a bit and embrace my Se. I’ve enjoyed hostels and camping and little guest houses. I think that stuff is a blast and I would love an extended holiday at some point for a more extended trip.\n\nLuxury travel is nice, but to me, it’s somewhat boring and not worth the cost. I can have a lovely spa experience stateside. For a non-packing style trip, I prefer to stay somewhere modest, travel as often as I can, and mix in fine dining with typical local fare. I make a decent income, but I’m not wealthy by any means. I prefer to travel more often than to take a big, luxurious trip on a less frequent basis.
1	Lived in four countries, mine included. Travelled in a few ones, backpacked a week in Vietnam. I love travelling but my autism for plans and organization makes me little compatible with backpacking, though I have nothing against it.\nI love to travel anyhow, I believe it's the one activity I'll need all my life. Wherever I go, I like to get a grasp of the culture(s) and language(s).
1	I can't travel for more than 2 weeks while backpacking - I start to miss the work routine. Vacations for me need to be kept smaller in size or it'll take the fun out of it if I do it so long/often.
1	Hell yeah! Unfortunately never for more than 3mos as that's incompatible with my current job. Definitely a long-term goal of mine, though... Appalachian Trail or Pacific Crest. Something along those lines. \n\nThis is my preferred method of travel. I dig going to the Rockies and try to find a new spot out there to spend a week or so with the dog (and, formerly, with the ex) about once a year. Outside of that I try and spend about 1 weekend per month at a local campground, or just throwing some bricks in a pack and getting a few miles in one morning for conditioning.\n\nIMO comparing camping/backpacking to some sort of luxury getaway is apples vs. oranges. Nice to have the freedom of pitching a tent wherever the fuck you want and downing a bottle of Jameson under the stars, while beach views with a bed and room service has its obvious perks. Both options can be equally pricey.
1	I used to travel a lot, I’ve spent many a night in European hostels when I was younger. I’m 29, I just can’t do it anymore. I’ve lived in 3 countries, I just want to finally settle down. I’ve always been more of a homebody, I’ve hosted a lot of parties because I’d rather people come to me. \n\nI’m not a teenager or student on a tight budget anymore, it needs to be in luxury at this point (within reason). I also don’t want to be away from home for more than 2 weeks. We went to Italy for a month with my boyfriend’s family two summers ago (one week cruising and the other weeks spent at hotels in Venice, Rome, and Taormina). Although it was in luxury, I thought it was just too long. My INTP boyfriend and his ESTJ sister wanted to keep going at the end of it, their ISFJ mother and I were ready to lie down and die in a ditch somewhere. I’m in good physical shape, so if I’m feeling like I need the help of a mule to manage the altitudes and inclines of the terrain, Jesus I can only imagine how their parents felt. During the cruise portion of the trip, we scaled the city walls of Montenegro. That was one of the most physically/spiritually challenging things I’ve done in my life. The view was worth it I suppose, I’d rather have been helicoptered up there, or carried, or something. \n\nMy boyfriend and I went to Paris 10 years ago and took a picture in front of the Eiffel Tower. This spring we are going back for a week, and we’re going to take the same picture in the same spot :’) My idea.
1	I'd love to backpack one day. Honestly, I wish I could live my entire life traveling, but I think that'd get tiresome. 
0	ENTJ, ENFP, INFJ, weed and a bag of skittles	So there’s this ENTJ (me), my ENFP friend and my INFJ roommate. We have an interesting type of relationship. Right now I’m currently contemplating my future, and recognizing signs of the path of success, typing on Reddit. The ENFP is randomly spazzing from conversation to rants about his greatness. The INFJ is currently playing some game on a CPU that involves conquering other counties and enslaving people, eating skittles tuning us out, but occasionally chucking at us. \n\nTypical. \n\nWhat’s your experiences with these types specifically? And what’s your experience with these types specifically\n\nI’m stoned AF

1	God that sounds fun. It'd be like me hanging out with a INTJ and an ENTP. Bonus points for guessing my type. 
4	Advice for dealing with an EXTREMELY immature ENTJ mother?	My mother is an ENTJ. She has never exactly been stable in her life, but recently she has gone off the deep end. I am desperate enough to salvage my relationship with her that I'm coming on here and asking you for advice to ameliorate things through the vector of MBTI. \n\n**How do I know she is an ENTJ?**\n\nI *know*. \n\n**Are you sure?**\n\nHer function stack most closely adheres to that of the ENTJ. In addition her traits match the four letters. Most predominantly she adheres to archetypal "truth seeking" behaviors, in which she handles life, its problems, and the situations she encounters through the Fi/Te axis. From my perspective her defining characteristics are her willpower, willfullness, high energy level, arrogance, poor handling of her own emotions, intolerance towards others, and ability to defy the odds and use pure unadulterated work ethic to claw something out of nothing. \n\nShe also displays the hallmarks of immature ENTJ behavior: aggrandized ego informing decision-making, a seeming fear of failure and/or laziness, sexual dynamicism as a means of attachment to the opposite sex, a need to do things NOW and not later, a a sociopathic lack of empathy concerning others (including her own children, family, and coworkers), a desire to set the bar and control people, a tendency towards "do as I say, not as I do," and a level of ruthlessness towards her own children that is just plain nasty. \n\n**She can't be that bad.**\n\nNo. She's not all bad. There are genuine moments with her where I feel like I'm seeing the real her, like I'm talking to a person with aspirations, hopes, even dreams. \n\nThat being said, ever since I was 8 or 9 about 90% of the time that it's just the two of us she is quite nasty to me and the people around us. I'll give you an example of her ruthlessness (mostly so I can vent, but it will also illustrate the worst of her behavior). When I began college I almost dropped out: it was too expensive for me. She convinced me to stay by promising that when she became a surgical nurse that she would use the money she earned to help me pay off my student debt. By the time I graduated she dropped out of her program and gave me an old vehicle of hers to use. She convinced me that it would make more sense to get my grandfather to help pay off my debt, to which he (very generously I might add) obliged. Fast forward two years: My grandfather died, he split up his money between his next of kin, I try to talk to her about her or my father helping me pay the $1,250 a month I have to pay back in school loans (monthly), and she shuts me down by passive-aggressively talking about how much worse she has it now that she has to pay all sorts of loans. She then pre-emptively tells me to not talk to my father since "we are just now getting our life together, it's not fair for you to do this to us". I remind her that she promised to help out and told her I'm not looking for them to pay it all: just 50$ here or there. She shuts me down, tells me she already pays out the wazoo for my car (which I didn't ask for) and my phone. I ask her if I can pay them myself: she says no, because the car is in her name, and it wouldn't make sense for me to get off the phone plan. I tell her that while her contributions are appreciated, they're not in the form we discussed years back, and that it seems cruel to me that she won't trade me the car but will take every opportunity to remind me that she's helping me out by giving me it. It reinforces that it's not really mine. Obviously, that opened a whole other can of worms. \n\nSometimes it feels like she is a brick. A cold, unfeeling, selfish brick. The kind that crashes through your front window with a threatening message tied to it courtesy of the local mob. \n\nAgain, the point isn't necessarily the story, although any emotional validation you can give me would be nice. The point is to illustrate that there's just some sort of thought process going on in that noggin that I just don't *get*. It's alien to me. Bizzare. I have no idea what she values and no idea how to convince her that we don't have to be at odds with one another all the time. \n\n**What do you want out of this?**\n\nI want a healthy relationship with my mother. She has historically refused to meet me even halfway when I try to broach these topics to her. To get my goal I therefore have to develop a more nuanced understanding of who she is and the way she thinks. Although reading up on attachment psychology has given me insights into what may be motivating her, I think there may be wisdom and value in any anecdotal or factual information that you have to offer, since your thought process is likely to have more in common with hers than my own. \n\n**You shouldn't be relying on your parents after you're 18**\n\nI don't want to. I need help though. She's my mother. I just want to be able to ask her for help. \n\n\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this though. I'm going out to dinner soon but I promise to answer any questions or comments people have when I return. 
13	I think you should read about narcissist abuse, narcissist parents, Narcissistic Personality Disorder, etc. r/raisedbynarcissists seems like it could help you a lot. \n\n\nI'm going to give you the honest truth from being raised by a narcissist and from my mother being raised by one: it's pointless. I'm sorry to tell you that, but it really, truly is. It seems like she has no interest in yours or anyone else's emotions. You won't get her to change or listen unless it benefits her.\n\n\nDoes your mom regularly drop contact with you for doing something she disapproves of? Does she try her best to insert herself in areas of your life that she has no business in? Does she make her love a prize to be won so you and your (I assume) siblings will compete for it? Does she regularly compare you to other people in your life and downplay your accomplishments (or even co-opt them as if she did it herself)? Does she often criticize the way you speak, dress, act, etc? Does she tell you that you're too sensitive if she hurts your feelings and then get angry at you for being in a bad mood?\n\n\nI don't think you'll ever have a healthy relationship with her if "90% of the time" you're alone she treats you like shit. You seem to be in denial, although you repeatedly say she lacks empathy. You might have to come to terms with the fact that you can't understand your mother because your mother is a narcissist who lacks empathy and you are not. I'd look into narcissists and how that develops (if your mother was abused or emotionally neglected perhaps) if you want to understand her better. 
4	Honestly, it sounds like she might have some mental health issues, and that is something different than just being an ENTJ. 
3	You can't force someone to mature or deal with their issues. The only thing you can do is put them through an experience which may encourage them to grow up. I'd cut her completely out of your life. Maybe (but don't rely on it) that will be the catalyst for her to finally grow up. If not, you're better off anyway. But really, you're powerless here except to accept the reality of the situation.

5	XNTX's curse	Recently i discovered inteligent people's curse. I wonder if you agree. \n\nWe are good at focusing on one subject but we miss context. I mean, inteligent people tend to be arogant and ignorant. We ignore unknown and unnamed. "It's either great or is's just shit" Steve Jobs used to say. I bet you don't like traditions. What are they? Some bullshit made in past, celebrated in present. \n\nProblem is that traditions have hidden value we tend to ignore. \nFor some unknown reason people celebrate them and as efficient person i want to squeeze information from this bullshit traditions. Do you? 
3	I think you're on to something about context, but I'm not sure if I agree with what you're saying about traditions. Of course there are some that are BS, but I think there are many that stand up to scrutiny. The idea that traditions or past experiences need to be destroyed in order to "make progress" or innovate is a largely postmodern idea that is rooted in the belief that all truth is subjective, and it ignores the fact that traditional ideas or lifestyles are still employed by various individuals to positive outcomes. It suggests that traditions and innovations cannot coexist, which is false.\n\nTowards context, I think ENTJs in particular might have trouble gauging the "context" of a room or social situation because of their Ni (maybe other NTs face this problem for other reasons). As an Ni user, it's easy to get in your head and fill in the blanks of a situation, even when that information might be speculative, which could cause social anxiety or paranoia when you're not in a leading position. If our assumptions are accurate, our Ni can make us look like we can predict the future, but if our assumptions are inaccurate, we're just wrong, because we make subsequent decisions based on inaccurate speculation.\n\nIf I can offer one counterpoint to your idea of an "intelligent person's curse," I would argue that it's forgetting that we're not perfect, and we don't always have the perfect perspective. I had a friend put it to me very succinctly. When I was younger I was complaining about not knowing how to deal with the failures of others, and feeling like "everyone else is stupid." \n\nAnd my friend said to me, "Ah Deerhoof_Fan, but you forget: everyone is stupid -- including you!"
3	> XNTX's curse\n\nUgh, this is so far from perfection. X is not a real letter of MBTI. How about, xNTx, or better yet: NT?\n\n> We ignore unknown and unnamed. \n\nAll humans filter out most of the information. We have a dedicated area of the brain to do just that.\n\nWe all have this filter; it is just different from person to person.\n
7	The way I see it, we definitely start out with this kind of attitude, but get better with age. Well, some of us do.
2	Intelligence is definitely able to account for context. For example, when cooking, which is more intelligent: following a recipe, or knowing what each ingredient does and having the ability to deviate from the precise recipe in order to work toward an improved result? The answer is obvious.\n\nIgnoring the unknown is also terrible. Most types that I have met have some sort of “what if” planning.\n\nTraditions, their value is sometimes lost, and become a matter of just going through the motions. Doesn’t mean that all traditions are like that. Some traditions have even evolved in meaning and taken on new value.
2	> inteligent people tend to be arogant and ignorant. We ignore unknown and unnamed. "It's either great or is's just shit"\n\nThat's the opposite of intelligence. 
1	I don't know anybody who has problems with tradition in and of themselves. Tradition only becomes irritating when people refuse to listen to new ideas because "we've always done things this way."\n
1	Why do you think you're intelligent because you're an NT?

9	Hi entjs, Im pretty sure my son is one of you and I have questions.	So my son from what I can see perceives the world with the function order of TeNiSeFi(Im about 70% certain. I don't really care if you think kids can't be typed, that's a different discussion. Also notice that it's not 100% though honestly after typing this out it's got me even more convinced but still I won't shut the book on this until they can take the test themselves so don't get your undies in a twist.)\n\n\n So my son is very smart and organized and always wants to be in charge. Not in a "power struggle" way, he just naturally takes charge and has a strong logical and common sense vision and understands (or tries to understand) the "rules" of whatever it is he is playing, doing, confronting, building, or changing. He collaborates and has a lot of patience but he definitely sees himself as the leader in any situation(not because he sees himself as greater it's just how he *is*). He is also very competitive and only really needs to hear or see something once and remembers it very well mostly.\n\n\nIt's cute though when he's trying to tell me what to do as I am trying to tell him what to do and I end up asking him "who is the mommy and who is the son?" which sorta snaps him back into the "rules" of the situation. He'll patiently tell me the answer and then sorta...collaborate with me on this too? Like respecting that my role is "in charge" but also still seeing himself as...in command or something? Like we're peers.\n\nI don't mind, I encourage him to be himself within common sense kid boundaries(I am definitely in charge and I also encourage my kids to speak their minds to learn and to negotiate), but I do see this "Im always naturally in charge" mentality as not so great at school where who he is isn't understood by the teachers. Many teachers feel very overwhelmed by him (he has a million questions and is always talking things through to "figure it out") and he often see other kids as...workers to help him achieve his goals.\n\n\nI mean, he also makes bonds with kids and likes to just hang out and definitely has appropriate emotional intelligence for a kid his age but sometimes he doesn't understand why other kids don't want to be his workers when he believes he has such a great vision for whatever it is and understands which part each person should play in it. \n\n\nSo, how do I encourage who he naturally is and help him assimilate to school and other kids so that he *and* they are happy? How do I teach him to be a good "follower" when necessary? I don't even know if this is the right question to be asking but any advice outside of "beat him into submission" or other unintelligent advice is welcome. And I also welcome any "I wish my parents had helped me..." or funny stories from when u were a kid if that interests you. (Im an infj).\n\n\nEdit: Thank you all those who gave level headed responses to my specific questions. To the circlejerk: I stopped those inbox replies lol, have fun you guys. 
19	no.\n\ndo not box him into a type at such a young age. he is still developing. confirming the stereotype just encourages him to grow into it and breed a sense of pride about it\n\nhe’s a kid, let him grow naturally! if u feel u need to discipline some things he does, do it
10	I'm ENTJ now, but I'm not sure what I was as a kid. \n\nI saw the authority in teachers and administrators as arbitrary and rules as flexible. That got me in trouble a few times, but I wasn't out to make trouble or push boundaries for the sake of it, and if someone said "just humor it", I did. So that's the outlook I would recommend - the rules and boundaries may be stupid and feel condescending, but sometimes you can ignore them if you're nice about it and don't make a scene. And they won't always be there. He will probably understand and navigate this intuitively.\n\nMost of my personality development didn't happen in school. I was strong willed in social situations with peers, but ignorant, blunt and awkward. Looking back, the most important for development was loosely structured, low stakes, open ended activities. Things like clubs, unplanned time spent with a group of friends, summer camps where you can choose your curriculum. The biggest value will come in figuring out strategies for gracefully handling cooperation, disagreement and conflict. It's important to see some ideas you're promoting both succeed and fail, understand why, and be accepting of the experience either way. And, to know when to take a step back and consider someone else's ideas and follow them in an exercise - and especially to pay attention rather than daydream and scheme in the background.\n\nedit: And to echo what some other people are saying, don't get too caught up in types or how things should be based on some online personality test. Definitely *don't* do what one commenter is saying, to tell him he's this-or-that and a special natural-born leader. Nobody is. Those skills, and the personality itself, develop and mature over time.
6	btw, tons of kids out there are like him at a young age but mellow when they age. \n\nthis is not an exceptional scenario where he is confirmed ENTJ from infant to adult. MBTI theory is so goddamn harmful in this sense
2	I would teach him about picking your battles, and that sometimes the "not losing" move is not to play. I argued a lot of unnecessary things when I was younger because they were "right". Somethings are more important to people than others and although it may be more efficient for your child to do it or something, teach them to understand everyone needs their time to shine, and to learn to not need the reigns all the time. Teach him to lead as a support, things like that. 
2	Hi,\n\nWhat you're saying is pretty amazing because, it was exactly me and my mom as a kid / parent relation. More fun, my mom is ENFJ, like you but extraverted. Maybe there is a link since parenthood plays a huge role in the construction of the kid and his type.\n\nSo how to manage him ? That's not that complicated I think. I've always appreciated my mom because she was always trying to understand me. My dad was the opposite, he didn't understand me and stop trying after some years. He was trying to make me change or being more like "a good follower" just as you said. He asked me to lead only when there is the need and an injustice. He probably wanted me to be like him, I understand totally.\n\nBut the fact is that it didn't work. I was a huge rebel when he was asking me this and sometimes he've had huge fights (since he is a strong personality too). My mom was always here to take my defence and try to ask him to understand me.\n\nYou CAN'T and shouldn't ask someone to change. You can help him work on his weaknesses and tell him his forces but he can't change because he is naturally like this. Help him understand that he is someone strong willed and that he can hurt other sometimes or can be misunderstood. Ask me to concentrate himself and his energy on things that can create an impact or can be useful for him. If someone has been telling me this when I was younger, a lot of difficult things and relations would be avoided.\n\nHope it helps !
2	I learned about personality types at about 15-16, I'll be 19 soon.  Looking back at my younger self (under 10), I didn't have enough interaction with other kids (besides an older brother) to give you too much perspective on that side.\n\nReally just ask him questions, I'd say it's best not to tell him about being a natural leader, but help him to have outlets to lead in.  I had to fight a superiority complex when I was about 14-16 because I seemed to be the only person putting time into things to improve or make something happen.\n\nAsk a lot of questions, ask what he thinks about people, don't be surprised when he gives blunt reviews of not liking the way teachers manage a classroom or other students do projects.  An ENTJ is known for identifying inefficiency or perceived inaccurate information and pointing it out in a blunt manner, as you've seen on this thread.\n\nIt I didn't have an outlet for leadership, for me it was Scouting, im not sure what I'd be doing.
2	My father is an INFJ, so I feel like I can give a good answer. But first:\n\nDrop all of the stereotypes and only use the theory if you're going to use it to think about your child. Te is cause and effect. Ni is seeing connections others don't and having an instinctual understanding of probability. Se is real-time action Ni. Fi is a code of honor. Do not tell him about the theory until late teens, if ever, or it'll cause a multitude of problems.\n\nFor me personally. I wish my parents had made me feel more like my feelings mattered. They both are Fe valuing types. They didn't ignore them, but their advice was always to subdue them for logical reasons, which was bad advice for me. Teach him that his inner convictions matter and are a source of strength.\n\nAlso teach him that people can have completely different mind sets from him. This is where the theory can be useful, as long as you just use it as a guideline and explain everything in a way that works as a standalone from the theory. For ENTJs, Fe feels fake and evil, and they won't value it. It feels like ignoring everyone's actual emotions to put on a meaningless show of happiness. So teach him what's good about it, which you probably can do better than I can. Explain it like how smiling can make you happy, that acting out emotions you don't feel can make you have them, and that can unite people if they do it together. Or however. Readint *The Prince* by Machiavelli should help understand how a Te user can learn to value Fe.\n\nAnd explain Si like there are some things that work well and don't need improving, so it's a good thing a lot of people like tradition.\n\nAn important thing is try not to let him become totally disillusioned with the system. It's inevitable for an ENTJ, but it doesn't have to be so painful. Basically, inferior Fi is a concrete set of inviolable universal rules. And for right now, every rule he learns becomes part of that. But all people and especially teachers are hypocrites, and with him learning more and more rules things are gonna start conflicting. This can cause anger, sadness, rebelliousness, or just not caring. The end point is following the spirit of the rules, but not the letter. Be ok with him fighting the system sometimes, support him even.\n\nAnd teach him that not everyone thinks as hard as he does about things, and not everyone cares about doing what's right, and people will be lazy and will do immoral things just because they aren't against the rules. NTJs are gonna have a lot of negative critical thoughts about things, unavoidably. Don't let it worry you, don't disagree immediately. Just tell that as long as someone is happy, you can learn things from them.\n\nAs an INFJ interacting with an ENTJ, you are likely going to feel constantly criticized by him, but this is not true. It's a result of your intertype relationship, not him seeing anything worse in you than any other child sees in their parent. But it might cause you to want to come back at him over-criticizing his actions like it seems he does yours. I can see it already here:\n\n>It's cute though when he's trying to tell me what to do as I am trying to tell him what to do and I end up asking him "who is the mommy and who is the son?" which sorta snaps him back into the "rules" of the situation. He'll patiently tell me the answer and then sorta...collaborate with me on this too? Like respecting that my role is "in charge" but also still seeing himself as...in command or something? Like we're peers.\n\nYour his parent, so you've obviously gotta discipline him, but it can be hard with that dynamic going on. I only mention this because it happened with me and my dad, and we're fine now, but I had to realize I was disregarding a lot of what he told me without even giving it any thought, and not do that anymore. That goes back to teaching him to value all things. Maybe have him read Siddartha by Herman Hesse when he's old enough, as that helped me, not just with that with all things. I don't really know how to help you from your end of the problem, but being aware of it is the first step.\n\nThis was really long and doesn't even really start to cover it, but good luck.

1	He is not broken. Don't fix him. He will be able to control other people once he is in position to pay them. He just needs to get there.\n
1	As a kid, my mom said she was never able to get me to do things because "she said so," but that if she reasoned out and explained why she wanted me to do something I would do it immediately. I recommend this strategy.
-1	I would tell him now about his personality type. Tell him that since he's a natural born leader, he will face challenges that are unique to him. Also, Let him know that he has a special skill, but if used the wrong way it can hurt him and he won't be able to make friends.\n\nAs an ENTJ, I feel that a child ENTJ needs a diagram drawn for him to see things clearly make a brief drawing on paper about him and his interactions with others (like teachers and other kids) and explain the pros and cons of the way he is acting. Reassure him that it's fine to be that way and that you are just letting him know. \n
0	Sounds like you're focusing on getting to know your kid which is a good move. \n\nMy parents socialized me with sports and athletics, I was pushed really hard growing up. Swam from maybe 6 yo, started competitive club swimming in late elementary school through college, the friends come built in and those types of relationships are very wholesome compared to some of those I saw forming in high school around mutual excessive free time or distaste with status quo. \n\nMeanwhile me and my friends just worked out, did math/science, and ate a lot.\n\nSo my best advice for you on raising your kid is push them, but do it kinder than my parents did. Let him take breaks from a small amount of that stuff, blow off a saturday morning practice for a sleepover and whatnot. \n 
-1	If he's anything like me growing up (I'm an ENTJ raised by an INFJ mother) he would appreciate DIRECT COMMANDS. No sugar-coating, no "hints". Don't try to be his friend, don't try to give him excess "freedoms" he never asked for. We respect hierarchy so establish that hierarchy and he will find his place in it. It's crucial that this hierarchy is consistent, no exceptions, no off days. Consistent, explicit order, to sum it up.

1	Money	ENTJs tend to make a ton of money and typically strive to become the best version of themselves, correct?\n\nThey also tend to have relatively high salaries and be good investors, correct?\n\nFinally, they tend to be logical, correct?\n\nWhy the heck do I tend to see ENTJs living in luxury (e.g. $1M net worth) instead of donating extra money?\n\nHeck! I’m a minimalistic INTP (No, I don’t prefer to live without electricity or anything) who strives to be the best version of himself. You don’t see me buying a bunch of possessions or eating out all the time. If you’re spending money for pleasure (unless it’s sex with your spouse or for conditioning purposes), that’s stupid. Pleasure only leads to wanting more pleasure, not happiness.\n\nMy question is why the heck do a lot of ENTJs live in luxury, becoming fragile instead of antifragile?\n\nIf I had $1M, here’s what I’d do. Live in a relatively nice self-sufficient, eco-friendly, long-lasting trailer. Save enough money for retirement and have an emergency stash. Invest a large portion of it to increase it and stay just wealthy enough to continuously increase my wealth in a relatively short amount of time. Then, I’d donate that profit I’d make or put it towards a humanitarian project, because I’m a humanitarian, AND because it’d be the logical thing to do.\n\nYet I hear about ENTJs buying things like bread boxes, relatively big houses, and cars with heated seats.\n\nYou know what I’d think they’d do? Instead of spending $20 on a freaking box for bread (as if you don’t already have a container), a relatively big house (how big of a house do two people need?!?), and a car with a heated seat like a pussy, I’d just keep the bread in the container it came in, buy a small house, and use my body as its own heater.
23	i'm sorry to tell you but you're not a humanitarian. you care about other people's opinion of your good deeds way more than doing them to HELP people. you're self centered, but it's for a good cause! people can spend their money on frivolous things and still donate to good causes. they just may not feel the need to endlessly brag about how good of a person they are.
10	Why do you care what other people do with money that they earn?
3	 Thinkers keep calling logic's name like it's a god and don't understand what logic means. Donating or giving to charities isn't automatically logical. Since it's an action, it is only "logical" if it works to suit your goals/desires. \n\n\nIt would make no sense to donate all your money to charities if you're trying to become as rich as possible for example. Learn what logic is before you go crusading with the term. \n\n\nNext thing is your stereotyping of ENTJ kind. We might have some the greatest most powerful people on earth or whatever but the majority of us are plebs, small businessmen or like corporate middlemen.  \n\n\nAnother thing, unless you're raised into money,  you don't get "bread box money" by having a splurgy lavish lifestyle persona. That's actually a rarity. I know that I rarely spend money and I think a large number of us also save/invest a good portion of our earnings because:    \n\na) we recognize a lot of things people see as necessities are luxuries (cars, clothes, household decorations for example)   \nb) for a luxury to be of interest it has to be significant (usually expensive)   \nc) the average ENTJ is ambitious as fuck and you don't achieve much squandering your earnings on bread boxes.   \n\nSo I don't know where you're getting that idea from.  \n\n\nA next thing, about rich ENTJ, or rich anyone. It takes a certain mentality to become rich. Sure there'll be exceptions but I assure you that altruism, sharing and being charitable aren't traits that lead people to focus on making themselves rich. Of course rich people are going to horde money and spend it on themselves. It's what they desired and what they worked for.   \n\n\nAlso ENTJ aren't the most caring and loving letters in the mbti club. Logically, why would you expect the majority of us to be altruistic, minimalist philanthropists? Not to say we're heartless but come on!  \n\n\nLastly if you want to speak about logic. How much do you think one man's charity makes an impact, and for how long? Do you think there'd be a point in time where people no longer appreciate your charity and just expect it? What about when your charity has [adverse consequences?](https://edition.cnn.com/2013/04/12/business/second-hand-clothes-africa/index.html) Hell you might think you're donating to a cause that could use the funds and really be [lining the pockets of some other slime balls](http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/fifa-corruption-caribbean-football-chiefs-jack-warner-and-jeffrey-webb-took-aid-for-haiti-earthquake-a6759651.html)  \n\n\nSo in summary to answer all your questions.   \n1) We might be typically richer and greater investors but most ENTJs aren't financial god-kings and are part of the lower to middle class rank and file of society   \n2) It's not really an ENTJ thing to spend lavishly.  \n3) Unless you were born a millionaire or got incredibly lucky, you would have earned your millions because money (and the pleasures that it brings) is something you value and focus on, so it makes sense that millionaires (ENTJ millionaires included) splurge on good stuff.  \n4) It can be argued that building a good business and/or spending your money on goods/services could do better things for the economy and people at large, as in either case, people are working for the money you gave them, rather than doing nothing and collecting money, improving the quality of life and productivity more sustainably than charity.\n

2	Can you give some examples of the people you're referring to?\n\nI make a lot of money, relatively. I'm financially independent and will be retiring within a year. I also live in a 600 square foot apartment on less than $17k per year. I don't own a car. I have a leadership role at a small nonprofit. My thermostat right now is set to 63. \n\n> If I had $1M, here’s what I’d do. Live in a relatively nice self-sufficient, eco-friendly, long-lasting trailer. Save enough money for retirement and have an emergency stash. Invest a large portion of it to increase it and stay just wealthy enough to continuously increase my wealth in a relatively short amount of time. Then, I’d donate that profit I’d make or put it towards a humanitarian project, because I’m a humanitarian, AND because it’d be the logical thing to do.\n\nSo why don't you make a plan, put it into action, and don't be so critical about what other people are doing?
2	>If I had $1M, here’s what I’d do. Live in a relatively nice self-sufficient, eco-friendly, long-lasting trailer. \n\nTrailers are not self-sufficient in any sense, or eco-friendly or long-lasting.\n\n>Save enough money for retirement and have an emergency stash. Invest a large portion of it to increase it and stay just wealthy enough to continuously increase my wealth in a relatively short amount of time.\n\nYup, it's that easy. Why do you need to start with a million. Why not start with $100 and invest it to be come wealthy?\n\n>Then, I’d donate that profit I’d make or put it towards a humanitarian project, because I’m a humanitarian, AND because it’d be the logical thing to do.\n\nI'd almost like to hear what this "logic" is you talk of. But not quite enough to actually want to hear it.
2	I’m an ENTJ, small business owner, and a guy who wants to be rich.\n\nI absolutely hate when people spend shitloads of money. It looks to me like the effect of self-image issues.\n\nI want to live frugally and donate as much as I can to programs society needs but won’t pay for. Those relationships are worth more than a boat by a lot.

2	Pleasure leads to more pleasure. \nWealth leads to more wealth. \n\nAnyway, you have different (not better or worse) mentality then wealthy people. You are not super wealthy. What's more, you can't imagine your future wealthy life - thats how it works. So don't assume you know what would you do in future, you just dont know what will you prefer neither need etc. 
1	Yo man, what's your beef with bread boxes? I mean it's not even a luxury item or anything. Even my 70 years old grandma had one throughtout her whole life.\n\nKeeping the bread inside the plastic it comes in only works if you buy sliced bread. If you don't, because you buy from the local bakery for example then leaving it in the plastic makes it spoil faster and it's a pain to take it out of the plastic if you want an other slice.

14	What many of us don't realize about relationships...	In general ENTJs are (or at least perceived to be) just task monsters that will do whatever it takes to reach an objective we deem necessary. Usually this equates to doing well in classes, hustling up the corporate ladder, etc. \n\n\nWhat I think we often fail to realize is that personal relationships (friends, business partners, spouses, etc.) are very important to fulfilling many of life's objectives. Additionally, how you maintain your relationships is important to maintaining our mental and emotional health (don't forget that health is also important for being able to have maximum efficiency in achieving our goals).\n\n\nI saw in a recent TED talk that the most significant predictors of living a longer life are your social integration and deeper relationships. These are how you interact with your community (baristas, mailman, waiters, acquaintances, etc.) and how you maintain your life long friendships respectively. In addition to living longer lives, maintaining healthy relationships gives you a happier life. From my personal experience, this translates into higher efficiency and greater self satisfaction. \n\n\nNow I come to my main point: I encourage you all to allocate time towards friendships and being more friendly and sociable. Try not to jerk your self off with how much of a robot and how cold you are. It may yield better results than you expect.

8	Time is the currency of relationships. \n\nI'm in a pretty intense educational path right now which is notorious for taking up a ton of it's students time. It gets bad, programs brag about their divorce rates. \n\nNo matter what's happening in my career, completely independent from my stress levels and workload- I spend Friday night with my SO. Sex, kinky stuff, drinks, going out to a show, meeting up with friends. Whatever she wants to do, I'm available for it. If I can spend more time of course I do but I highly recommend setting one evening aside as "sacred."\n\nI've found that bosses and peers tend to respect that time if you're up front about it. 
1	This is great advice. I've taken it to heart because I've been very career-oriented, to the point where I've neglected a lot of old friendships that weren't convenient to maintain. So I take the same approach to them as I do any other goals - set reminders to keep them going, make plans well into the future, and be the one to organize events. The passive approach to socializing doesn't really work past college, when friends are ten miles away at the closest and doing the same corporate grind and/or starting families.
1	See, I've almost always been in a long-term relationship. I never wanted to be a slave to *the man*. I saw that end-game well in advance. I chose not to have one of those over-burdened careers. \n\nA long term boyfriend all through HS, single for a couple of years, then living/married to a guy for a few years, single for couple of years, then living/married again. \n\nI've always had friends. \n\nIt's gotten harder recently making time for friends, I've been busy with work and traveling more for work, which is new (I had someone else doing that before). I starting to miss friends. But I've always made relationships a priority. \n\nBut, now I'm *the man* so FML. \n\n
1	If a person is happy being a robot and cold then they should **do** that. Just like if people are so self centered they get off on telling other people how they should act and feel, they should do that too. Everyone else gets to decide whether they want to interact or not.
4	ENTP Relationships?	Have any of you dated an ENTP? What was it like if so?
6	Yoooo I am an ENTP, and I'm dating an ENTJ. \nNever-ending conversation, jokes and board games, and a lot of "nah, I get it. Don't waste your time saying it, fam"\nBut...debates. and I always wanna go new places and he's all "let's go to the same restaurant as last week". Drives me crazy.
3	I'd hit it. ENTPs are the most alive of all so-called "rationalists" and they are the best in bed. While an ENTJ is nervously checking their watch during sex, afraid to miss an appointment, ENTPs literally fuck like there is no tomorrow.\n\nINTJs are supposedly the least alive, even less so than INTPs but I am special.\n
2	One of my friends is ENTP. I don't really get along with him to be honest.

7	Project Management V. S. Technical route	Would you rather be a project manager or someone who is highly technical? 
6	I was a software engineer, team lead. When I company wanted me to move into management I went to another company. Early on I worked for a team lead who was a great engineer. He moved into management and told me it sucked because he couldn't create, had less direction on products. He had a family and more money was important. He moved up pretty fast. I hired on to do specific projects more than because of the company.\n\nGood PM is entirely different even from management. They're like club promoters, fun, motivating. A good one was always extremely valuable to me in creating great product. I'm not that type of person and would completely suck at PM.\n\nThe two paths were similar in that both are a flat org chart. Both can make a lot of money, but if you want to get into the Director, VP, Pres, CEO game that would require a switch.\n\nI've never worked with a PM who had any programming or product design experience and I've worked with some excellent PMs. Last thing I want is a PM with a little programming experience telling me how to implement. They get that. They're grease.\n\nBoth are excellent paths into startups with PM being in a senior management role. And a PM will likely have many more contacts to hear about people wanting to start companies. PMs can be like bar tenders and not repeat rumors to management.\n\nThis is just based on areas I've worked.
4	Elon Musk?
1	I think you would want to work at least a couple of years as an actual engineer. If you like it, you can stay there. If you want, you can also climb higher up. You would make a much better boss / PM at that point.\n\nAlso, at some point you might want to move up because the freaking technology changes so fast that you will get tired of keeping up well before you are 50.\n

2	Reading The Basketball Diaries as a boy helped me choose to avoid a lot of drug and alcohol related heartbreak that plagued my friends' lives as teenagers and young adults. As an adult, my 'superpower' came out of identifying what skills my bosses and managers truly could not master (and did not want employees to master), and devoting my time to those skills. My entire ability to lead teams and win work has come down to two or three processes that I could never find a book, mentor, or a course to learn from. In each case, I had to tackle work I had never done before in order to learn them. 
2	Milton Friedman's books and free online lectures turned me libertarian. I do believe that I understand some aspects of the world (this knowledge can bring me more $) better now, but it also has reduced the number of people that I could / want to have a conversation with.\n\nSo it is a double-edged sword. It is important to understand just how dumb or smart people are in the aggregate and how to deal with that.\n\n

7	Is President Trump one of you?	To me he is clearly an ENTJ, the Executive/Commander type, but fellow INFPs think he's an ESTP. What do you think?
34	As an entj I refuse to consider the possibility of trump being an entj
26	ESTP with narcissistic personality disorder. I’d say he’s an enneagram type 7w8 
39	Not entj at all lmao
11	Can anyone with such a severe narcissistic personality disorder actually be typed?
5	ESTP for certain, Tisperacies meshed wit inferior Nisperacies
3	Most people type him as ESTP\n\nI personally view him as ENTJ. He has that Te goal setting and the Ni vision for it. The Te/Se- brashness, speaking his mind.\n\nHis Fi is his drive "Make America Great Again". That is if you actually believe that is his motivation for running. (Which I don't).\n\nHe is way too calculating in my opinion to be anything other than an XNTJ. Just read this article\n\nhttps://www.vanityfair.com/style/2016/12/how-donald-trump-beat-palm-beach-society-and-won-the-fight-for-mar-a-lago\n\nAlso his use from reading Carl Jung. I definitively think he is portraying a public persona. So Yes, I think he is an ENTJ
3	Probably not, he doesn't seem engaged in active leadership or organization at this point. 
2	est-X
2	ESFJ! He seems very ruled by emotional responses. 
4	way too illogical to be an entj. driven by emotions that lead to lash-backs and twitter rants for example.
4	His changing of position to me says weak Ni, not auxiliary.
2	I'm still sticking with ESTJ like I said a while ago.
4	So much external feelings, he has the best extroverted feelings ever. And intuition, lots of intuition. Everything is done by intuition. No sensing. Sensing is for shitholes. And Judging. After the Appearance, Trump is number one judge in America. He can judge fairly anyone who isn't from a shithole or a Muslim. See perfect judgement. No perceiving. Absolute ENFJ. So biggly an ENFJ. Give Trump the attention he caffettes. It'll be glorious, I promise. 
2	I tend to think that he is one. Many people think that he is a bumbling idiot. He does make noise but he is also good at strategy. Watch him wrestle his opponents. He is forcing them to make weaker moves.\n
1	Doesn't matter what you say, hell claim it's fake news.  Once he's figured out which combo he thinks will net him the most financial gain, hell claim he's that, he's the best that there's ever been, he knows, because he's checked.
1	he is ESTP. STPs are the closest thing to us
1	Trump is obviously an ESTP with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_personality_disorder.\n\nAre you familiar with the differences between judging and perceiving language and extraverted and introverted feeling?\n\nNote: my view of Trump as suffering from (or making others suffer from) NPD is not colored by political ideology, I view Obama for example as an INFJ who also has NPD (as do--I imagine--many who seek the presidency).
1	I think he’s either an estp or estj. No way he’s intuitive
1	He's an ENTJ turbulent.  Wants to constantly maintain a perfect image of himself.
1	He's ESTP, I don't buy into him being an ENTJ.
0	ESTJ
0	It's hard to say really, since we don't know his thought process or how actually his inner circle works. All we have is rumors.\n\nHe might have been an ENTJ previously, who know has some mental issues like most old people do. 
0	OP do you know about cognitive functions?
-1	I figured out the answer, sorry for bothering the Executives here.\n\nIt ended up being ISTJ, the duty fulfiller. Spends a lot of time alone - I, was like that in his prior life as well. You were right with the S, we agreed on the T, and J still remains true for me.
4	Entrepreneurship V.S. Climbing the Corporate Ladder	Would you rather start your own business or work your way up in a interesting company? 
9	Start my own business 100%
6	[Unless you are willing to borrow / issue equity ... which is high risk and not a lot of fun]\n\nIt is only a choice if you do have some play money / safety net, like a parent's basement to move into while you skip on rent. If you do not have that, then you might want to try to climb up the ranks in an interesting company. You will have made connections and gained experience and would be able to save money for your future endeavors. You will also have a pretty good idea about what you are missing or not missing about the corporate world. As well as a company that you could always return to if you wanted to.\n\nIf you produce good output within the company and force yourself to work on some people skills, then you will have created a place that you could come back to in the case of a failure. Sure, you can get any job, but will you like it?\n\nThere are a couple of scenarios -\n\na. You start climbing the ladder and find out that it sucks. You gained experience, understood better what you like and what you hate and have saved some money in the mean time. Think about your next move.  \nb. You started climbing and you like it and they like you. Well, you could stay and keep on doing this. Great. You could also save $, leave (or in parallel, or continuing to work part-time) start your own thing.\n\nThere is some legal stuff to worry about like the non-compete agreements and non-disclosures (they could cock-block your business for a little while), but I am sure you can find a lot of help online.\n
4	First I climbed the ladder, then I started a business. \n\nI needed money, experience, and a reputation to start the business, so working in the field for a good while was worth it.\n\nPeople, in my industry, take me more seriously now that I'm a bit older. I would not have succeeded if I started my business in my 30's.

1	Corporate ladder for sure
1	It's context specific isn't it. For me it's all about the return relative to the risk I'm taking. \n\nMost entrepreneurs I know are single men/women that come from relatively comfortable backgrounds; the worst thing that could happen, if they experience abject failure, is to live with their parents for a few years. So infinite upside, very small downside.\n\nLikewise most of the people I know who pursue a corporate career have real downsides: mortgages, fiancés, children etc. The option that would provide them with the highest probability of satisfying their immediate needs is a corporate job. Limited upside, but your risk is hedged so long as you're hired.\n\nI have tremendous respect for entrepreneurs but because I also have people whose lives depend on me, I find it deeply irresponsible for me to risk their happiness for an idea that has a 0.01% chance of succeeding. (Entrepreneurship by nature entails over confidence)
3	Do you believe “absence makes the heart grow fonder”?	What personal views or experiences in life have shaped your view on this? (I originally posted in the love subreddit but realized it’s dead so I thought it’d be more interesting to see fellow ENTJ perspectives) 
4	I do. I think sometimes when you take a little space it can be a lot easier to see the good in people. Spending too much time with anyone makes it hard *not* to see their faults. Putting in some distance and coming back to those people later makes them refreshing again. At least in my experience. 
4	I think absence reveals your true feeling, whatever it is. \n\nSometimes I'm sad over the disruption, but when things settle down again, my feeling is more like "good riddance". \n\nOther times, I realize the absent person contributed something real and valuable to my life and I miss them. 
4	Absence to love is like wind to a fire: extinguishes weak ones and e courages strong ones.
2	Yes I do. I value quality time spent, and by being absent, I emphasise the quality time we spend together while i am present. 
1	Yes, love is dead on subreddit.\n\nI do believe. From a brain chemistry perspective it makes sense to me. Taking a drug like heroin causes the brain to *get used to* the drug and more is needed. Caffeine, same thing. Get off heroin, caffeine for some time and the brain resets it's baseline.\n\nI think this happens for love related hormones since a drug is a drug. Stay with someone 24/7 for a long period and it becomes less intense. Being apart lets the brain reset and the next time you meet it feels more intense. During the time apart a hormone like serotonin might decrease like it did when you first met to make you more obsessed with seeing your partner again.\n\nThis could explain why many people like a Living Apart Together lifestyle.
1	To a point. But eventually everyone moves on. 
1	Alone time is one thing, absence is another. Too much absence just turns to bitter ache. I’m not a lonely person, I can and have lived contented by myself at the same time I was missing him bad (we were separated by an ocean for months at a time earlier on in our relationship, we’ve lived together for years now). Life is short. I just want to experience as much of it with him as I can, even just to be near each other while each doing our own thing (he’s an INTP, so he’s entirely in his own world a large portion of the time. He literally just asked me, ‘Did you know naked mole rats don’t age?’)\n\nThe demands of life take enough out of our schedules as it is. I’ve gone away from a few days to a week at a time, but I really really wouldn’t want to do anything more than that unless I really had to. \n\nAbsence humbles the heart and is a reminder of how it would feel without that person you love in your life- but if one of us *needed* it, that (to us) would be an indicator of a problem in the relationship. 
1	I think it can be true for some people, but in my case it turns into "Out of sight, out of mind."
1	It depends. I'd say:  \n1. time apart can reveal what needs of yours the other person is meeting, especially if you're not getting them met in the meantime. You might realize they weren't that significant.  \n2. you both have added life events and different mental states and the unknown/newness of sharing that is attractive.
1	if you understand intuition , yes, thats how it behaves )  \njust like food, stop eating and ull see how tasty everything becomes  
1	Need advice for dating ENTJ girl.	Hi all. I'm an ENTJ[25m] myself, but I'm having a little trouble understanding my ENTJ[22f] friend. She's not my typical type of girl that I fall for, but she's the only one that got me singing Lee Brice's I don't dance when I'm alone. She's an independent woman(single) that doesn't need or wants any help. I have so much respect for her independent nature, but I want to be the guy that she chooses for a husband. \n\n\nI'm a very career focused person and not easily falling in love with anyone, let alone thinking about girls while working. But I think about her a lot. My top love languages are quality time, physical touch, and word of affirmation; I'd rather be with her in person. Sometimes I find myself having to try my hardest holding back from saying, "I miss you" even after when we just talked an hour ago. She seems so lonely sometimes. If she's lonely, I want her to find comfort in me! I told her that one time and she answered: "I would if I could,(my name) but I can't." What does she mean by this?\n\n\nThe biggest problem is I'm getting mixed signals and we're also in long distance. She said she likes me, but won't agree to meet up in person. Her excuse is that she likes to stabilize her career path first before considering dating anyone. But she would also plan to meet up in person with me for 6 months ahead. Sometimes I wonder if she's just playing with me, but I know I'm just being paranoid. What might be really going on with her, how can I gain her trust so she'll more open up with me, and how can I make her fall in love with me? \n\n\nExcuse my English, not my native language. :)
7	>"I would if I could,(my name) but I can't."\n\nShe probably is already in a relationship with someone else.\n\nAnyway, your hormones are leading you astray. Consider the idea of marriage only after you know her as a person. This also includes meeting with her.
3	Hmm. This sounds like the kind of situation where you need somebody with a different type to give you a parallax view. From here, it looks like you and this woman are identical images of each other. \n\n>I would [find comfort in you] if I could, but I can't. \n\nCould be read a lot of different ways. It could mean that she doesn't trust herself enough to open up to you. It could mean that she isn't comfortable opening up to you because you're coming on like a predator. (Sadly, it's hardest to be open with your lover/girl- or boy-friend/spouse, simply because it's so easy for them to hurt you - quite the paradox...) It could mean that she's been trying to open up to you, but doesn't find comfort in doing so. So, under what circumstances would *you* find yourself saying something like this? What would it mean for you to find comfort with a woman when you're feeling lonely? What might be going on if you weren't finding comfort with a woman, even though you like her, at least as a friend?\n\n>She said she likes me, but won't agree to meet up in person.\n\nThat's less of a contradiction than the fact that she also makes plans to meet up with you. What order is the making plans/not agreeing happening in? Is she making plans, but then getting cold feet? Said no, then said yes later on? \n\nI'd *like* to tell you that she just wants you as a friend, and is afraid to tell you that she doesn't want a romantic relationship with you because that might end the friendship. At least then, you'd have closure. But, you're right, there's enough mixed signals going on here to keep hope alive.\n\n>Her excuse is that she likes to stabilize her career path first before considering dating anyone. \n\nWell, *that* sounds like her head not checking in with her heart. Even if you're not the guy for her, good chance that *some* guy will come along and sweep her off her feet, career or no. And not listening to your heart is something you ENTJs are susceptible to, I believe.\n\n>Sometimes I wonder if she's just playing with me, but I know I'm just being paranoid.\n\nEven if she is "friend-zoning" you, that's not the same thing as playing. Friend-zoning just means that she honestly does value your friendship, even though she doesn't want to be with you romantically. That's not nothing, even if it can definitely feel like it at the time.\n\n> how can I gain her trust so she'll more open up with me, and how can I make her fall in love with me?\n\nWell, you can gain her trust by being *trustworthy*. Do you value this woman's friendship? Then be her friend first. If love is going to happen, it will happen. If it's not, then it's not. There simply is no way to force the issue. If you value her friendship, then be her friend. \n\nIf you simply can't stand to see someone so close to you that you can't have in the way you want, well, that's a different story. I've been there before myself. But if you end the friendship because of that, then that's because of the weakness of your own heart, not her fault for "playing" with you. \n\nShe is not a puzzle box that can be opened if you just find the right buttons to push. She is a flower that will open on her own, or not at all. All you can do is wait and be patient - the equivalent of giving her sun and water. Of course, "patience" is not something you ENTJs do well :p That just means the experience will be good for you!  
3	I would imagine that she wants a smart, confident guy with a good idea of his direction in life who respects and wants to discuss her work and her direction in life.  \n\nSeems she is not yet super into you or she would want to make plans to see you.  Maybe try to be a good friend to her and then see if things can progress? 
1	Are you fantasizing about marrying somebody that you haven't seen in person? Did I get it right? Duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuude?! Get your s**t together.\n\nAlso by saying\n \n> how can I gain her trust so she'll more open up with me, and how can I make her fall in love with me?\n\nyou are forgetting a very important factor: you. A relationship is about 2 people that want to spend time with each other to start with. If you focus **all** of **your attention** only on what **she** wants you have already killed this "relationship" before it even started.
1	I am an ENTJ girl and I think this is not a good sign. When I was in my late teens/early 20s, I was pretty commitment shy, but I was blunt about it. If she isn't being direct with you about why you can't meet/prgoress in your relationship, she's likely hiding something or not feeling the situation nearly as much as you. If you go in too strong and she isn't there, she's going to run or pull away more. I'd say if you want that kind of commitment fast, move on.
3	Mastering the concept of magnetic speaking?	There have been throughout history, many firebrand speakers who would energise the crowd, their magnetism would grow a political movement and create many loyal followers who would follow to the death, how is this mastered and what to you suggest to learn it better?
3	a) Pick a worthy cause so that you yourself can be excited about it. Back in the day the Royalty would literally lead (as in risk their very own lives) the troops into the battle.  \nThis is what the crowd likes to see - passion and dedication. Work ethics should not be a problem for an ENTJ, but true passion on the other hand ... Dig into your Ni and Fi (and some Te) and figure out what it is that you want to commit yourself to for the next several years.  \nPeople are more than willing to forgive you the production value should you have crappy camera for as long as you try your best to be honest with your audience. This is in the context of Youtube.  \nb) Follow Scott Adams on Youtube on the topic of persuasion.  \nc) Practice. Be patient.  \n
1	well peruse yourself with the past while im marching toward the future, knowing that my fellows will assist me with all their knowledge of past and present. while we might possess the same level of conviction, I'm afraid that you are lacking something very fundamental: imagination. lucky you have the right resources to compensate that. 
4	Catching Up on Work	What’s the best way to get caught up on work a person is behind on?\n\nI’m aware psychology plays a big role similar to finances.
2	Option 1: Explain to management how not doing the work would save the company millions of dollars.\n\nOption 2: Pitch a new money making idea to management. They'll put you on that new project and give your current work to someone else. \n\nOption 3: Quit and find another job.
2	Focus on how the tedious work you are required to do can benefit your future. \n\n\nDon’t pass calculus? —> lower GPA —> possibility of not accomplishing your goals whether it is obtaining a Bachelors Degree or Masters Degree OR the possibility of staying an extra quarter and spending a extra few thousand dollars or more just for one class you didn’t pass. \n\n\nI hated some of the classes I enrolled in such as a mandatory art course.... but I get it done and try to find at least one thing that is interesting or beneficial about the class... and if I really can’t, I will try to remind myself that if I don’t do well, it will affect my future drastically. 
1	Can't help much without more details. Are you really behind? Is that work really necessary or did you make yourself busy because it is an ENTJ thing to do.\n\nI think you need to employ the human / baggage airplane model. I am sure there is a better way. Here is what I mean:\n\nAn airline can afford to mix up your luggage but it can't really afford to crash an airplane. They first try to optimize the most important aspect - human safety and human experience and transporting cargo in the left-over space is of secondary importance.\n\nSimilarly in life and work - what things can't you fuck up and which things you can allow some slack on?\n\nYou usually can't miss your flight without a significant penalty in $, time, headache and stress. However, you can forget to take out recycling this week. It is mostly clean and does not rot and can sit out an extra week somewhere. It might be messy and annoying, but not as bad as missing a flight to another continent for an important meeting. So, if you need to clean but you are late to the airport - only take care of things that will rot and fix the rest later.\n\nIf you are a PhD student about to finish, then it is important to pass some exams and finish and defend your thesis. Some other things like getting a black belt in Jiu Jitsu can and probably should take a back seat at that time.\n\nIf you feel like you are not getting enough done - sorry ENTJ, but this is mostly in your head. YOU are the one who is creating crazy goals and subsequently you are the one who is failing at them. Separate your TODOs into 2 or 3 tiers: like must have, need to have, nice to have and bang them out accordingly. If you aren't keeping up with your own goals on average, maybe lower the bar or hire help?\n\nYes, there are ways to squeeze out some extra performance out of your day, but don't forget to live a life.\n
5	Let's unite and conquer the world	All ENTJs let's unite and conquer the world:)
7	First clean your room.
2	Too busy working.\n\nWhen you get close, let me know how I can help. \nBonus- I'm pretty good with most firearms :) 
1	Thought ya all already did that.
1	Can I have the Aleutian Islands for being there while you guys conquer? 
1	First, why do you want to conquer the world.\n\nSecond, how would you do it. \n\nThird, what would the end game be, what would you be conquering the world for? People are going to care about what kind of world you envision.
1	Okay, but I'm going to be our leader.
-3	First we must remove Democracy, I suggest reading up on Erdogan and doing as he did.
7	Do you feel less motivated after hearing a quarterly / yearly motivational speech by a CEO or other higher up merely due to the choice of language and not the actual stats?	
4	[deleted]
2	Today I got a message form the CEO that he sends to all 500 000 staff from Davos economic forum. You are there on vacation man! I'm not even jelly, it's just hilarious. We can't possibly relate.
8	Desire to impress, but don't.	Hello Fellow ENTJs!\n\nI've been thinking about something I do, and was wondering if other ENTJs feel way this too.\n\nI feel the need to impress people, or show them my skills, but I rarely show them unless asked.\n\nExample: I play guitar, and sometimes feel it would be nice to be recognized as a good (or okay) guitar player, but I never play for people, it feels rude and strange to say "I play guitar" ~Pulls out guitar randomly~ so I don't.\n\nIf someone just got a new guitar and was showing it off (or other random hypothetical situations), I feel I would ask to try it, in an attempt to impress people. Then afterward say something like "wow, that is a nice guitar". (Maybe trying to downplay the fact that I was actually trying to impress people)\n\nIs this an ENTJ thing? or maybe a lack of confidence issue?\n~Ant\n\nPS: I'm not sure if this is a problem, or exactly what I'm asking so...
9	If you wait to be asked your displays will almost always be welcomed.\n\nIf you wait to be asked you will almost never show what you can do.\n\nI would predict that this is a lack of confidence issue. Give people a show, read the room while you do, cut it off early if they're showing signs of being uninterested. Show your enthusiasm, people tend to enjoy secondhand passion.
4	A lot of this is situational. Yes it would be weird to whip out a guitar during a board meeting and start playing. It's not so out of place to bring along a guitar to a back yard bbq. You just need to calibrate to the situation to show off your skills. You can even look for opportunities to do a thing if it's something you want to really put out there. 
3	Very much normal and relatable. That's your Extraverted Sensing (Se) on the work. \n\nIf you're familiar with the inner working of the ENTJ functions, the **Te** Dom emphasizes competence and excellence, **Ni** Aux emphasizes vision, and the tertiary **Se** emphasizes aesthetic; meaning that it's somewhat childish and vain in terms of wanting to be seen as *perfect* or even enviable among admirers and rivals alike. In regards to the lack of confidence, that's your little **Fi** speaking: it ties your sense of character to your ability. If you fail to exceed your high expectation (Te), your Fi suffers and you will end up second guessing about your ability in playing the guitar.\n\n\nIf I were to use the military as an analogy, ENTJs are most likely be the type to have their entire force displayed solely as means to display their strength and instill fear upon enemies without having to waste a shell. It's not necessary to our agenda in most cases, but its *fun*. 
2	Silly boy, ever heard of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good\n\nHearing a nice song or seeing a nice haircut benefits people on the whole.\n\nThat's why I whip out my dick when in public.\n\nI recommend that you too stop caring about what other people think and push yourself to take the risk of feeling humiliated for the sake of getting stronger.\n
2	I was more like this as a teenager, now if I invite someone over they see guitars ask me to play something I will. Same with piano or any other instrument. I've seen my friendships / relationships go up tenfold when I don't show my cards. I think this is a really good example of not showing your cards, it has a much bigger pay off and comes off way more humble: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eq8B0WrUeYc\n\n
2	Do you know about Enneagram? Another personality typing tool.\n\nMost ENTJs are either 3s or 8s, you're definitely pinging 3. I'm a 3w2.\n\nGoogle Enneagram 3 and see what you think.  Both encourages you to shine and teaches you when to reel it in. \nSometimes we rely too much on external validation. \n
1	I have this problem when I'm first entering educational stages or in new work environments.\n\nBasically you can't control what other people think of you. It's just one of those things, there's too many factors at play for deliberate actions on your part to have any effect on their opinion of you.\n\nBest thing you can do is be the kind of person most people like by default (nice, competent, relaxed) and stay in your lane with jobs, hobbies, and interests.

12	ENFJs are insufferable	You’re the only group of people I trust with this (not really). I am an undergrad student working at a law firm as a file clerk/office bitch. My Bosses are ENTJ and I suspect ENFJ. The ENTJ? I absolutely admire and respect as an attorney, as a leader and as a man. The ENFJ boss? Let’s jist say I wouldn’t spit on him if he was on fire. He’s incredibly rude, terrible leader and a walking morale killer. He’s insecure and it shows big time. The entire office hates him. Naturally I’ve confronted him in regards to some of his outlandish remarks. The only reason I’m still here is because I respect the ENTJ boss and it accommodates my schedule. I’m thinking of leaving in March, what do you guys think? 
28	*An* ENFJ is insufferable.\n\nFTFY.
21	All the ENFJs and INFJs in my life are extremely valuable, that doesn't sound like them at all \n\nSorry you're having so much trouble at work. Maybe your boss is just a jerk
16	Not everything has to do with type. Maybe he’s just a shitty boss or a shitty person. Don’t take one trait and put everyone else with that trait into a single box.
10	How did you decide that your bosses' types were ENTJ and ENFJ?
9	Yeah, could be specific to that person. My boss is an ENFJ I've known for several years. She's kind, creative, crazy charismatic, and extremely well-intentioned. Only difficulty is I feel like there's always (an acceptable amount of) tension and push and pull between Te and Fe. My Te tries to encourage her to "cut the crap" and succeeds at times, while hers is effective at getting me to show more positivity than I want to. That dynamic aside, we balance each other out extremely well. 
4	[deleted]
4	I love my ENFJ. She's self sacrificing to a fault but so warm and friendly to everyone. She naturally makes people happy. Hard working and sees the world very similarly to me. We seem to take in the same information but use it differently. Super useful to me. 
2	Any type of NF are usually good. This doesn't sound like them. Maybe you got him mixed up with an SP or something. But I havn't had that problem
2	[A teaching moment from Sopranos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppU5gBY-3ow)\n\nWhat is likely to happen is that other people with much more clout than you will push him out. You might want to adopt a "tit for tat with forgiveness" strategy and stick around for say 6 months. Whether he is pushed out by then or not, you will have learned something. You also will have an answer to that question - can you think of the time when you encountered challenges at work and how you dealt with them. Depending on how things go, you might be able to spin the story. As well as to actually learn something.\n
1	I don’t think a blanket statement will cover this. Sounds like that guy is just an asshole.\nENFJs are usually the targets of my biggest girl crushes.
1	I work under an ENFJ manager and I'm leaving my job in 2 weeks. I don't know how but I lasted 1.5 years in this bullshit, working under that despicable piece of shit. I don't even have a job to go to. I've been given half a confirmation for another job, but that won't be 100% until next week or the week after. But even if I don't get it, idc. I'm just SO happy to not work under him anymore.\n\nI absolutely love my job. I don't love that it's retail and it's minimum wage. But the nature of the work is perfect for an ENTJ. (It's far from your typical shelf stacking retail.)\n\nWhat I absolutely fucking detest is the dipshit moron that is my manager. I have never seen anyone SO incompetent struggle to lead a team like he does. The man has been in retail for a decade, and yet he depends on me (a mere supervisor with only 2.5  years of experience) to do all the serious shit. Our assistant manager is an overly arrogant lazy piece of shit who has had over 20 years of experience in retail, yet he's entirely unreliable. Our jobs are more difficult than they should be. I've known since before I started that I would be doing more than I should. And I'm fine with that if given the appropriate amount of time and resources. Instead he regularly starves me of both of those things and yet expects me to run at maximum efficiency.\n\nWhen it comes to leading the team, Jesus Christ help him when I leave, he just doesn't know what the fuck he's doing. In the 1.5 years I've worked under him I have learned nothing from him. I've developed a hell of a lot personally and professionally, but I haven't learned any skills and now, 1.5 years after starting my job, I still haven't received any training so I only know half of what I need to know for my role. My sales assistants are in exactly the same position. 2 (out of 6) who are functional enough to survive in the working world are doing okay because he's given them the training they need to function in this difficult job. As for the others, he has been way too easy on them because he doesn't trust that they will also be effective workers - he hasn't given them the training they need to prove it! Fuck's sake.\n\nI'm so happy I'm leaving this shit. I'm sick of working in a team where out of 10, only 4 do any work. And it's purely the manager's fault for not allowing me to train the team. I have begged and begged and have even done it here and there/where possible, but it wasn't enough.\n\nI'm leaving my job and I have no idea where I'm going to go or what I'm going to do, I'm just SO happy I won't have to work under such a lazy, inefficient, pathetic excuse for a manager anymore.
1	I had a project with an ENFJ - *such* a scatter-brained know-it-all, she was completely insufferable! \n\nI can't imagine having one with a position of authority above me. \n\nI'd try to distract him, keep him busy in other departments/people. \n\nGood luck. 
1	it makes no sense for him to be ENFJ imo  \nENFJs are very composed individuals especially in public.  \neither way, human character is much more a factor of resources, when u feed shit to your body and brain, it will function like shit.  \n\nid still bet he was esfj esfp though .  maybe give more behavioral examples  
1	I'm an ENTJ with an ENFJ flat mate, I think the problem comes from them being the feeling version of the ENTJs which means they have all the conviction and will power of an ENTJ but it's steered by their feelings. Which for thinking types can be absolutely maddening.\nIn much the same way an ENTJ will ignore the popular truth around them and be guided by facts which in the short term fucks people off but once the dust has settled everyone with a gram of security apologises and as you described, respect is built. ENFJs do the same but guided by their OWN feelings, they tend to actually have little value for the the feelings of those around especially of those they think have no feelings at all aka anyone who uses logic to make a decision.\n\nYou will never like everyone at your company and if you do it's only because you don't know them well enough yet, these people who are rude always meet their comeuppance in the end, in fact I actually get a warm feeling everytime I see a feeling type act like a jerk as they have no idea the wall that will hit them in the face.\n\n\nBeing nice is actually a choice though, one which thinkers logically arrive at with a tumble at first, but feelings people automatically assume they are nice(which is something we all do, I mean who would you guess is nicer an android void of emotion or a human pumped with feelings) which can lead to a longer path to not being a douche.\n
0	This is vauge and anecdotal however all of these are, weather they are peoples opinions of good OR bad ENFJs all of them are just opinions but infirior ti can be very critical.
7	Lonely around people	Since I was kid i have had few friends. Nowadays i keep in touch with a lot of people but still i don't feel that those are close relations. I have had 3 girlfriends but all romantic relationships didnt last long - maximum 1 year. I'm still in touch with one EX. \n **I really like being around people but only little part of people like me, like i truly am** (assertive, straight, inquisitive, intellectual). Recently i accepted that i can't be liked by everyone. I appreciate my current friends. It feels sad though.\n\nI wonder if its my individual trait or is it personality issue?\n\nI assume it is due to lack of empathy. Cognitive function tests put me in category ENTJ (or XNTX - depend on test and mood).\n\nAny of you guys have same issue?
11	I feel you. Similar here.\n\nI wouldn't say it's a lack of empathy.\n\nA friend of mine once put it like this:\n\n"You're a very intense person. First of all, most people don't enjoy confrontation [which you do, hence assertive and straight]. It's exhausting for them. Then, your brain simply runs at a different frequency from theirs [inquisitive, intellectual]. For them, spending time with you (which likely includes confrontational discussions) is like going on a run with Usain Bolt. Not that enjoyable. Hence, they avoid you."\n\nThe solution? Find people who can keep up with you and you'll love it.
3	No you are not alone. and i hope that this statement makes you feel better. \n\nWe just happen to belong to a minority group, the funny thing is as ENTJs we can be true friends to each other due to our similarities, however our emotional being might not mature the way it should. By initiating meaningful and intimate relationships with other intuitive and feeling types we might be able to delve into our potential reservoir for emotions. Unfortunately, the difference in priority of cognitive functions will probably trigger us to be conscious of being not like others and misunderstood. \n\nJust accept that, calmly. Please embrace aloneness as no one will understand your your inner world as profound as you. 
3	I can relate somewhat.\n\nI would recommend Dale Carnegie's "How to win friends and Influence", at least read a chunk of it. It helped me understand other people a whole lot better!
3	Same, you're not alone
2	Feel exactly the same. I am also not cliquey and don't enjoy your usual group settings. I need people to be energising and uplifting. I don't enjoy bullshit conversations. 
-1	No not at all
0	Coping with a bad breakup	I was dating this girl who was like the opposite of me (ENTJ) and it was very refreshing and exciting. Don't think she was entirely mentally stable. She made all these promises that she loved me and was going to be with me then did a 180 and ghosted me. I struggle with it especially being an ENTJ. I want answers and understanding but she is incapable or unwilling to sit with me. Any advice how to navigate this? I'm focusing on creating something better but it still hurts. I've also learned very valuable lessons. Feel like I'm stuck on being wrong or hurt. Or maybe stuck on what happened wasn't right... it just doesn't make sense
6	Get out of the house and do what you do best; get shit done and better yourself. It won't get rid of a bad smell but it'll slowly mask it until it goes away. 
2	I'm usually able to cut people off that pull that kind of stuff. My best advice is to just think about the things you like about yourself, and find a way to tell yourself why that girl isn't worth it. People who like to play mind games like that should never be welcome in your life, so just live your life and move past it. Pursue a new hobby, hangout with your family, workout, etc. All of these things will keep your mind occupied before you inevitably get over it. I know it sucks, I always get hurt so bad, but you'll be alright.
1	The person that you though you were with did not actually exist. Move on. Count your lucky stars. Mental instability is no joke.\n
7	How far would you go for someone you love?	Most people agree that ENTJ are quite logical and are able to place their emotion on the side, but at the same time, when I actually care for someone, may they be friend or family (when they enter that specifict spot where I'm happy to give them my time). \n\nI always feel like there's no limit to how far I would go to help them.\n\nNow, ofcourse, I have a boring life and I'm not going to complain about not being in trouble (that would be stupid), but if it would ever happen, I know I would be able to do anything (no mater how immoral or grusome I would need to become in order to protect them). \n\nIt tend to make me feel like I've got some kind of demon inside of me. When I was younger, (I'm still young, just 21, but I mean when I was a teen), Someone tried to attack a friend of mine during the school. I made it clear that if he ever did it again, I would have turn him into the same condition has stephen hawking. \n\nThe teen in question then stayed super far from my friend and was scared of me for the following eight month. \n\nDoes that make me some kind of horrible human being? Sometime I wonder If i'm just a monster for being able to be so emotionless, but at the same time, these immoral tought are brought by the need to protect those I love so I get confused on the matter.\n\nAnyway, it's 2 AM so I'll go to sleep, but : \nHow far would you go to protect someone you love (in the surreal senario that you would have to go to your own limit of monster-turning in order to protect these loved person.)\n\n
5	If you feel a "demon" inside of you then there is something "not demon" that can feel the demon. What do you think about "monster" and "horrible human being"? What does that mean to you? Do you ever think about how much empathy you have?
1	You did it to protect someone. Not immoral by my books.\nThe person didn't attack your friend again.\nIt was efficient. And It was effective.
1	Do you consider yourself an ENTJ? I can't find a clear indication.\n\nIf so, I'd say I understand how you feel and why you feel that way. Your "demon" is probably inferior Fi rearing its head - a powerful emotional reaction drawn from a moral imperative which feels "alien" and "other". ENTJ's aren't naturally talented at handling pure values and feelings, even our own. We still have them, though, lurking under the surface and occasionally surging up in an uncontrollable way.\n\nMuch like you, if someone decides to victimize a person I care at all about my morals are largely suspended, I'm restrained more by avoiding criminal charges than anything else. That's probably unhealthy and I don't recommend it. Perspective and patience are key.
1	if it's something that keeps you up at night, that means you're not a horrible person. just someone who was terrified and angry for someone you love. just because you can threaten someone doesn't mean you can go through with it, even if you really, really think you can. i hope you never have to find out, though.
1	[Jordan Peterson - Don't be harmless!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQ5oqgJWJyw)\n\nRabbits are harmless. There is no virtue in being harmless.\n
1	I would do nearly anything outside of an immoral act. (Which you might think means little) given the right circumstances, I would even consider sacrifice of my own life for theirs.
1	You'll only become evil if you, whether it's done out of opportunity or rage, decide to perform the exact things your demon is whispering at you. Realizing your own capacity for violence has nothing to do with being immoral; it speaks of your virtue and self-awareness in regards to **knowing** that violence is an option and whether or not you should carry out the atrocities that you could see yourself doing. \n\nHaving a virtue means knowing that you could plant a lead deep in some bastard's skull at any moment, yet decides not to do it out of mercy and decency. No weak men are ever capable of weighing such contemplation, because they would either carry out their violence through impulse or withdraw themselves out in fear of confrontation. 
1	I would go to the ends of the Earth is someone did something bad to someone I care about. I don’t care who they are I will find a way to get justice. And I’ll get my justice in a way which will be so sweet for the person I love. Essentially I’ll tailor it to their situation

1	Which ones are fake ENTJs?
1	Chael Sonnen - ENTJ? Dude just oozes Te & Se	
1	Not gonna watch it but I'll note that Michael Pierce has pointed out that IDR Labs asserts that the majority of self-help authors are ESFPs, so perhaps consider that type as well; both share the same values (Gamma Quadra) but one is tactical and the other is strategic. Just a humble suggestion as one that can't be bothered with typing the man.
1	I recently considered it while watching an interview with him. He may not be ENTJ but he's definitely close.
1	This is an old post but I think he is an ENTJ. So much Te that it's difficult to argue for ESFP even though some ESFP can have a more Se-Te balance. Dude can talk forever and tends to compartmentalize his stories which I find often with dom or aux Te users. Super confrontational. Very immature Fi, leading me to believe it is his inferior function.
2	Thoughts on Modern Art	I went to the Getty Museum recently with some friends and gained a newfound appreciation for art when I had the chance to see the classical Western paintings and sculptures up close. I walked into a smaller rotating exhibition in a different building and was honestly disgusted at the fact that literally a solid red square canvas was being displayed in the same place as some of the finest pieces of the Western canon. What are your thoughts on modern art and aesthetic relativism as a whole? 
7	Aesthetic relativism is a form of debauchery.
7	Relativism of any kind is just an excuse to be subjective and not do things the right way. There's an objective standard to everything.
4	I think aesthetic relativism is spot on. Thinking it rubbish is a narrow view of the world. My Mom hangs paint by number pictures of cats on her walls and think its art. I don't.\n\nModern art contains the range of good to bad, interesting to dull, subtle to blunt. It's just a different style.

1	You don't get it. There's beauty and meaning in lots of modern art. \n\nFirst, don't forget that current art is more current, which means we access the timeless masterpieces and the fads and the throwaway nonsense. Your "western canon" (not a specific term) is the stuff which our ancestors saw fit to preserve for whatever reason, you're not seeing the shitty stuff that was put out around then or only popular for a moment. \n\nSecond, you don't understand what it's about (clearly, from your post. I'm not trying to insult your intelligence here) Highly recommend you learn a little bit about contemporary art, here's a free full lecture course from Biola, a private christian university in Pomona: http://open.biola.edu/collections/arts-315-contemporary-art-trends\n\nYou'll have a good time watching it and learning a little bit about what's going on even if you keep hating modern art. \n\nFinally, what do you like about the "Western canon?" Is it because it makes you feel profound emotions and a sense of place? That's why I like it. There's contemporary pieces which do that too, though. \n\nSee the work of Nancy Holt\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Holt\n\nthe work of Mark Rothko (particularly the Rothko chapel)\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Rothko\n\nAnd some of the fantastic spaces created by James Turrell\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Turrell\n\n\nBasically, your use of the term "aesthetic relativism" makes me think you've been propagandized to and are misunderstanding lots of contemporary art, or taking in piss poor examples, or just hate it but could still benefit from the ability to talk about it better. Hopefully you use this opportunity to learn a little bit and at least refine your opinion.

2	I thought that was sweet in a devilish sort of way, it was more cute than it was creepy.. although I am shocked and concerned, to say the least, to learn my grown INTP boyfriend is thinking of a child’s cartoon character at all like, in any way. Very upsetting news, I’m going to have to confront him about this. \n\nNot gonna lie tho, we are bad bitches. Same reason ESTPs love us in my experience, but I think INTPs understand and appreciate us more completely.. and also aren’t threatened in the way so many other men are once they get to know us. \n\nThat’s where my mind went with it anyways, idk about these downvoting perverts.
1	That was funny
1	All I comprehend from this thread is "ayyyy lmao".
2	Favorite apps or tech devices?	Why are they your favorite? \nI don't have a Kindle, tech watch, or tablet atm. Just got an Amazon Echo for Christmas and am enjoying it. Want to see if I'm missing out on anything that could make life more efficient, cool, or fun. 
2	Smartphone, laptop, kindle, in ear headphone, thats enough. 
2	My favorite device does not exist - it would be un-hackable, Linux-powered laptop with obviously a lot of RAM, SSD, good sound, video card, ability to connect to more than one monitor, with perfect drivers, good looking UI and unbreakable form factor.\n\nLaptops running Pop OS! from System76 that come with an Intel Management Engine disabled would come close to the ideal.\n\nThey can be expensive as fuck though - often more costly than a used car.\n\nI do like Trello\n\n> Just got an Amazon Echo for Christmas \n\nEwwwww [Smart Tyranny: How to resist the smart grid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ7X70znuZE#t=1m40s)\n

6	It's not always about you	Has anyone ever told you 'it's not always about you'? As individuals who are highly career orientated and focused on our own success I was personally hurt when someone told me this. 
7	I mean, it isn't always about you. I think that's something a lot of ENTJs need to hear. If you were hurt by it it might be because you recognized some truth to the criticism.
3	That's probably the most prominent phrase of my father during my early childhood, right before 'You need to learn how to loose.' Heck no, I'll just always win.
2	but *isn't* it? ;)
2	I've been told this more time then I could ever count.\n\nBut I always see it that way : I don't care weither it is about me or not. The result is that if someone around me is mad because of x, I have to endure them being mad. So the faster I enter in their head to solve the X, the faster I can stop having them annoying me with them ''being mad''.
1	Yea that's what I am saying. You should focus on yourself to the extent you wish 
1	They might be threatened by your rising stardom and success. 
1	> It's not always about you\n\nIt is a vague and therefore meaningless statement. Certainly not without context.\n\nWhat do they mean by "it"?\n\nWhat do they mean by "about"?\n\nYou can construct all sorts of nonsense using natural language.\n\nFor example: "It seems as if some believe that they are on target to get from here to there in a reasonable amount of time."\n\nWhat the fuck did I just write?\n
1	Yes, someone has told me that and my feelings were also hurt but I needed to hear it. I was in the habit of jumping to bad conclusions about the behavior of others based on an assumption that they were acting with me in mind. I have since instituted a policy of assuming that it *isn't* about me (until I have evidence to the contrary) and that one leads to much more accurate results.
35	ENTJ Bingo	
22	Cat person???
13	Whoa whoa, stop right there buddy, Cat person? what?
8	I love cats and have had them all my life but boy would I hate to contract Toxoplasmosis.
5	the only things i can't mark are "cat person" and "low empathy". i have *moderate* empathy. \n\n\nalso i had a friend tell me "it doesn't have to be all or nothing" once and i was like ???? of course it does; what else is there?
3	Lol, I love all the reactions to the, "cat person" box!  How ENTJ of all of you.  I thought the same thing though, it seemed out of place.
2	Has anyone seen the ENTP bingo picture? It's pretty hilarious. Someone link it plz.
2	I am at odds with the cat person box because technically I am a dog person by my love of them but I act more like a cat than a dog. Therefore, I am more of a cat person in the literal sense but ironically not by the standard meaning of the phrase. 
2	this is actually one of the most accurate things ive seen in a while, wow. but fuck cats, dogs are where it's at
2	I was gonna say this is gay but it's actually very accurate 
3	Is that a bingo card or a new way to present yourself?  \n\nMature ENTJs have empathy. I don't think most people there loves attention so much. You quickly realize that "all or nothing" is a losing strategy. A "need" to win is something dangerous if not controlled. And that goes on for almost all your card.
1	I *might* have a horizontal bingo across the middle. Unsure if I can rate myself as "super honest".\n\nWould have preferred something using "cat person", but you could probably guess that from my username.
1	Attack as a defence tactic is questionable. I know better than to be so presumptuous and impulsive.
1	Just fucking cross that second row from the top for me 
5	Friendships and the lack of thereof	'Sup guys. ~~Really dislike walls of text so let's get this as quick as possible.~~ Super wall of text ahead, use caution.\n\nCurrent situation: I had 3 friends in the strong meaning of the term. They were acquired by sharing common interests (mostly gaming) but 2 of 3 changed in a way that we became incompatible (no self-improvement in matters of knowledge or goals and change of hobbies so nothing worthy to talk about ). We still hang out from time to time but it's not terribly entertaining for me. The last one: last acquired, been friends for 9 years, has done some serious improvements BUT his historical bad characteristics and some new changes are making me reconsider for (something like the 4th time) this friendship. To GIVE you some examples: always fu***ng late, superficial, rarely admits his sins.\n\nMain problem: If I am correct about him not being a valuable person to me anymore I will simply run out of friends. I tried to look for new ones but no luck so far. Maybe I am too picky (whatever that means) or it's just statistically too hard to find a person similar to you both in the mindset and hobby (video games, gym, STEM stuff). Stereotypically, if you game you stay at home and neglect everything else. If you are a master's degree engineering student, you study all day and neglect everything else. If you go to the gym, you are a meathead and so on. A mix of the 3 anyone? No? Meh.\n\nSecondary Problem without considering the first: I have never had issues dry-cutting off a person out of my life (is this sentence even correct?). In this case though, I think I will face more serious consequences if I do so and I need to know if there is a sound decision making/evaluation process to take. Plus I had made some aggressive decisions in the past that made sense in that moment but could have been resolved in a softer, more mature way and don't know if this is also the case.\n\nI posted this on another sub, given their answers I will add additional information from my answers:\nThe point is that after some last events he went back on personal integrity/coherence on some topics. For example one of our common grounds for years was the dislike for common bad practices here in Italy like getting a position or a job only because you know some insider. He would spend several days criticizing those people. Turns out it was just he being angry with people just because he is envious (in my opinion; because it's not rare for him) and as soon as his brother proposed him a job inside his company, with several advantages, he accepted faster than light.\nAnother example was with criticizing how people are ignorant and think with their feelings instead of brains. Same thing here, there was a discussion where the government started to tax something that was a waste product at the start and then became a tradable good. I spent like 2 hours explaining to him why this is an ok thing to do and why a relative of his having invested into that market was irrelevant for this discussion.\nTo summarize: I am very annoyed for, in my opinion, at least decent reasons and normally that would result in a no-brainer. At the same time, I am not afraid to admit that from a practical standpoint that if this is "the best I can get" in a reasonable amount of time, breaking this relationship is not the brightest decision from my perspective. Plus I have a history of making decisions mildly influenced by my annoyance level so write things down and hearing different kinds of opinions helps me boil down and think more. Obviously, he has good traits too and we share the hobby of both gym and gaming, otherwise, the problem wouldn't even be present.\n\nQuestions to you: Would you abandon the comfort zone of a long friendship at the cost of being alone (because you have no valid replacements at the moment)? **How do you find decent friends at 25 years of age?** **How do you decide if a friendship is worth keeping?** Where is it worth looking anyway?\n\nWell, it ended up being a WoT anyway. If you want more details, ask me in the comments. Ah, and English is my third language, for what it's worth. PS he looks like an ESFP to me, and MBTI (not Jung's) descriptions somewhat fit him.
3	entj female.\n\n1/ friendship requirements: respect, possibilities of support on connections, emotional needs and career opportunities, high achievers, share my core values, basically well-rounded. remember your potential of success will roughly measured by your small circle of close friends, so work on that. some will fulfil your needs on A and others on B, etc. so build and maintain a 'portfolio' of friends that can cater to your own needs.\n\n2/ given my criteria on friends, i would recommend u to keep him just for the time being and only when needed. if he doesn't affect you on a fundamental level, great, keep him at arm's length. people like this are obstacles for your own progress. if u want to go fast, go alone. at that point i would say u need to go fast rather than far. \nhowever, if u plan to find work in the city u living in, keep him can be beneficial as he can serve as some sort of connections. just be careful, esfp can be flaky. \n\n3/ move out from your city to somewhere with a better mindset. i dont know where u come from but i've been in some cities in Italy and the overall ambience is quite chilled and relaxed. u will need more competitive environment, put yourself on hot water and survive. however, u will find urself being quite 'misunderstood' for most of the time, unless u can meet someone with NT. learn to accept that. \n
2	trust me it is different. been there done that. 
1	As an ENTJ, what do you guys think of the book Ender's Game?	My thoughts: Ender could very well be ENTJ, but what do y'all think about the book and it's possible relations to ENTJ? 
2	Haven't read the book. After watching the movie numerous times, I agree.
2	Love that book but I always identified more with Bean in the book Enders Shadow. \n\nI dont think Ender would be ENTJ. \nHe doesnt plan out his battles. He just trains his troops and makes it up on the fly. \n\nHes not ambitious enough. \n\nHe's good at empathy which is ENTJ but he feels too much. This is also according to Bean why people follow him. Hes more likeable.\n\nHes a leader but I wouldn't classify him as really wanting to be a leader. He just does it mostly because hes put in the position.\n\nConsider this if he had failed. if he hadn't been the commander who never lost. If he had washed out of battle school do you see him in his story looking for another way to gain leadership and power? I don't think he would have. \n\nHis brother would have and did. I think Peter was an ENTJ. A bit of a psyco but an ENTJ none the less. \n\nI think Bean was also an ENTJ. Methodical, always had a plan, understood emotions even if he himself had trouble with his own. He actively went after social and leadership power even if he did it in a way that didn't necessarily lead to promanance.  
2	What do you Guys Like Doing on Cruises?	Details: Paid for, Royal Caribbean, Sailing to Eastern Caribbean\n\nI'm naturally trying to plan this trip so it's as jam-packed with fun as humanly possible, so I'm calling upon my fellow ENTJs for suggestions
4	honestly, whenever i've been on them i just spent all of my time reading in my room or any other quiet spot i could find. the last time i went on a cruise i went to the bar at night and chilled in the room most of the other time. i wasn't 18 yet so i couldn't do anything ~interesting~. i'm not really sure what there is to do for you, but i really liked going on the mini tour of the island we went to. \n\n\nhave fun! cruises are the best. i love the ocean so much.
2	It’s a bit of an art form isn’t it, squeezing as much as you can out of an adventure without overdoing it. There’s a real sweet spot between planning and remaining flexible. I try to make an overarching plan, but one that’s open to change and unforeseen opportunities. I think I plan about 70%, and leave 30% open-ended. \n\nI would definitely do some research about each port of call, and make a couple advance bookings depending on how much time you have at each port (especially for those activities that require it). You can always cancel ahead of time if you change your mind. I like to learn a little about what each place is known for: the best sights to see, the best activities to do, foods/drinks to try, places to shop, and where the most beautiful beaches are in relation to the ship. \n\nI think I like to rely pretty heavily on the guides they give you before each port though. We’ll bring some extra money just in case we want to book excursions and transportation through the cruise, and we usually do. Cruise excursions offer some security in the sense that if you’re late getting back to the ship, they can’t leave you behind.

May go get an old fashioned after dinner every other day.\n\nIf with family, girlfriend, or friends, then probably I'll to enjoy what's on the boat with them.\n\nBut as a matter of fact, I never been on a cruise. I enjoyed every time  (only four, heh) I had to cross a sea with a big boat though, I remember the arcade games room when we crossed the Channel to visit Great Britain in 2nd grade, that was dope.

0	Was Adolf Hitler an ENTJ?	I am curious, he's one of the world leaders whom I have much admiration and respect for, I am curious to know what peoples impressions of such a leaders personality is.
14	Maybe you could use better role models? Churchill? Rommel? Roosevelt? If you’re staying in that era. A racist meth addict with captivating speech patterns and the cause of so much suffering isn’t an ideal person to admire or emulate.
11	with the way the internet is, i can't tell if you're a troll or serious... going through your post history hasn't helped clear things up.
5	An unhealthy INFJ. 
3	Although Hitler was a very dynamic leader, I don't think he was an an ENTJ. I agree with others who type him as FJ. ENTJs are quite calculated, but Hitler was a very feeling person. Although we have a view of Nazi Germany as very systematic, Hitler actually devised many of the systems based on what he felt was right. Even the Holocaust, Germany only began it because the previous attempts to deal with the JQ failed. I think if Hitler was NT type, he would have started with such a plan and his motivation would have been more clinical. Instead, Hitler believed in his dreams of the German Empire and the Third Reich (As Hitler saw it, a glorious realization for Germany.)\n\nIf you are interested in MBTI and Hitler you can find Jung's account of meeting him somewhere online. As Nazi Germany was repairing the country he was invited to be an important figure in a psychological school there and explore psychology through the realms of European myths and archetypes. Of course, Jung was not a Nazi and only a few years later during the war his association with them (Although he never did much) tainted his reputation, and also his disagreement with Freud made him more ostracized from the community and leads to the situation we have today where Freud's school of thought is more accepted than Jung's.\n\nAll I really remember from it is Jung referred to Hitler like as a shell of a person, a man who was not present there in his body and gave Jung an uneasy feeling. Personally I think Hitler was ENFJ but an unhealthy E who could not express himself adequately due to paranoia and betrayal, so behaved as an I (except in front of his crowds, of course.) Anyway good luck if you're interested there's actually quite a bit of information since the men were contemporaries.
5	He arranged for the genocide of about 12 million people and you admire him.  Watch out, bitch.  Karma is coming for you.  
2	I’ve always heard he was an INFJ. I could support  that and the idea that he was an ESFJ. I think for sure he was an FJ. 
2	why Hitler when we have Caesar? wasn't Hitler INFJ? the best entj rode model for me is Caesar. admittedly, genocidal, but i'm strangely fond of Caesar and his strategies. 
1	Most celebrity typers call him an INFJ. Celebrity typing in general is pretty bullshit, though, so don't a possible personality difference stop you from trying to emulate his behavior!\n\n... oh wait.
1	Reading through the responses in this thread was funny! LOL!
1	I hope you're joking when you say you admire him. ENTJs are supposed to be logical please don't put stuff like that in this subreddit
1	Do you mean literally Hitler or Trump?
0	Is it possible?	Is it possible for you to develop Fi when your a child\n\nI actually developed my Fi already. I didn’t know that because i was a “good person”.
7	It is possible to develop your Fi as a child, many people do (INFPs, ESFPs for instance). It isn't to do with being a good person, that is morality and can be subjective, MBTI functions are more to do with how you process information and interact with the world around you, others.
3	I have a very developed Fi. I believe it comes from the fact that, as a child, I was extremely anxious about what the people around thought and believed about me. As it showed useful, I developped it.\n\nBecause of that, I even wondered if I wasn't an ENFJ sometimes. Able to sit down, listen and be empathetic (though I don't enjoy it).
1	ENTJs Fi comes out as strong opinions that they’re often unwilling to compromise on. We’re also terrible about talking about how we actually feel, especially when it comes to more private things.\n\nSo before we can ask, do I have developed Fi, we need to ask, is it possible for ENTJs to develop Fi? Of course! But then, what does it look like? An ENTJ who has learned to compromise, who is less perfectionistic, who is able to discuss feelings, even if only with people close to them, has great Fi.\n\nPeople tend to have a romanticized view of the inferior function and its development. *Don’t forget about your tertiary function!* Se is still extremely important in your cognitive development, and being able to use it fluidly makes you a fuller person than if you were to skip to Fi.
1	what do you guys think of enfp?	
16	I try not to.
9	My older brother is an ENFP and a friend I had for about four years (on and off) is also an ENFP. (both male).\n\nMy sample size of 2 cannot at all be extrapolated to the type as a whole, but this is what I have experienced: Though they can be very creative and I really appreciate their motivational talents, ultimately my relationships with them end up strained. They've required a lot of external validation and have a lot of ideas for how they think things should be but absolutely no interest in actually DOING anything ever. They fly from one extreme to the other, between impassioned self-loathing to a narcissistic grandiose. Everything is always this massive good vs evil struggle and they have a lot of difficulty accounting for things like "shades of grey" and "reality".
5	I like
5	I try not to put people in boxes before I know them. They're ok on the whole, I guess.
3	Healthy ENFPs are great. One of my favorite people is a healthy ENFP. \n\nUnhealthy ENFPs are horrible—they’re manipulative, pretentious, demanding, and exhausting. 
3	Good & bad. Good in bed.
2	Energy demanding but can be nice to have around.
2	I hate to judge groups of people, instead of getting to know the individuals, but ENFPs as a whole, are the most annoying and energy zapping types.
2	Nice at first, then annoying
2	ummmmmm some ENFPs are very nice, but a lot of the time I feel as though we have a personality conflict 
2	[deleted]
2	I am ENFP, most of the people in my life are ENTJ’s.  It seems my particular blend of ENFP, just works with y’all.  \n\n99% of the time, I love your independence.  We can all have a blast with each other and then go do our own thing for a while, then come back again when it works out.\n\nI love the business mind of the ENTJ’s, and completely admire their ability to make decisions.\n\nLastly, ENTJ’s are hilarious.  Y’all say things that I would never say and just don’t get your feelings hurt very easily.  It’s highly entertaining.\n\nMy biggest struggles are with getting y’all to acknowledge your feelings, be a bit gentler when you deliver your messages to others.  Oh! And to chill out and be spontaneous!  That’s a task, but if I’m persistent enough, I can usually crack you, and y’all love it in the end 😄

4	How do you feel about having a manager?	I hate the fact that someone has control over how much I make and where my career progresses. I don't like the fact that I can't be extremely straightforward and direct with them  on certain topics without risking putting the relationship at risk and being at a disadvantage. \n\nHow do you deal with being managed by people you think are not aware of opportunities as you are?\n\nWhat do you feel about management?\n\nBackground: I am 22 in the defense industry. I have a lot of opportunities but my manager wants to take it nice and slow. I feel that I need to do things at a rate I am happy with. 
11	Everybody has a boss. Even when owning your own company.
7	I don't have a manager per say, just my department head. That being said, he's very keen on autonomy and not micromanaging personnel, so we get along swimmingly.\n\nFor your current situation, it's just part of the game. Anything working with or for the government (especially DoD) is going to have that. Try not to fret about it, and keep focusing on what you can do to make yourself more valuable. It'll prove especially true if contracts change hands, etc. Especially because management are the first to go in my experience (new contracts bring in their managers while keeping the workers that are familiar with the projects).
1	I mean in the military it's normal to say "I want to be at "this pace" in the future. How can you help me?"\n\nIt's hard to imagine the defense industry would have delicate relationships like the regular business world 
-1	> Background: I am 22 in the defense industry.\n\nLeave.\n\nI know the money is good but why make weapons and shit?\n\nIt is a cash cow. Just look at the 1 Trillion dollar F35 program.\n\nThere is a fuck ton of money in this industry but you would be better of earning money the right way.\n
8	Anyone else attribute their ENTJness with emotionally abusive parents?	Just as the title says. Lately i’ve been doing a lot of deconstruction of every single event that has transpired in my childhood till now (18yo) and I have not only realized that my own parent’s specific flavor of emotional abuse has led me to have some...not so positive personality quirks, but they also have resulted in some really good ones. For example, my mom, The Narcissist (post Divorce trauma) caused her to be CONSTANTLY running her mouth and never asking for my input, or trying to prove me wrong with everything I said. While i absolutely it  and her during the time, the way I internalized it is the reason for my quick wit, constantly preparing a rebuttle that would be shot down. So i kept redrafting what I had to say to her. \n\nEither that or I was born with it, you know?  Aside from this being a nature vs nurture type of conversation, does anyone have any experiences or thoughts about how the emotionally neglectful/abusive behaviors your parents exhibited during your childhood/ any type of neglect have indirectly caused you to have a greater mental stamina through constant conflict and trauma.
4	You have my sympathy for being faced with the task of unraveling all that has happened to you so that you can understand and move on.\n\nI disagree with your hypothesis in two ways. One, I do not think "greater mental stamina" or the "quick wit" you mentioned are things we can safely associate with the ENTJ type, at least without more specific language. Two, I seriously doubt that emotional abuse has a statistical tendency to cultivate "greater mental stamina" or "quick wit" in its victims. I offer the alternate explanation that your acquisition of these traits is reflective of qualities in you that aren't accounted for by the ENTJ type.\n\nI would say that a family's preference for/acceptance of given functions does strongly impact the mental health of its members; if Te is unwelcome and Fi is encouraged then an ENTJ must adapt or suffocate, but if Te gives an advantage is and Fi is a liability then it's easy to settle further into stereotypical ENTJ patterns.
4	I didn't have abusive parents, more emotionally negligent than anything. Definitely not a good dynamic though.\n\nI don't think my ENTJness came from my parents--my siblings are ENFP and INFJ, after all. But I think being an ENTJ definitely helped get through it in much better shape. For example, I needed less emotional nurturing than my siblings, so the lack of it didn't mess me up as badly. I was also naturally independent and self-starting, which was a necessity in that environment.
2	first of all, nice username XD. \n\nsecond, i'm sorry about your past. \n\nthird to answer your question, i do attribute a major part of my identity to my parents. they were not abusive, but they've made me emotionally distant, detached, and extremely uncomfortable with being under anyone thumb or at someones mercy, so very low Fi (typical enneagram 8 traits). My father never liked to interfere in my life, he always said, your life, your actions, your responsibility and that i must take responsibility and face the consequences of my choice, this helped me develop my Te and Ni. there are other things i don't want to get into, but my mom had been borderline abusively strict, A wasn't good enough, only A+. and B- would be considered a disaster.  She was a religious woman, and an overemotional one whom never accepted logic when it came to her blood relatives and her religious beliefs. my dad was/is aloof,very introverted. likes to mind his own business and taught me to do the same.also, he is a "never throw the first punch son, always throw the last punch" kind of guy. dad definitely an ISTP, mom i'm not so sure, i think ESFJ
2	I believe I do my ENTJness to the combined fact that I have always been praised as very intelligent by my family, teachers and friends on one hand, and my continual dissatisfaction with many elements of my life, which I felt were not right because I was sure I could had design them better (I still do, hello uni) on the other hand.
2	I don’t know. I just discovered the Enneagram test, check it out if you haven’t already. Many ENTJs are type Eights, and I’ve heard it said that many Eights report abusive childhoods. This may just be anecdotal evidence, but the person I heard it from is very knowledgeable about the Enneagram. \n\nMy father is an ESFJ with NPD. I watched my mother die when I was 15, she was like a best friend/sister to me. They were both lenient and affectionate, but my father was suffocating. I moved out the month I turned 18 lol. 
2	I had a very abusive, narcissistic mother like you, and I also find myself to be an ENTJ. I really feel like the T evolved as a defense mechanism to block out the belligerence coming from her end, and that naturally I would actually be an F. The J was also influenced by the need to constantly make decisions promptly, or else things would end up poorly for me. I feel like the E also came from my need to seek attention outside of my abusive mother, but then again I could see how abusive parents could make someone be an I. This was very thought-provoking, and I'm glad you posted it. In sum, I'd say that I could actually attribute a lot of my ENTJ-ness to my parents. 
1	I heard a theory about this, that inferior functions are a result of some type of trauma. "Trauma" in a very leberal sense. This has many implications that can be criticized but I find the inferior Fi to be interesting in that conjecture because it can definetly be from abuse or high emotional stress as a kid. I have two close ENTJ friends who have suffered from childhood trauma.
1	Not really. I have several others siblings who were also treated like shit. And none of the others are ENTJs. There’s a whole bunch of Fs instead, which I think would make more sense based on the abuse we experienced. 
10	Entj appreciation post	Don't wanna stroke y'all ego too much, but as an esfp I love y'all. \n\nAll my bestest friends and favorite coworkers have been ENTJs. I like pushing your buttons and it's always fun to be in competition with you. \n\nAlso, I love talking shit about stupid people with ENTJs. We can just be assholes together and admit it and just keep venting. \n\nSome advice; y'all are great at making plans and motivated to accomplish your goals when you're comfortable with all the details, but the ENTJs I've known sometimes procrastinate big decisions or they'll take the easy decision because it's smarter instead of the hard one and then regret it because the hard one was what actually would've fulfilled them. So, my advice is to make sure you don't miss an opportunity just because it's coming from left field!  Also, apply to that job you've been thinking about! Right now. Apply. \n\n\n
8	I hate how the last part is so true and accurate. It is amazing advice. I love it. Also thank you for stroking my ego. My ego thanks you too
8	I find people who try to push my buttons just for the sake of pushing buttons, annoying. I also find people who talk shit about other people, just for the sake of talking shit, annoying.\n\nGood luck with those applications. Not a type of friendship I would enjoy.
1	I talk shit about stupid people all the time so you got me there 🤷🏻‍♂️😂 I’m very strong in the workplace so thank you for the post :)
4	ENTP wanting a change in lifestyle	As an ENTP, I’ve always admired ENTJs. Now, I’m turning to you guys for help on how to get my act together. \n\nI’ve been known as a master procrastinator, procrastinating on projects and assignments, but almost always somehow managing to get perfect scores by what I perceive as luck. \n\nEver since 2018 started, I found myself wanting to change this habit of procrastination since I came to a realization that that luck won’t stay with me forever. However, my biggest problem is motivation. The only reason procrastination works for me is because I find myself working best under pressure with the adrenaline pushing me to finish and perfect the task at hand. Any tips? 
10	Eat the frog first, every day!\n\nStart by getting done the most unpleasant task first. Then everything else is easier from then out; it gains momentum, and it feels sooooo good.
6	Mate, you just fuckin do it. 
2	What I do is just one simple thing each day without fail, and the deal is, I can't go to bed if I haven't completed it. Make it something you can do. Don't make it too hard. And just start with one thing. It can be whatever you want. Mine is I have to do a work out for 20 minutes. I have a daily planner that I write out each morning and put a check by the things I've completed. It's amazing how motivated you feel by simply fulfilling a goal you've set for the day, and then you're inspired to do more ( at least I am) 
3	Smaller projects with shorter deadlines. Have a semester project? Break it into core aspects, and set a deadline to each, ideally with one deadline each week.\n\n"Fixing" procrastination is really tough. Always seem to find yourself saying you'll fix it later.\n\nBetter to design for it when it's become such a bankable trait. By setting multiple deadlines, you can procrasinate a little each week while still moving forward. 
2	Improving work habits is always a good idea imo. But don't dismiss procrastinating totally. If you haven't already, I suggest a little research on benefits. I see procrastinating as a skill. Most of the world loves lists and the orderly order of ordering everything. ENTP is not most people.
2	Start by making the bed right when you wake up. Some general said that it is the most important task of the day because it is the first task. It puts you on the right path to get shit done. 
2	Size up a opportunity, see how your gonna get there and execute the task.
2	I date an ENTP, and I swear he could have written this. Something I try to do to help him with procrastination/motivation problems: positive reinforcement. \n\nHave a specific goal, and when you achieve it, reward yourself. Sometimes motivation is hard to grasp if the reward is just a few points towards your grade or for your boss to not yell at you. \n\nMy ENTP doesn't think a lot of tasks are important especially if the consequences of not doing them aren't too burdening. So make them important. "If I do X, then something awesome will happen" is much more motivating than "If I do X, then it will be done". 
0	Your an awesome procrastinator.
4	Female ENTJ dating ISFP	Hi all looking advice from assertive ENTJ or anyone who has experience in these issues in general.\n\nAs our relationship progresses into something more serious. I"d like to start planning for our future. However this is proving very difficult as my partner isfp insists that he is fine with the present situation and does not seek any improvements.\n\nBackground \nI am a  graduate lawyer and my partner is in Payroll he has been in the same government job for 5 years and although he earns enough, he is having a hard time making ends meet as he recently bought a house.\n\n I contribute as much as I can but at the end of the day it is his house and his mortgage repayments. It's very frustrating for me to see him struggle so I encourage him to find a better job he has masters from a prestigious university and is overqualified for payroll. \n\nDespite the struggles my partner insists he is fine  and doesn't want to look for a new jobs. Moreover we plan to have children and we can't support that plan given the current situation.\n\nWhenever I raise the question he sees it as a personal attack on his current job- I have no issues with his current job I just don't want him to struggle. Eventually my plans are to become a judge and provide enough for him to not work if he chooses to, however until that point he needs to do things to help himself. \n\nI'm  frustrated I can't get through to him on this level and it's difficult to have a conversation as he gets very emotionally charged about it.. \n\nany advice ? \n\n
6	advice. first study NVC. it seems the basic foundation   \nsecond, his intuition clearly loves his work, or fears the alternative. either way, his reason cannot articulate it.  \nyou pushing him will not help.  \nyou have to understand that he might be livingthe dream here ) life is not about money or status
3	How long have you been dating? And where in the relationship process are you?
1	I am also ENTJf and I'm in a relationship of many years with ISFPm. I feel your pain. It took a very long time to understand where my partner is coming from, but ISFP are very value oriented. Does he value a slower pace of life if it means less money? You have to figure out what motivates and inspires him. I am woman of STEM and he is an artist. I am motivated by complex, high energy problems that I can solve, money, and "moving up". He is motivated by freedom in hobbies and expressions and stability (safety, security). It is difficult at times when we try to plan ahead because I like to have lots of control with budgeting and he doesn't get it. The best thing I have found to work is draw up where the money goes now, where it will need to come from and go once you have a family, and talk through a feasible plan to make it happen together. Break it down thoroughly and expain it to him. Dont be accusatory and really try to understand his point of view. You have to always hold each other accountable while also not settling or letting him overstep your boundaries. ISFPs are balancing to our personality type. It is our natural mode to steamroll through problems with logic and action but we have to look past this and adapt for relationships. Hope this helps. 
1	It sounds like you have fundamentally different approaches to personal finance and that's a leading cause of marital strife. This is a serious area to be mismatched. If you are looking into having children with this man I suggest that the two of you see both a couples counselor and a financial advisor.
1	That is a major red flag. How can you build a nest with someone who doesn't value having a good job or nest? Time to move on.
3	ENTJs-good at leading, bad at politics?	I made an interesting observation the other day while looking at a list of the MBTI types of US Presidents. We (probably) have never had an ENTJ President. The only two presidents I’ve seen typed as ENTJs are FDR, who I’m relatively certain was an ESTP (he was actually pretty lazy before he got polio) and LBJ (and I’m confident he was a sensor.) \n\nFurthermore, the only example of a democratically-elected head of state I could think of that I was sure was an ENTJ-Margaret Thatcher- never actually won a majority of the popular vote (her opposition was divided), had some of the worst approval ratings of any PM in British history, and was forced out by her own party. \n\nAnd it’s not like ENTJs aren’t running for office, Al Gore, Bernie Sanders, Ted Cruz, and Jeb Bush have all run for office in the past few years and failed to make it.\n\nSo here’s my theory: politics favor those with a sociable personality and a desire to be liked generally found in ExxPs (every US President since 1980 has been one, with the exception of Bush I.) I suspect ENTJs are often too obstinate, wonkish, and uninterested in popularity to successfully climb to the top of the ladder in politics.
13	I despise bureaucracy and cant imagine getting caught up in being a politician. Having to kow-tow to every group to get votes, begging for money, being scrutinized at every turn, mired in muck and filth of it all... without actually accomplishing much of anything -  sounds like a complete nightmare to me. \n\nI cant see it being appealing to the personality type. Having to pretend to be nice all of the time? Not getting any real, actual work done? No thanks! 
3	I think that ENTJs tend to be peripheral in politics, might become Members of Parliament/Congress, only reaching for the top towards the end of their political careers, mostly from the frustration of always having a superior. If they get there, they are quickly disillusioned by how constrained they are. I would be hesitant to take a job that would put me under heavy scrutiny, has a maximum term, and that you can be voted out of. \n\nI do know of ENTJs that head NGOs, unions, lobby groups. I think being a senior policy analyst, or high up in a ministry wouldn't be so bad, and there's always the revolving door of lobbyists and political connections that you could utilize later. 
7	I don't agree with your theory.\n\nCelebrity typing depends on I/E, S/N, P/J spectrum rather than functions, which leads to incorrect typing. Based off your analysis, I don't think you typed based off of functions either.\n\nSounds like an attempt to be edgy.
2	I agree with u/savageappeal --trying to type others from afar often leads to incorrect typing. Celebrity typing in general is a cancer on the face of the MBTI community.
1	I would definitely be bad at politics. In fact, I didn’t go into a specific career because I dipped my toes in and decided I wasn’t willing to play the politics game in the workplace. However, I’m a great leader now that I’m not an asshole and I often move up the ranks quickly to gain leadership positions. 
1	I think that Trump is a spoiled ENTJ. Why are you concerned with an ENTJ presidency?
4	I'm a 19yo ENTJ female, and I need dating advice! How do I go on a date without being too brash? Men are usually interested in my looks (I used to model), but as soon as I start talking I scare them off :/. Anyone been there and know how to fix?	
26	Assuming that your default setting isn't completely obnoxious, you're thinking about this the wrong way (and if you do have bad personality flaws, you should work on them before dating).\n\nYes, attract people with your good looks, then *be yourself*. You'll get rid of anyone that doesn't like you for who you are, and retain people that find your personality attractive. Love is short and life is long, don't spend it pretending to be somebody else. 
17	my philosophy is if someone doesn't like you for who you are then they aren't right for you. i'm waaay too brash and it's hard sometimes to realize i might be scaring people off, but also *fuck them*. if they can't handle you, then they don't need to be in your life. if you have flaws, they'll accept them and help you grow. be yourself. there are a LOT of guys out there who love women like us; you just gotta find em.
9	I think you should figure out which (if any) parts of your behavior are legitimately "too brash" and which (if any) are just you being confident/assertive. Then, if necessary, you can figure out how to adjust. "Be yourself" is only good advice if you're already pretty awesome.\n\nHowever, the older you get the more comfortable guys become with confident women. Be patient. At the very least, you're not investing too much time in them.
3	I think that it's good, you know early on that the person is just interested in your looks.  You'll eventually meet someone who likes you for your entire self, not just your looks.  Just keep being you.
4	Dude here. Fellow ENTJ.\n\nWhat do you say that scares them off? Give an example. It’ll clarify for everyone here and make you confront whatever it is you’re worried about.
3	I'm an ENTJ-A woman...20 years old. My mom always told me since high school that I should be dating MEN...not BOYs...as soon as I started prospecting/dating people who are at least 2 years older than me...more likely 3-5 years older, I noticed that these guys not only understood me better, but were more focused and mature. I know as ENTJs we struggle to find comparably mature and driven partners so I think the best thing you can do is look to men who are ready for you...especially the Introverted iNtuitive types who may not initially have the guts to ask out a "pretty girl" they don't know well.
2	Well, the first question that rises in my head by reading the information you offered is that did you like them?\n\nbecause "scaring off" people does happen to me,or rather did happen to me, I've learned to somewhat get a grip on my "intensity".\n\nI assume that when you're talking to someone on a date and you scare them off, you've started talking seriously about future, your goals, or your expectations. strength of character and the intensity that most of us ENTJ's have would come out when we're talking about this. think of it like this, have you seen in the movies when the guy has had his whole family slaughtered and he vows revenge? that moment of becoming hellbent of sth in the movie, the vibe it gives off, that's how most ENTJ's look when they're talking about their plans seriously. also guys your age, are struggling for some confidence, even if they look they're already arrogant af, but their self confidence is shaky and glass-like fragile, so, when they meet an assertive independent woman with a take-charge attitude, it does come across their minds as a threat.\n\nI myself have had that problem when i was actively dating, i can't say it's completely gone, but i'm handling it better and also, i've come to accept and even embrace it as an advantage, not many people can put up with my character, but the ones that do, i'm very comfortable with, and i can be myself around them without restraint. and if that's not a good thing, i don't know what is. \n\nAlso, people's taste differs from person to person,my friends taste vary from the stereotypes "princess"-"busty dullard" "nerdy" "housewife".and  i myself do not like majority of the girls around me. my type would best be described as a warrior. i don't want someone to "have my back", neither do i want a princess that needs to be saved, i want someone who can not only go toe to toe with me, but also would keep me on my toes. she/he would be the closest person to me, and will identify weaknesses and flaws that I've buried deep, so i would like them to be able to challenge me to grow, to work on them. in short, i want a partner,not an assistant, nor a master. i want an equal who would be by my side. So my advice to you mate would be to \n\nDon't consider this a failure on your part. it's not\n\nDon't hide who you are, if you're brash or harsh, embrace it. by embracing it, the too harsh and too brash parts will slowly get disssolved.\n\nalso, don't expect too much from a guy who's going out with you just because of the looks. i mean, he could have absolutely no clue as in who you are and what you're like as a person.\nif you want further advice, you'd need to give more information. as in what types of guy get attracted to you,(there is always a type :)) )or how you behave on dates.\n\nanyways, i wish you good luck on your next date mate.
2	How about trying to meet better guys.  Or having a better filter in place to realize they are superficial dicks to begin with?  Where/how are you meeting these guys?
1	I think you will this changes a bit with age. Guys under 25 are likely intimidated by what I can only assume is a degree of forcefulness that you display that most 19 year old women do not. That’s surprises them and catches them off guard. Men that age are generally looking to build their confidence and worth via romantic escapades, and it may be the case that your demeanor does not lend itself to such. There’s nothing wrong with that. You are fine.\n\nTe can make us prone to talk more than listen, and that’s something that nearly everyone needs to bear in mind when it comes to relationships. As long as you are leaving space in the dynamic for the other person to be themselves, just be yourself. Strong flavors aren’t for everyone, but that’s okay. Just be your best self. The rest will work itself out.
1	I say, get to know them well before going out on a date with them. I'm incredibly picky and don't let down my guard easily even when out on a date. I'm thinking whitney cummings comes across as very brash and in your face, I always thought of her as an ENTJ. Some find her over the top, I think she's perfect.
0	Wanna go for a "practice date"? ;p
0	Get rid of them anyway. If you scare them off by talking then they clearly aren't compatible with you and they don't deserve you. 
-6	I was going to suggest that you date me, but looking at your short history of posts - you come off as a feminist, so you and I would probably just end up arguing about James Damore, psychometric research, the so-called Wage Gap, Donald Trump, the Simpson's Paradox and so on.\n\nI might come off as too brash.\n\nP.S. Why would you use real name on Reddit?\n
9	What do you think about tattoos? Do you have them? Was it an easy decision?	I've thought about getting one several times over the years. I'm 50 now. I thought about memorials for my Overlords, but then I'd just end up with a bunch of random cat tats, and that's stupid. I like the idea of having a single artist do something significant.. but I never show off my back, and I'm Pres/CEO, so no sleeves. \n\nSo I thought, maybe something small... \n\nAnd I've never anything... Analysis Paralysis \n\nHow do you guys feel about it?\n\n
6	Analysis paralysis! God I hate when that happens. \n\nIdk if I have difficulty deciding, or if I just have difficulty finding something that matters enough to me that I want it on my skin forever. If someday I was unearthed like an Egyptian mummy, would I be proud of the markings on my body? Would I still stand for what they signify? That’s my litmus test. \n\nUnless you’re going to go all out, I prefer a minimalist look. Something classy, yet sexy/edgy. The meaning itself doesn’t have to sexy, but the location of it can make it so.\n\nI don’t see myself ever committing to covering large portions of my body unless the artist is expertly skilled in a realistic style, and they confer with me on every little detail. The amount of planning it would take makes it so it’ll probably never happen. I’m not against it tho. 
7	A 50 year old browses here? Boss
2	Try something temporary and take the time to figure out what you really want if your aim is to brand yourself with something permanent.
2	I have two and am booked in for more. I set some some very specific rules for myself getting any tattoos;\n\n1) Nothing on a whim. I would decide what I wanted and then wait at least a year. If I still wanted it then I could go ahead. \n2) Nothing that would be visible when wearing business dress. \n3) Research the artist very thoroughly. Even meet with them for a consultation first. \n4) No names or faces. Names because the people in your life can change and faces because I think there are very few artists in the world capable of making then look as good as they should. \n\nThat’s just what I go by, hope it helps!
2	I have a small, simple, easily concealed tat that carries meaning. I drew it when I was 18 and decided if I still wanted it in several years that I would get it. Had it done 10 years ago at 23 and have no regrets. \n\nI love elaborate colors and designs on other people, but don’t think I’ll ever commit to that myself.
1	i want a tattoo, probably. i went from not wanting one for ages, to really wanting them, to not really caring. if i could figure out something good, i'd probably do it. i'm mostly into piercings, though. \n\n\nyou should get a small tat. it doesn't really matter where, because you could easily cover it for work. if you're a ceo, then you have money for concealer. it probably doesn't take that long to put on, either. 
1	I prefer to modify my body through weight training.  
1	I've got two, and am considering a third that would be a start of a sleeve (shoulder). My most recent is on my forearm, so not easy to hide. I'm in for (Asst. Director), but work in an area and for an employer that supports indivuality, or at least makes discriminating against things like tattoos or bright hair unacceptable.\n\nThe way I see it, you'll never find something that reflects who you are now and for the rest of your life. If you do, then you aren't growing or changing as a person, and that's unlikely. Tattoos are reflections of who we are and where we are at one point in life. They are reminders of both where we've been and where we might be going. Find something that speaks to you, but don't dwell on the permanence of it. Just look at it as part of your story.
1	I don't wanna be too detailed but it's a design clearly meant to bilaterally point at my penis from my thighs. A dick frame, if you will. Directions if you need them. \n\nI got it years ago as a joke and everyone who's seen it loves it. 
1	When it comes to tattoos on other people I think it can be pretty cool/aesthetically pleasing/even funny depending on the tattoo. But I'm pretty ambivalent in general.\n\n\nFor myself? Shit scared. I view it kind of like child birth. I admire people who can get through the pain but I'd just rather not go through it personally.\n\n\nAs for your dilemma, I think if you want one just go for it. I actually have this one friend who once got a tattoo in a colour close to their skin tone around the wrist so that they could get away with it at work, so maybe something of that sort is an option? 
18	Do any of you live in a s***hole? How does it affect your ambition?	Seriously, this question has been bugging me since I knew about MBTI. \n\nBetween all of the MBTI types, ENTJ is the least likely to be satisfied with being a failure/nobody or economically impaired. But then, there are countries where becoming a somebody or attaining economic stability is almost impossible. I am wildly curious to see what ENTJs are doing with their lives in poor starving countries and why they haven't overthrown the incompetent corrupted system and took charge yet (the last statement is only slightly a joke). \n
22	Brother, i gotta say, it is not good. i live in middle east,Iran and it is not looking good. the economy is very dysfunctional and the whole system is corrupt,,(i'm not sure if you followed the news,we some major riots in different cities the past month which was violently put down,about 30 murders and thousands of arrests), and not the good kind of corrupt! and it has effected my life plan severely, if i had a choice, i would've loved to become a law enforcement officer or a district attorney, but since the way those jobs work is so intolerable for me, i have decided to go for a career in business, and i'm trying my best, but it's not looking good. the thing is, in my country, it doesn't matter how well educated,skilled or talented are you, all it matters is if you have someone on the inside to pull rank for you, or you're in league with the corrupt,mass-murdering racist religious hateful trashes of the government.your qualifications barely matter, and all that matters is if you're one of them. so yeah, it decreases ambition,and if not, it badly twists and corrupts it.it also inflicts a tough question that some consider moral but i don't on you: Should i focus on becoming/appearing(personally i don't think there is a difference)as one of them or should i go my own way. personally, I've decided to choose a middle ground, as I've mentioned on this sub before, i had ties with a paramilitary organization,but i loathed it.i worked there just about enough to be in the records, and to show in future job interviews that i'm one of them, or at least, i don't pose a threat to their twisted ideology. and at the same time, i pursue skills and knowledge necessary to make me a good manager in business. and as an entj who lives in a rotten land, i'd love to get out of this hellhole and live in a country with opportunities for a decent life.
9	Lived in an apartment complex full of drug addicts, and had three flunky roommates. Sounds harsh to call them that, but one of them had a history with meth, another had a history with opioids, and the third liked to hang out with the knife-throwing lunatics below us. One of them beat the shit out of his face. His friends dumped him in the apartment and I had to call an ambulance so he could get facial surgery.\n\nAll people adapt themselves to fit their surroundings. I tended to lock myself in my room and learn accounting. Learn learn learn. Kept my gun near my bed. Called the cops all the time when shit went down. Just learned and distanced myself from my neighbors and roommates.\n\n\nThe meth guy was choking out the opioids guy one morning, so I pulled my gun on him. He let go, but I sure as fuck moved out the next day.\n\n\nNow I’m the CFO of a company that launches in a few months. I wouldn’t trade the painful experiences I had for anything in the world because they give me wisdom as a young man. But fuck. I never wanna go back there again.\n\n\nTL;DR: lived in a shit complex full of addicts. Locked myself in my room and taught myself accounting. Pulled my gun on my psycho roommate to make him stop choking someone. Moved out, and now I’m the CFO of a company that’s launching next month. Surroundings affect you.
3	Hey man, 22yo ENTJ here living in Brazil...\n\nI had luck that throughout my early education economy was good (because ALL of brazilians royalties were selling at good prices) which made my parents earn enough to provide me good education.\n\nWhen I got to my high school years economy was trash, my grandpa died (he used to be friends w the guy who employed my dad) and as a consequence, my dad lost his good paying job.\nSince my grandpa's death my parents have never recovered from the shock and now developed themselves into extremely lazy, depressed people with excessive amounts of self-pity, constantly beating the shit out of me (I have a younger sis which was the golden child at the time but now they what they did to me, to her) for no reason and projecting STUPID amounts of insecurity into me.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, since the economy was shit, my parents had no job, I had no job, and the good universities are only accessible to people who can spend 24/7 studying (they r free, the good ones, but the entrance exam is ridiculously hard) I found myself in a deep depression cycle, working on shitty gigs, trying to help my parents out and using drugs in the spare time. \n\nSomething along the way clicked and I started doing web-development. I have this thing I tend to think we as ENTJs are really smarter than we look??? Idk, I just know that after I got into coding, my brain kinda went into a knowledge berserk state. Fast-forward a couple of years, I got a gig at a USA company (they don't pay me tremendous amounts of money but the salary is decent) and I'm moving out of my parents this year with my girlfriend and our cat :), I make enough so I can pay for my own shit and still help my pitiful shitty parents out, in an absolute SHIT (trust me br is in a deplorable state) country so I guess I'm doing fine...\n\nWhat I got from all of this is: It is REALLY much easier to do basically ANYTHING on good countries.\nIt's not IMPOSSIBLE to do shit on shitty countries tho... Just endure the pain and move forward...
1	At least people living in shithole countries could come up with an excuse ...\n\n> and why they haven't overthrown the incompetent corrupted system and took charge yet (the last statement is only slightly a joke).\n\nGame theory? Tragedy of the commons? Revolutionaries getting eaten by the revolution.\n\n
0	Dating an ENTJ female: talking bout abstract subjects	So I am a 22yo male ENFP and... I have been dating this 21yo female ENTJ and I have a question. Do you like theorizing or do you just prefer talking about... superficial/mundane topics more? Maybe it depends on the person or group you are talking to? I have noticed this pattern with her: talk about superficial stuff - joking - silence - me saying random "deep" thoughts/ideas. She has stated that she likes listening to me talk about those ideas and theories but I would love if she would also talk about what she think about those ideas and theories or even express her own, not just listening. Would I be expecting too much or nah?
20	There’s a decent chance she thinks your theories are absolute garbage.  
7	I would say in general ENTJ’s do not love superficial topics preferring the deep ones however they/we are usually adept at navigating superficial conversations when we need to.\n\nI’d say keep poking around the deep topics, but cycle through a variety of topics until you find one that sparks her interest.  Then as you fall deep down the conversation well, occasionally pepper in some dissent opinions, it’ll give her something to argue against and keep the conversation alive.\n\nGeneric disclaimer: as always people are people and vastly different regardless of MBTI, so everything I said could well be opposite in reality with respect to her and it won’t break any laws of nature.
3	I am an ENTJ male. I have great conversations with an INFP female friend of mine (No romantic involvement) about conceptual and theoretical topics. She will often bring up things like the meaning of modern art pieces and I ridicule her rather mercilessly for it. We just laugh how opposite we are when it comes to our taste in art and music.\n\nSo abstract, no, but conceptual...definitely. I love to know how systems work together and analyze those things. Most of my best conversations with my INFP friend have been working through thoeries of human nature and theology.\n\nEdit: Spelling
1	My ENFP friends and I have great conversations, they're both deep thinkers and we can generally talk for hours. Either you're rambling and she's very patient (topics I can't be bothered with that ENFPs seem to like: spirituality, conspiracy theories), or you have an introvert. Think about it, likes listening more than speaking, needs to be prompted to share their thoughts, hesitates before speaking? Watch some of the ENTJs on Youtube to get a feel for us.
1	It depends; I like talking about theoretical/abstract stuff to a certain point, but after that point I just feel like it's a waste of time. In those situations I don't want to express my own opinions because then it'll just be more wasted time, plus ENFPs tend to take it too personally if you disagree with them.\n\nBased on your description your conversations sound kind of one-sided. How often do you talk about her interests?
1	Women want emotion dude, not nebulous concepts. She wants to kiss and have her emotions spiked, and do the things that make her feel good. Not have dumb scientific conversations, which is why yours are falling flat. Save it for the guy friends.
1	For the logs: communication was horrible. Things ended. Not able to communicate properly without giving out unrequested advices 
1	Maybe she's just not an ENTJ...\n\n"Spacing out" while you're talking about what interests you might be a red flag that you're both not really compatible, at least in my opinion
3	Advice on tattoo	I'm wanting to get a tattoo (likely on or near my shoulder area) and was wondering what it would be of to reflect my personality type. 
3	A cactus\n
4	It's initially painful, permanent, costs money and doesn't do anything of actual use outside of undercover work. Try something temporary so you don't end up with buyer's remorse at least.
2	If you had to get a tattoo just having the letters ENTJ would be the most efficient 
2	I’m an ENTJ and I have a mountain scene on my chest to help reflect on how small I am and how I can look outwards for help. Don’t know if that is helpful but there it is. 
4	Nothing. That'd be most efficient, you don't spend any time on a ratio and nor do you waste time later in case the tattoo goes wrong. \n\n\n
2	Are you female or male? If you’re female, you should get a pair of boxing mitts down on your lady parts with the words “Hit it like a champ.” \n\nKidding.
2	Tattoos are not in style this season. If you really want to express yourself, undergo a sex change.
1	Ok it's your body you can do whatever you want and all these people here are only pretending they behave like [homo economicus](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Homo_economicus)\n\nI'm someone who's been spending like a total of a decade on what kind of tattoo I want and it's *constantly changed*. So, my advice is that if it's something that you personally value you should be ready to spend a lot of time thinking/researching tattoo culture before you commit to one. /u/N0ble1's recommendation of temporary tattoos is worthwhile. A lot of redditors I see suggest [inkbox](https://inkbox.com/)\n\nTalk to artists and browse the thousands of online tattoos (apparently I like a category called [Trash Polka](https://www.google.com/search?q=trash+polka+tattoo&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwix_6aWkdjYAhUjwYMKHdVDCKcQ_AUICigB&biw=1536&bih=772)). There are tons of weird niches to sift through that I'm pretty sure you'll find something, but as an ENTJ-inclined person (Which is I'm assuming) you should be prepared to want to spend a serious amount of time mulling over.

1	I only have one small tat on my foot, a musical symbol. I’m thinking of getting ‘Molon Labe’ in Ancient Greek tattooed on the side of my ribs, it’s a classical expression of defiance. The literal translation is ‘having come, take’, or ‘come and take’. I think ENTJs pioneered the art of the laconic phrase. Only my SO is allowed to take it as a friendly invitation, for everyone else it’s a defiant challenge.\n\nIt was said by King Leonidas in response to Xerxes demanding that the Spartans surrender their weapons. Unfortunately, the phrase has been hijacked by conservative gun rights nerds in America, the irony being that Spartans of that time looked down on ranged weapons as cowardly and easy. 
1	Of nothing. That would be the tattoo to reflect my personality type, the no tattoo type. To reflect your type - insecure enough to get a tattoo for the sake of getting a tattoo when you don't even have any motive you feel strongly about - I guess some random Chinese letters that unintentionally spell something embarrassing.
12	ENTJs are known to have little patience, what are ways to gain control and stay calm in stressful situations?	I’m so impatient. Help!
16	I’m only impatient with things that makes me lose my time.
9	Mindfulness and breathing exercises help me. I have also worked really hard to take things less seriously.   I pay attention to my body and if I feel myself getting ramped up for no reason, I am mediately try to mitigate that stress or work to calm down. 
6	Get yourself some [nice balls](http://odditymall.com/niceballs-scrotum-stress-ball)
3	Emotional Intelligence 2.0. Buy the book, take the assessment, work on your opportunity areas. 
2	Sometimes it's good to be impatient. No procrastination. More discipline.\n\nHowever, it can put people off. \n\nYou could either approach it in the **mind-over-body** way: learn about personality differences and what is known as emotional intelligence. Here is a lecture series:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM&list=PL22J3VaeABQApSdW8X71Ihe34eKN6XhCi\n\nOR\n\nThe **body-over-mind** way: try to do exercise a lot or some mindfulness/meditation. That way your body will calm down your mind.\n\nI try to do both.
2	Honestly productivity.\n\nDoing anything to help my situation is better than doing nothing. I had a death in the family and everyone was kind of emotional at the time, lots of talking and hugging and stuff over the course of a week. I probably cleaned my parents house like four times, cooked some food, took the little kids to parks, moved boxes around. Probably seemed manic or weird but it was my way of coping with feeling powerless in the face of tragedy, getting organized and moving was the best thing for me at that time. 
1	Telling myself, that maybe they just weren’t focusing while doing the task. 
1	Realize that stress can affect your health if you don't gain control of it. Also, nutrients like serotonin
0	How does entj see entp ..? for entp: intj are "real monsters" ... they cling to all possible details as they do not fit ... what to say to them: why are you hurting me? are you unjust? do you have a proven way?	is that: entj have Fi's band ... here is the description ...?\n\nwhat strategy to adopt:\n\n    avoid them? bad idea\n\n    conflict?\n\n    pretend Te instead of Ti? :-)\n\n.....\n\n"Fi is often seen as very hard to elucidate since so little of it is openly displayed. Jung writes of feeling in introverted feelers "[As feeling] continually seeking an image which has no existence in reality, but which it has seen in a kind of vision. It glides unheedingly over all objects that do not fit in with its aim. It strives after inner intensity, for which the objects serve at most as a stimulus. The depth of this feeling can only be guessed—it can never be clearly grasped. It makes people silent and difficult of access; >>> it shrinks back like a violet from the brute nature of the object in order to fill the depths of the subject. It comes out with negative judgments or assumes an air of profound indifference as a means
12	[deleted]
2	I copy pasted your post, placed it on google, got way to much content to read, I found jungian cognitive functions.\n\nI don't know what you seek, who you are, but you are being unclear.\n\nI've meet a couple of INTP and ENTP in the past. They are completly unable to say what they want before having it in front of them, but they are not dumb. Far from it, they usually know why they want it and how they want it, but they don'T know the what in questions.\n\nThen again, you may be outside of the norm, but I'll try to answer your questions.\n\nHow does entj see entp.\nENTJ are ''cold'' people. I think I am really emotional in many way, but I also think that crying doesn't bring back the dead. When you are confronted to a shitty reality, you have to choice. One, you get all sad. 2, you move on.\n\nI think ENTP are dangerous people. Because they are harder to pin down. It's harder to read an ENTP then most other types of people. Not because they are good liars, but because they have a way to hard time to express themself. So when they try to say X, they will say Y. Therefore, it is hard to read.\n\nI have friend who are ENTP, but it's really hard to feel connected to them, simply because they never say ; Thank you or I'm gratefull. If you help them, they will act as : since you took the decisions of helping them, then they don't have to give you anything in return.\n\nENTJ are closer to merchand. When I help someone. If they appreciate it, I expect them to smile. If they don't, I'll say fuck them. Most ENTP I've encounter are so afraid of ENTJ analytique ability that they get even more frozen then usual so it's even more annoying. \n\nYou also asked : how to dodge them or deal with them.\nSimple : Show them you're stupid. ENTJ gets bored REALLY REALLY FAST.\n\nIf you let it unknow, they'll eventually think : fuck them.\nIf you show them you're intelligent, they'll be atrackted.\n\nBe carefull if you want to do a conflit with an ENTJ. You will lose.\nAnd it won't be because you'll be wrong or right. It won't be because they will scream or w/e.\n\nENTJ have a natural talent at playing with mind. There's a reason why we always win. Think of it as a hunting game where the prey is your opponent weakness. 
11	ENTJ's emotions: RAGE	Hi, i didn't post for a while in this sub. In the last week i saw a lot of posts regarding emotions, so i decided to create this daily series where everywhere describe their relationship with certain emotion. The first i want to talk about is rage, because is the "state" where i get to start over my life again.\nRage for me is a necessary emotion, without it i'd will be far less motivated. I've learned with time to direct the rush of adrenaline that rage provokes in me into positive energy that helps me get up after a huge letdown. I'm curious if this is a general feeling for ENTJs. 
11	Rage is something I'm all too familiar with. I think it's the strongest and earliest emotion I remember really feeling, and so naturally as a kid I wasn't always the best at directing it positively. Luckily I recognized its intensity and the necessity to keep it contained. I mostly directed the energy into exercise and helped mediate it a lot. I agree, directing it into a project can also serve as a sort of motivation boost. I think it can depend on the source of the initial rage though. 
7	I need to get mine out, from time to time. \nUsually loud music, live venue... Lots of booze. \n\nGoes with the deep-seated anger issues. \n\nFeels good. 
3	ENTJs have the best handle on RAGE )  \nevery emotion is cool, and valuable resource. we should learn to master the others   \nPS have really low blood pressure . 
3	Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage
2	I test somewhere between INTJ and ENTJ and I can relate to this. I'm afraid it's too general. Most people can probably relate to using rage as fuel for a new beginning / better attempt of some sort.
2	Ever since I've been young I've always felt rage in the background of whatever other emotion I've felt, I've always used it as fuel to keep going, especially considering my shitty life circumstances with shitty parents. 
2	I'm a bit of a ragetard sometimes I must admit. I definitely have a good control over it, but when I'm able to let it flow without causing anyone any harm, I definitely let it flow. It's funny though, I just got a new job 2 months ago, and it's a desk job, so I don't really experience any rage inducing moments. However, I used to work in food service for my entire working career, and obviously many rage inducing things happened. When I left the food service, I was excited to think that I wouldn't have to deal with it, but I honestly miss it. It's like I have an innate craving for bullshit. Rage to me is passion, and I have absolutely no passion at this boring ass new job. You know the, "can't handle the heat, stay out of the kitchen?" Well I'm missing the heat, and I'm going back to the kitchen lol. Quitting this new job soon and going back to my restaurant life. Let the rage commence!
2	Oh my god yes. Everyone thinks I'm super nice and happy all the time but when someone pisses me off I get ***really*** pissed off. I think ENTJs are especially good at turning rage into something productive. 
5	When i was a teenager i had alot of rage. So much that i got blackout angry multiple times. I am 2m 100+kg and pretty strong, so when one night me and my parents got into a fight i snapped. Alot of fighting, broke my dads collarbone, mother and sisters crying and trying to call the cops. I smashed all their phones and they locked themselves into their rooms scared for their life.i was beating like a maniac on their doors, trying to break them off their hinges. Fast forward to the next day, i have trouble remembering anything from that night.  Now as i am older i can't let the rage get to me. Since then I've forced myself to keep all the rage i get, chained up inside me. If i ever let any of it out im scared it will be too much and i will let it all out at once. Screaming, crying, breaking everything around me and hurting the ones i love. That risk is unacceptable for me and i just keep chaining it up. One day i hope it will be released in a safe environment :) 
1	Do you suffer from high blood pressure? Rage doesn't seem to me a motivational state of mind. 
1	> I've learned with time to direct the rush of adrenaline that rage provokes in me into positive energy that helps me get up after a huge letdown.\n\nPrecisely. It seals the holes in me, clots over my cuts. It's there when I need it, and if it's a little caustic when I don't need it that's an acceptable price to pay.
1	Rage is the door to my other negative emotions. 
1	I'm usually cool and levelheaded. I don't get angry often. But when I work out, sometimes I'm able to "summon" the rage, and push harder and harder. But in a day to day life, I find anger to be at bay because I love my job and the people around me. 
1	I always feel like that rage is my main drive in life. Without it I feel like I’m lacking the energy. When I’m enrage, feel like there’s an intense pressure over my head and chest. For me it’s accelerating because It makes me want to break free from it. And suddenly the only thing I could think of is how get back to the person or anything that causes my rage.  The most efficient way to hurt them overflowed my head. But as I grew older I know it’s not ok to hurt someone with your words or behaviour because it’s more likely that you gonna regret it later. Either because you love them and it’ will ruin your relationship or it’s gonna fire back and make you looks like a jerk, even worse put you in deeper trouble. \nSo I learned to be more tactful, although it’s still not tactful enough for some people.\nBut I  still feel rage or just anger could take me far in term of achieving my goals when I can harness it well.
8	As an ENTJ, how do you feel about meditation?	
21	Possibly an unpopular opinion here, but I think it is very worth it. There are practical and well researched benefits to meditation, including an increase in focusing ability and aiding in deeper sleep. Now being an ENTJ I don't believe in the spiritual side at all. But breathing slowly and clearing your head can help you take a step back and solve problems effectively.
10	I tried to do it, but every time I did I fell asleep. Other than that, I could never calm down enough.
7	It may sound odd but I actually find it most meditative to do some kind of chore/domestic task. Like if I'm making the bed or doing ironing, I just kind of slip into that state and feel a lot calmer and more grounded afterwards
2	I can't seem to get my mind to slow down and actually concentrate for it. My girlfriend swears by it, but it just doesn't click for me. 
2	i do it default, mindfulness, cold showers , everything is meditation, just have to develop your awareness 
2	Not useful for me. 
2	unpopular opinion here but im an entj with belief lol, probably due to upbringing background intertwined with eastern culture and esoteric studies for leisure. my intuition were quite powerful when i was a child so i have experienced some unexplained events that affected my perspective of the world. back to the topic, yes i try to meditate more and i find Tide, a meditation mobile app quite beautiful and effective. i still feel restless and a bunch of intense emotions every times im out of controls tho.. long road ahead
2	i think it's quite worth it, i've tried it during a turbulent part of my life, it helped, not as much as i liked it to, but that was not because of any possible flaw in the technique, the flaw was in me.i do love the way it allows me to further detach myself from life, and gets a better, clearer view on things.
1	I tried a few times. I either fall asleep, or I can’t shut my mind off and just lay there. 
1	I do something that is probably a local variation of meditation and it helps. What I usually use to increase my mental power is to actually cut off all stimulation for a while without sleeping. No light no sound no phone nothing. Close your eyes and for about half an hour. Cease compulsive thoughts and let long supressed revelations pour in.  
1	I meditate by creating paintings and other Visual Arts. I also have the luxury of an audience of 800000 + people to validate my art.
1	I meditate every morning for 15-20 minutes immediately after waking up. My competitiveness after meditation in the am tends to be less aggressive and more towards myself - which takes me much farther in life. 
1	I feel meditation is useful so I push myself to meditate.\n\nOften I feel it wouldn't be the most optimal use for my time. But once I'm actually meditating, I like it, it helps me to focus on the real things in life.
-2	I don't feel; I think.
4	Entjs and an affinity for addictions?	The textbook entj aims high and takes upon him/herself a great amount of responsibilty(and stress). Addiction is a way to deal with this stress. However one thing entj addicts have in common: they keep their functionality. It would bee even fair to say that they are using the addiction for the sake of their functionality. \n\nTalking for myself, I had a very long lasting addiction myself which I sometimes let it take control of my life. I tried to execute it many times but then eventually I learnt to coexist with it. It seems to take control of me when I lose confidance in myself or wallow in self pity. It is there when I have to deal with a bunch of feelings I am not used to deal with or when I let down my superiors and friends with my underperforming.\n\nHow are your experiences with addictions? Please do tell.
8	I’m 21, I try to steer clear of addictions. Soon as I feel myself wanting something more and more I tone it back whilst I still have that control. I know in my heart that once an addiction gets going It’ll take over. \n\nI can see where you’re coming from and I’m trying my best to avoid it. 
5	I'm not very addictive. I'll binge drink, but then I'll go weeks without drinking. When I'm depressed I play tons of video games but when I'm not I don't.
3	I'm too much of a control freak to be an addict. And a bit frugal. \n\nI even tried once. By the 3rd day I forgot... 
1	No addictions. I went through a binge drinking phase a little in college, but nothing stuck.
1	I latch onto stuff really quickly, so I'm very addictive prone. Use this to your own good 
1	I too have an addiction prone personality and have always avoided drugs and alcahol. However I do socially drink but never keep any at home. Whereas with video games or personally hobbies, I was an addict losing days at a time or staying up all night which hurt my work performance. \n\nWhat I did was not so much suppress the addiction but replace it with a positive outlet, such as learning a new skill or investing in myself. Instead of spending 100's of hours a week behind video games, I put that towards reading startup related books and learning to program apps, websites and games. I've also started being stricter with my diet and go 110% at the gym or in the pool. \n\nIt's all doable depending on what you set your mind to. We're goal orientated so make sure you set your addiction towards something that gets you closer to your goals. 
3	INTP vs ENTJ one on one talk	So I as an INTP, reached out to an ENTJ about how he communicated his way of telling someone to do something, of course the advice itself was true and straight forward, I simply told him that adding a tiny bit of motivation into his way of saying would be way more motivating and higher chance of successfully making him do what he is trying to tell this person. After some back and forth it turned into him writing that it was my opinion and he got his own opinion, fair enough. I ask him why he thinks the method is best, which he replys less preamble, less chance of misinterpretation. Hungry as I am to continue the conversation, I write if he would change his way of communicating depending on the person he talks to and at that point he wrote he do mind. I just let him have it as I saw no point going further with the conversation. My question is: Is this the way most ENTJ are when debating with somebody that try make them see another solution or to see a deeper understanding in a way that may open their minds?\n\nEdit: The conversation was in a specific scenario, where the person worked under his business and was an employ.\n\nTldr; Debated with a ENTJ, he got stubborn and is set on his "way", ended the conversation even tho it could go way further with some openness.
6	He's probably taking the "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" approach. He's more likely to change his behaviour by experiencing a "failure" in his approach.\n\nMaybe I am interpreting your exchange with this ENTJ incorrectly, but had this communication occurred after an instance where his strategy failed, then he would have been more open to your suggestion. Purely because he would be seeking to optimise his strategy.
4	He probably didn't see the point.\n\nSounds like you just asked a broad question on his behavior, and tried to make him change by theorizing about a better outcome. In general, ENTJs are image conscious people. We think about the way we present ourselves, and he likely deliberated on this for some time.\n\nThis is also not a scenario-specific question or anything that brings tangible results. In general, I don't get mad, just annoyed when I talk to NTP's and they talk about these hypothetical things that actually don't translate towards anything.\n\nDon't take it personally, but he probably just thought that was 'done'. There was nothing further (in the Te and Se world, at least) to discuss.
2	why do you assume it "could go WAY further" . you have no data. its a mere theory  
1	Never teach unless you are asked.
0	Why would an ENTJ continually date way below his/her league?	There’s this one guy I know in college with me who I respect and get along with but we’re not great friends. He confuses the heck out of me cause throughout the 5 years I’ve known him (plus 2 more years of evidence from the high school girlfriend who was all over his facebook at the beginning of college/end of high school) he has the strangest taste in girls. He’s really attractive, he knows what he wants, he has great charisma, and I know lots of really attractive and smart girls who have had crushes on him. The thing is though he won’t show show interest in these girls and then out of nowhere he’ll turn up dating some girl at least one year younger than him, someone without any confidence from an outsider’s perspective, no personality, low ambitions and goals, and I don’t mean to be shallow but there’re almost always out of shape and don’t put any time into their looks. It’s almost like he’s choosing them on purpose because of how many undesirable characteristics they embody. \nThis seems to be a real pattern with this guy and I want to know if anyone has any clue what could be going on with him regarding dating or how he sees himself or anything like that. For the most part everything I’ve read about ENTJs and from the ones I know in my life it seems characteristic that they like to go after worthy partners, ones that pose a challenge intellectually, who look after themselves and who are confident in what they do. So I’m so confused why he’s not doing better even though he easily could. \nAlso about him, besides this dating pattern he is just like the other ENTJs I know. 
18	Maybe he's looking for a girl with potential. Someone he can see becoming great, but needs a little help to get there.\n\nAlso, a lot of girls act mainstream. Their personalities are basic. Sometimes weird is nice! I personally found the weirdest people to be awesome friends. I know a guy who's 22 and watches my little pony. The funny thing is, he's a genius at engineering and remembers every detail of his childhood 
9	Perhaps the girls that you call "unattractive" or "below his league" are, in his opinion, more authentic, interesting, and real than most of the people that he's met. Most girls that my guy friends call hot bore the shit out of me.\n\nAnother way to see this is: Looks fade, but the intensity of the bond you can form with an interesting person does not. And maybe that's what these girls are offering him that f*ckgirls aren't.
3	All I can say is that hypogamy is much more common in men than in women, sorry I don't have anything insightful to add.
5	I'm thinking he doesn't want a woman he has to watch, as in, that other men will be after. \n\nA woman who see's him as the moon, and will never stray. \n\nHe may have some confidence issues. \n\nENTJ's dont want a challenging home life. They want a support system at home, generally. 
2	Needs to be needed.  It's not uncommon, my wife has this trait and she's had to work on it over the years so she's not burning the candle on both ends.
2	Maybe he’s looking for a girl with minimal sexual history? This was the first thing that came to mind when you were describing the traits or lack there of for his potential partners
2	OP, have you told your friend how you feel about him?
2	To echo other comments, perhaps he just has a different view of who he is attracted to. In my personal experience (I am an ENTJ) I go for people for reasons that are not necessarily explainable or clear to people on the outside. Likewise for people who like me but I have no feelings for (there is nothing wrong with them per se, but I just don’t feel it).\n\nEdit: a word
1	You're talking about quite a few girls within those 5 years, correct? It makes sense he wouldn't shoot for gf/marriage material if he's only looking for regular sex, not the love of his life.
0	Many men date women who remind them of their mothers. Maybe his mom was a low-maintenance type who dislikes exercise. 
1	Is it possible for your type to change?	(sorry i dont know how to cross post) \nI must be doing something wrong. I've taken the test so many times. I used to get ISTJ all of the time, and then I became depressed and just wasn't the same. Then I tested as INTJ all of the time which was strange because I don't question authority and I love a party. Now after therapy, medication, assertiveness training, and learning not to care what people think (which had caused the depression), I keep coming out as ENTJ which I heard is totally different from INTJ. The only consistent thing is that my introversion/extroversion are always near 50/50. The last time it was extroversion 51%. When I read about ENTJs during childhood though, that sounded dead-on like me. What am I doing wrong? Can your MBTI type change after major life changes? Or was I just wrong from the start? lol 
5	Look at the functions and get familiar with them. \n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungian_cognitive_functions\n\nFigure out which ones you use and go according to that. \n\nI tested as intj for a long time but then got infp  for a while then infj haha. So knowing the functions is more important the test imo. 
2	Sounds like you're pretty consistently testing as types that are strong in Te, so you can be pretty comfortable about being Te/Fi. I think you should read up on the functions to figure out if you're Se/Ni or Ni/Se, and then all you have to do is figure out the order of the functions.\n\nINTJ and ENTJ are pretty similar types, actually. I think a lot of ENTJs test as INTJs when they're depressed.
2	>I tested as INTJ all of the time which was strange because I don't question authority and I love a party\n\nWe can safely disregard that then. Off-topic but it's refreshing that you are aware and honest about not questioning authority. Even the most sheep-like people tend to think of themselves as #woke rebels nowadays.   \n\n>I keep coming out as ENTJ which I heard is totally different from INTJ\n\nNo, it isn't. Hence, I don't think you're ENTJ.
1	yes. we all mutate, as our DNA mutates ..
1	And sorry guys, if some of these questions seem dumb, I think I overstudied it and overtested myself to the point of being confused, but at least there is some consistency I guess 
1	Hmm never used typeinmind \n\nCheck this one out. \nhttp://www.cognitiveprocesses.com/16Types/ENTJ.cfm\n\nBut in the end what I've realized is that the personality is just a mask. An illusion that we create. So I like to look at typology as a way to see past the personality and see the deeper motives behind a persons behavior. 
1	I was similar. Most of my adult life I tested as an ENTJ, but for a brief moment during Business school, I tested as an ENFJ. I was quite surprised. \n\nIn terms of relationships I'm clearly an ENTJ, I have a bad reputation of cutting my losses and ending relationships too soon. Yet some aspects of the ENFJ personality traits do fit me and it could be because I have a bit of an overlap or may fall on a cusp between F and T. 
9	Hello! It is me again, THAT entp!! A while ago I took a survey with all the MBTI types to create an article about how they would want to be asked out. Life got in the way, and I didn't finish it until today. Tell me what ya'll think!	https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sIyFAUKxzQSQZVNP87aGEJkuEqpmYHP0sUvYvocxJ5w/edit?usp=sharing
24	>The ENTJs were least responsive of the Rationalists, only giving about 3 direct answers, and 29 comments in total. Granted, some of these comments just insulted how I worded my intro and question. To introduce my question to the group, I inadvertently did a very ENTP thing by saying, “Hello Motherfuckers! It is I, an ENTP!” It’s a reoccurring joke that ENTPs and ENTJs don’t get along, and this was showcased to me by someone telling me to, “Try a mature title next time maybe.” To which I responded, “would you like me to help you get that pole out of your ass?” Journalistic integrity be damned. Aside from the insults to my character, many responses incited that they (ENTJs) would rather be the askers than the asked. While that doesn’t help much in this article’s case, from what I know of the ENTJs I would have to say that if you really wanted to ask one out, follow the INTPs’ advice and just ask directly.  \n\nHow do you want anybody to take you seriously after this?  \nENTP or not, you definitely lack the maturity (and methodology) to perform surveys.
11	I think you were off base with a lot of your assumptions. Your article also seemed roughly written, and I hope you polish it up before you push it out.
5	I'm happy that you feel like you finished something. I'm really not sure what you feel like you've contributed to our discourse, though.
1	I would like to say that when I "finished it" I mean I found it and added the last line. 
1	Wait was that supposed to be about how we want to be asked out or how we are rude? 
6	Let's talk about feelings.	Since our Fi is the weakest, I was wondering when us ENTJs decided to develop our Fi? We're pretty big on personal development/improvement so it must have crossed out mind at some point, right?\n\nFor me, it was after my first LTR break-up about 6 months ago. I had a really hard time post break-up, and was in the most pain I've ever felt in my life. \n\nWhen I looked around for support, I had none.\n\nThat was devastating. I realized I've been neglecting my relationships, haven't built meaningful ones, and been focusing on my school/career plan at the expense of caring for friends. Then all the little immoral things I've done so far bubbled up, plus childhood issues, past traumas, family problems... all at once. It wasn't fun.\n\nThen I picked myself up, put my pride aside for a moment and asked for help. After I was able to stand on my own again, I went to therapy, started making plans with people, reached out, cared for others, apologized for past behaviors that might have hurt people, and tried to be more emotionally open. At first, I was desperately trying to make connections so I was (really) sloppy. Like, too much at once, too little at times, sloppy lol. But just the fact that I started to care about my Fi... that was enough for people around me to notice and say that I seemed to be changing for the better. And when I started openly "talking" about my feelings, I realized a lot of people feel similar stuff and that made me feel like... I don't know, connected? life was suddenly fuller? Ok, this is getting a bit too mushy lol.\n\nI think the main positive of developing my Fi was that I felt I can relax and be vulnerable without feeling tense. I feel blessed to feel this comfortable.\n\nSo do you guys have any experiences that made you face your Fi?
3	I am going through this exact situation right now. Trying to deal rationally with some domestic abuse I faced and realized I had already cut off everybody who could have helped me because they weren't helpful for my goals at the time. Reaching back out has been slightly awkward but I am getting help at last. People keep describing me as "chatty" in a negative way (aheh) but I think it's just because I've had nothing to say for so long that now I do it's difficult to stop.
2	I developed severe depression when I was 7. I started therapy at a young age, but around 15 it started to take hold. The biggest thing is that I found a therapist I clicked with and she helped a LOT. The other thing is self awareness.\n\n\nI was discouraged from showing emotions by my dad, but also being emotionless was a problem. There was no gray area; I had to be one or the other and neither was right. I had a lot of displaced anger, severe mental health issues, an abusive parent, and 0 guidance. So obviously, I reacted intensely to any and all perceived threats. \n\n\nI've been realizing lately that I AM a very cold, logical, detached person. It's something I've known but really, REALLY hate about myself. I didn't want to admit I wasn't an ENFP, because I'd been discouraged from being a "cold" person. \n\n\nI never really felt guilt when I was younger, which is fairly normal for children. They often aren't aware of how their actions effect others, or that other people have thoughts independent of their own. I was in that place, but also I was waaay too depressed to really deal with other people. Now all that guilt is weighing down on me.\n\n\nI'm not really in a GREAT place, but I do feel a lot. I know what other people are feeling intuitively and easily, but I'm also very easily able to detach myself from that. I'm definitely very empathetic but also way more logical and too harsh for my INFP friend. I want to protect emotions, but I see more value in helping people grow than coddling them. The way I see it, I don't mind someone being mad at me briefly for calling out the faults that are harming them, when I know in the long run I'm right and it'll help them to know.\n\n\nI also know what I'M thinking and feeling and why. I had to develop other skills and reactions to situations, and I like helping people (to the point of it hurting me), but I can also easily disconnect, say no, etc. I hate talking but my emotions, but know it'd harm me more not to. I also know that talking about them would help foster a culture of openness, and that would help people who went through the same things I did.\n\n\nI might be a lot kinder and more open now, but at the same time, that comes from a lot of logical conclusions. I'm not very good at being vulnerable, but I know it's a necessity. I've had to change a lot of my, I guess, instinctive reactions to things because I *know* it's better for me in the long run. I'd say my Fi and Ni are probably what I've been using most, since I couldn't really use my Te because of my ~life situation~. \n\n\nI realized that emotions are messy and illogical and I *hate* feeling vulnerable, but that I can't move ahead unless I talk them out. And also, it's easier to get things done swiftly if you're kind and empathetic than if you're an asshole. \n\n\nIt's strange to look back at myself as a kid and see how horrible I was lmao. 
1	Am gonna cry
1	I just wanna chime in a little. Since you guys really find emotions distasteful, lets call it filth. To be a very productive person is to be a healthy person, physically, mentally and emotionally. When negative emotions pile up, they are filth. You have to clean it up so that emotions do not get clogged up and mess you up.\n\nAs for how you're going to clean it up, there are many ways worth researching. I find having brotherly/sisterly, "what happens in the room stays in the room", heart to heart talk very effective. The point is to be vulnerable and pour out all the filth. It is uncomfortable for everyone but it is LIBERATING. Some may choose to keep a journal as well.\n\n\n
1	In any discussion about developing Fi, the focus needs to be on a specific individual's age and life experiences. I really believe this is an area where MBTI and its inevitable stigmas can do more harm than good, especially for ENTJs. It may be gratifying (and accurate) to hear that you're a ruthlessly efficient machine who conquers all, but that can come at a price, of which the currency is Fi.\n\nSpeaking personally, my early formative years were not conducive to any healthy Fi development in the long-term. I got attention from Mom when I outperformed my peers, protected her from Dad, or perpetuated lies to appease Dad. I got no attention from Dad aside from being a human bargaining chip in lieu of banging down doors. It becomes difficult to come to grips with who you are when you're raised in such a hot-and-cold manner.\n\nI'm also in my mid-twenties, and my funeral:marriage ratio is a juicy 14:1 (very soon to be 16). Two of those were grandparents, who served as my "actual" parents in many ways, one of which I had to personally DNR. I think anyone who has experienced the loss of someone extremely close would say it deeply changes your valuation of life and time. Doing it 14+ times really starts tearing you up at the seams. \n\nFor what it's worth, most of those close family losses took place during the span of a ~4+ year LTR, which involved serial cheating and other emotional scarring. Genuinely loving the other person made it *really* difficult to recognize how far my behavior was deviating from who I am. So for me, on one hand I will be the absolute first to be irritated when emotion trumps rationality, and I almost never prioritize the former over the latter. On the other hand, MBTI simply cannot account for life experiences which force you to develop a certain way more than, or earlier than you normally would. My tolerance for Fi has definitely increased over time.
1	Let's not. 
5	Until a few days ago I was certain I was an ENTJ. Now I dont know	The P vs J for me is tiny. Sometimes I am 2%J and others I am barley P.\n\nI have certain ENTJ traits but never really fit into the whole commander stereotype (while I do have good leadership ability). Nor am I the most efficient and organized person. None of my friends are super familiar with MBTI types, but when I read off ENTJ weaknesses they would not agree that it was me.\n\nI dont know where I am going with this but just started writing. Perhaps that shows I am an ENTP after all. Focus is not one of my strengths.\n\nI am fine being an ENTP. They seem to have a much better view than ENTJ's. However, I always liked that ENTJ's seemed to be the type that was easy to shit on and people would type "bad" people as ENTJ's (Voldemort, Magneto, Stalin,Frank Underwood, Dennis Reylonds, ect). So part of me liked that my type was not one that people flocked to and I liked being un liked.\n\nI have read through the functions several times and have been familiar with them for months now. I can fit both of them pretty easily. I have both Ne and Te aspects. When it comes to Ne my friends have refereed to me as adventurous and I have a very curious eye when it comes to most things. I like the Te aspects of doing what is effective but dont have some of the ruthlessness associated with it(a little blunt though). Same goes for Ni/Ti. This is where we get different. I would say that I am far more Se than I am Fe, and I am correlate more with the inferior aspects of Fi than Si, but I do have a little bit of a fuck the system attitude.\n\nPeople who know me would definitely say I am more of a devils advocate than a commander if I asked them. And I guess the mess that is this post leans ENTP.\n\nI realize that I put way too much of my identity in my type. Does that say I lean ENTJ with Fi. \n\nWhen it comes down to the cognitive functions I side more with Ne than I do Te, Ti more than Ni. However, I am more Se than Fe and more inferior Fi than Si. So basically a Ne, Ti, Se, Fi\n\nI dont know man/woman/non binary
8	The functions you thus far seem to identify with are at odds with each other. Where have you gone to read about the functions? Some sites are good, others are much better.\n\nIf you care to go into more detail than I assume you have, I recommend Juan Sandoval's book, [*Cognitive Type*](http://cognitivetype.com/book-details/), or Michael Pierce's [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmDcT_Pujk8vOcxk_IcnxtQ) (if you can handle is softspeakedness). They are both heavy in terms of academically explaining things, but their level of precision may be what you need.\n\nAge is also a consideration. Just after learning Myers Briggs -- but before I learned about the cognitive functions -- I didn't feel I fit most descriptions of the ENTJ. The "typical" ENTJ, as described, for example, by [Personality Page](http://www.personalitypage.com/ENTJ.html), doesn't seem to fit me as much as their description of [ENTP](http://www.personalitypage.com/html/ENTP.html). So, by description, things can get confusing. But when you understand the functions at deep enough level, appearance matters less, and how the functions manifest themselves become more clear.\n\nBecause of this, I find now that material which does not deal with the cognitive functions themselves tend to describe the 16 types more on their behavior and stereotypes on average, rather than on the mechanics of perception and execution. The latter is much more useful, and will likely be less confusing to you given you absorb the material.\n\n[Here's a page](http://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2015/12/how-each-cognitive-function-manifests-based-on-its-position-in-your-stacking/) I find 90% on point that has been helpful to me, my friends, and my family.\n\nI hope this helps you get on the road to better understanding your cognitive stack.\n\nEDIT: grammar
10	Develop your Se to get along with others	I just wanted to share my experience to my fellow ENTJs who have a hard time on interpersonal development.\n\nAs an ENTJ personality, most of the time when we interact with others, we tend to use our under-developed Fi or a mimicked version of Fe. Both of which makes us look insincere on the surface and appear awkward.\n\nHowever, I learned that people tend to relate better when I use my Se - living in the moment. This is why ESTP's easily create rapport with people. People like to feel emotionally safe with people who aren't so intense. Who feel that whatever happens, everything is going to be okay.\n\nHeavy Te users heavily dislike this because Se tend to be prone to unpredictable mistakes and chaos. However, when Se used properly in a social setting, it can be a powerful tool to influence people.\n\nHere's an example:\n\nTe-Ni way of talking:\n"Hi galacticexplorer, what's the status of our monthly report? I need it for a meeting next week."\n\nSe way of talking:\n"Hey man! How are you? Listen, I know you're busy but do you think we can get our monthly report for a meeting next week? Thanks a bunch!"\n\nThe former is very rigid and commanding. Focuses on the bottom line and doesn't take consideration of person you're taking to into the sentence. While the latter is more perceptive and empathic.\n\nNow some of us might argue that the latter might create an impression that we aren't professional or that people might take advantage of us being nice.\n\nThis where Ni comes in.\n\nOn the surface you want to be relatable (Se), but at the back of your mind, you've already calculated the multiple responses of people and have already put contingency plans in place (Ni). E.g. Act like a harmless animal but think like a snake.\n\nIt's very important to be perceptive of how people see you. And most ENTJs  are already seen as smart, competent and hardworking. But if people see that they can actually relate and reach out to you, you tend to be more charismatic while you still being on guard of people with motives.
5	Just saying, but this has a serious cultural component to it as well. I am northern European, and all I could think of when reading your Se quote is: oh look, another insincere and fake stereotypical American. (Regardless of whether you are American or not.)\n\nThat's definitely not the thing you want to go for when establishing rapport. \n\nIf any americans are wondering why it sounds fake: in northern European cultures you don't go about asking everybody you meet how they are doing. If you do so, you better be prepared to hear an honest answer as the question actually serves a purpose. Your close colleague might very well answer 'im doing shit right now because my wife served me with divorce papers this weekend' and you ahould be willing to deal with that and offer support because you asked a question which implied willingness to actually hear the answer, or your meeting partners will tell you they had a busy and stressful day, implying that they would appreciate it if the meeting can go as quick and smoothly as possible without unnecessary bullshit. The typical American 'how are you' is in that sense not a sincere how are you, which will make you look fake and that shit is not appreciated in this cultural setting. 
2	"Act like a harmless animal but think like a snake"\n\nIf I ever make this into a t-shirt I promise you some royalties. 
1	Oh\n\nSomeone put this into words\n\nEdit: sometimes I actually hate doing this because I come off as stupid lmao but I still do it
1	I agree completely, Se is our social lubricant. It makes us more likable, establishes lines of communication and trust. It’s something I’ve always intuited about myself, but I was not surprised to learn it’s only our 3rd function when I finally took the test as an adult. I always knew I was reaching inward and tapping into something that was a useful part of me, but wasn’t predominantly me. It made me more fun to be around, took the edge off my intensity, disguised my nerdiness. \n\nIn the wild when I’m with friends, you might mistake me for an ESTP. I have an ESFJ father, my oldest brother is ESFP, best friend is ESTP. Very fun and funny people all. Energetic, animated, can make you laugh until you have tears in your eyes. So I did a lot of improvising growing up, used soo much Se. I always loved making people laugh, still do. People in school saw me as funny and charismatic, but also as a serious, engaged student. My ESTP best friend was the class clown. \n\nI’m Irish, so I agree with others who say there’s a cultural component here. There may also be a genetic component, my family is very musically and kinesthetically inclined. Both parents sing and play guitar, mother played drums, father was a dancer and a boxer in his day. My oldest brothers (ESFP + ISTP) are incredible dancers, born a year apart (Irish twins), got into too many fights as children. I’m the best singer in the family, and I play the most instruments. I was a fighter too, but only when I witnessed injustice. Basically I think we are natural performers, so I have been in touch with sensing my entire life. 
0	A Biochemistry Theory of the Soulmates Phenomenon	Soulmates: what do you think of when you hear the concept? Is it someone we are destined to be with? Someone we love? Someone we're supposed to be with? Someone we have a deep connection with that extends beyond time and space? \n\nMost of us rational people think soulmates is something akin to fantasy: something imagined, not real, something out of touch with reality. But what if the concept of the SOULMATE had a biochemical basis for the way we feel? What if soulmates actually do exist?\n\nThe truth is, most of us don't want to believe in the imaginary. We believe it to be unreal. We don't want to be disappointed. Truth is cruel, it's harsh, it's THE TRUTH. We settle for best friends, someone we are compatible with on a similar social level, someone our parents or friends approve of, but what about that SOULMATE connection?\n\nAnd what if the concept of soulmates had a BIOCHEMICAL basis?\n\nWhen we fall in love, we have to be in the right place and the right time. We have to be OPEN to falling in love. We can't be closed, we can't be unwilling, we can't be on the rebound, we have to be OPEN to falling in love. At a particular stage in our lives, we have to be at a particular junction in our lives to fall in love.\n\nAnd let's say we fall in love, or in general, people fall in love, a connection occurs that has to be more than mental, more than verbal, more than psychological, more than emotional, it also has to be physical. When everything else lines up (the emotional, the psychological, the intellectual et al) **the physical body becomes the conduit for the SOULMATE phenomenon.** Sex becomes the ultimate expression of the SOULMATE phenomenon. \n\nThrough sex, our bodies produce viral DNA. We produce viral DNA all the time in reaction to the environment. (NOTE: this is contrary to the current theory of viruses as a disease, but in fact, viruses are manufactured by us all the time). When we fall in love with someone and all the conditions are right, we produce viral DNA which becomes integrated into a part of the OTHER's DNA. **We become each other**\n\nThat is why so many couples, after years together start to look alike. They have infected each other's DNA with each other. They are flowing through each other's veins, bloodstreams, DNA, they are ONE.  On a biochemical level, this is what happens when we fall in love. We start to become and turn into each other. (Note: I don't want to go through all the scientific chemical reactions here because it would take a 150 pp thesis to do so and most of you wouldn't understand the scientific lexicon anyway ;) )\n\nTherefore, the soulmate phenomenon has to occur because 1) it's the absolute right timing 2) there is an intellectual, emotional, psychological bond 3) and it is consummated by a physical bond - **sex that leads to infection of each other's viral DNA.**\n\n**After several years or decades together, the couples start to turn into each other- they become each other. They start to look alike, act alike, because they are infected with each other's nascent viral DNA.**\n\n__________________________\n\nEXAMPLE: The next part is **completely** speculative but think of couples who start to look alike and act alike.  If we were to assess them in terms of speaking style, physical appearance etc, they would appear to be quite similar to each other, but what if they had virally infected each other with their own viral DNA akin to the soulmate phenomenon?\n\n__________________________\n\nWhat do you guys think? Have you experienced the soulmate phenomenon in yourself or others?

1	Are you saying that ScarJo and Obama banged?
1	It's called pair-bonding, "souls" have nothing to do with it for sure. I don't think it involves DNA being exchanged both ways but there is some support for male DNA being implanted in women via sperm. This might be why women are only able to pair-bond a few times whereas men's partner count has no effect on the durability of marriages.\n\nSource regarding marriages affected by women's partner count: http://i.imgur.com/DnMjpl3.jpg
1	Hid my birthdate on FB so no one would be notified and I got sad	Title\n\nBut I don't know why really. Like, I find the celebration of a birth date to be arbitrary or really not matter. I don't/rarely wish anyone else a happy birthday on Facebook or real life anyway so I just decided to remove it because I didn't really want to partake in the social cue on an internet platform\n\nBut it did make me sad. I think I like the idea of the social norm and really it's harmless. But I still like the decision I made to remove birthday notifications on Facebook anyway - but I still got sad\n\nCould someone else try to put this in to words/over analyze my decision?\n\nEdit: OMG YA'LL I'm not pissed about not getting enough birthday wishes --> "I find the celebration of a birth date to be arbitrary or really not matter."\n\nEdit2: More thoughts on the matter, I wish this social norm didn't exist at all now since the perception of me wanting to rescind my birthday must conclude that I'm mad I don't get enough birthday wishes lmao\n\nEdit3: It's too late now but I forgot an important detail - this was done **pre-birthday** not **post-birthday**
8	You're too attached to social media.  You were expecting a high from birthday wishes via the notification on some app.  You need to distance yourself from that.  It seems you've started testing the waters. Start with doing some reading on all the research showing the negative effects of social media.
2	I don't really care about my birthday, but I like the thought that people care enough to WISH me happy birthday? Presents are usually pretty useless unless they're cold hard cash or something else that I'll deffo use, but at the same time it kinda hurts when people you're really close to DON'T get you something. \n\n\nI don't care much about birthdays or holidays, but other people do. What I care about is the the people I'm close to. Sure, it might mean nothing to me, but it means something to THEM. So I celebrate for them, but also expect them to celebrate for me. It might mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but feeling like people don't care about you sucks. I'm not close to any of my family and generally do not give a single shit what they think, but for some reason, it still hurts when they don't wish me happy birthday because of the sheer fact it's important to THEM. (Or I'm assuming it is, even though I know that most of my family probably feels the same as me. Hm.)\n\n\nSo maybe it's just that yeah, YOU don't care but other people do and the fact that they just glossed over your bday or didn't remember it is a slight. Your feelings on birthdays don't matter so much as the fact that for most people it's very important, meaning they should still tell you happy birthday/holidays even if they know you don't care. (And that makes it even more meaningful, if you think about it. You don't care but they still go out of their way to tell you. How sweeeet.)
1	You chase authentic feelings and didn't receive as much as you would had like.  \nOr, you saw what lies beyond our society of social media, and indeed it's very sad.  \n\nProbably a bit of both.\n\nI did the same a few times, the first time I had only a very close friends and family to wish my birthday. I felt bad because some close friends that just never got to learn the date couldn't wish me.  \nThen I got by, and decided that my birthday was something intimate that I now only want to celebrate with my family.
1	Delete your social media. At the least delete it off of your phone. You’ll be happier. 
7	Public speaking	I'm taking a speech class in college this semester. I am not looking forward to it. In the very small amount of public speaking that I've done previously, I have done pretty poorly- or at least felt like I did poorly, as I was a bit shakey.\n\nI'm wondering how other ENTJs feel about speaking in front of a class or just public speaking in general. Did you struggle with it and figure out how to do better? Has it always come naturally?
12	I feel comfortable speaking to large groups.  I dont memorize, i just use bullet points so i dont forget to nail all my points.  
11	I actually love public speaking, and it's one of my strengths. My best advice is try to remember that you're just talking to other humans. Yeah, they're gonna judge you, but everyone always judges everyone. And being prepared is extremely important. The closer you can get to reciting your speech word for word without stuttering, the better. Have confidence (I've taken a shot or two before speeches before lol), and just talk. Use your own words and be yourself. If you aren't a funny person, don't crack jokes throughout. People are going to listen to someone who speaks in their own voice rather than a robot who reads from a slideshow, or a weirdo that tries to crack cringy jokes. Overall, be yourself, and don't overthink it. You got this! 
6	The more you do I️t the easier I️t gets 
6	Can't say I love it but I am comfortable doing it and always have been praised when it happened. The more I know what I am talking about and the better I feel. If I master the topic, then it's even fun.
3	I enjoy it! I was fortunate to have a really good public speaking professor in college, though. I think you should see this as an opportunity, because like anything else you can only improve on it with practice, and public speaking is something where the opportunities to practice are sadly limited.
3	I love it and do it professionally.  I genuinely enjoy connecting with people and don’t care about being judged.  I appreciate the massive impact being a good, authentic public speaker can have on people’s lives.  It’s worth the work to get there.
2	Toastmasters. 
2	my best simple tip for public speaking is don't use the words "like" and "um" ever. It's subtle yet makes a tremendous difference. I've completely cut those words from my vocabulary and its helped me develop other, more creative and impactful placeholder words to my discussions and speeches. Also take a genuine interest in your audience. Smile like you're dog would when you come home. People take interest in you when you show interest in them. Godspeed to you, amigo. 
1	I have a ton of experience with it, and if you're trying to get better then I would suggest practicing with topics where you don't need any notes. Just try to let it flow very naturally, and then build from there. I think you'll find that after the first minute or so, you'll relax considerably. The biggest problem I had (and still have to a lesser extent) was forcing myself to say something when I truly believed it was better to listen, or let others speak. But as others have said, immersing yourself in it will only help you. 
1	I enjoy it a lot, I run a corporate Toastmasters club at the company I work for. It’s not easy to be put on the spot, but once you get past the initial nerves there’s little else as exhilarating.
0	hey baby, do you like Rick and Morty?	Cuz i'm gonna R&M your asshole ( ͡°⊖ ͡°)
9	No.
3	cute (˵ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°˵)\n

-8	No, anyone who watches R&M clearly hasn't grown out of their diapers yet. 
17	Are ENTJ doomed to loneliness?	It's one in the mourning, It might be a bit gibberish, but I'll try to make it as clear as possible.\n\nI feel like I realize stuff the people around me simply don't see. \nI don't know much people who like to talk about all sorts of thing, I've got a couple of really close friend, but for them, I seem to be more like a sociopath than an actual human being. I have yet to encounter someone I would call my best friend... (the main reason why I wanted a girlfriend in the past was simply to talk, but I've never encountered a person like me)\n\nThey are telling me that I'm too rational. I used to believe it was a good thing, but the more I age (I'm 21 now), the more I realize that being rational in our world mean to be alone in your own mind. \n\nI like to debate about anything, try to push our own tought to the limits, but I haven't encounter a contestant for my mind for like 6 years (when I was still young and stupid, which I still am, but I suppose less stupid then I used to be). \n\nThe only place I find people that are thinking like me are on the internet, like in this forum, sometime I see talk at Ted X or on a random youtube channel about a debate of any kind and I feel like I could be there, talking to these people. But I'm here, at the other side of the screen. I can't seems to encounter such people IRL.\n\nI'm not like super sad about it, I have an ok everyday life, I've got many project going on, but Whenever I try to like just go on a subject and think, but people get completly disconnected. It's quite sad. \n\nStatistically talking, ENTJ are like less then 5% of the populations, so we should encounter a bunch of them here and there right?, but it seems to off, cause part of what make ENTJ what they are is that they strive to achieve stuff, so like, I don't want to stop doing project, but I feel like if all ENTJ are thinking like that, \nWe will just never encounter each other so we are kind of stuck into a cage of loneliness.\n\nI'm not sure if it's super clear, what are your tought on the matter? Even if it's not a direct conversation, I know I wouldn't find anyone to have such a conversation with else than this or like a psychologue, but like I'm not having a problem I just like to talk so I'm not going to pay someone to talk like that's stupid.\n\n\nAnyway, I'll stop rambling here, what are your toughs?
20	I've managed to find a group of NT's just by sheer luck and I'm happy when I'm around them. We've been friends for more than ten years.\n\nIt's been over a year and a half since my last romantic relationship. It was with an NT guy who happened to have sociopathic and narcissistic tendencies so I had to cut my loss and move on. Now I'm as lonely as a 250 year old turtle. 
10	Your issue is obviously not that you're too rational, because if you were rational, you would be able to identify and solve your issues a lot better. \n\nYou think people don't argue with you because they're not intellectual matches for you. Honestly, this is unlikely. They probably avoid arguing with you because you are so convinced of your own rationality and so enamored with debate and "limits-pushing" that you come off as a tactless boor--essentially it's more an issue than "won't" than "can't". Because even nice people with open minds will often disconnect when someone else starts rambling about something they only have a tangential interest in. \n\nAs for the Ted X thing...you do realize most Ted X people are not normally on the level that they're at during a presentation, right? The reason you don't encounter people like that in real life is because TED X PRESENTERS ACT LIKE NORMAL PEOPLE IN REAL LIFE, having conversations for the sake of socialization rather than just leaping from bullet point to bullet point. You've constructed this fantasy of this sort of person you think can relate to you, but your fantasy is just that.\n\nIt's been said that if you met one person today who was an asshole, they were an asshole. If everyone you met today was an asshole, you're the asshole. The same thing goes for rationality. If you think everyone around you is irrational you're probably the irrational one, because you've placed your own highly specific and fundamentally flawed ideal of "rationality" on an altar and you feel lonely because no one else wants to worship it alongside you. News flash: as long as you have such ridiculous standards for the "rationality" of others, you will always be lonely.
5	Debate and discussion is a performance art, an act.  \nThe time you spend backstage, in rehearsal, in solitude, is where you learn your craft.  \nIf you want to find someone that appreciates you in that way, then you will have to impress them in your performance.\n\nIf you feel unchallenged intellectually be others, than this is probably a symptom of misjudgment.  People don’t like to be out of the loop, they want to understand what is being said.\n\nAs NTs, especially ENTs, vocalizing our intellect it’s second nature.  Not everyone will respond will such vigor instantly, as they may process emotions and analyze other ways first.  \n\nNew media is deceptive in a way that we can navigate and consume at such tremendous capacities.  TEDtalks are great fuel for debate, thought provoking discussions.  But not everyone you meet has seen that one, remembered it and thought about it they way you do.  Don’t be a fool to think others are brain dead, just lead them if they want to be lead. \n\nENTJs are leaders, we can construct methods and organize, but our utility for the human race is how we apply them.  
6	I don't think you should jump to the conclusion that you will stay lonely, especially since you are only 21.\n\nTbh after graduating high school I was also struggling a bit regarding close friends, because it sort of turned out that in high school I was only friends with some people due to the need to socialize. While I had buddies at college, I did not have like a close friend group. However after a couple of years I met a girl through mutual friends, who would become my best friend and she still is.\n\nSo what I'm trying to say is be patient, you have your whole life ahead of you yet. Also you could try to get a bit more in touch with your emotions. You don't always have to act on them, because logic is still the best way to go, but it can help you come off less as a socipath (which I assume you are not).
11	ENTJs don't have friends, they have minions.\n\nJust get new minions and you won't even notice your old minions are gone.
2	Yes. Always lonely. 😔
2	No we are not doomed to loneliness. The perfect match for us probably are Intj’s and they’re the least social people; hardest to find. And if you get to meet one, first impression they have from you would be, being irritated by you. If you manage to keep them around just a little while, you’ll have the most intelligent, easy going, fun and understanding person in your life. \nI have an intj husband whom i met when i was 23 and we are married since then. (8 years) \nHe thinks a lot. Reads quite a lot. A LOT! And only talks if he is enthusiastic or necessity about the topic and if he sees the companion worthy and intelligent enough to start a conversation with. Also listens carefully. He even listens more than he talks. That is where they beat entjs as emphatetic humanbeings. I, for example, as an Entj, love to speak; tell people about what i’ve seen or learned or experienced lately and love to amaze everyone around me. (I’m pretty sure we were the storytellers and leaders during early ages and intj’s were, sadly for us, the puppetteers behind us.)\nI don’t feel serene enough to listen to anyone with predictable opinions and/or conflicts for longer than i am interested. And it’s definately not me to pat someone’s shoulder when they make something wrong and they obviously ask for a lie; not for the hard truth. These treats we commonly have, keep people away at a distance.\nExcept intj’s. They watch you socializing; wondering; speaking about anything. Although our brains work similarly, the outcome really differs. \nMy husband tells me that when i talk about anything i feel interested, my eyes shine, the jests and mimics are awe-inspiring. He says whenever i feel i lost the group’s attention, my face bitters unknowingly. If anything have to be told, i say it no matter how inappropriate the time and place is. I am an insane go-getter, debater and manipulater. No second thoughts or hesitations are an issue for any desire of mine. He loves all those opposite outcomes of the same thoughts he shares with me. And i love to be appreciated and understood thoroughly while being criticized honestly. Because as an entj, i don’t feel comfortable to be criticized by anyone unworthy and can be quite stubborn to win the arguement about how right i am against them. \n\nAs for a clearer image:\nA couple of months ago we were on a queue for a flight check-in. A group of noisy middle-aged group passengers (bottom stair white collar wannabe businessmen) were having trouble about issuing their tickets and kept all 4 counters to themselves. Just about a couple of minutes we were both completely silent, obviously disturbed by them. At the very same second i started yelling at one of them; my husband starting talking to another of them. He was talking some sense into them to let other passengers to be able to check in; i was continously explaining how incredibly rude they were to keep all counters for themselves and trying to exaggerate the situation to gain support from the people on queue with us. At the end, all went to one side, i was the one to check in first and the guy apologized to my husband. while all of them were looking at me with a notion of grudge, which made me feel better actually, i guess both of our behaviours succeeded. This is how much we think and react the same in such different ways.\n\nDON’T LOSE HOPE! 
2	Totally can relate. Our gift and burden is to see things in advance that others can't see.
1	I sometimes feel like this. I'll go super "logical" and think that people only hang out with me because of a certain reason (belonging to a same church or organization). Which might be true to a certain extent.\n\nI would recommend "How to win friends and influence people" by Dale Carnegie, it definitely helps you understand other people better, and can help build friendships. (and you get to understand why)
1	I agree that argumentation is fun, but give it time to chill. Not everyone likes to argue. We are strong minded and not everyone else is, but it isnt. appealing to people if you are so storng minded 24/7.
1	It sounds like you need to develop your Fi and Fe. You’ll struggle with relationships, feel isolated, and feel disconnected from other humans unless you develop those.\n\nTwo things I’d suggest: Compassion meditation and solar plexus meditation.\n\nYou’ll be surprised to find Fe and Fi are actually very powerful and very useful. Fi is a driving force. It empowers and fills with passion. It can also be romantic. Fe gives. It gives love, compassion, and comfort. Both are necessary for humans to connect and relate with one another. Otherwise, it’s like computets talking to computers.\n\nHere:\nhttps://m.wikihow.com/Practice-Compassion-Meditation\nWatch Elephant Man, Forest Gump, and/or The Green Mile.\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iMSILdW68zc\n\nScenes that reflect SP meditation are characters going Super Saiyan, Mob VS. Koyama, Saitama VS. the meteor, Gohan going SSJ2 against Cell, and Future Trunks going SS Rage.
1	I think ENTJ's are incredibly hard on themselves. Yet at the same time, we have a super large ego which needs to be put in check. Adversity was the hardest life lesson I had to overcome and it made me more humble and made me realise, "I have to stop thinking I'm better than everyone else". Everyone has their own journey to get through, judging people on being lesser or less deserving doesn't make us any better. \n\nSecondly, we are insanely hard to please and may be that's why relationships are so difficult for us. It's incredibly hard for us to be happy with who we're with, and not think "Can we do better". Yet at the same time we fluctuate between thinking are we too good or good enough. Honestly this has to stop and only then can you let yourself open up to meeting more people and trying new things. 
1	Yes
3	Any good resources/videos to enhance knowledge on ENTJ (esp. the weakpoints).	Friend recently had me typed and I have since found this shit fascinating like a crack addict.\n\nSure this is all just theory, but it seems like a good framework to approach the different personalities of people. \n\nAny good resources (YouTube channels) you'd recommend? Some of the videos I've found seemed too basic, I wanted something more thorough and academic.
2	What’s your line of work?
2	try doing research on how Te-Se loop manifests in ENTJs and how Fi manifests under stress. This is a good start.
1	trying to understand my entj dad.?	hey my dad always nice to me growing up then suddenly when i hit age 20 he started acting funny towards me,started bullying me in front of my friends,i was also going through depression at the time and never left the house much,thsi also caused alot of grief for him,then something happened to him at work,one of his employees put him in a choke hold because he constantly scolds him out ,ever since then my dad would realy bully me,like everyday,in all ways,trying to hurt me as much as possible,even when i was in hospital for depression he would bully me,he spends all his time trying to hurt me as much as possible and shows no mercy,its like he wants me dead?,now what could this be?,is it becauise he doesnt understand things on an emotional level??,is his te getting mixed up with his inferor fi,is he just bad???,
7	Call him out on his behavior. Confront him. Tell him he won't be in your life if he continues this behavior. Be condescending because it sounds like his behavior warrants that. 
7	Your dad is out of control. You should not have to put up with this behavior. It sounds like both of you need some serious support and help.\n\nI would also recommend standing up to him - specifically, in a way that makes it clear that he is acting irrationally. Tell him that he is failing his responsibilities as a parent and as a good human being and that he needs to sort out the awful crap in his own life instead of making yours worse, that you are willing to work with him if he starts acting like a sane person again.
5	I feel like this is beyond MBTI, and your father is just behaving like an unapologetically abusive asshole. Value yourself and put as much distance between the two of you as possible. Work up the courage to tell him that the way he's behaving is inexcusable and that you don't have to put up with it.
3	If this kid posts about his dad one more time I swear to god
0	entjs have this willpower	entjs has this willpower,especialy when they angry,it scares me,sometimes this one entj guy gets into an argument with one of his employees,and all hell breaks loose,its like hes going to have a heart attack
7	From your past posts and comments, I seem to remember how unhealthy some of these individuals are. Maybe they aren’t ENTJs at all. Maybe they are just immature and unhealthy; any types can behave like you describe.
2	that's so cute lol i started laughing
6	ENTJs, how do you take a break?	Cuz sometimes "taking a break" just doesn't compute naturally lol. 
9	There are lots of really shitty replies in this thread, but to give a sincere response to your question, I've found that I need to "actively relax." Kind of sounds like an oxymoron, but unless I actively commit to scheduling out a block of time and turning off my brain, I will constantly have running thoughts. A lot of times I turn off my phone during these times as well.\n\nAs soon as I turn off my phone and realize I have four hours (or however long) of "me" time, I feel liberated. I can walk and get coffee, read a book, play games, play or listen to music -- whatever -- completely free of any distractions. Maybe a better term is "focused relaxation." Once again, I know it sounds stupid, but it works for me.\n\nAlso, you might consider mindfulness meditation to clear your head. Sometimes you won't realize you're stressing out about something until you sit by yourself, without any external input, and you let your thoughts percolate to the surface. It's easy to do, even if you've never done it. For me, I just sit and repeat a word of my choice over and over, or I try to focus solely on my breathing for as long as possible without thinking of anything else. If I'm thinking about something over and over again, that's a sign to me that I need to express those thoughts in one way or another -- through art, talking to someone, or journaling, for example. Best of luck OP!
7	I grow house-plants and mess with them, drink nice coffee at home and listen to music. \n
4	I quit my job and slept for a fucking month. fuck that place for making me so over-worked and sleepy! 
3	Not unless it is forced on me, school and work was closed for a whole week. Took some much needed rest.
3	I fiercely guard my once-monthly sleep-in Sunday (I only make it until 10:30am instead of noon). But, I feel like a teen again and am refreshed. Then I jump back into the chaos that is my life....
4	I get sick... \nFever, body aches, chills, cough - that usually does it. 
5	I drug myself to sleep lol
4	I don't.

1	I see movies. I got to 5+ a month. I don’t watch television at home so it’s time where nothing else is demanded of me.
1	Internet games
1	Reddit.
1	My whole life is a break right now. Ughhh. Wish I could get myself headed in the other direction.
1	More often than not, I read in a quiet, tranquil atmosphere... but that's only after all my friends have said they're too busy to hang out hahaha
0	Looking for an unsolicited advice from ENTJs.	Nothing is wrong with me and nothing is broken. I just want to see what you come up with.\n\nWait, looking for an unsolicited advice is an oxymoron. Ah, whatever.\n\nAnyway, what's your life advice for me? What wisdom can you share?\n
10	Push yourself hard, but let yourself rest. Learn when to sprint, learn when to stop. 
11	"You have two ears and one mouth so that you can hear more and speak less."\n\nSeek wisdom. Be gracious. \n\nSmile often, laugh heartily, smirk appropriately. \n\nLearn from failure. Learn from the failures of others. 
7	[deleted]
6	This is the most ENTP question I've ever seen.
3	Life is never easy or straight forward. Ride the waves and kick its fucking ass. Also if you ever want to drive real fast ride with a cougar like Ricky Bobby.
3	Do everything that you have to do in life cause one day you might not know your going to die
3	Nothing really matters in the end, and only a small handful (at best) of any accomplishments you have will actually be remembered. Find those areas where you can create lasting value that matters to you, and go after them hard. I could never look back on life with any satisfaction if I didn't actually create something memorable, so that's about the best advice I have for you. 
9	Well here it goes. Your post history shows you're a trump nsupporter, even calling him a 'good businessman' even though he failed all his ventures to the point that putting all his wealth into a simple fund would have gotten him a higher return on interest, meaning his such a 'good' business man to the point that he can't even outperform basic inflation and minimum market growth. Your support of this idiot of a man makes me question your intelligence and ability for rational thought, especially considering you claim to be an INTJ. Although history will tell, my unsollicitate advice would be to not support a dementing narcissists who spends his time golfing and playing dick contests with other nations over Twitter, and instead actually support people who know what the fuck they are doing. You want America to be run like a fucking business? Trump would have been fired a looong time ago already by that 'business'. \n\nBring on the downvotes,  but here you got it, some proper critical, unsolicited advice.
4	Learn to program. It's going to be the difference between the rich and the poor of the future. 
2	* Good is good enough. Don't beat yourself up over perfection. \n\n* Don't compare yourself to the Elon Musks of the world. Try to be better than who you were yesterday.\n\n* Try to give up bad habits and addictive behaviors. Focus on continual learning and building your skills. \n\n* What you do outside of work, improves who you are in the long run. 
4	Learn to be a gentleman and stop acting like a dirty pervert
1	When starting out with a new habit, make it so easy that you can't say no. E.g. "I will do 1 push up when I am out of bed". It's the starting of tasks that daunt us and we always think its harder than it actually turns out to be most of the time. If you do that one push up and you think "eh, that wasn't so bad" and you do another one-bravo! If you carry on with your day after your push up, that's cool, you still met your target.\n\nThere are going to be days where you feel like you're winning at life (e.g. you do 20 push ups and say "no" to that bacon sarnie), they're rare. Cherish them because it feels great when it happens, but that is no reason to beat yourself up when you have a day when it feels like everything is going to shit (e.g. you wake up really late, so you don't do that push up, and you also end up eating a whole packet of cookies while at your desk). \n\nDoing stuff the same time of day is useful because it's like automating your life- but life loves to give us a curve ball every now and then, and so we must remain adaptable. Didn't do that push up this morning? Do it as soon as you are able to. Even if it means tomorrow. It's during these crappy days when we feel overwhelmed or when things aren't going as planned that our self-discipline is tested, and that's why its important to set goals and habits which seem manageable even in these kinds of situations (obviously there are exceptions e.g.: (physical and mental) illness, emergencies/tragedies, etc....).\n\nOh, and Baz Luhrmann is right- always wear sunscreen.
1	Be a person of integrity and stamina and you should be just fine.
1	Be who you are. It's good to have diagnostic tools and philosophical and psychological resources to help you put it into words, but at the end of the day, you are you before you're an ENTJ or whatever you are. I'm an ENTJ by only a few % and much of the bill matches me very well, but I'm an intensely passionate and spiritual person. While I know I'm an ENTJ, I also know that I'm not defined by it. Nobody is.\n\nYou define you. Nobody else. You take that definition and transition it into a lifestyle, a thought style. Don't let anything or anyone in the world change that or take that from you. Be confident in your intellectual autonomy and individuality. 
6	What makes ENTJ’s efficient	Please explain
30	What makes other types so inefficient? I mean, it's really not that difficult. You set a goal, decide what needs to be done to get there, plan your actions, and *just do it*.\n\nNo whining, no bitching, no endless 'but I can't because ... '. Just fucking do it already. 
10	ENTJ in functions is Te Ni Se Fi.\n\nTe, Se, and Fe are the functions that demonstrate the most 'usefulness' in the real world, because these are functions that lead us to take action (not really the case for Ne). These are functions that process data and let us respond to present issues.\n\nSe (extroverted sensing) serves as some capacity to process, interpret, and directly react to the world, as opposed to Si which tends to imbue past experiences and conceptions on present day events.\n\nFe (extroverted feeling) is a function of how to engage emotionally with people, hence which is why ESFJs and ENFJs are known for creating social harmony and having an ease in leading others.\n\nTe (extroverted thinking) doesn't do that. Te puts aside people's feelings to take action on an issue, usually on the basis of organization and management. It is an executive ability, which is why you may often hear ESTJs and ENTJs in management or upper-level positions.\n\nExxJs have Je (extroverted judging) so they'll respond quickly and decisively to issues that come up and take initiative. For ENTJs, efficiency comes about from the combination of action-oriented, outwards looking functions (Te + Se) with that judging capacity, and the 'logical' nature of these functions facilitates this further.\n\n
3	From a personal perspective, actively trying to be efficient. I hate screwing up and having to do tasks twice.
2	Te
2	-- Extroverted: ENTJs have connections to make their goals happen and can properly delegate "lesser" tasks to others they trust. \n\n-- Intuitive: ENTJs look for patterns in the world, which allows them to analyze a situation, make predictions, and formulate plans of action based on those predictions. \n\n-- Thinking: ENTJs make logical decisions without allowing emotions to fully take over, meaning they can be more efficient towards meeting their goals. \n\n-- Judging: ENTJs have amazing long-term planning abilities. This allows them to formulate plans with clear starting and ending points, with realistic "checkpoints" along the way. ENTJs can visualize steps that need to happen along the way in order to reach "the big goal" and *make them happen.* 
1	Extroverted, so have a lot of experiences and connections with which to draw from. Higher energy because not within themselves as much as an introvert, less prone to depression and other disorders that would hamper progress. \n\nThinking, so not clogged by emotion to action. Precise. Ruthless. Extroverted thinking style, succinct, results-oriented, linear, easy to broadly apply, perfect for leadership. \n\nSensing style based on here and now. Not reminiscing about the past, not bound to tradition. Sensing style that's outwardly attractive.\n\nIntuition style that is looking at relevant data to something they're working on. Not scattered.  Not looking at endless possibilities, which is less accurate, but nails efficiency and effectiveness. \n
4	What are your plans for New Year's Eve?	
9	Throwing a “formal but not normal” black tie party for about 30 people.  Champagne, caviar and confetti I’ll be finding around the house for the next few years.  Everyone dressed in creative black tie...like tux w red converse, taffeta formal skirt & heels w Slayer t-shirt.  It’s been an annual tradition for about 6 years now.
3	Staying home. Kids, family, games, snacks, champagne & music. Looking for tips on how to make it fun for 8-11 year olds.
3	I'm throwing a little house party at my place. 
3	Warm bath at home with champagne and a Skype session with my fiance.
2	Like every year I'm going to a friend's house with some other friends and drink and play board games. The hosts have 2 small kids, so they can't go out and party, but we want to spend time with them so we "party" at their home.
2	I'm doing a favor for someone, then doing some work year end stuff and then probably sleeping. 
2	Dinner and drinks, then a concert with friends. We hit a lot of bars before the show. \nSan Francisco is a fantastic drinking town! 
2	Gambling with family (Chips not cash), drinking, and bonfire w/ grill to make some munchies.

13	ENTJ Cognitive Functions/Immature VS Mature ENTJ	Hey ENTJ brethren, thought I'd share a little (<misnomer alert) post I wrote for r/entp earlier today. Do share your thoughts!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHey ENTP's of Reddit! What an interesting subreddit you have.  Something I have noticed whilst perusing it is a fair amount of discussion surrounding "Bossy Saucey's", a.k.a. ENTJ's.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nWhile much of this is entertaining and enlightening to read, I couldn't help but notice a lot of existing misunderstanding surrounding ENTJ's and wanted to shed some more light on the elusive "Executives".\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNow, as we all know, the dichotomies of Myers-Briggs are a surface-level indicator of **cognitive function** stack of each type. I'm going to assume most of you reading this are familiar with cognitive functions and their nicknames when going through this post. Buckle up, it's likely to be a long one.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe first thing I want I address when we discuss Myers-Briggs is the fact that it is a horizontal typology system. In other words; descriptions about types are generalized and indicative of everyone being at the same level of growth. This is why stereotypes exist and why these are perpetuated on Reddit. We all, at some level, understand that every individual person is, depending on their age and position in life, at a different stage of mental and emotional growth than each other. A simple comparison would be a 14 year-old kid versus their 80 year-old grandmother. Both are at different levels of development. Both could share a Myers-Briggs type, yet they would, or at least should, appear quite differently.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis is also affected by how aware of and interested in self-development the individual is.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo, let's get into the meat! \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe first thing I've noticed in a number of threads is that people tend to think ENTJ's are **close-minded**. It's very true that they can come across as such, yet a look at the cognitive function stack for an ENTJ shows that their secondary process is "**Introverted Intuition**". This process exists, in some degrees at a basic level, as a means of getting into others heads to understand why they say what they say and do what they do. Personality Hacker has nicknamed  it "**Perspectives**". And this is exactly what the function is all about; getting perspective to understand the world.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOf course, a more **immature** ENTJ might not use their secondary process as consciously as they should. The tendency of humans is to skip hard or uncomfortable work, and developing **Perspectives** requires an ENTJ to slow down and go inward; a place they don't have a lot of experience initially. Prior to developing **Perspectives**, it's very common for ENTJ's to skip over their secondary function when making decisions and jump straight to their **tertiary function**; **Extroverted Sensing**.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Extraverted Sensing** is only concerned with the immediate present and doesn't look at the big picture. This creates a problem for ENTJ's in that they can become easily distracted by what's right in front of them or what provides immediate sensory satisfaction (ie television, video games, visible busywork etc.), forgetting the **big-picture** and long-term consequences of their actions. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt's also the use of this process and the skipping of **Perspectives** that can cause them to seem close-minded.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs an ENTJ grows and **consciously** develops **Perspectives**, they'll be less argumentative and far slower to argue with you, since they'll be considering your response before counter-arguing. That said, ENTJ's enjoy a good debate almost as much as ENTP's do, so don't think even a mature ENTJ will back down unless you can back up your argument very well. The difference is that a mature ENTJ will still be considering your points and has no qualm admitting it if they were wrong, but you have to prove them wrong. It also helps to not mock them if they admit defeat; they've respected you and your argument, respect and honour that in return. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnother point I've seen made in this subreddit is that ENTJ's aren't loyal. This could not be further from the truth. And, don't worry, I'll tell you why. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nYou see, tucked away at the end of the ENTJ's function stack is a little process called **Introverted Feeling**. This is the ENTJ's **inferior function** and it exists as a bit of a **blindspot**. It is nicknamed **Authenticity**.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Authenticity** is concerned with what matters to the the ENTJ, what their core values are and making sure that their actions are being true to themself and the type of person they want to be.  It's very easy for an ENTJ to forget to check in with this process, but the immense power that comes from pausing and using **Perspectives** to get inside their own head and access their **Authenticity** is mind-boggling.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nENTJ's tend to have a very powerful moral compass, driven by **Authenticity**, and this compass highly values loyalty, integrity, respect, honour and so forth. It might not seem it at times, especially when they're ranting at you for whatever reason (thanks **Te**), that they don't give a rat's ass about you or anyone else. Believe me, that isn't true.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nENTJ's are actually very affected by emotions. They are simply blessed with the ability to sidebar them until they choose to deal with them. This can be a weakness if they are never dealt with, leading to tons of unresolved baggage. It is an amazing strength, if used properly, however, in that the ENTJ can put their emotions aside until such a time that they're alone to sit down and break down what they feel, recollect and ensure their actions are in **alignment** with themselves.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLoyalty is highly esteemed by ENTJ's, they just forget it at times because the emotion behind it is hard to access. It's far more effective for them to cultivate **principled** loyalty, as this will then stem from their dominant function of **Extraverted Thinking** and be far more readily accessible to them. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI think it's time to bring this to a close. Hopefully this is information has proved enlightening. Please leave any questions below if you have them. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**tl:dr** ENTJ's are people too\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEDIT: formatting

2	Thank you for those clarifying insights. All of that needed to be said, and bears repeating in the future. I understand there aren’t many of us for people to base their opinions off of, but. We all know that people have a tendency to disparage that which they don’t understand and/or feel threatened by. 
1	ENTJs are great people tbh and I wish I had some of their qualities but theyre just fucking irritating at times. I've learnt to deal with some of them but I can't stand them being my boss, in fact I would argue that mature ENTPs make better leaders than any mature ENTJ
2	How do you challenge yourself in a meaningful way?	I find that when I am challenged, when the stress is on, or when there is an expectation of me from an external source work/boss/friends ect. I usually excel at whatever I'm doing. Huge projects are nothing. A federal agency shows up for work and threatens to cut off 70 million in funding, A cake walk. Planning a trip for 12 to another country, easy.\n\nHowever if I have a goal where there is no external expectation. Things that I want to do but don't really need to do. I tend to lose focus and I have trouble developing the long term routines. I find that other things and other interests crowed out stuff that I really should do. As example some of my personal goals:\n Exercise every day, practice with my guitar an hour every day, cook and eat the right kind of healthy foods, keep my house from getting cluttered, learn to speak Italian ECT.\n\nI have a problem developing those habits and goals over the long term. I can keep things going for a few weeks or a few months but eventually things start to slide and I stop working at them only to pick them up again months or years later.\n\nSo how do I challenge myself in a meaningful way to reach out and stick to long term goals. Goals that are generally good but where there may not be an immediate practical benefit?    
2	The challenge with the activities you mentioned is that it's hard to have a concrete measure of success / failure. \n\nI recommend trying to shift your thinking about "success" being the outcome you want to "success" being in the input. Track your success by the percentage you stick with the habit. Make it visual and obvious — hang up a calendar and tick off the days you stick with it. You get the idea.\n\nWhen you can frame "doing it every day" as the success, rather than the vaguer outcome, your ENTJ ambition should kick in and carry it forward from there.
1	Lifting weights.
6	Do you give money to beggars? What is your opinion on people doing this/not doing this?	>What is your opinion on people doing this/not doing this?\n\nI just want to say that I meant - What do you think of people giving money to beggars/not giving it to them.
11	I wrote a paper on this... I of course have lost it but hey w/e. Basic thing I took from my research is that its better to donate to good foundations rather than individuals unless you know they will use that money to survive. \n\nLong term homelessness is generally a sign of mental illness that needs to be addressed. There are definitely people who exploit it as well. Things like gov benefits pay more than a minimum wage job so people know that working those jobs is a step back (and if they work them they lose benefits). Begging allows them to increase their livelihood. Nothing is ever easy or black and white everyone's got something going on.
8	I don't really care what other people do.\n\nFor myself, there are just so many beggars in my city that I feel like I can't allow myself to begin. 
4	I used to and pretty much stopped. In a country where I live shelters and food and other programs are available. The overwhelming majority of these beggars are alcoholics / addicted to hard drugs.\n\nYes, there are big underlying problems but I can't solve those and donating to money to people seems counter-productive for the most part.\n\nNow, there are other programs like tiny tiny houses for the homeless, and this is something that I can get on board with and even taxed for.\n\nWe have to double-check the incentives though. Does some program cause more people to quit their jobs and become homeless? Milton Friedman talked about Negative Income Tax and the incentives that come with that.\n\nWhen trying to help the homeless, maybe the current generation of hobos is already a lost cause (not sure 100%) and the most good we could do would be in preventing more of it in the young children today.\n\nIf we are to dump more money at a problem of say people with low IQ being decimated by automation, then I do not think simply giving them money unconditionally for life is a good idea. They will go mental and addicted without anything to do. It might be better to assign a small but large enough to farm on plot of land and a tiny but functional house somewhere where land is relatively cheap.\n
3	I do sometimes but it's more of a spur of the moment thing. I don't care what they spend it on -- it's just a gift with no strings attached. If they're going to buy drugs with it then that's my gift to them, I guess. I'm sure I've given money to non-homeless people who have gone on to buy drugs, do I get to complain about them too? I can't fix their whole life, nor do I really have the desire to, but I have enough money that I can make someone happy for a couple minutes. Life is not that great that I feel inclined to dictate what can make someone else happy and what can't. They can choose themselves. 
2	I don't give money to beggars, but I have no issue with other people doing it.
2	I prefer to feed them; I usually end up buying them groceries if I don't give them a meal that's ready-to-eat.
1	I might buy them food or toiletries if I have the time and money. I don’t generally give them cash. I’m all for helping people but I don’t want to spend my money on someone else’s drug habit.
1	I will donate to charities, but never give money to beggars. I have no idea where the money is going to end up.
1	I have before, but no not really.

3	Not bad.  \nBut I do think that colonizing Mars is not that dreamy  \nand I don't like unecessery confrontations or even competitions.
0	INFP curious about ENJFs and ENTJs	I just took the test and found out I'm an INFP woman. I read that ENJFs and ENTJs get along best with each other and I wanted to put it to the test. Share if you're at ENJF or and ENTJ and share a bit about yourself and what makes you tick ;)
5	It depends on the INFP's level of maturity, TBH... But here's what I have to offer based on personal experiences with INFPs:\n\n**Good points:**\n\n* Intellectual\n\n* Good at comforting \n\n**Ticks me off:**\n\n* Overly idealistic\n\n*  *Very* emotional/reliant on emotions\n\nFine with INFPs but I wouldn't say we get along *best*...Not in my opinion at least. Also, it seems that usually INFPs tend to like ENTJs more than the converse
5	Not a fan of the INFPs I know.
8	I've never heard of ENJF's. A 17th personality?
2	I get along well with the INFPs I know, but while I'd call some of them good friends, they're definitely not my closest friends. Anything beyond friendship seems really unlikely to work out.\n\nThis was mentioned somewhat, but I do value INFPs' creativity, open-mindedness and genuine desire to comfort you if need be. I tend to view INFPs as very non-threatening, but in a relaxing way given the contrast between them and who I'm usually surrounded by, and how I act around them. While it's not always easy to be blunt (e.g. "That's a terrible idea, do it X way"), it is very easy to be open with them (e.g. "This is exactly how I viewed X"), which they tend to understand and can be just as fulfilling. They may be very emotional on average but they have great depth, so if you pick your battles it can balance out. \n\nWhere it falls off for me is their inability to organize themselves, their environment or their goals. The whole creative-laid-back thing is nice in short bursts but I couldn't be around someone long-term who was so different to me in this way. I'd obviously give someone a chance if the chemistry was there, but it has never been there to this point. 
1	My best friend is an INFP or INFJ, forgot which. I'm not sure I've ever known an ENFJ
1	I am an ENTJ and my girlfriend is an INFP. Do you have questions?
1	I have a really close INFP friend. Long story short, I think we cover a lot of each other's weak points. But I also think our common interests, similar backgrounds, and equivalent maturities make up at least as big a part of that as our personalities.
0	I doubt it's easy for NTs and NFs to get along.  Our logical approach versus their feelings – based approach isn't ideal.  \n\nOur natural partner is the INTP.  
2	What gifts would you like to get for Christmas?	
15	time :( 
9	Money, government bonds, money, cash, and checks.
3	Generally geek and tech stuff. I'm also happy to get books.\n\nI usually ask my close family to get me stuff like video games, which I could buy myself easily, but hey this way I get something I want and save money at the same time.
3	Money, books, sausage and cheese, sundress. 
3	Canada Goose 
2	Fully funded retirement account 
1	I love classic literature so books, particularly Shakespeare because I have an affinity for his work.

1	Usually absolutely nothing, but this season - a damn good pair of multi-use winter gloves would be nice.
1	Housing is only a small portion. My house is almost paid off. \n\nYou need to pay taxes, health insurance, utilities - and I'd like to live in a manner that I've become accustom to, which includes travel and other luxuries. You need a good amount of money earning interest to live like that. 
7	Best friends	Assuming you're an adult, what's your best friend situation?
6	My bestie is an ISTP.\n\nIt's funny because it's the only friendship where I'm the "emotional" one. She keeps me really grounded; I think that if not for her I would be a much more stereotypical ENTJ. 
4	Coincidentally, my two closest friends are also ENTJ-A women. They are both first generation Americans, one Indian, and one Chinese. Despite our cultural diversity, we all had fairly similar upbringings. It’s amazing to have people around that understand your thought process/core personality, but are still different enough from you to keep things interesting
4	My best friend is isfj, we have a very different approach to life. He's a lot more traditional and by the books in his choices. He's more of a 'this is a logically good next step, I pick this road and stick to it'. I am looking for off-road life paths, both professionally as relationshipwise. \n\nHe's successful in the medical field, specialising in eye surgery. I'm an engineer, but I'd love to be an entrepreneur. Now I'm trying to find a part-time teaching job in the sciences. That way I have free time to do entrepreneurial projects on the side.
3	We get along with well and share interests, they will be there for me even if it’s inconvenient for them, and know that they can rely on me to for the same but don’t take advantage of the fact. Also, someone that isn’t gonna flake out or get weird after a few years. That last one has been the kicker so far. 
3	My best friendships tend to be with ENxPs. Currently have a lot more ENTPs around me to call "close" friends. I enjoy the company of many other types but I can't see myself having a "best" friend that doesn't like deep discussions, being intellectually challenged, wants to actively invest time in the friendship etc. They're intelligent enough for me to respect what they have to say but laid back enough that I don't feel a need to compete with them all the time either.
4	My best friend is an ESFP. We've been attached at the hip since we were 6, she's pretty much my sister at this point. We both have things we appreciate about each other that we can learn from. I help her have her life together and make more or less important decisions, she helps me be more adventurous and learn to get in touch with that fetus Fi. I think growing up together has helped us both be more well rounded individuals.  \nWe are very different people in some ways and don't really share a lot of interests, so there are a few activities and topics I prefer to engage in with different friends, but I still appreciate her a lot and I'm looking forward to buying matching walkers with her in 50 years' time.
1	I don't really have a best friend, but the person closest to that is this INTJ. We mostly just talk about stuff we're doing or people we both know, but we both *get* each other in a way that makes all conversations fun
1	An INTJ. We have more or less the same brain, but she thinks deeper and I am more spontaneous and at ease with people.
1	My best friend is most likely an Enneagram 6 and most definitely an INFP. He's the most loyal person I have ever met and he has only ever let me down logistically. We lookout for each other's best interests and although we are on complete opposite sides of the world these days, we still talk and I plan to visit him in Japan next year. I love INFPs unless they're neurotic. :)\n\nEdit: Two letters.
1	I don't really use the term "best" friends, but close friends. To me, best friends has a childhood significance based on the growth of an individual (aka adolescent growing pains).\n\nAt university, my close friend was an INFJ female. We were literally attached at the hip and we would never got bored of talking to each other. I would ring her at 2am and vice versa and we always answered each other after the first ring, lol. We spent many nights at 12am at the local diner having coffee and bagels, studying for our exams and were each others' confidantes. Our friendship broke up after a major incident, and also the fact that we ended up liking the same guy, and I cut her out of my life and I still feel regretful about that. \n\nAnother close friend at university was an ISTJ female. We were literally the opposites in nearly everything, including our opinions and thoughts, but I found her refreshing because she was different from me. We were also very attached at the hip and worked together for the school paper and literally were part of every activity together and attended all the same parties. I found her very dependable and reliable but we didn't have that kind of close emotional connection as my INFJ friend. She was very centered, practical and grounded which was a striking complement to my being in the clouds all the time and engaged in abstract thought and theory. I still recall one of our conversations in which I was talking about a particular philosopher and she said, "But what has that got to do with *reality*?" LOL \n\nAfter university, my close friend who also became my bf, was an ENFP male. We literally spent every single moment together. He was very caring and accommodating but unfortunately I was a b*tch to him as I was going through an anger phase. He wanted to settle down, but I felt like I hadn't lived my life yet.\n\nA close friend after that was and ENTP male. We were each other's confidantes and everyone thought we were dating, but our relationship was totally platonic. He would give me advice about the INTP I had been dating at the time, while I gave him insight into the various women he had been involved with. He was the kind of friend in which, I could ring him up at any time and say, "Hey, let's meet at our local pub" and we would spend hours barhopping and having drinks, talking about everything under the sun. He would always make me laugh with the ridiculous opinions that he had and he always entertained all my theories about everything. We threw the most extravagant surprise parties for each other and would go on many group trips together. However, he started dating a girl and got her pregnant, then moved to another state, so we lost touch after that. Sometimes, when I'm traveling I still think, "Oh I wish ENTP male was here. He would love this place." \n\nSometime after that I became close friends with an INFJ male. He had such a brilliant mind, and I loved dissecting every thought he had in his head. He was also an extraordinary writer and poet and I just loved reading everything he had ever written. There were so many layers to his personality, he was like a Chinese puzzle. However, I think for him, I was more of a *social experiment* than a friend, and when he said he didn't consider me a friend at all, that really hurt my feelings so I shut myself off from him and told myself I would never let him get close to me again. We are still civil to each other when we bump into each other, and may exchange pleasantries, but nowadays, I keep a polite distance from him. \n\nThese days, I spend most time with my work colleagues, but I wouldn't say they were close friends, since they really don't know anything about me. \n\n  \n\n
1	2 girls I've known for the last 12 years. We became friends when I was shunned from my old group of friends because I wasn't vain enough to be their friend. It just happened. We had very little control over it. For years they were best friends until I joined in, now I seem to be the glue holding us together. We'll be friends even when we're widows.
-1	Best friends are outlawed in grade schools thanks to post-modernism. They say it is a form of discrimination and it is not fair to other kids.\n
7	The Worst You	When was a situation when you were the worst version of yourself?\n\nWas it internal or was it externally influenced? (eg, internal: social anxiety, depression etc vs external: trapped in a small city in the middle of nowhere surrounded by sexist, condescending people etc)
6	Both. If you aren't taking proper care of yourself and are surrounded by negativity and what not, losing sight of you who are is inevitable

1	I've already written an essay here, but just to answer the question I would say the worst me is the me that indulges in all the bad life has to offer. I've realised a lot of mental illness is like that. Having suffered pretty severe illnesses in the past, I've used stocism to help be a better, healthier person. Using this to change the way I think has done more good than medication and meditation.\n\nIn the past it was both internally and externally influenced, but once I took out the external influences, the internal ones became easier to control.

8	Best You	Considering the effects of neuroplasticity, biological aging, and muscle loss accompanied by time, what do you think it means to be the best version of yourself?\n\nEdit: Grammar
8	Waking up in the Swiss alps, breathing fresh air, surrounded by brilliant minds, strolling for a bit of eye candy at the local farmer's market, holding hands with a guy named Hans lol. \n\nI like building things. Without that drive to create, I feel restless and bored and engage in obsessive tendencies. 
4	Good is relative. Love will end and legacy will die. \n\nYou only matter to you, so be the you that you want to be.
2	Be loved, strong, independent, creative, witty.
2	Imho it's using what you have to your best strategic advantage. You will never be the best in you life at any one thing in your life at the same time. Looks fade as experience grows etc. For me it's more about knowing your strengths and weaknesses and leveraging these to get what you want.....

12	Follow up: People who get goosebumps or chills when listening to music	It appears that people who get goosebumps when listening to music, a phenomenon known as "frisson" is due to:\n\n*more nerve fibers connecting auditory cortex, the part of the brain that processes sound, to their anterior insular cortex, a region involved in processing feelings. The auditory cortex also has strong links to parts of the brain that also monitor emotions.*\n\nhttps://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/researchers-look-what-happens-brain-when-music-causes-chills-180959481/\n\nThis could also mean that people who experience frisson might also experience deeper emotions than others. Whereas for some, emotion is perhaps even, a shallow, fleeting experience to be experienced frequently and often; for thinker types who experience frisson, emotion is a very powerful experience limited to certain auditory cues.\n\nFrom the moment we are born, we are in tuned with the environment, in particular to auditory cues, and that is how we assess the world before we open our eyes. We may think we are primarily visual thinkers, but sound has a very important aspect in the way we assess emotions.\n\nSo as Thinker personalities, do you think you experience emotion more powerfully than other Feeler types? Thoughts?

2	Great news! I am dying to know - what are you like during sex?\n
1	Music is definitely one of those things that can bring me to tears very easily. But it's never with pop music, or anything with a singer, generally. I've bawled while listening to Mozart, Mahler, Górecki, take your pick. I've also cried while listening to the Blade Runner soundtrack. \n\nI know that powerful music has that affect on me, and I will never listen to it in the presence of anyone else. I just can't let my emotions betray the façade of the cold, hard bitch I've come to be. 
1	XD This has a lot to do with chakras and "chi". If you'd like, I can provide some good sources on it. It's hard to find helpful sources without prior understanding of the concept, history, and science itself.
1	I rely on music to guide my feelings and, for me, it's a cheap way to make me inspired and full of myself :P  \n  \nBut I really am not sure about the 'stronger emotions' part :/
1	I don't know about experiencing emotion more than feeler types. I don't know how to compare.\n\nI experience this frission sensation strongly and often. I can sometimes summon it on command, and did while I was reading the news article you linked.\n\nMy reaction to this is I am concerned that music can hijack my momentary emotions. I didn't recognize that it was emotionally related. 
24	Anyone else really enjoy a high stress environment?	At work today I was complimented on how calm I am even though it's the busiest time of the year. I dunno I just love the challenge of it I guess. Everyone else is getting tired and I'm just getting amped up lol. Thoughts?
14	Same here it's just the busy environment and a time of year to really show our potential, love it.  
5	I tend to feel more like "myself" when I'm up against deadlines and high-stakes expectations. I think it helps me remember why certain things still matter so much to me, whereas it's easier to lose sight of that when things are in a lull. I also tend to value my free time a lot more when I have less of it, making my relaxation all the more productive too. 
9	Yea same. Unless its emotional stress. Then I just get uncomfortable lol.
3	I feel most comfortable in high-stress situations. I need the challenge, it puts me at ease. The way I see it, it's the only way to truly thrive.\n
5	Do you create problems for yourself so that you can heroically solve them in the 23rd hour?
2	I have a hard time recognizing stress sometimes. My brain thinks and I do, this is a habit that usually gets me in over my head in several fields. 
2	I sure do but that's because I enjoy the stimulation and I'm not easily stressed; Type B finally paying off.
2	Nailed it. Yesterday, my mom was cooking and set the kitchen on fire and I felt a sense of inner peace. I looked at the fire, took my time, and deducted all of the opinions I had to put it out. Same with school, I freaking get off to the feeling when I have like 6 midterms on the same day. Its kinda sad when life feels dull and empty without stress.
2	Define "high stress" environment. I dislike crowds, people screaming and generally chaos everywhere. \n\nHowever, if everyone is working together on a project and there is a great deal of feedback and interaction, then yes, I find that interesting, but I wouldn't call that a high stress environment. 
2	I enjoy it if I have a certain level of control about it, and if the outcomes are interesting. If not, I will usually get by but feel very bad and need a good rest for a few days after that. That just happened last week.
1	Late to this party. I love those situations but only if I’m relying on myself. As of late I’ve had external factors that I cannot control causing chaos and I cannot stand that shit. 
3	Anybody else likes to measure the dimensions of measuring tape with measuring tape?	I have one metric and one imperial. This is really fucked up. Every measurement I take is with the wrong measuring tape. What do I do? I also have two magic markers.
3	Hey buddy. I have perfectionism OCD too. It’s a bitch, isn’t it. Lol 
2	Well, you can either use the magic markers to place the tapes side by side and then put both scales on both tapes orrrrrr mark one as imperial and one as metric with an I and an M somewhere using your markers or by color if they are different.\n\nHint: One option is less work than the other. \n\nPost was a joke, though, right?
1	Are you sure you're not an INTP?
14	Is anyone else here fascinated by the thought of planning your own funeral?	I know that sounds weird, but here I go.\n\nWhen it comes to music I have a "playlist" that I "joke" about with my friends but deep down would be great to see through. I will hear a song and think to myself that this song would be a good opener. \n\nI also joke that my pallbearers will have a choreographed routine as they carry my casket out. I will also tell people to bring headphones for the drive from the funeral home to the dump where they will leave my body. I mostly joke, but..... idk\n\nI just think that it would be a great way to get people through the pain of losing a loved one, one last chance to have the perfect plan that can never be outdone, set a tone of celebrating life lived, ect.
6	No not really. I don't really care what happens to my *physical* body.
4	1) Find my exact looking doppelgänger before I die so I can pull off something great for my funeral.\nOR\n2) Just strip me down naked and throw me into the woods.\n\nI would honestly be more than fine not having a funeral at all.
3	But I'll be dead when my funeral happens, why would I care how people mourn or celebrate my life, and or death ?\n\nFuck that I say.
2	I am not. Having planned a funeral for a close family member, I realized how important it is for the family to have the opportunity to honor the dead through the planning process. That part of the grief process would have been taken if this person has left instructions for us.
2	Not fascinated, but a big, drunken wake would be my preference. Help empty out my beer cellar. \n\nI am a bit Irish. 
2	Nah, i want to be cremated, and no funeral whatsoever. 
2	My family always talked openly about funeral arrangement wishes and what my siblings and I would get/want (objects, not money) after my parents' deaths. I plan on preparing and paying for my funeral as much as possible, if only to spare my loved ones from handling that while grieving. It's a necessary kindness. Also, what a party, amirite?
2	I want to be cremated, and then have a wicked party with a lot of booze, food, and dancing. 
2	Sounds like a waste of time, sorry. I'd rather spend this time watching a monkey rape a deer on Youtube.
1	Haha, that's a neat idea, but no, my general attitude is that I don't care what people want to do with me after I die. 
1	I'm into a lot of bubblegum/princess pop/rock, the type of stuff that you would imagine Regina George would listen to. I just ask that everyone reminisces about me listening to that music. Britney's Baby One More Time had better be the first album that's played. Or her Greatest Hits. I'll happily accept the latter.
1	Calling all ENTJs.	I need a total of 10 ENTJs to contribute data for a future MBTI test based mainly on machine learning. All you'll have to do is get your type verified and take a quick survey. If you'd like to help PM me. Thanks!
9	You know, the MB foundation does have an official test for MBTI. You should read their mission statement sometime; it’s almost like this is what they do or something. \n\nIt baffles me that all of these people want to make their own knockoff test, like hello it’s already done. In my eyes this is like someone painting the Mona Lisa with watercolors from Walmart and being like “EVERYBODY COME LOOK WHAT I MADE!”\n\nAnd we get two or three of these a month. \n\nEdit: ok now that I’ve had my rant I am aware that this could be a school project or just for fun/learning to use machine learning, I want to say that I may have overreacted a bit. I have just seen too many of these get advertised by some Joe Schmoe trying to make a dime off of a scummy web survey loaded with ads and there are _so_ many people trying to recreate this that it’s becoming a peeve of mine. 
3	[deleted]
1	Omg, I need to speak with you!  \n\nWhat ML tehnique do you use?  \nHow do you handle the scarcity of the data? (Or do you have a lot of it somehow?)  \nWhat outputs are you looking for?  \nAre you using supervised or unsupervised tehniques?
1	How are you planning to verify their types? I'm not an ENTJ, by the way, just a curious ESTJ.
6	what do you think of quiet people and how will you go about dealing with them?	
16	Quiet people have much to teach an ENTJ, especially in the deep listening department. My New Years resolution for 2017 was to be quieter and listen more. It started with watching how some of my quieter employees behaved. Once I internalized the process of actually shutting up, I learned A LOT. Powerful practice for sure. 
9	Talk one to one, establish a relationship, build trust, check in.
10	There are a few important distinctions to be made.\n\n* Awkwardly quiet: does not respond to prompting, does not make decisions, restrains emotional reactions or is generally dour, special efforts to be friendly with them yield no discernible results - this type of person frustrates and angers me and I avoid or ignore them. I compare them unfavorably to rocks because at least rocks can be interesting while they get in my way.\n\n* Timidly quiet: does not volunteer opinions or information but will respond genuinely when prompted, tries extremely hard to avoid giving offense or making others unhappy, opens up somewhat in favorable conditions - I find this type of person endearing and try to take care of them, though their timidity can be frustrating at times.\n\n* Naturally quiet: expresses thoughts succinctly and only when it's appropriate, has the normal range of emotional expression but doesn't usually make a big deal out of it, perfectly comfortable without needing much conversation and is very pleasant if you meet them on their terms - I tend to like this type of person and will happily cut any chatter as long as I am confident that that's what they prefer (explicitly declaring that helps, freaking tell me please).
5	I like quiet people more over the loud, always need to fill any silence with chatter, people. I’m probably a little more on the reserved side, so it bothers me none. There is no special “dealing with them” that has to be done.
5	I appreciate it. I can set my routines more effectively, whether the goal is to get to know them, to make them comfortable, to work with them or else. They let me in control, and I take it with pleasure.  \nThe less "space" people take and the more ground you have to operate socially.
5	Your problem is not the I but the F.
4	Depends. Why are you asking? Why do you need to deal with them? Is the business or social? \n\nThere is one in my social group. I've recently tried to draw her out. I sat by her and chatted. This is hard, as we're usually in loud pubs. It was a nice chat, she's very friendly and seems happy that I'm there, but the minute anyone intrudes she retreats hard. It's a lot of work on my part. She's not timid, she'll speak if addressed, but she's not going to put it out there. \n\nShe's not teaching me anything, as I interview people well, and that is what it feels like. It feels like I'm doing all of the work, like it's a one sided relationship. \n\n
3	Lol, I think you should be more worried about dealing with loudmouths, rather than those who are quiet.  If you ask quiet people what they are thinking, they are often willing to share.  They just don't feel the need to vomit every thought in their head onto others, being reserved shouldn't be seen as a bad thing and often if you give them some time/chance to warm up, they may become more chatty once they know that they can trust you.
3	I like quiet people but sometimes I think I'm too much for them and it makes things awkward. I have to remind myself to step back a little and not dominate the conversation. It's something I'm trying to work on, because most of my friends are introverts. I like quiet people though because I'm pretty independent and they generally respect that. 
3	Community College Is Not Working For Me, Could It Be An ENTJ Thing?	Now, I want to start off by saying I am not a genius, in fact I only earned around a 3.5 GPA in high school. With that I was accepted into a variety of "better" colleges. However, due to my finical situation, I decided to try out a community college. So far I am close to finishing my first semester and have noted a few things. First off, the classes are not too stimulating and most professors employ the "push them through" mentality. Second off, the people, most of the people tend to not want to stay and be social, make new friends. I am planing on transferring to a state school next fall and hopeful get a better experience. BTW I am a business major. 
14	i don’t think being dissatisfied with having boring classes and antisocial classmates has anything to do with type. it sounds like your school sucks
2	Sounds like you have terrible teachers and may be experiencing burn out. So take the time to study the things you will need in business school, to make it easier for yourself when you transition.
2	Try Coursera.com or EdX or like instead.\n
2	Sounds like we had the same experience, but I liked it that way. \n\nI hated the day classes (full of kids), liked the night classes much better.\n\nStill no social interaction that you are looking for, but I was working full time. The teachers were sub-standard, or barely spoke English, but I was just looking to push-through, myself. \n\nAre there any social clubs at your school? You may just have to work harder to find that at a JC. I was socializing with co-workers. 
2	I went to a community college and it was easy for me as well. I tried to take difficult classes that interested me. Community college was a great opportunity to make connections with professors and I loved that each class was about 30 students. Get a great gpa, make connections, join clubs, and transfer into your dream school—that is what I did. I was pretty anti-social for most of my time in community college due to the fact that nobody wanted to make friends. I basically studied all the time, transferred out of community college, and met amazing people/professors at uni. 
2	All I did in Community College was smoke blunts, sell drugs and study. It was not until I got into major specific classes that things got exciting.
1	I had a blast in community college, I had lots of friends and flirted with girls constantly. The classes were easy I got nearly straight As. Don't know what you're whining about. I loved college. 
1	Sounds like your professors suck. Use RateMyProfessor before a semester. It's usually super accurate, and I never took a college class without it. Tells you everything you need to know, and makes the college life so much better.
1	You seem to have a strong vision of who you want to be, and a desire to work hard achieving it. Maybe that means you're ENTJ, or maybe you're just a good student. Either way, I do know a few individuals who were forced into a situation like yours and not one was happy until they were financially stable enough to transfer. If you have high academic and professional goals for yourself, do not spend 4 (or even 3) years at a comm. college, or anywhere that doesn't challenge you the way you want to be challenged. Look into as many scholarships and as much financial aid as possible, and best of luck with the 'gtfo' operation. 
19	A group of ENTJs is called...?	O-oh hai there! n.n; I'm just visiting from r/ENTP. Apparently I'm the designated ambassador or some shit? *ahem* That is to say, I am the most proactive and leadership oriented ENTP among the throng! <strikes power pose>\n\n*ahem* So, it began with a person calling a group of INTJs a gaggle. That just won't do. I went to r/INTJ to ask what a group of wild INTJs should be formally called. I now know that it is a Jury of INTJs. What few ENTPs we could scrape together agreed that we are a Chaos of ENTPs. INTPs are still working out whether they are an Institute or an Asylum of INTPs.\n\nWhat shall a group of ENTJs be called formally? Are you ... a Barrel? An Excitement? A... you know what, I've only met one that I know of for certain, I'm just winging it here. >.>; Help an ENTP out? n.n
63	A command of ENTJs. 
18	A Clash (of Titans)
11	A Republic of ENTJs (my personal favorite)\n\nor \n\nAn Administration of ENTJs\nA Supremacy of ENTJs \nA Dominion of ENTJs\nA Power of ENTJs\n\n(All of these would work in my opinion)
10	A board of ENTJs. \nOr, a kernel of ENTJs.
10	A Summit of ENTJs.
8	A regime
5	An efficiency.
7	A... Lone... A group on ENTJs is a lone... Generally there are fireworks when I've been in the same place as another of you.\n\nEither that or a team of world dominating entities. ToWDE for short.

6	Perhaps a congress of ENTJs would fit. They love to discuss ideas, debate and make decisions right?

11	How do you handle disrespect from upper management?	Usually I have to simply get up and walk away, rather than getting really snarky and getting myself into some kind of trouble. \n\nI'm wondering how I can better respond to these type of situations. I'm trying to show some level of maturity, because I'm not really sure that ignoring the situation is doing any good? \n\nI want to stand up for myself, but being disrespected by people "above" me really grinds my gears. I guess it's hard for me to say something decent, rather than getting confrontational. I'm not really sure that I have enough leverage in my job to afford getting confrontational. \n\ntldr, how can I handle disrespect without turning into a firecracker?? 
8	It really depends on the circumstances for me, so I'll have to be nuanced in answering this. If it's a short-term job or position where I know I'm eventually leaving, I'm getting what I came for, and one person might not be seeing things fairly, I brush it off. I would like to be recognized for my efficiency and dedication, but if a "higher-up" doesn't see it, whatever. They can feel whatever way they want so long as I get my money and experience. I have many other professional references, so I don't have to bend over for one person's irrational emotional needs. \n\nIf I do value the person's opinion, or it's a long term position where I can't let things deteriorate over time, I'll handle it differently. I try and strike a balance between explaining where I think the misunderstanding occurred, but still remain professional and assume blame whether I deserve it or not. That's what employees do -- they work for their employer. How I happen to feel about a situation, or how they feel about me personally, should not factor into the equation. Again, I am there for money and experience, and they want me for my competency. Misunderstandings are bound to happen but I rarely let it get personal. 
3	I walked into a company with a pissy little ISTJ running an area - just a little bastard of miserable fucker. He just fucked with people to fuck with them. And everyone knew it. The boss loved him because he'd get blood out of a turnip, and I mean, he'd get every vendor at the lowest price they'd ever seen, but that man should not have ever been allowed to be around people. He was a complete shit-head. \n\nThey *loved* it when I gave it right back to him. The better I could slam him, the more they laughed. I was new, and under 30, he was in his 50's... He started looking for easier marks. \n\nIf I had *not* been allowed to do this, I'd have put my resume out immediately and left. \n\nIt really depends on how badly they are disrespecting you, how much power they have over you, and what you can do about it. \n\nI'd try with making yourself an unattractive target. A little firecracker for some disrespect is to be expected by the one dishing it out, I'd think. That's be my first go-to. Tit for tat! But, I'm a bit evil. \n\nIf they are completely out of line, is it worth reporting? Is it worth leaving? 
3	I tell them that I don't care about their status as a higher up, and no human should disrespect a human, period. I then state that if there's an issue with me, or the way I work, you can tell me in a respectful way, and we'll come to a consensus on how to fix the issue like adults. If they can't handle that, well then maybe it's best I don't work there, or I'll tell their higher up on how they handled the situation. The key is I remain very calm throughout the whole process, and also just consistently make sure I'm a good worker, so I don't have dirt on me if there's a third party that gets involved in the dispute.
2	Walking away looks weak. You have to stand your ground. Never raise your voice, always be super calm when talking to your superiors. \n\nAlways compliment them first before going into the specific criticisms. People always listen if you first tell them the good news before the bad.  
2	Why are you enduring this? Upper management consistently disrespecting those lower on the hierarchy is an indelible sign that they are fools - they are broadcasting that they cannot control their own organization. I would find leaders worthy of my loyalty. \n\nIn the meantime, heed /u/WorldOfDrumcraft and /u/CatisMyOverlord depending on who exactly the fool is. Don't lie down and be a victim.
2	Start doing things by the book, PRECISELY. No more, no less. You should probably be able to play this game better than them.
2	I agree with the other reply, depends how bad it is.\n\nI was one of the youngest of my team and I had no qualms in calling the boss lies in front of everybody. Actually the bigger the crowd (specially if they agreed with me/were bad talking the boss behind his back) and the more supportive the better.\n\nThat can backfire though and actually make the boss angrier, so dunno if open confrontation is the best plan.\n\nYou can slowly undermine his confidence. But not visibly. For example, some guy is embarrassed of having aged/is losing his good shape, you comment how some other boss is joining a marathon and is doing such great progress (but don't mention your boss directly, and is even better if the doesn't know you know he is miffed about it). Just find where it hurts and indirectly undermine his confidence, but not openly since you have no leverage. Sometimes, we all need a humble me down to get a little less obnoxious lol.\n\nIf others are also putting him down, open up to listen and just nod, sometimes people confess or share so much in those times, even hated bosses. And sometimes they start treating you better because they see you as a pal/on my side. I dunno how you are being treated and how bad the situation is. Is variable and better think through before doing something that can make things worse.\n\nAnother thing, get along well with all the staff, specially people that can defend you/loyal colleagues. If you can't get him to respect you if others do respect you a lot or like you a lot, he won't be able to act like that in front of them.
1	Start by polishing your resume and going to interviews. You just might score a better deal. When they ask you why you are leaving ... that would be a tricky one ...\n\n
1	Depends on the culture but if you are snarky it may come across as stronger than if you just take the abuse. I kept my mouth shut to upper management and they did not like that I did not express myself ultimately. You have to be crafty but I’m sure you can still survive the abuse without digging your grave. Definitely look for another place to work though and seriously try to make a move soon. Bad bosses really ruin a perfectly good job. 
1	Don't respond with "Go fuck yourself". That will get you fired.\n\n;<
2	Any ENTJs in the Central Florida area?	Hey all, INTP here.  I'm looking for an ENTJ in the Central Florida area, ideally somewhere between Tampa and Orlando, who is open to partnering up and working on some creative or technical projects together.  I don't really care if they're your projects or mine, or if we come up with something to do for the hell of it.  I have lots of ideas and ambition, but I have a hard time following through without someone else to bounce ideas off of and collaborate with.  
5	Probably
1	Think bigger....
1	Maybe...\nWhat do you have in mind?\n
1	I live in Central Florida and just so happen to be ENTJ.
15	Just a hello :)	I just wanted to say hello to my fellow ENTJ’s! I’m a 28 year old male from the US. I know we make up a tiny cross-section of society so I found comfort in discovering this subreddit. I came across the Myers-Briggs test about a year and a half ago and was amazed at how accurate it was. I’ve always been told that I have a strong personality and the ENTJ personality type has helped me to understand myself greatly.\n\nMy two favorite aspects of my personality are:\n1 - my polarized ability to genuinely inspire or completely demolish another person’s self esteem. (As I’ve gotten older, I’ve strived to use this for good and not evil)\n2 - my ability to problem solve and analyze any situation very quickly and objectively (this is especially useful in the workplace)\n\nMy two biggest areas of opportunity as an ENTJ are:\n1 - my intolerance and condescension towards those that I deem to be beneath me. This usually arises when I sense that someone is incompetent or uneducated. (I very rarely take this stance based on socioeconomic status).\n2 - my struggle to maintain long lasting friendships and relationships. I am able to create them seamlessly but they almost never last. I don’t like that I am able to let go so easily. I feel the emotional tug on my heart but my brain is always able to keep me moving.\n\nTL;DR - Hello from a fellow ENTJ!
4	Hey what's up! I feel you on the things you like about yourself for sure. As far as relationships go, I've had the same friends for years and years, but romantic relationships never last for me. The weird thing about that for me is, I actually hate romantic relationships, so I'm totally cool with that. It's definitely cool to be able to vibe will people on things that I thought I was crazy for. Our minds can definitely be a prison sometimes, so it's nice to have like-minded people to relate to. 
3	Hey there! Fellow ENTJ female from Australia! Right there with you for number one, especially the part about hoping to use for good. I do worry that if something ever sparks an evil inside of me I would crush undeserving souls... Also yes, it's hard to view those who are either seemingly incompetent or inefficient as worthy of time often because I value the two so highly. Do you know your Enneagram type? Just wondering as I have some idle time and I'm always interested in correlations between MBTI and Enneagram, especially when it's of someone who has similar views/values/habits/strengths/etc.
3	Welcome.\n\n> 2 - my struggle to maintain long lasting friendships and relationships. I am able to create them seamlessly but they almost never last. I don’t like that I am able to let go so easily. I feel the emotional tug on my heart but my brain is always able to keep me moving.\n\nCould you elaborate on this a little, perhaps quantify the time lengths? Do you leave the context of the friendship or do your friends?\n\nI also want more long-lasting friendships and relationships, but I view it as a challenge caused primarily by others generally operating on a shorter timescale than I do. I'm wondering if you have a similar dynamic or if something else is going on.
1	Turning to this Community for Typing Help	I'm hoping someone here can help provide some insight so I can move things along. This is the first time I'm reaching out to the community.\n\nHere's the issue:\nI met mbti 13 years ago. I've gone through a number of types, mostly in the NT quadrant. For some reason, I can't bring myself to peace with any one type. I go through cycles of finding what I think is my type > wearing it for a while > recognizing all the ways I'm different from it > questioning MBTI altogether > refusing to give up > repeat. I've taken every test imaginable probably too many times to the point where I'm desensitized to the results. \n\nWhere I stand today:\nENTJ seems the type closest to who I am. Main reasons being I would be miserable with work that is isolated, repetitive, or meaningless. I want to go into a line of work that is competitive, dynamic, and involves working on a team. Although I do dilly-dally, I don't like playing with things just for the sake of it. I prefer for all the things I do to have some kind of purpose behind them building some aspect of myself that matters to me -- even the time-wasters (for example, competitive video games to build strategy/team-building. shows with strong characters to learn how they deal with different situations I can apply to my own life, etc.)\n\nMy qualms with ENTJ for me: \nI've got a million and one doubts for you. \nFor large portions of my life I get lost in cyclical nonconstructive activities. Addiction to video gaming, cyclical personality research, basically computer-based activities. \n\nI have this thing which happens to me: when there's a goal or a big task to do, I might all-in it and give it everything I've got -- rally people behind the goal, make it happen. When it does happen to be a huge success, I over-rest on my laurels. I feel like I've worked hard enough I deserve a break. And then I take that break way over-board. \n\nI set goals and plans, but I flake on them and on people. I have a direction and I am trodding along -- I'm at a top-tier university, I've got an internship as a product manager at a tech company, I've got a second internship helping my friend build a social networking company, I'm part of the entrepreneur club on campus. \n\nBut really, I almost have like existential depressions on the regular and flake on my goals, go into periods where I'm extremely isolated from others. \n\nIt's my own issues, I don't blame it on my circumstances or other people, I want to solve it myself, but I have a hard time imagining an ENTJ going through these types of patterns. \n\nThe time I was happiest and most at-peace in my life was the first semesters at college when I was organized and on-top of my game. I made it a point to prioritize my studies -- scored within the top 3 students of each of my classes (straight A+s). When I came home, it was always first thing studies no matter how long it took -- it felt confining and suffocating to some extent, but on a deeper level I felt happier I was working towards a goal (med school) and was kicking ass. \n\nThe leisure time I spent after work hanging out with friends, playing games, watching shows, or spending time with family felt so well-deserved that I could fully relax and enjoy it to its full potential. \n\nAfter a rift with the family though I've had trouble getting back to that same footing for years. \n\nAnyway -- hope I didn't provide too much info, but any insights would be dope. Open to answering questions.
3	You sound a lot like me, except it is not often I have an existential crisis. Everything I do has to have some kind of meaning or value to it and it has to align with my long-term goals. I tend to give it my all when I am working on a large task or goal and then when I am done, I take a REALLY long break (longer than I should..like right now). I just finished a huge project and am done for the quarter at uni. I have been doing nothing but scrolling through Reddit for the past three days. \n\nI also let my grades/success in school define me more than anything. Nothing makes me happier than getting grades that are above the average and being the top of the class. 
2	For what it's worth, I'm very confident you're INTJ. I get why you would go with ENTJ given everything you said, but Ni-Te seems to suit you a bit better than Te-Ni.\n\nJust because you don't want to be isolated and do repetitive grunt-work doesn't automatically equate to extroversion, or leading with an extroverted function. The biggest distinction between INTJ and ENTJ in the workplace, as I see it, is how the person focuses their time and energy *generally* with all else held equal. INTJs tend to focus on matters that further their "grand vision", so to speak. The emphasis is placed on the value of the goal towards a greater end. How efficiently and expediently the task gets performed, and the notoriety they get as a result, is comparatively of lesser value. Everything you do needs a purpose behind it, even mindless things, and that really suggests a detachment from "Se" or the literal world beyond what you'd see from an ENTJ, who rely on that as a form of relief. Even when you are engaging the Se, you over-indulge. I'm not saying you're unhealthy, but I am saying that it's *far* more probable than not that this is inferior Se, not tertiary. ENTJs use Se to make certain that their goals are stabilized by concrete and observable facts *while they are acting*. INTJs rely on Se more passively, and their conclusions generated by Ni are a compilation of many Se data points meshed into a deeper, extensive conclusion. \n\nThere's a ton of other examples just in the OP to support Ni-Te also. All your accomplishments and indicators of academic & professional success are presented under the guise of "here is who I am and my vision, and here's what I'm doing to further it". The success is a means to an end for you. That is subtly distinct from "I am who I am because I am successful". ENTJs place comparatively more value on success and personal pride as an end itself, subsequently filtering that desire through Ni towards broader aims. The existential depression you feel is your Ni demanding results, and the fact that your personal successes aren't alleviating that suggest Ni-Te over Te-Ni. \n\nI think xNTJs are very difficult to differentiate online because so many of the indicators people think leads to one type could honestly lead to the other. I know very many ENTJs who have isolated themselves socially and over-prioritized work as a result. I know many INTJs who lead clubs and organizations, are the top-tier student such as yourself and have a wider social network than the stereotypical introvert might have. But for you, while it's subtle, you place a lot of emphasis on the end rather than the means. Given the choice, I think you would measure success relative to how much of your own goals you've realized, rather than how objectively successful you may be. \n\n(As a side note, you are either INTJ or ENTJ but there is absolutely no chance you're ENFP, or some of the other types that are being suggested here. I find it hard to understand how people can reach a conclusion like that in good faith.)
2	>I'm hoping someone here can help provide some insight so I can move things along. This is the first time I'm reaching out to the community.\n>\n>Here's the issue:\n>I met mbti 13 years ago. I've gone through a number of types, mostly in the NT quadrant. For some reason, I can't bring myself to peace with any one type. I go through cycles of finding what I think is my type > wearing it for a while > recognizing all the ways I'm different from it > questioning MBTI altogether > refusing to give up > repeat. I've taken every test imaginable probably too many times to the point where I'm desensitized to the results. \n\nSolid points for analysis and self-discovery. I initially thought I was an INFJ. Then an ENFP, then an ENTP, and now pretty stably as ENTJ. Sometimes I wonder if I'm an INTJ or an ENTP, but I figure that I'm definitely not an INTP, so least-squares keeps me here.\n\n>Where I stand today:\n>ENTJ seems the type closest to who I am. Main reasons being I would be miserable with work that is isolated, repetitive, or meaningless. I want to go into a line of work that is competitive, dynamic, and involves working on a team. Although I do dilly-dally, I don't like playing with things just for the sake of it. I prefer for all the things I do to have some kind of purpose behind them building some aspect of myself that matters to me -- even the time-wasters (for example, competitive video games to build strategy/team-building. shows with strong characters to learn how they deal with different situations I can apply to my own life, etc.)\n\nHave you ever played Minecraft and had seemingly endless loads of fun at first until you realized that there were no meaningful objectives after a point and that the game was suddenly almost as meaningless to you as life in general?\n\n>My qualms with ENTJ for me: \n>I've got a million and one doubts for you. \n>For large portions of my life I get lost in cyclical nonconstructive activities. Addiction to video gaming, cyclical personality research, basically computer-based activities. \n\nWelcome to the club. That's not a bug, that's a feature.\n\n>I have this thing which happens to me: when there's a goal or a big task to do, I might all-in it and give it everything I've got -- rally people behind the goal, make it happen. When it does happen to be a huge success, I over-rest on my laurels. I feel like I've worked hard enough I deserve a break. And then I take that break way over-board. \n\nThat's another point in favor. 4/4\n\n>I set goals and plans, but I flake on them and on people. I have a direction and I am trodding along -- I'm at a top-tier university, I've got an internship as a product manager at a tech company, I've got a second internship helping my friend build a social networking company, I'm part of the entrepreneur club on campus. \n\nOverextended? 5/5.\n\nYou should work on that though. That's not really an ENTJ trait as much as it is a treatable potential side effect.\n\n>But really, I almost have like existential depressions on the regular and flake on my goals, go into periods where I'm extremely isolated from others. \n\nMe too thanks 6/6\n\n>It's my own issues, I don't blame it on my circumstances or other people, I want to solve it myself, but I have a hard time imagining an ENTJ going through these types of patterns. \n\n7/7\n\n>The time I was happiest and most at-peace in my life was the first semesters at college when I was organized and on-top of my game. I made it a point to prioritize my studies -- scored within the top 3 students of each of my classes (straight A+s). When I came home, it was always first thing studies no matter how long it took -- it felt confining and suffocating to some extent, but on a deeper level I felt happier I was working towards a goal (med school) and was kicking ass. \n\n8/8\n\n>The leisure time I spent after work hanging out with friends, playing games, watching shows, or spending time with family felt so well-deserved that I could fully relax and enjoy it to its full potential. \n\nEnjoys relaxing 8/9\n\n>After a rift with the family though I've had trouble getting back to that same footing for years. \n\nCares about interpersonal relationships 8/10\n\nCongrats kid, you passed.

1	Man, this rings so many bells for me that I am starting to question my own type. This may not be a very useful reply (especially regarding MBTI) except for a look into my experience and another hello from someone with a similar story. Seems like we are not that rare after all.\n\nI am an INTP. For us this oscillation between high motivation for things we find meaningful then very low motivation when we don't is typical and well explained by our traits. So is evading responsibilities by delving into captivating side-projects. I now realize on the other hand that the drive for achievement does not fit that well with INTP.\n\nEven the internship story is almost exactly mine. I worked really hard to get an internship at the largest tech company, which I thought was crucial to my future, I got it, and now I am a bit de-motivated to try anything further, especially anything that would not be as high an achievement... I work hard to get IN, to set myself on the right track, then when I'm there I don't take enough advantage of it and am not sufficiently into it, I feel I've done my part.\n\nThe way I see the problem/solution right now is this:\n\n- instrinsic motivation is crucial. If I am unsure of the goal, or don't care enough about it, it will be painful to get things done, and also not the best way to exploit my resources and qualities. So believing in the goal, as little confusion and hesitation as possible, is crucial. Do anything you need to get there, question your goals until you find a conclusion you are happy with and a direction you really believe in.\n- prioritizing success as measured by society, and competitiveness, are also signs of a faulty internal compass. The thirst to achieve sounds like a potential self-esteem problem.\n- also getting exhausted after an accomplishment and resting on laurels sounds like a problem with internal motivation. If you work towards something you enjoy (edit: value) and have objective proof of your growth you should be elated instead of fed up? It should fuel your resources instead of exhausting them.\n- feeling the need to "deserve" relaxation time, retreating into safe activities in the face of external pressures (playing video games or finding interesting side-projects instead of doing what you "should") sound like an internal conflict. A conflict between what you would really want to do and what you think you should.\n\nAand btw, I study/work with artificial intelligence and am fascinated with cognitive science.

1	i think you are ENTP ENFP. male ENFPs are not that feeling nowadays )  \nbottom line, TJs prioritize their philosophy, building it and reaching a system 1 high quality  \nsystem 1 = intuition.  - neuroscience  \nso , start working on your philosophy. ur not taking seriously your own life , you gotta make a project of each thing you do if you want to imrpove it    \nlack of tldr is a minus  
13	Anyone else seem to do better when you're tired?	It seems like when I'm tired I can communicate better, and do more. I dunno I guess I'm just better able to cut out the bullshit and get more stuff done
9	Nah I'm pretty useless when I'm tired haha. I see what you're saying though.
9	I am more productive at night when everyone else is asleep and everything is “still” but it doesn’t seem to have to do with me being tired. 
7	I get angry and irate when tired, I try let that not happen by taking breaks.
6	HolysHit yes, but it's because for like 90% of my teen life I did everything on 1/3rd of the necessary actual sleep a person needs and (to me) that's the real me. I don't know who that 8-hour sleep cycle person is.
4	God no I drink so much coffee and energy drinks when I work I need to be fully awake to be my best. 
2	i’ve done really good on essays and exams when i’ve been sleep deprived 
2	Sometimes for me being tired helps me focus. I don't have enough processing power to deal with too many things. 
2	Damn, I'm so tired right now. Between Xmas & business, I'm walking dead. I'm really just going through the motions right now, on auto pilot. Not snappy, in a bit of a haze. This is one of my few breaks of the day, still shopping then big party tonight. I'm hurt and hungover from last night.\n\nSo, not better than my usual, but still functioning when I should be DOA.
2	When you're tired, your body secretes dopamine due to your tired state. So your attitude and emotions are generally positive.
1	no
1	Nope, not at all. I'm utterly useless when I'm tired.
1	No. I can function fine on 4 hours of sleep, but any less than that and I’m a mess.
1	I've noticed that when I pull all nighters, there's a split second in which I have an epiphany that will solve the reason I stayed up all night. It's really weird. I don't even try to think about it and then BOOM.\nBut this is only when I literally don't sleep at all. When I sleep less than I should I just feel, well, tired and don't function at my 100%.
5	What are the best podcasts for growth and insight, particularly suited to ENTJs?	
6	The Tim Ferriss Show

2	I am a big fan of hidden brain. Partly, because it gives me insights into how other people think you’re not. I’m not always adapt understanding the motives of other people and this I have some perspective and fluency is my everything. 
1	Invisibilia
1	My favorite podcasts currently are [Bad With Money](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/panoply/bad-with-money) (but that might be changing because some of the later podcasts have nothing to do with money) and [99% Invisible](https://99percentinvisible.org/).
1	Already been said, but Jocko Willink's podcasts have been a huge help in my development as a person over thr past year. The guy totally speaks my ENTJ language.
